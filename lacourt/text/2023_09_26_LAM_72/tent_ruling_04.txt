[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:  
MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION AND MOTION FOR STAY OF
  PROCEEDINGS 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 26, 2023
 Calendar
  Number:  6



 
 
 
Defendants Weiss
Accountancy Corporation, Weiss Accountancy LLP, and Scott Weiss have moved to
compel arbitration and stay proceedings.
 
Defendants’ Motion to Compel Arbitration and
Stay the Action is taken off calendar since Defendants do not have standing. Defendants
have defaulted in this matter and have not sought relief from their default.
 
 
Background
 
On January 25,
2023, Plaintiff Kay Adams (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Weiss Accountancy Corporation and Weiss
Accountancy LLP and Scott Weiss (“Defendants”) alleging causes of action for
disability, sex and national origin discrimination, sexual harassment and
failure to prevent under FEHA, violation of CFRA, wrongful termination in
violation of public policy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and
numerous violations of the Labor Code wage and hour provisions as well as
statutory unfair competition.
 
On March 13,
2023, default was entered against each of the Defendants. 
 
On March 22,
2023, Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint.
 
On August 23,
2023, Defendants filed the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration (the “Motion”). Plaintiff filed
an opposition to the Motion on September 12, 2023. Defendants
filed a late reply on September 19, 2023. 

 
Legal Standard
 
“On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the
existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party
thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the
petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines
that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines that:
(a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b)
Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
1281.2(a)-(b).) “Because the existence of the agreement is a statutory
prerequisite to granting the petition, the petitioner bears the burden of
proving its existence by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Rosenthal v.
Great Western Fin. Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413.) 
 
“California law, ‘like [federal law], reflects a strong policy
favoring arbitration agreements and requires close judicial scrutiny of waiver
claims.’”  (Wagner Const. Co. v. Pacific Mechanical Corp. (2007) 41
Cal.4th 19, 31.) If the court orders arbitration, then the court shall stay the
action until arbitration is completed.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.) 
 
Discussion
 
The Court concludes that Defendants
do not have standing to bring the instant Motion.
 
“The entry of a default
terminates a defendant’s rights to take any further affirmative steps in the
litigation until either its default is set aside or a default judgment is
entered.”  (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa
AMC/Jeep/Renaltu, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385; see also Harbour
Vista, LLC v. HSBC Mortgage Services Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1496, 1513
(quoting Devlin, supra, 155 Cal.App.3d at 385).)  “‘A defendant against whom a default has been
entered is out of court and is not entitled to take any further steps in the
cause affecting plaintiff’s right of action; he cannot thereafter, until such
default is set aside in a proper proceeding, file pleadings or move for a new
trial or demand notice of subsequent proceedings.’”  (Devlin, supra 155 Cal.App.3d
at 385-86 (quoting Brooks v. Nelson (1928) 95 Cal.App. 144, 147-48); see
also Harbour Vista, LLC, supra, 201 Cal.App.4th at 1513 (quoting
Devlin, supra, 155 Cal.App.3d at 385-86).)  The entry of default deprives the court of
jurisdiction to consider any motion other than a motion for relief from
default.  (W.A. Rose Co. v. Mun. Ct.
(FitzSimmons) (1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 67, 72.)
 
Since default was entered against
Defendants on March 13, 2023, Defendants have lost their right to bring this
motion until and unless the default has been set aside. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Compel Arbitration and
Stay the Action is taken off calendar.
