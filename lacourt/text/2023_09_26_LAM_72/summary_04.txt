## English Summary

The judge issued a tentative ruling denying Defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The judge found that Defendants lacked standing to bring the motion because they had defaulted on the case. Defaulting in a lawsuit means that the Defendant failed to respond to the Plaintiff's complaint within the required time, resulting in an automatic judgment against them. 

The judge stated that once a default is entered, the Defendant loses their right to make any further moves in the lawsuit, including filing motions, until the default is set aside.

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Kay Adams as the plaintiff and Weiss Accountancy Corporation, Weiss Accountancy LLP, Scott Weiss, and Does 1-50 as defendants. The defendants have moved to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings, but the Judge has concluded that they do not have standing to bring this motion. This is because default was entered against each defendant on March 13, 2023, and the defendants have not sought relief from this default. As a result, the Judge has taken the motion off calendar. The Judge notes that the defendants have waived their right to bring this motion by failing to seek relief from default. The Judge also cites various California court cases and statutes in support of this ruling.

### English Text Summary
The Judge's tentative ruling in the case of Kay Adams vs. Weiss Accountancy Corporation, et al., concludes that the Defendants do not have standing to bring a motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The Defendants had previously defaulted in the case, and according to California law, a defendant who has defaulted is not entitled to take any further steps in the litigation until the default is set aside or a default judgment is entered. The Judge cites several cases, including Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renaltu, Inc., to support this conclusion. As a result, the Defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action is taken off calendar. The Plaintiff had filed a complaint against the Defendants alleging various causes of action, including disability, sex, and national origin discrimination, and the Defendants had filed an answer to the complaint after default was entered. However, the Defendants' failure to set aside the default before filing the motion to compel arbitration is fatal to their motion.

**Case Number:** 23STCV01601

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Parties:**

- Plaintiff: Kay Adams
- Defendants: Weiss Accountancy Corporation, Weiss Accountancy LLP, Scott Weiss

**Key Figures:**

- Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renaltu, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381

- W.A. Rose Co. v. Mun. Ct. (FitzSimmons) (1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 67

**Background:**

- Kay Adams filed a complaint against the defendants on January 25, 2023, alleging disability, sex and national origin discrimination, sexual harassment, wrongful termination, and Labor Code violations.
- Default was entered against the defendants on March 13, 2023.

**Laws and Regulations:**

- Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1281.2(a)-(b)

**Discussion:**

- After default is entered, a defendant loses the right to bring any further motions until the default is set aside.
- The court lacks jurisdiction to consider any motion other than a motion for relief from default.
- Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay the Action is taken off calendar since Defendants do not have standing.

**Significant Statements:**

- "The entry of default terminates a defendant’s rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation until either its default is set aside or a default judgment is entered." (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renaltu, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385.)
- "A defendant against whom a default has been entered is out of court and is not entitled to take any further steps in the cause affecting plaintiff’s right of action." (Brooks v. Nelson (1928) 95 Cal.App. 144, 147-48.)
- "The entry of default deprives the court of jurisdiction to consider any motion other than a motion for relief from default." (W.A. Rose Co. v. Mun. Ct. (FitzSimmons) (1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 67, 72.)
