```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action is taken off calendar because they do not have standing to bring the motion. The defendants have defaulted in the matter and have not sought relief from their default. The court finds that the entry of default terminates the defendants' rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation, and they cannot bring a motion to compel arbitration until the default is set aside. The court will not consider the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action.
