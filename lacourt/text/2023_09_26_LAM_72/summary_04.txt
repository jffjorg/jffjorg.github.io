## English Summary

The judge issued a tentative ruling denying Defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The judge found that Defendants lacked standing to bring the motion because they had defaulted on the case. Defaulting in a lawsuit means that the Defendant failed to respond to the Plaintiff's complaint within the required time, resulting in an automatic judgment against them. 

The judge stated that once a default is entered, the Defendant loses their right to make any further moves in the lawsuit, including filing motions, until the default is set aside.

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Kay Adams as the plaintiff and Weiss Accountancy Corporation, Weiss Accountancy LLP, Scott Weiss, and Does 1-50 as defendants. The defendants have moved to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings, but the Judge has concluded that they do not have standing to bring this motion. This is because default was entered against each defendant on March 13, 2023, and the defendants have not sought relief from this default. As a result, the Judge has taken the motion off calendar. The Judge notes that the defendants have waived their right to bring this motion by failing to seek relief from default. The Judge also cites various California court cases and statutes in support of this ruling.
