And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the Plaintiffs' motion for an order to show cause why Defendant Peak Foreclosure Services, Inc. should not be found in contempt of court. The Plaintiffs contend that Peak violated the preliminary injunction by sending notices of postponement of the Trustee's sale of the Properties. The Court finds that Peak did indeed violate the injunction and orders Peak to pay $5,970.00 in monetary sanctions to the Plaintiffs. The Court also finds that the notices of postponement caused unsolicited trespassers to inspect and photograph the Properties, disturbing the tenants who reside there.
