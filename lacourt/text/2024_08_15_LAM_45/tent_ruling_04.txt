Motion for Attorneys’ Fees
The court has
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers.
The court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney’s fees in the reduced amount.
Background
On July 26, 2018, Plaintiff Louis
J. Palos (“Palos” or “Plaintiff”) filed the underlying lemon law action against
Defendant Kia Motors (“Kia” or “Defendant”) asserting six causes of action for
(1) violation of subdivision(d) of the Civil Code Section 1793.2; (2) violation
of subdivision(b) of Civil Code section 1793.2; (3) violation of
subdivision(a)(3) of civil code section 1793.2; (4) breach of express warranty;
(5) breach of implied warranty of merchantability; and (6) fraud by omission. 
On November 9, 2018, the Court
sustained Defendant Kia’s demurrer as to the causes of action regarding (1)
civil code section 1793.2(a)(3); (2) breach of implied warranty of
merchantability; and (3) fraud by omission with twenty days for leave to amend.
(Bokmuller Decl., ¶ 10.) Plaintiff alleges that on February 26, 2012, he
purchased a 2012 Kia Optima (“Subject Vehicle”) for a total purchase price of
approximately $35,655.12 which was manufactured and or distributed by
Defendant. (See Carvalho Decl., ¶3, Ex. 1.) As a result of the various defects,
Plaintiff claims he was forced to take the Vehicle to the dealership at least
eight times for repairs, but Kia was unable to conform the Vehicle to warranty
or provide Plaintiff with restitution in compliance with its affirmative
obligation under the Song-Beverly Act. (Id. at ¶¶6-13.) Thus, Plaintiff
initiated the underlying action.
On November 29, 2018, Plaintiff
filed his First Amended Complaint (“FAC) which is now the operative complaint. Defendant
then filed another demurrer, as to Plaintiff’s third, fifth, and sixth causes
of action. (Bokmuller Decl., ¶ 11.) The Court then sustained Defendant’s
demurrer as to the fraud by omission claim, without leave to amend.[1]
(Id.)
After five years of litigation,
Defendant and Plaintiff reached a settlement agreement pursuant to CCP 998 and
Defendant Kia agreed to buy back the Vehicle for $99,000.00, plus attorneys’
fees, costs, and expenses by a single motion to the Court. (Carvalho Decl., ¶
123, Ex. 8.)
Thus, on April 3, 2024, Plaintiff,
represented by Successor-In-Interest, Giselle Palos, brought the instant
motion. (Plaintiff himself has passed away since commencing the underlying
action.) Plaintiff filed the instant motion concurrently with a Request for
Judicial Notice, a Proposed Order, an Exhibit List, the Declaration of
Plaintiff’s attorney, Tiona Carvalho, (“Carvalho Decl.”), and the Declaration
of Plaintiff’s attorney Payam Shahian (“Shahian Decl.”).
On June 18, 2024, Defendant Kia
filed an Opposition, Defendant’s Objections, and the Declaration of Tammara N.
Bokmuller (“Bokmuller Decl.”).
On June 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the Amended Motion for Attorneys’ Fees which the Court is treating as the
operative motion. 
On August 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the Reply, Evidentiary Objections to Defendant, Plaintiff’s Response to
Defendant’s Objections, and the Declaration of one of Plaintiff’s attorneys,
Angel M. Baker (“Baker Decl.”). 
 
Plaintiff’s Request
Plaintiff
requests the Court award $155,102.89 in attorneys’ fees. This amount consists
of (1) $100,386.00 in attorneys’ fees for Strategic Legal Practices, APC
(“SLP”); (2) a 1.35 multiplier enhancement on the attorneys’ fees (or
$35,135.10); (3) $16,081.79 in costs and expenses for SLP; and (4) an
additional $3,500 for Plaintiff’s counsel to review Defendant’s Opposition,
draft the Reply, and attend the hearing on the instant motion.  
Plaintiff argues that Counsels’
hourly rates ranging from $385 per hour to $620 per hour is consistent with
hourly rates for attorneys in Los Angeles with similar skill and background. In
light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the skill demonstrated
by Plaintiff’s Counsel, the results obtained, the risk of the contingency fee
and non-payment, and the serious 5-year delay in payment, Plaintiff argues the 1.35
multiplier is appropriate.

of N. Am., LLC,
Case No. 18CV475JM(BGS) 2020 WL 759285 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 14, 2020).  
The Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to judicially notice Exhibits 1-17.
Defendant makes
Objections 1-37 with respect to the Shahian Declaration and attached
exhibits which the Court rules on as follows:
Overruled: 1-37. 
Plaintiff argues in response to Defendant’s
objections that in the Song-Beverly context, the California Court of Appeal has
found that counsel may present evidence/declarations regarding hourly rates
that other courts have previously awarded them for comparable cases to
demonstrate the prevailing rate in the community for comparable legal services.
Goglin v. BMW of N.
Am., LLC, 4 Cal.
App. 5th 462, 473 (2016) (in Song-Beverly case, court accepted declarations
demonstrating hourly rates that “various state and federal courts had
previously awarded [plaintiff’s attorney] attorney fees for comparable work at
comparable hourly rates” as evidence of reasonableness of rates); See also Heritage Pacific
Financial, LLC v. Monroy,
215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009 (2013) (“Affidavits of the plaintiffs’ attorney and
other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community, and rate determinations in other cases, particularly those setting a
rate for the plaintiffs’ attorney, are satisfactory evidence of the prevailing
market rate.”) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs are offering these rulings as
evidence of Plaintiffs’ counsels’ reasonable hourly rates in the community, not
as binding authority that the Court must follow; these rulings simply shed
light on what courts have recognized as the prevailing market rate. 
Plaintiff’s
Objections
The Court overrules
objections 1-10.
 
Legal Standard
 
General
Attorneys’ Fees
“As a general
rule, the prevailing party may recover certain statutory costs incurred in the
litigation up to and including entry of judgment. [Citations.] These costs may
include attorney fees, if authorized by contract, statute . . . or law.
[Citation.] . . . attorney fees require a separate noticed motion.
[Citations.]” (Lucky United Props. Inv., Inc. v. Lee (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 125, 137.) This motion may be brought: (1) after judgment or
dismissal, for fees incurred “up to and including the rendition of judgment in
the trial court--including attorney’s fees on an appeal before the rendition of
judgment…”; and (2) on an interim basis, upon remittitur of appeal, of only
fees incurred on appeal. (CRC, Rule 3.1702(b)-(c).)
In determining
what fees are reasonable, California courts apply the “lodestar” approach. (See,
e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.)
This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (See PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there, the “[t]he lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.” (Id.) Relevant factors include: “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”
(Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)
 
 
 
CCP Section 1794(d)
Discussion
If the
buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by
the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action. 
Plaintiff argues that as the prevailing party under the
SBA, Plaintiff is entitled to recover all fees, costs, and expenses reasonably
incurred in the “commencement and prosecution” of this action. (See Carvalho Decl. ¶¶ 123, Ex. 8.) See Cal. Civ. Code § 1794(d). See Reck v. FCA US LLC, 64 Cal. App. 5th 682, 698
(2022) (Plaintiff is entitled to recovery of all reasonably incurred attorney
fees when the ultimate settlement amount exceeded manufacturer’s prior
settlement offers).
 Here, on July
1, 2019, Defendant offered to buy back the Vehicle for $10,000.00 plus
attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code § 1794(d). (See Carvalho Decl. ¶¶ 48, Ex. 3.) On
December 15, 2022, three
and half years after the
first 998 offer, Defendant served their second 998 Offer, offering to buy back
the Vehicle for $34,000.00 plus attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses pursuant to
Cal. Civ. Code § 1794(d). (Id.
at ¶¶ 95, Ex. 5)
On September 14, 2023, Defendant served their third 998 Offer, offering to buy
back the Vehicle for $50,000.00 plus attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses
pursuant to Cal Civ. Code § 1794(d) by single motion to the Court. (Id. at ¶¶ 116, Ex. 7). On October 3,
2023, Defendant served the fourth 998 Offer, offering to buy back the vehicle
for $99,000.00 plus attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses pursuant Cal. Civ. Code
§ 1794(d). Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s fourth offer. (Id. at ¶¶ 123, Ex. 8.) Thus, under Reck, Plaintiff argues he is entitled
to attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses through the settlement of the case
because the fourth 998 Offer of $99,000.00 was for a far greater amount than
Defendant’s initial 998 Offer to Compromise. 
With respect to the multiplier, Plaintiff argues
that an enhancement of 1.35 is reasonable given (1) Plaintiff’s Counsel
obtained an excellent outcome in securing a $99,000 settlement; (2) the risks
of taking Plaintiff’s case on contingency were high considering Plaintiff’s
Counsel went five years without pay and could have never received payment; and
(3) there has been a significant five-year delay in payment. The Court notes
that Plaintiff does not address the factor regarding novelty and difficulty
presented by the case. However, given the five-year delay in payment, the four
998 offers, and the difference between the first 998 offer ($10,000) and the
fourth and final 998 offer ($99,000), the Court finds the 1.35 multiplier
reasonable and warranted. 
Plaintiff argues Counsels’ rate and hours billed are
reasonable because the California Appellate Courts have found similar rates
reasonable in Song-Beverly cases. Although the Court has judicially noticed
Plaintiff’s Exhibits, the Court agrees with Defendant on Opposition that such
orders (of other trial courts) are not binding on thus trial court. However, the
matters were judicially noticed as to their existence and to provide context.
They orders and decisions therein do not govern in this matter. Defendant
argues on Opposition that Counsels’ rate ranging from $496 per hour to
$620 is unreasonable, given the simplicity of the case. Defendant contends that
reducing the rate to $350 would be a more appropriate and reasonable. The Court
disagrees and finds Plaintiff’s range of hourly rates reasonable considering
the attorneys’ range of experience and qualifications. 
Defendant further
argues that Plaintiff’s billed hours are unreasonable because Plaintiff’s fee
recovery is based on 227.60 hours billed. Plaintiff argues such hours were
necessary considering Plaintiff had to litigate the instant matter for
five-years because Defendant did not offer a reasonable settlement sooner.
Moreover, Plaintiff provides the following work, including but not limited to,
warrants the total hours billed: the complaint; Plaintiff’s FAC; defending the
deposition of Plaintiff’s Successor-In-Interest, Giselle Palos; attending and
conducting the deposition of Defendant’s PMQ, Sandra Beshai; opposing
Defendant’s demurrer on both the Complaint and FAC; opposing Defendant’s
petition for coordination and motion to stay; numerous discovery motions and
responses; opposing and defeating Defendant’s MSJ; and a protective order. On
Opposition, Defendant argues that hours billed for Plaintiff’s fraud claim
should be deducted considering Plaintiff’s fraud claim was dismissed on
demurrer. (Opp., pg. 9.) Specifically, Defendant argues that hours billed for
Plaintiff trying to seek leave to amend to bring a second amended complaint primarily
to revive the fraud claim should be deducted from the fee award. (Bokmuller
Decl., Ex. A.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff incurred $14,137.00 in trying to
seek leave to amend. Defendant also argues that by overstaffing the case with
seventeen (17) attorneys, Plaintiff’s case was litigated with significant
inefficiencies which has resulted in duplicative billing entries. ((Opp., pg.
9-10.) 
The Court does not find
it problematic that seventeen attorneys were staffed on the case, as it does
not change the number of hours billed if the total number of hours expended is
reasonable. Except as to the hours spent in reviving the fraud claim, the Court
finds it reasonable to bill over 200 hours given the five-year timeframe and
number of motions filed, including an MSJ. It is reasonable to deduct the hours
spent in an attempt to move the Court for leave to amend a second time when the
motion brief evidences the primary purpose of that effort was to revive the
fraud claim which Defendant had demurred to. Moreover, the Court sustained that
demurrer, with respect to the fraud claim, without leave to amend. Thus, the
Court deducts the $14,137.00 incurred. 
As such, the reduced
amount of attorneys’ fees is for $140,965.89. Additionally, the Court will
subtract the enhanced multiplier amount of $5,230.69 for that portion of fees,
resulting in the total reduced amount of $135,735.20. Although Defendant
requested a significantly greater deduction, the Court finds the public policy
related to encouraging settlement in such matters governs: Defendant’s failure
to make an acceptable offer earlier in the litigation came at its own risk. 
For the foregoing reasons,
the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees in the reduced amount
of $135,735.20. 
The moving party is to
give notice.
 
It is so ordered.
