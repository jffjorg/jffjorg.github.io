And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings in this case. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff, Jane Doe, had agreed to arbitration in her employment contract with PicsArt, Inc. and that she had refused to arbitrate the dispute. However, the court found that the plaintiff's claim of hostile work environment sexual harassment and discrimination was sufficient to bring her entire complaint under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA), which bars arbitration of such claims. The court also found that the plaintiff had pled sufficient facts to establish a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). As a result, the court denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.
