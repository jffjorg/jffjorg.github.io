And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Myranda Isabelle de la Cruz's motion to stay the entire case. The motion was filed in response to the Court's summary judgment ruling in favor of Defendant Mission Hills Shopping Center, LLC, which was granted on September 12, 2023. The Plaintiff argues that the purpose of the appeal is to avoid the litigation with the new Doe defendants and that the stay is necessary to preserve the status quo until the appeal is decided. The Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the issue of the tenants' liability is not embraced by the summary judgment motion and that only two defendants filed an opposition to this motion. The Court finds that there is no basis to stay the proceedings as to the remaining defendants. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff must pursue conflicting legal theories in the trial and appellate courts.
