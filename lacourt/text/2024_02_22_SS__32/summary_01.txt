Here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to quash subpoenas filed by Plaintiff Matthew Morgan and the opposition filed by Defendant Adan Villareal. The Court finds that the motion is procedurally defective because notice of the motion was not provided within the minimum timeline required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. The Court also notes that the subpoenas were issued after discovery was closed, and that the subpoenas seek information that is irrelevant and protected by a privacy right.

The Court grants Plaintiff's motion to quash subpoenas and denies the request for sanctions. The Court orders Plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of the quashed subpoenas.
