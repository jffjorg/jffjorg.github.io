The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maria De La Cruz, Luis Enrique Hernandez Correa, and Ramiro Hernandez v. Salomon Melchor and Does 1 through 50. The case involves a personal injury lawsuit arising from an automotive collision on August 22, 2021. Defendant Salomon Melchor has filed a motion to compel Plaintiff Luis Enrique Hernandez Correa to respond to Special Interrogatories, Set One, which were served on February 7, 2024. The judge has granted the motion, ordering Plaintiff Correa to serve verified responses to the Special Interrogatories, Set One, without objection, within 20 days.

The judge has also granted the request for monetary sanctions in part. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), the judge has imposed a monetary sanction of $510.00 on Plaintiff Correa and his attorney of record, to be paid within 20 days. The judge has determined that this sanction is mandatory, as the plaintiff failed to serve a timely response to the Special Interrogatories and did not file an opposition to the motion.
