  Case Number:  23AHCV01874    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  X DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGSDefendants move for judgment on the pleadings regarding the complaint.  No opposition is filed.BackgroundDefendants serve as co-executors of the estate of the deceased, John Ernster.  On March 10, 2023, the plaintiff filed a creditor’s claim for $380,340.33, alleging that she loaned funds to Decedent from July 31, 2009, to April 7, 2020, for various expenses, with the expectation of reimbursement.  Defendants rejected this claim on May 24, 2023.  Subsequently, Plaintiff initiated this action on August 17, 2023, for money lent within the last four years.  On September 18, 2023, Defendants issued a Demand for Bill of Particulars, to which Plaintiff responded on October 5, 2023.Tentative RulingDefendants Shannon Ernster and Elizabeth Ernster’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is granted, though Plaintiff shall be permitted 20 days leave to file a First Amended Complaint.Request for Judicial NoticeDefendants request judicial notice for Exhs. A-C, which are documents filed in a different case in the LA Superior Court, Case No. 22STPB02506, for the Estate of John H. Ernster, Jr.  This court may take judicial notice of records of any court of this state.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).)  The requests for Exhs. A-C are GRANTED.Defendants’ request for judicial notice of John H. Ernster, Jr.’s death certificate, Exh. D, is GRANTED.  The court may take judicial notice of official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of a state and of facts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (c), (h).)Legal Authority“A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.”  (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064.)  “In deciding or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all properly pleaded material facts are deemed to be true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.”  (Fire Ins. Exch. v. Super. Ct. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.)  A motion for judgment on the pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause of action.  (Id.)  “In the case of either a demurrer or a motion for judgment on the pleadings, leave to amend should be granted if there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.”  (Gami v. Mullikin Med. Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.)  A non-statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made any time before or during trial.  (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)¿Because a motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, the procedures in responding to demurrers similarly apply to motions for judgment on the pleadings.  (See e.g., Evinger v. Moran (1910) 14 Cal.App. 328, 329.)“Whether a motion for judgment on the pleadings should be granted with or without leave to amend depends on “whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment....’  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [stating rule applied to a general demurrer].)  When a cure is a reasonable possibility, the trial court abuses its discretion by not granting leave to amend and a reviewing court must reverse.  (Ibid.)AnalysisCommon counts are based on express or implied promises to pay money.  (Moya v. Northrup (1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 276, 281.)  “The only essential allegations of a common count are ‘(1) the statement of indebtedness in a certain sum, (2) the consideration, i.e., goods sold, work done, etc., and (3) nonpayment.’”  (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460.)  Plaintiff is required to show that the amounts it seeks relate to services, goods, etc. actually furnished, or a sum certain that is actually due based on past actions – e.g. a loan of a particular amount.  (Ibid.)“Where one person lends money to another, the law implies an obligation to repay it.  An action in the form of a common count for money lent is recognized as an appropriate pleading to recover money so advanced.”  (55 Cal. Jur. 3d Restitution § 25.)  That is, the “common law . . . knew a [common] count for “money lent” which was the appropriate form in which to state a cause of action for money loaned.”  (Jones v. Re-Mine Oil Co. (1941) 47 Cal. App. 2d 832, 843.)  “To state a common count for money lent, the plaintiff need only allege that the defendant is indebted in a certain sum for money loaned by the plaintiff and that the defendant has not repaid the money.”  (Lintz v. Blue Goose Dev., LLC (Cal. Ct. App., Apr. 24, 2015) 2015 WL 1884276, *35, citing Pleasant v. Samuels, 114 Cal. 34, 36-38 (1896).)Plaintiff’s form complaint indicates a Common Count cause of action is being alleged.  The Complaint alleges a statement of indebtedness for a sum certain.  That is, Defendants Shannon Ernster and Elizabeth Ernster, as Co-Administrators of the Estate of John H. Ernster, Jr., became indebted to Plaintiff within the last four years, for money lent by Plaintiff to Defendant.  The reasonable value alleged is $380,340.33 due and unpaid despite Plaintiff’s demand, plus prejudgment interest according to proof.  This is sufficient to state a plausible common count for money lent.  (See Lintz, supra, 2015 WL 1884276 at *35.)Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings argues the claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.  Defendants submit evidence in their requests for judicial notice.  Defendants are co-executors of Decedent John Ernster’s estate.  (RJN, Exhs. A, D.)  On March 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a creditor claim against Decedent for $380,340.33 (RJN, Exh. B.)  Defendants assert the original creditor’s claim did not attach a written instrument evidencing the loan, but rather included copies or checks and statements.  (Motion, p. 3; RJN, Exh. C.)  On September 18, 2023, Defendants propounded a Demand for Bill of Particulars on Plaintiff.  (Glaspy Decl., ¶, Exh. C.)  On October 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a response to the demand, stating the total owed is $380,340.33, and identified eleven loans from July 31, 2009, through April 7, 2020.  (Glaspy Decl., ¶ 3 Exh. D; RJN, Exh. B.)A bill of particulars is both a pleading amendment for certain common counts (open account or money had/received, but not account stated), as well as a very simple discovery tool.  The Demand for a Bill of Particulars presumes that the plaintiff suing has a “book” or “contemporaneous ledger” or an “account” to support any charges when the complaint was filed and provides a court process to require that it be presented upon demand.  The account, unlike the pleading in a complaint, is supposed to “furnish a defendant with the details of the items charged against him…”  Meredith v. Marks (1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 265, 269.  This procedure dates back to early common law when plaintiff sued on an alleged account, and the pleadings gave no specifics as to the nature of the claim –i.e., whether contract, quasi-contract etc. The courts allowed a “Demand for Bill of Particulars” to enable the defendant to discover what is being claimed and to prepare for trial.  (Weil and Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (TRG 2019) ¶8:1765.)California has codified the procedure in Code of Civil Procedure section 454 titled Pleading of Accounts that reads as follows: It is not necessary for a party to set forth in a pleading the items of an account therein alleged, but he must deliver to the adverse party, within ten days after a demand thereof in writing, a copy of the account, or be precluded from giving evidence thereof.  The court or judge thereof may order a further account when the one delivered is too general, or is defective in any particular.  If the pleading is verified the account must be verified by the affidavit of the party to the effect that he believes it to be true; or if the facts are within the personal knowledge of the agent or attorney for the party, or the party is not within the county where the attorney has his office or from some cause unable to make the affidavit, by the affidavit of the agent or attorney.(Code Civ. Proc., § 454.)The Code of Civil Procedure also makes it clear that a Bill of Particulars is not a discovery device and is outside the Discovery Act.  It is considered as an amplification of the complaint.  (Kurokawa v. Saroyan, 95 Cal. App. 772, 775.)  It has the effect of a pleading—it gives the defendants reasonable notice of the items constituting the plaintiff’s claim, to the end that they could be prepared for trial.  (McCarthy v. Mt. Tecarte L. & W. Co., 110 Cal. 687, 692.)  It also limits plaintiff to the items and amounts specified in the Bill of Particulars.  (See Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (TRG 2019) ¶8:1778 citing Baroni v. Musick (1934) 3 Cal. App. 2d. 419, 421.)There is some overlap in the information actually obtained from a Bill of Particulars as would be provided in discovery.  Its use enables defendants who have been sued generally on a contract claim or on an account to force plaintiff to itemize the basis of the account upon which the complaint is based.  (See Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (TRG 2019) ¶8:1765.)  As the First District Court of Appeals stated in Dobbins v. Hardister (1966) 242 Cal. 2d 787, 795: “While modern discovery devices may serve the same purpose as a bill of particular, it should be noted the primary purpose of discovery is the production of evidence for use at trial while that of a bill of particulars is to amplify the complaint ‘in order to make it easier for the defendant to prepare his pleading.”  Furthermore, answers to interrogatories or deposition questions can be used as evidence against the plaintiff at trial; but they are not preclusive (contradictory evidence is admissible).  However, a Bill of Particulars is conclusive as to the items and amounts claimed; i.e., no other evidence is admissible at trial.  (See Weil and Brown Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (TRG 2019) ¶8:1766.)Defendants identify Plaintiff’s underlying cause of action as a breach of oral contract, noting that the nature of the right sued upon is crucial in determining the applicable statute of limitations.  There is a four-year statute of limitations on “[a]n action upon any contract, obligation or liability founded upon an instrument in writing” and a two-year statute of limitations on “[a]n action upon a contract, obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument of writing”.  (Code of Civil Procedure §337(a) and 339.)  In other words, a breach of written contract must be brought in four years, and a contract that is not found in writing must be brought within two years.Defendants argue that there are no written agreements attached or referenced in Plaintiff’s response to Defendants’ demand for a Bill of Particulars.For every claim in her response, Plaintiff stated Decedent “promised to reimburse[]” her.  (See Glaspy Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. D)  Therefore, oral agreements governed all the claims.  Under Code of Civil Procedure section 339(1), the eleven claims for money lent, beginning in 2009 and ending in 2020, are time-barred.  Without an opposition from Plaintiff, the Court is unable to consider defenses or arguments as to how the complaint is actually timely.  Plaintiff has not submitted any evidence that indicates a written agreement exists and thus a four-year period applies instead.  Consequently, the moving parties have sufficiently shown that even Plaintiff’s most recent money lent claim against Decedent with an alleged end date of April 7, 2020 has been time-barred as of April 7, 2022.Based on the face of Plaintiff’s complaint and Plaintiff’s response to Defendant’s demand for a bill of particulars, claims related to money lent between 2009 to 2020 are subject to the section 339(1) two-year limitations period.  Because Plaintiff filed her complaint on August 17, 2023, any claims for money lent that accrued prior to August 17, 2021 are time-barred.  Without an opposition, Plaintiff does not challenge this conclusion.  Therefore, judgment on the pleadings with respect to claims for money lent that accrued prior to August 17, 2021, which includes the sums identified between 2009 to 2020, is appropriate.
