Summary in English text:
The judge issues a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV26460, granting plaintiff/cross-defendant Gayane Musayelyan's special motion to strike the second cause of action in defendant/cross-complainant Mariam Gabashvili's cross-complaint. The second cause of action alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress arising from Musayelyan's allegedly tortious statements made in the complaint, which are protected by the litigation privilege. The judge finds that Gabashvili has not shown a probability of prevailing on her second cause of action and therefore grants the motion to strike. Musayelyan is awarded $8,372.50 in attorney fees and costs.
