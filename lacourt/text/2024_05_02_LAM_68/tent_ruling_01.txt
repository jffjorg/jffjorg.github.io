SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
April 4, 2022, Plaintiffs Betty Chen entered into a written contract with defendant
V-Stream Aviation Corp. for a one-way private jet aircraft charter from Maui
Hawaii to Van Nuys California. The flight date was scheduled for April 15, 2022
at a cost of $47,600. Plaintiff Becky Yue was an intended co-passenger. 
 
On
April 8, 2022, Chen cancelled the charger via email “due to covid-19 exposure”
with a confirmed positive test result. Chen subsequently requested a refund
based on the language in the agreement allowing for a “no charge” refund for
cancellations “at least 100 hours in advance of scheduled departure.” Registered
agent for V-Stream, Eli Levy, purportedly confirmed the refund in June and July
2022, but no refund appeared. 
 
On
June 15, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their complaint for Breach of Contract and
Conversion. On October 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint
for Breach of Contract, Conversion, and Intentional Misrepresentation. On
December 22, 2023, the court granted a motion to strike the claims for punitive
damages and attorney fees. On January 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their second
amended complaint for Breach of Contract, Conversion, and Intentional
Misrepresentation
 
RULING
Demurrer: Sustained with
Leave in Part/Overruled in Part.
Defendant
V-Stream Aviation Corp. brings a demurrer to the conversion and intentional
misrepresentation causes of action in the second amended complaint. Defendant
challenges the two causes of action on grounds of failure to state facts
supporting either claim beyond the unchallenged breach of contract cause of
action. Plaintiff in opposition maintains both challenged claims are properly
pled. The court electronic filing system shows no reply at the time of the
tentative ruling publication cutoff.

A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent
from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated. (Picton v. Anderson
Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules, where the
complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently apprising
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty
should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.]
 
2nd
Cause of Action, Conversion: Overruled.
Defendant challenges the subject claim on grounds that the
contract undermines any claim for conversion. “‘A cause of action for
conversion requires allegations of plaintiff's ownership or right to possession
of property; defendant's wrongful act toward or disposition of the property,
interfering with plaintiff's possession; and damage to plaintiff. [Citation.]
Money cannot be the subject of a cause of action for conversion unless there is
a specific, identifiable sum involved.’” (PCO,
Inc. v. Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil & Shapiro, LLP
(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 384, 395.)
 
The
claim relies on the nonreturned deposit of funds following the timely
cancellation of the flight. The demurrer itself only cites to a potential
defense of a conversion claim without addressing the actual elements. The court
finds the elements properly stated, and declines to rely on extrinsic inference
in support of the demurrer. (Taylor v. Forte Hotels
International (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1119,
1124.) The demurrer is overruled.
 
3rd
Cause of Action, Intentional Misrepresentation: Sustained with Leave to Amend.
Defendant challenges the subject cause of action on grounds
of insufficient factual particularity. “‘The
elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or “scienter”); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.’” … [¶] ‘Promissory fraud’ is a subspecies of the action for fraud and deceit. A promise to do something necessarily
implies the intention to perform; hence, where a promise is made without such
intention, there is an implied misrepresentation of fact that may be
actionable fraud.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 638.) “Fraud
in the inducement is a subset of the tort of fraud. It ‘occurs when “‘the
promisor knows what he is signing but his consent is induced by fraud, mutual
assent is present and a contract is formed, which, by reason of the fraud, is
voidable.’”’ (Citations.)” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294-295.) “[I]n
order to support a claim of fraud based upon the alleged failure to perform a
promise, it must be shown that the promisor did not intend to perform at the
time the promise was made. (Conrad v. Bank of America (1996) 45
Cal.App.4th 133, 157 accord Tenzer v. Superscope, Inc. (1985) 39 Cal.3d
18, 30.)
 
The fraud claims appear to arise in either promissory fraud
or fraud in the inducement in that Defendant never intended to comply with the
agreement at the time of making the purported agreement. [Sec. Amend. Comp., ¶¶
24-25.] Defendant specifically challenges the justifiable reliance element of
the claim in that the refund demand only occurred after payment of the deposit.
Plaintiff reiterates the fraudulent intent claim.
 
“In
addition to showing that the defendant knowingly made a false representation,
in order to establish fraud it must be shown that the defendant thereby
intended to induce the plaintiff to act to his detriment in reliance upon the
false representation. (Citations.) The defendant must intend to induce a
particular act of the plaintiff and is not liable in fraud for unintended
consequences. (Citation.) And it must be shown that the plaintiff actually and
justifiably relied upon the defendant's misrepresentation in acting to his
detriment.” (Conrad v. Bank of America, supra, 45 Cal.App.4th at p. 157.) “The plaintiff
must also plead the injury or damage suffered and its causal connection to
plaintiff's reliance on the defendant's misrepresentations.” (Thrifty
Payless, Inc. v. The Americana at Brand, LLC (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1230,
1239.) “Actual reliance occurs when a misrepresentation is an immediate cause
of [a plaintiff's] conduct, which alters his legal relations, and when, absent
such representation, he would not, in all reasonable probability, have entered
into the contract or other transaction.” (Conroy v. Regents of University of
California (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1244, 1256 (internal quotation marks
omitted).)
 
Given the contract was entered into with only the possibility of a
cancellation prior to the entry of the contract, the court finds no specific
basis of fraudulent intent at the time of entry and payment of the deposit to
intend the fraudulent withholding of the deposit. “The law is well established
that actionable misrepresentations must pertain to past or existing material
facts. (Citation.)
Statements or predictions regarding future events are deemed to be mere
opinions which are not actionable.” (Cansino v. Bank of America
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)
 
The demurrer is sustained based on the failure to articulate any
actual fraudulent representation and therefore basis of reliance on a purported
promise to comply with a provision not yet pertinent or enacted. 
 
 
Motion to Strike: Granted/Moot.
Defendant V-Stream Aviation Corp. moves to strike the
prayers for punitive damages and attorney fees in the second amended complaint.
Any and all challenges and reliance on the third cause of action for recovery
is now moot, due to the court sustaining the demurrer. 
 
Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (c) authorizes punitive
damages upon a showing of malice, oppression, or fraud, which are defined as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
Punitive damages require more than the mere commission of a
tort. (See Taylor v. Superior Court
(1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 894-95.) Specific facts must be pled in support of
punitive damages. (Hillard v. A.H. Robins
Co. (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 374, 391-392.) “The mere allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient
to warrant an award of punitive damages. [Citation.] Not only must there be
circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.
[Citation.]” (Grieves v. Superior Court
(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166, fn. Omitted [emphasis added].)
 
The
failure to return a deposit upon timely compliance with a contractual condition
lacks sufficient support demonstrating malicious or oppressive intent for
purposes of the supporting the claim for punitive damages in the conversion
cause of action. The court therefore grants the motion to strike the punitive
damages claim. 
 
In summary, demurrer is overruled on the conversion cause of
action, and sustained with leave to amend on the fraud cause of action. The
motion to strike is moot as to the third cause of action, and granted as to the
second cause of action claim seeking punitive damages. Because this is the
first time the court has reviewed the substance of the claim, the court grants
30 days leave to amend. Plaintiff may not add any new causes of action, and
only add facts to the previously existing claim for fraud. (Harris v.
Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.) Any new
causes of action added without leave of court may be subject to a motion to
strike. If Plaintiff elects to forego filing an amended pleading, V-Stream
Aviation Corp. is ordered to answer the remaining complaint within 10 days of
the lapse of the amendment deadline.
 
Trial remains set for November 12, 2024.
