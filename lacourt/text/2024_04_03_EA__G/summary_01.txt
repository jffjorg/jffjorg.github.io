And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or adjudication due to their failure to properly craft a code-compliant separate statement. The court found that the defendants' separate statement was overly long and included facts that were not material to the issues in their motion, including background information and outlines of policy that had no bearing on the issues in the motion. The court also noted that the defendants' separate statement failed to clearly state the material facts that were without substantial controversy, instead providing obliquely stated "facts" that were material only to the extent they were controverted and uncontroverted only to the extent they were immaterial.
