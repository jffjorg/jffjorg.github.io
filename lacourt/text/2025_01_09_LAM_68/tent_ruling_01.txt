RULING
Demurrer:
OVERRULED. 
Defendants
Haresh Jogani, Jeet Jogani, and, Ritesh Desai submit a demurrer to the alter
ego allegations of the complaint. Defendants submit an extensive citation of
the law regarding alter ego liability, while concluding the operative
allegation in the complaint lacks sufficient support. Plaintiffs in opposition
challenge reliance on unpublished and other inapposite caselaw, maintains the
complaint sufficiently articulates alter ego liability, and challenges
Defendants’ arguments as beyond the scope of the demurrer. Defendants in reply
reiterates the “inequitable” result of allowing the alter ego claim to proceed
without sufficient factual support.
 
A
demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from
either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules, where the
complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently apprising
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty
should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.]
 
Alter ego is not a cause of action, and therefore more
properly the subject matter of a motion to strike. (PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680,
1682-1683 [While a demurrer is not the exclusive means to challenge a cause of
action, a motion to strike generally applies to parts of a cause of action,
claim for damages, or where the cause of action or primary right is barred as a
matter of law]; see Quiroz v. Seventh
Ave. Center (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1281 [“Where a whole cause of
action is the proper subject of a pleading challenge, the court should
sustain a demurrer to the cause of action rather than grant
a motion to strike”].) The demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
 
Motion to Strike: DENIED.
Defendants
submit a concurrent motion to strike the alter ego allegations and punitive
damages claim. Plaintiffs counter both the alter ego allegations and punitive
damages claims are sufficiently articulated, Defendants improperly rely on
extrinsic inference and seek premature factual adjudication, and Defendants
cite to inapposite caselaw. Defendants in reply reiterates the factual
insufficiency of the alter ego claim.
 
Alter ego liability requires two elements: “‘(1) that there
be such unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the
corporation and the individual no longer exist and (2) that, if the acts are
treated as those of the corporation alone, an inequitable result will follow.’”
(Mesler v. Bragg Management Co.
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 300; Leek v. Cooper
(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 399, 411.) To allege alter ego, plaintiffs must plead a
unity of interest and ownership such that the separate personalities of the
corporation and individuals do not exist, and that an inequity will result if
the corporate entity is treated as the sole actor. (Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1269,
1285.) Paragraph 10 of the complaint sufficiently articulates the elements for
pleading alter ego liability. The court declines to consider any extrinsic
evidence or factors submitted in the extensive authorities; such discussion is
well beyond the scope of the motion. The motion to strike the alter ego allegations
is DENIED.
 
On the punitive damages claim, Civil Code, Section 3294
authorizes punitive damages upon a showing of malice, oppression, or fraud,
which are defined as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means conduct which is intended
by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which
is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression” means despicable conduct
that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of
that person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an intentional
misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the
defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving
a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
The court finds the allegations regarding the knowing
violation of habitability laws and standards demonstrates a conscious and
knowing disregard for the rights and safety of tenants, thereby supporting the
claim for punitive damages for purposes of the motion to strike. The motion to
strike is DENIED as to this item.
 
The demurrer is therefore overruled and the motion to strike
denied. Defendants to answer the complaint within 10 days of this order.
 
The
court will concurrently conduct the Case Management Conference.

Defendant to give notice.
