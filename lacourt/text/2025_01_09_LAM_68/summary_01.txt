And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 24STCV10830, in which plaintiffs Sanchez, et al. filed a complaint against defendants Haresh Jogani, et al. The defendants filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the alter ego allegations lack sufficient support. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint sufficiently articulates the elements of alter ego liability.

The defendants also filed a motion to strike the alter ego allegations and punitive damages claim. The judge has denied the motion to strike, finding that the allegations regarding the knowing violation of habitability laws and standards demonstrate a conscious and knowing disregard for the rights and safety of tenants, thereby supporting the claim for punitive damages.

The judge has ordered the defendants to answer the complaint within 10 days of the order. The court will concurrently conduct a Case Management Conference.
