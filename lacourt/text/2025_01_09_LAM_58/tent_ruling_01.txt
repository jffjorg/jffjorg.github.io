            Plaintiffs have settled this case
with Defendants for $135,000. Plaintiffs/Petitioners
now seeks approval of a compromise of the claims on behalf of minors, Plaintiffs Javier Hernandez, Jaiden Garcia,
Lesly Medina, Andreana Medina, and Alexanden Medina.[1]

 
Discussion
 
            Court approval is
required for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) California Rules of Court, rule 7.950
provides that a petition “must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the compromise.” The Petition must be filed on Judicial Council Form
MC-350 and must be fully completed. 
 
            The Petition is properly filed on the Judicial Council form
and is verified. Petitioners have also submitted the requisite attachments with
the Petition.  
            
            Of
the $235,000 in settlement funds, Adult
Plaintiffs will each receive $32,500, except for Plaintiff Christopher Medina, who will receive
$5,000. $5,000 will also be allocated for
the claims of the minor Plaintiffs
Javier Hernandez, Jaiden Garcia, Lesly Medina, Andreana Medina, and Alexanden
Medina. This amount compensates minor
Plaintiffs for their emotional distress and inconveniences.
            Plaintiffs’
counsel seeks attorney fees in the amount of $1,250 from each minor Plaintiff
claimant, which is approximately 25% of the settlement amount, plus costs of
$409. (See Pets., ¶¶ 13-16.) No attorney declaration was submitted.
Nonetheless, the Court finds that the amount requested is reasonable. 
Petitioners
have satisfied all of the procedural and substantive requirements.
Therefore, the petitions are granted.
