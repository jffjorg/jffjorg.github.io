Savat
 Vuthy v. Michelle Marie Dobard-Anderson

Tuesday,
 February 6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER TAKING
 HEARING ON DEMURRER AND MOTION TO STRIKE OFF CALENDAR 
 
      The demurrer
to Plaintiff’s complaint and motion to strike is taken off calendar as
Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint on January 23, 2024, before the
opposition was due. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005, § 472.)
As the amended pleading supersedes the original complaint, the demurrer and
motion are rendered moot. (Foster
v. Sexton (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 998, 1035 ["An amended
pleading supplants (i.e., entirely replaces) the prior pleading and it,
standing alone, contains all the plaintiff's allegations and requests for
relief.”].)
