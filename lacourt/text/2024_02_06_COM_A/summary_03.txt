Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages against Cameron Dayne, a defendant in the case. The motion was filed by Dayne, who argued that the Plaintiffs had not alleged facts showing that he acted with malice, fraud, or oppression to warrant recovery of such damages. The Plaintiffs acknowledged that it was Oswaldo Lopez, another driver, who was driving under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident, but did not allege any facts against Dayne concerning driving under the influence of alcohol. The Court found that the Plaintiffs did not have a cause of action for punitive damages against Dayne and granted the motion to strike.
