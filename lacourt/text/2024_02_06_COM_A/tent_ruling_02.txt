[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
MOTION
 FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT BY DEFENDANTS
 
      The
verified complaint alleges that Defendants unlawfully recorded a deed of trust
encumbering Plaintiffs’ property. Plaintiffs allege that they do not owe
Defendants pursuant to a promissory note that has been previously ordered null
and void in another action. Plaintiffs allege claims for quiet title, financial
elder abuse, cancellation of instruments, and slander of title. 
      On
November 17, 2023, the Court granted a motion for judgment on the pleading
filed by Defendants, Bank of America, (“BOA”), Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.,
dba America’s Wholesale Lender (“Countrywide”); and Recon Trust Los Angeles
(“RTLA”) (collectively, “Defendants.”) The Court granted Plaintiffs 30 days
leave to amend.
      Defendants
request a judgment against Plaintiffs who failed to amend the complaint within
the time allotted by the Court. Defendants timely filed and served the motion
on Plaintiffs, who did not file an opposition. 
      Where a
party does not amend a complaint, then the party in whose favor judgment on the
pleading was granted shall move for entry of judgment in its favor. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 438 subd. (i)(1)(B).) The Court’s file does not reflect that
Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion is
GRANTED. The Court will enter judgment in Defendants’ favor and against
Plaintiffs.
