```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that the demurrer to the Plaintiff's complaint and motion to strike are taken off calendar as the Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint on January 23, 2024, before the opposition was due. As the amended pleading supersedes the original complaint, the demurrer and motion are rendered moot. The Judge cites Foster v. Sexton (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 998, 1035, which states that an amended pleading replaces the prior pleading and contains all the plaintiff's allegations and requests for relief.
