Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the Plaintiffs' Motion to Relate Cases (CRC 3.300(h)(1)) concerning cases 23STUD13055, 23STUD13065, and 23STUD13071. The Court finds that these cases are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a) because they arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events, requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact. The Court also finds that there will be a substantial duplication of judicial resources if the cases are heard by different judges. As a result, the Court orders that cases 23STUD13065 and 23STUD13071 be reassigned to Department 93 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all purposes, and all hearings currently set in these cases are hereby advanced and vacated.
