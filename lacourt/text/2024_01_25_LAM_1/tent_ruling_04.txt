Background
of 23STUD13055 Bogari v. Mendoza
 
On October 4, 2023, Plaintiffs Faye
Bogari, as Trustee of the Faye Bogari Trust dated August 9, 2002, and Manijeh
Habibi filed this action against Jennifer Mendoza for unlawful detainer of real
property located at 4857 W. 12th St Los Angeles, CA 90019, which is allegedly
part of a single parcel containing three residential units. The complaint
alleges Plaintiffs filed a notice of intent to withdraw units from rental
housing use under the Ellis Act, complied with the Act’s requirements, and
Defendant failed to vacate the property after the expiration of the 120 day
notice. 
 
On October 11, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Related
Case involving 23STUD13055 and 23STUD13071 Bogari v. Quezada, and
23STUD13065 Bogari v. Thomas. On October 16, 2023, Judge Ian C.
Fusselman issued a minute order stating, in relevant part, “[t]his Court finds
that Case Numbers 23STUD13055, 23STUD13065 and 23STUD13071 should not be deemed
related because they involve different addresses, different defendants and
different notices to quit.”
 
On October 23, 2023, Defendant Mendoza filed a demurrer based
upon the contention that the notice of intent to withdraw was not filed on
behalf of the trust that owns the property. The court overruled the demurrer on
November 14, 2023. 
 
On November 20, 2023, Defendant filed an answer containing
a general denial and asserting Plaintiffs “did not serve a legally-compliant
notice either (1) in person or (2) by both posting the notice on the door and
mailing said notice,” did not comply with the Ellis Act, served the notice to
retaliate against Defendant, lack standing and a bona fide intent to take the
rental unit out of the market, and violated the implied covenants of good faith
and fair dealing, among other defenses.
 
On November 20, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to
consolidate 23STUD13055, 23STUD13065 and 23STUD13071, which the court denied on
December 19, 2023, noting the cases must be related in the same department
before a party may notice a motion to consolidate, citing LASC Local Rules,
rule 3.3(g)(1). 
 
This case is currently pending in
Department 93 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
 
Background
of 23STUD13065 Bogari v. Thomas
 
On October 5, 2023, Plaintiffs Faye
Bogari, as Trustee of the Faye Bogari Trust dated August 9, 2002, and Manijeh
Habibi filed 23STUD13065 against Jeremy Thomas for unlawful detainer of real
property located at 4859 W. 12th St Los Angeles, CA 90019, which is allegedly
part of a single parcel containing three residential units. The complaint
alleges Plaintiffs filed a notice of intent to withdraw units from rental
housing use under the Ellis Act, complied with the Act’s requirements, and
Defendant failed to vacate the property after the expiration of the 120 day
notice. 
 
On October 23, 2023, Defendant
Thomas, who is represented by the same counsel as Defendant Mendoza in
23STUD13055, filed an identical demurrer based upon the contention that
the notice of intent to withdraw was not filed on behalf of the trust that owns
the property. 
 
This case is currently pending in
Department 91 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
 
Background
of 23STUD13071 Bogari v. Quezada
 
On October 4, 2024, Plaintiffs Faye
Bogari, as Trustee of the Faye Bogari Trust dated August 9, 2002, and Manijeh
Habibi filed 23STUD13071 against Galo Quezada for unlawful detainer of real
property located at 1185 S. Tremaine Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90019, which is
allegedly part of a single parcel containing three residential units. The
complaint alleges Plaintiffs filed a notice of intent to withdraw units from
rental housing use under the Ellis Act, complied with the Act’s requirements,
and Defendant failed to vacate the property after the expiration of the 120 day
notice.
 
On October 23, 2023, Defendant
Quezada, who is represented by the same counsel as Defendant Mendoza in
23STUD13055, filed an identical demurrer based upon the contention that
the notice of intent to withdraw was not filed on behalf of the trust that owns
the property. 
 
This case is currently pending in
Department 91 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
 
Motion to Relate Cases
 
Standard 
 
In the event that the pertinent judge under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1) does not relate any of the cases set forth in
a Notice of Related Case, Department 1 may relate the matters on noticed
motion. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) 
 
The Motion is Procedurally Proper
 
On October 16, 2023, Judge Ian C. Fusselman issued a minute
order stating, in relevant part, “[t]his Court finds that Case Numbers
23STUD13055, 23STUD13065 and 23STUD13071 should not be deemed related because
they involve different addresses, different defendants and different notices to
quit.” 
 
In opposition, Defendants
inaccurately characterize Plaintiffs’ motion as a motion to consolidate and
contend it is an improper renewal motion or motion for reconsideration under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. (Opp. at 2:3-4, 2:21-27, 5:2-4.)
Plaintiffs’ motion seeks to relate the three cases, a prerequisite for later
moving for consolidation. (LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(g)(1) (“Cases may not be
consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate
two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in
different departments, have been related into a single department . . .”).) The
motion does not seek consolidation, Department 1 does not consolidate cases,
and any arguments related to consolidation, such as the introduction of
character evidence, (Opp. at 3:25-4:24), are premature. Plaintiffs’ motion is
expressly authorized by California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(D) and LASC
Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3) and therefore is not constrained
by the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. Plaintiffs’ motion
is properly made in Department 1.
 
The Court Finds the Cases are Related
 
Cases
are related when they (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or
similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for
other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard
by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a).) Plaintiffs’ motion contends
the cases are related based upon every ground enumerated in Rule 3.300(a).
(Mot. at 7:2-8:27.) 
 
As
demonstrated above, while each case involves a claim for unlawful detainer
based upon proceedings under the Ellis Act, they do not involve the same
parties. Each case involves a different defendant. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(a)(1).) The cases also do not involve claims against, title to,
possession of, or damages to the same property within the meaning of Rule
3.300(a)(3). Each case involves a different residential property, though
situated on the same parcel, as acknowledged in each complaint. 
 
Plaintiffs
contend the cases arise from the same or substantially identical transactions,
incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially
identical questions of law or fact because they submitted a single Ellis Act
application to LAHD related to the three residential units. (Mot. at 7:18-24.)
While the unlawful detainer claim arises from the same Ellis Act application,
the Defendants contend the defenses asserted, and likely to be asserted,
require factually specific inquiries related to retaliation, service of the
notice to quit, and the amount of holdover damages, if any. (Opp. at 3:3-24.) The
Court finds the cases arise out of substantially identical events: Plaintiffs’
Ellis Act application and asserted desire to remove tenants from the units on
the property. Each case will require determinations regarding Plaintiffs’
compliance with the Ellis Act and related statutes and regulations, as
demonstrated by Defendants’ identical demurrers filed after the initial ruling
on the Notice of Related Case. The cases will also require determinations
regarding Plaintiffs’ intent. Based upon the additional filings in the cases as
well as the arguments asserted by the parties, the Court finds the cases are
related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a)(2). 
 
Plaintiffs
also argue there will be a substantial duplication of judicial resources if the
cases are heard by different judges. (Mot. at 8:9-27.) The Court agrees. After
the initial ruling on the Notice of Related Case, each Defendant filed an
identical demurrer regarding the same legal issue. If the cases continue before
different judges, it appears likely they will be called upon to resolve
identical factual and legal issues throughout the litigation. Plaintiffs’ cases
are premised upon the same Notice of Intent to Withdraw Units from Rental
Housing Use listing all three units, the units are allegedly subject to the
same provisions of the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, the Relocation Assistance
Payment Determination attached to each complaint indicates all three units were
provided the same case number by the Los Angeles Housing Department, (Compls.
Ex. G), and the relocation funds are held under the same escrow. (Id. Ex. H.)
Furthermore, relating the three cases will reduce the potential for
inconsistent rulings. (See Harris v. Rojas (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 817,
820 (“The notice allows the trial court to promote efficiency, to avoid
duplicative effort, to combat judge-shopping, and to minimize the prospect of
conflicting results. The trial court system relies on this mechanism to detect
and to cure the problem of parallel litigation within its jurisdiction.”).) 
 
The
Court finds 23STUD13055, 23STUD13065, and 23STUD13071 are related within the
meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a) and the motion is GRANTED.
