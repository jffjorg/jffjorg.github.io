Motion to Relate Cases
 
Standard 
 
In the event that the pertinent judge under California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1) does not relate any of the cases set forth in
a Notice of Related Case, Department 1 may relate the matters on noticed
motion. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) 
 
The Motion is Procedurally Proper
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs make various arguments regarding
consolidation, which are immaterial to Defendant’s motion. (Opp. at 2:19-6:2.) As
noted by Defendant, (Mot. at 7:12-13), the motion seeks to relate the four
cases at issue, a prerequisite for later
moving for consolidation. (LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(g)(1) (“Cases may not be
consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate
two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in
different departments, have been related into a single department . . .”).) The
motion does not seek consolidation, Department 1 does not consolidate cases,
and any arguments related to consolidation are premature. 
 
Plaintiffs also argue the motion
is improper, citing various authority standing for the general propositions
that one trial judge may not overrule another, (Opp. at 6:4-7:18), and a
superior court’s authority to promulgate local rules is constrained. (Opp. at
7:19-11:4.) While Plaintiffs’ counsel contends the instant motion is “the greatest
and most aggressive abuse the undersigned has ever seen,” (Opp. at 10:24-25), Defendant’s
motion is expressly authorized by both the California Rules of Court, rule
3.300(h)(1)(D) and LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).
None of Plaintiffs’ authority addresses the long-standing provision of the
California Rules of Court applicable here. Defendant’s motion is properly made
in Department 1 and Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the procedural propriety of
the motion are unpersuasive. 
 
The Court Declines to Relate the Cases
at Issue
 
Cases
are related when they (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or
similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for
other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard
by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a).)
 
As
seen above, the cases do not involve the same parties as Defendant is the only
party common to each case. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1).) The cases also do
not arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or
events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical
questions of law or fact. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(2).) Defendant notes the
cases all involve the same fire incident, (Mot. at 6:22-27), which is not
sufficient to render the cases related. Each case arises out of each plaintiff’s
tenancy, with the Plaintiff’s alleging different harm from the fire at issue. Plaintiff
Cervantes in 23STCV12969 alleges she had largely moved out of the unit her
parents rented at the property, but her belongings were damaged in the fire.
Plaintiffs in 23STCV15505 allege they were wrongfully evicted after the fire. Additionally,
the personal property at issue as well as the extent of damage is unique to
each Plaintiff. Furthermore, as Defendant acknowledges, “the specific
habitability issues may differ from unit to unit.” (Id. at 6:24.) The habitability
issues and Defendant’s knowledge thereof require different factual and legal
determinations for each unit. The limited similarities between the cases do not
render them related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule
3.300(a)(2). 
 
Defendant
contends “[a]ll Actions involve damages to their residential rental property as
a result of the fire that occurred on June 12, 2022.” (Mot. at 7:1-3.) However,
the property damage at issue relates to each Plaintiff’s personal property, not
the real property owned by Defendant. The cases do not involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property within the meaning of
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a)(3).
 
Finally,
Defendant contends that it “plans to file motions for summary judgment on
issues that are the exact same across the board, specifically as it relates to
their negligence for having caused or contributed to the fire.” (Mot. at
7:4-9.) This representation regarding a future litigation strategy is not
sufficient to render the cases related. Pursuant to California Rules of Court,
rule 3.300(a)(4), cases may be related if they are likely to require a substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. Based upon the
allegations at issue in the four complaints, the potential duplication of
judicial resources is not likely to be substantial. Issues unique to each
Plaintiff and their tenancy in their individual units predominate. 
 
The
Court finds the cases are not related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300(a) and the motion is DENIED.
