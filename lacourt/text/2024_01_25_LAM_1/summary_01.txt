Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Maha Visconti's motion to transfer the case to another district. The motion was based on various grounds, including a claim of conflict of interest by Judge Elaine W. Mandel, the alleged inconvenience of Visconti and her former counsel, and a request to be reunited with Judge Michael E. Whitaker, who originally assigned the case. The judge found that Visconti failed to provide any evidence to support her claims and that the Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court do not permit the transfer of cases based on these grounds. The judge also noted that Visconti's former counsel's convenience is not a permissible basis for a change of venue motion and that Visconti's own convenience is not considered in a motion to transfer. The judge concluded that Visconti's motion was denied without prejudice.
