And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant City of Long Beach's motion to transfer the case to the appropriate judicial district. The case, filed by Plaintiff Paula Johnson, was originally filed in the Southeast District of the Los Angeles Superior Court, but the Judge has determined that it should be transferred to the South District due to the incident occurring in a public right of way within the City of Long Beach. The Plaintiff had alleged that she struck a damaged portion of sidewalk while riding a bicycle, causing significant leg injuries. The Defendant had submitted a stipulation to transfer the case to the South District, which was initially denied by Judge Olivia Rosales.
