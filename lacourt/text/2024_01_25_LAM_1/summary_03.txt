English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to relate four cases: 23STCV12943, 23STCV12969, 23STCV12999, and 23STCV15505. The cases are separate and distinct, involving different parties, claims, and events. The defendant's argument that the cases are related because they all involve damage to residential rental property as a result of a fire on June 12, 2022, is rejected. The judge finds that the cases do not involve the same parties, transactions, incidents, or events, and that each case requires different factual and legal determinations. Therefore, the motion is denied, and the cases will be heard separately.
