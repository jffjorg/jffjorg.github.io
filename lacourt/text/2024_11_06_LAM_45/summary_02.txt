**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24STCV14265
* Hearing Date: November 6, 2024
* Department: 45
* Court: Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Nicole Alexandra Feryanitz
* Defendants: Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc., MTC Financial Inc. dba Trustee Corps, Athas Capital Group, Malcolm Cisneros, All Persons Claiming Legal, Equitable Lien and Estate in the Property located at 21231 Dove Circle, Huntington Beach, CA 92646 APN.149 403 20, and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive

**Background**

* On June 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against the Defendants seeking injunctive relief, unfair business practice, and declaratory relief.
* On August 7, 2024, Defendant SPS filed a demurrer to the Complaint.
* No opposition has been filed.

**Legal Standard**

* The primary function of a pleading is to give notice to the other party, and a defect in a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect substantial rights.
* A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.

**Demurrer**

* SPS demurs to the entire Complaint on the grounds that the first, second, and third causes of action fail to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against SPS.

**First Cause of Action**

* For injunctive relief, SPS contends that Plaintiff has no standing to seek relief because the Property is not owner-occupied and Plaintiff does not allege that the Property is her primary residence.
* The Complaint is devoid of any factual allegations that Plaintiff occupies the Property or that it is her principal place of residence as required by the California Homeowner Bill of Rights.

**Second Cause of Action**

* For unfair business practice, SPS contends that the second cause of action fails because it is derivative of the first cause of action.

**Third Cause of Action**

* For declaratory relief, SPS contends that the third cause of action fails because the Complaint fails to plead that an actual controversy exists, i.e., the invalidity of the Deed of Trust.

**Ruling**

* The demurrer is SUSTAINED with 30 days leave to amend as to the first, second, and third causes of action.

**Significant Statements**

* "The purpose of the act that added this section is to ensure that, as part of the nonjudicial foreclosure process, borrowers are considered for, and have a meaningful opportunity to obtain, available loss mitigation options, if any, offered by or through the borrower's mortgage servicer, such as loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure." (California Civil Code Section 2923.4, subdivision (a))
* "To qualify for a permanent injunction, the plaintiff must prove (1) the elements of a cause of action involving the wrongful act sought to be enjoined (here, declaratory relief); and (2) the grounds for equitable relief." (San Diego Unified Port Dist. v. Gallagher (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 501, 503)

**Request for Judicial Notice**

* Defendant SPS' request for judicial notice of certain documents is GRANTED.

**Meet and Confer**

* Prior to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.

**Intentions**

* The Judge intends to sustain the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend as to the first, second, and third causes of action.

**Facts**

* The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff is the equitable owner of the subject property located at 21231 Dove Circle, Huntington Beach, CA 92646 APN.149 403 20.
* The Complaint alleges that Defendants have not considered Plaintiff for a loan modification or her request for approval of a short sale on the basis she does not qualify.
* The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff is entitled to a loan modification of her loan or an opportunity to do a short sale of the Property in lieu of foreclosure.
