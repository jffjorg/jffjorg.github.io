```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to serve discovery on third parties to identify the individuals who have committed alleged wrongful acts. However, the judge has not approved the exact form of the discovery requests or the order proposed by the plaintiff. The judge notes that discovery typically commences after a defendant has been served, but that there is good cause to permit early discovery in this case. The judge also rejects the plaintiff's proposed order, finding that it combines two separate issues and goes beyond the scope of the motion. Instead, the judge suggests that the parties negotiate the contours of discovery between themselves, and that the court will address any disputes that arise.
