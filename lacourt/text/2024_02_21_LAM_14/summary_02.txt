And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Care as One, Inc. (Plaintiff) and Jonas Muthoni (individual Defendant) and Deviate Agency, LLC (corporate Defendant). The Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Muthoni failed to perform his duties as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and subcontracted work to Defendant Deviate, which also failed to perform. This allegedly resulted in the loss of several clients and significant financial loss, as well as emotional distress to Plaintiff Bhatti.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer (a motion to dismiss) to the second, third, and fourth causes of action (Intentional Misrepresentation, Negligent Misrepresentation, and Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage) because the pleadings are insufficient to support those claims. The Judge notes that the alleged misrepresentations are general statements made by Defendant Muthoni during a job interview and are therefore not actionable. The Judge also notes that the pleadings are unclear and failed to properly identify the cause of action.

The Judge grants the Plaintiff 10 days leave to amend the pleadings to correct these defects. The Judge's ruling is based on the principles of fraud pleading, which require that the pleadings be specific and factual, and that the allegations be supported by evidence.
