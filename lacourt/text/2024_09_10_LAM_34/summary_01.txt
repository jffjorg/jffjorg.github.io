Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Crystal Gomez's motions to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The Court grants Plaintiff's motions, compelling Defendant N. Francowitz, Inc. and Nancy Franco to provide further, code-compliant responses to the discovery requests.

The Court finds that Defendant failed to provide timely and code-compliant responses to the discovery requests, and that Plaintiff has made a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the issues informally. The Court also finds that Defendant has not provided any justification for its failure to respond to the discovery requests.

The Court sets forth the following orders:

1. Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED.
2. Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Production of Documents, Set Two is GRANTED.
