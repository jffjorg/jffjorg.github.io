1.         Motion to Compel Furthers Re:
Interrogatories
Legal Standard
“[T]he propounding party may move for
an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that . .
. (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete[,] (2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate[,
and/or that] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
The moving
party must demonstrate a “reasonable and good faith attempt” at an informal
resolution of each issue presented. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2030.300,
subd. (b)(1).) “In lieu of a separate statement required under the California
Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a concise
outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(2).)
Notice of the motion must be provided “within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (c).) The responding party has the burden of justifying the
objections to the requests. (Coy v.
Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction. . . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes
or opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court for an order compelling Defendant
to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Specially Prepared Interrogatories,
Set One. Plaintiff also seeks a monetary sanction in the amount of $2,500
pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 and 2023.300.
Merits
Plaintiff’s counsel Jonathan Lacour (“Lacour”) represents as
follows:
On or about June 29, 2023, Plaintiff
properly served her SROGs at issue upon Defendant N. Francowitz, Inc.
(“Defendant”). (Lacour Decl., § 2.)  Specifically,
Plaintiff's SROGs sought information related to Defendant's policies for
providing adequate meal and rest breaks to aggrieved employees, information
regarding aggrieved employees’ rates of pay and schedules, and identification
of witnesses and documents in support of Defendant's contentions. (Id.,
¶ 3.) Defendant requested a month-long extension its deadline to provide
responses to the discovery at issue in a lengthy email on July 13, 2023. (Id.,
¶ 8.)  As Defendant's new August 28, 2023
deadline approached, on or about Saturday August 26, 2023, defense counsel sent
yet another email seeking another month's extension. (Id., ¶ 10.) The
following Monday morning, on or about August 28, 2023, Plaintiff's counsel
again granted Defendant a month-long extension to September 28, 2023. (Id.,
¶ 11.) Defendant ultimately did not submit any discovery responses by its
deadline of September 28, 2023. (Id., ¶ 13.) Following this, Plaintiff
filed Motions to Compel Responses regarding the numerous discovery responses to
which Defendant had not given a response. (Id., ¶ 14.)  Prior to these motions being heard by the
Court, on or about October 18, 2023 the Parties attended an IDC before the
Court where Defendant indicated that it would serve responses without
objections. (Id., ¶ 15.) Subsequently, Plaintiff took her discovery
motions off calendar. (Id.) 
 
On or about October 31, 2023, Defendant
finally served responses to the discovery requests at issue. (Id., ¶
16.) Upon reviewing Defendant’s responses, however, Plaintiff discovered that
several responses were markedly deficient. (Id., ¶ 17.) Notably,
Defendant had provided boilerplate objections to several of Plaintiff’s SROGs
despite having waived such objections by failing to serve timely responses. (Id.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff sent Defendant a detailed meet and confer letter on
or about December 12, 2023. (Id., ¶ 18.) Defendant initially responded
to Plaintiff’s letter by agreeing to extend Plaintiff’s motion deadline
multiple times into February 2024. (Id., ¶ 19.) 
 
During this time in early 2024, the
parties also began settlement talks and were working on the details of
resolving the case for multiple months afterward. (Id., ¶ 20.)  Around May 2024, however, the momentum on the
parties (sic) settlement efforts appeared to be petering out. (Id., ¶
21.) Accordingly, as the instant PAGA discovery was still outstanding,
Plaintiff scheduled an IDC with the Court in an attempt to resolve the issues
informally. (Id.) At this IDC, Plaintiff explained that the PAGA
discovery sought would be necessary to properly present her PAGA claim at trial
and that, given the stagnation of resolution talks and the impending trial
date, (Id., ¶ 22.) Over the next two months, Plaintiff continued to try
and informally resolve this case as well as the instant discovery disputes. (Id.,
¶ 23.) As part of that effort, the parties again agreed that Plaintiff’s
deadline would be extended to July 22, 2024. (Id.) Unfortunately,
Plaintiff has been met with further silence from Defendant regarding both
settlement and discovery and accordingly reached out on or about July 11, 2024
to let Defendant know that Plaintiff would need to proceed with discovery given
the delays in the case. (Id., ¶ 24.)  At no point during any of this time has
Defendant provided substantive, code compliant responses to the requests at
issue. (Id., ¶ 25.)
The motion is unopposed Defendant is to serve further,
Code-compliant responses, without objections, within 20 days from the date of
the notice of ruling.
Sanctions
Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amount of $2,500.00.
However, Lacour’s declaration does not provide any information as to how the
amount was calculated. Therefore, the court will not grant sanctions at this
time.
2.         Motion to
Compel Furthers Re: Requests for Production of Documents
Legal Standard
“[T]he
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that. . . (1) A statement of compliance with the
demand is incomplete[,] (2) A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive [and/or that] (3) An objection in the
response is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(a).)
The moving party must demonstrate a
“reasonable and good faith attempt” at an informal resolution of each issue
presented. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) “In lieu of
a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(3).)
A motion to compel further responses to a demand for
inspection or production of documents must “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) If the moving party has shown good cause for the
production of documents, the burden is on the objecting party to justify the
objections. (Kirkland v. Superior Court
(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) 
Notice
of the motion must be provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.310, subd. (c).)
“[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction. . . against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (h).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court for an order compelling Defendant
to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents, Set Two. Plaintiff also seeks a monetary sanction in the amount of
$2,500 pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 and
2023.300.
Merits

Code-compliant responses, without objections, within 20 days from the date of
