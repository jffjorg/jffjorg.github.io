Legal
Standard
 
            A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (CCP §§
430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate
facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim
against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie
(1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading,
or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen
(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations omitted.)
 
            A
special demurrer for uncertainty is disfavored and will only be sustained where
the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s
of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if
the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)

 
            “Liberality in permitting amendment
is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to
show in what manner plaintiff can amend the complaint,
and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the
pleading. (Id.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendants Elavon, Inc. and U.S.
Bancorp demur to each cause of action alleged in Plaintiff Bazaar Chic, Inc.’s
complaint. The complaint alleges three causes of action for intentional
misrepresentation, concealment, and negligent misrepresentation.
 
Each of the causes of action is a
species of fraud. The elements of fraud are: “(a) misrepresentation (false
representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or
‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable
reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145
Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) Intentional misrepresentation requires the defendant to
represent a material fact as true when it is actually false and the defendant
knew the representation was false when the defendant made it, or the defendant
made the representation recklessly and without regard for its truth. (Manderville
v. PCG & S Group, Inc. (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1486, 1498.) To allege a
cause of action for concealment, plaintiff must allege that defendant was under
a legal duty to disclose the material facts, such as through a fiduciary
relationship between the parties or defendant’s exclusive knowledge of material
facts. (OCM Principal Opportunities Fund v. CIBC World Markets Corp.
(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 835, 845.) Negligent misrepresentation requires the
defendant to make false statements believing them to be true, but without
reasonable ground for such belief. (Bily v. Arthur Young & Co.
(1992) 3 Cal.4th 370, 407.)
 
In California, fraud, including
negligent misrepresentation, must be pled with specificity. (Small v. Fritz
Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) “The particularity demands
that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of America
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)  
 
Plaintiff’s complaint makes the following allegations in support of their
fraud causes of action. On June 18, 2022, a customer purchased three
watches from Plaintiff, each a separate transaction, totaling $77,500,
comprising a Rolex Datejust II S/G w/ Black Dial Ref. 126333, Serial # 9X7625Q2
for $14,500, a Rolex Datejust II SS Ref. 116334, Serial # V799281 for $13,000;
and a Rolex President II 18KYG, Black Dial Ref. 218238, Serial #M946410 for
$50,000. The customer provided an American Express credit card with an EMV
chip. (¶ 14.) On June 21, 2022, Plaintiff received an email from Helen R.
Helton, Fraud Operations Analyst of Bancorp d.b.a. U.S. Bank advising Plaintiff
about potential fraud and requesting more details about the three transactions.
(¶ 16, Ex. C.) Plaintiff reached out to its contact at Bancorp, Ms. Jung Kang,
forwarding her Ms. Helton’s message. (¶ 17.) In response, Ms. Kang instructed
Plaintiff to provide the requested details. (Id.) On June 28, 2022, Ms. Kang
requested that Plaintiff conduct a chargeback and refund the funds to the
cardholder. (¶18.) According to Ms. Kang, if Plaintiff disputed the chargeback
request, it would lose its “good standing” with Defendant Elavon and would be
unable to process credit cards until such time as the matter is resolved. Once
the chargeback was completed, the funds would no longer be “on hold in the
cloud,” but rather released to American Express. American Express would then be
able to process a refund of the funds to Plaintiff. (Id.) Plaintiff twice confirmed
with Ms. Kang that once the chargeback was processed, she would be reimbursed
for the purchase price of the three watches, i.e., $77,500. (Id.) In reliance
on this assurance, on June 28, 2022, Plaintiff processed the chargeback. (¶
19.)
 
Despite the chargeback, the funds
for the three watches did not follow. (Compl., ¶ 20.) On July 6, 2022, Ms.
Helton wrote to Plaintiff: “You avoided the Chargeback/dispute fees by issuing
the credit and this keeps your account in compliance and allow you to keep
being able to process credit cards. […] As for now, we are (…) waiting on Amex
to do anything if they decide they are going to pursue the transaction details
further. I know this is not the news you want to hear but at least you are
still able to take other sales and continue the processing relationship with
Elavon.” (¶ 21.) To date, Plaintiff still has not been reimbursed by American
Express. (¶¶ 21-24.)
 
As set forth in the complaint, Defendants
misrepresented to Plaintiff that it would benefit from consenting to the
chargeback of the three fraudulent transactions because this would (a) avoid a
chargeback dispute fee; (b) Plaintiff would remain in “good standing” and be
able to use Elavon for credit card processing; and (c) the return of the funds
to Plaintiff. (Compl., ¶ 25.) However, by consenting to the chargeback,
Plaintiff lost the ability to secure the funds. (Id.) Defendants were motivated
to conceal the above facts from Plaintiff because they wanted to (a) avoid the
hassle of a chargeback dispute and investigation; (b) avoid the embarrassment
from three separate fraudulent transactions being approved by the Elavon credit
card processing system; and (c) continue to gain the percentage fees earned by
Elavon through processing Plaintiff’s transactions. (¶ 26.) 
 
The first cause of action for
intentional misrepresentation alleges that Defendant represented to Plaintiff
that a chargeback would be beneficial to Plaintiff and allow it to receive the
funds for the three transactions. (Compl., ¶ 29.) “Specifically, Defendants
stated that once Plaintiff processed the chargeback, the funds would be
released to American Express, and it would receive a reimbursement of the funds
from American Express.” (Id.) This representation was false. (¶ 30.)  Plaintiff reasonably relied on this
representation. (¶ 31.) Each other cause of action echoes these allegations.
(See Compl., ¶¶ 35-52.) 
 
Defendants argue that the above
allegations fail to allege an actionable misrepresentation of past or existing facts.
Carefully examining the allegations, the Court concurs that Plaintiff only
alleges non-actionable opinions of future conduct by third parties or
representations of value rather than actionable misrepresentations. Generally,
expressions of opinion are not treated as representations of fact, and thus are
not grounds for a misrepresentation cause of action. (See Neu-Visions Sports
v. Soren (2000) 86 Cal.App.4th 303, 308 [representations of value are
opinions]; see also Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th
471, 481 [a promise of future conduct is actionable if it is made without a
present intent to perform].) Statements about the future are opinions or
predictions, not statements of fact, and are not actionable. (Cohen v. S
& S Const. Co. (1983) 151 Cal.App.3d 941, 946.) To be actionable, a
misrepresentation must ordinarily be as to past or existing material facts. (Tarmann
v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153,
158.) Simply put, statements as to future actions do not constitute actionable
fraud. (Id.) 
 
Opinions may be treated as
statements of material facts under certain scenarios. (Cohen, supra, 151
Cal.App.3d at 946.) For instance, where a party affirms a prediction as to
future events as an existing material fact, such as where a party implies
knowledge of facts that make the prediction probable, the otherwise
non-actionable opinion becomes actionable. (Cicone v. URS Corp. (1986)
183 Cal.App.3d 194, 202-203.) A speaker's opinions are actionable where the
speaker holds himself or herself out as having superior knowledge or expertise,
such in the case of a fiduciary agent or healthcare professional. (Nelson v. Gaunt (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 623, 636.) Whether
a statement is nonactionable opinion or actionable misrepresentation of fact
requires a factual determination generally beyond the scope of a demurrer. (Furla
v. Jon Douglas Co. (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1069, 1081.)
 
The complaint alleges that
Defendants, through Ms. Kang, caused Plaintiff to believe that if it agreed to
the chargeback request, American Express would ultimately pay the $77,500. (Compl.,
¶ 22.) Critically, Ms. Kang made three alleged representations regarding the
chargeback: a) if Plaintiff disputed the chargeback request, Plaintiff would
lose its “good standing” and would be unable to process credit cards until the
matter was resolved; b) the funds would be released to American Express and
American Express would then “be able to process a refund of the funds to
Plaintiff;” and c) Ms. Kang “reassured” Plaintiff that she would be reimbursed
for the chargeback amount. These allegations demonstrates that Plaintiff relied
on Kang’s predictions about how American Express, an alleged third
party, would process Plaintiff's refund request.
 
The first representation is not
alleged to be false – Plaintiff does not allege that it lost its good standing
or that it has been unable to process other transactions through Elavon. The
second representation is merely Ms. Kang’s prediction about what American
Express would do in the future – specifically that American Express would “be
able” to process the refund. As such, as a matter of law, these representations
are non-actionable opinions/predictions. 
 
As to the third representation, Plaintiff
vaguely alleges that Ms. Kang “reassured” Plaintiff that it would be
reimbursed. On its face, this would not meet the heightened pleading standard
of fraud. Further, as currently pled, this representation would still be a
prediction/opinion of what American Express would do in the future. Plaintiff
does not allege that Ms. Kang expressed or implied she had any special or
superior knowledge about American Express’s refunding process or policy. There
is no allegation that Defendants had any control or knowledge of what American
Express would do once the chargeback occurred. Plaintiff alleges that it had
inferior sophistication in credit card matters such as these, and reasonably
relied on Defendants’ guidance as a larger bank in the context of an extended
business relationship. (Compl., ¶ 38.) However, the alleged arms-length relationship
between a vendor and a credit card processor would not show any special
circumstances or fiduciary duty between the parties, such that Ms. Kang’s
opinion would be actionable opinions. (See Hasso v. Hapke (2014) 227
Cal.App.4th 107, 140 [before a person can be charged with a fiduciary
obligation, he must either knowingly undertake to act on behalf and for the
benefit of another, or must enter into a relationship which imposes that
undertaking as a matter of law].) Therefore, further facts are required before
the above-discussed representations could be considered anything but opinions
of future conduct. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is
SUSTAINED with 10 days leave to amend.
