```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, James Dutton, has moved for terminating sanctions against the defendant, Robert Ouriel, alleging that Ouriel has failed to comply with discovery requests and has engaged in a pattern of discovery misuse. The court has previously imposed monetary sanctions on Ouriel for his failure to respond to discovery requests. However, the court finds that Ouriel has since served substantially compliant responses to the discovery requests, and that the plaintiff has not moved to compel further responses or for any other relief related to the discovery requests. As a result, the court cannot conclude that there is any willful disobedience of a court order related to discovery that would require additional sanctions let alone terminating sanctions. Therefore, the motion is denied.
