for Terminating Sanctions

Legal
Standard
 
If a party fails to obey a court
order compelling it to provide a discovery response, “the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction . . . In lieu of or in addition to
this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction . . ..” (CCP §§
2030.290(c), 2030.300(e), 2031.300(c), 2031.320(c).) Misuse of the discovery
process, which includes disobeying a court order to provide discovery, is
conduct subject to sanctions. (CCP § 2023.010(g).) Possible sanctions are:
 
(a) [A] monetary
sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process,
or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct….
 
(b) [A]n issue
sanction ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in
the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the
misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by
an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.
 
(c) [A]n evidence
sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence.
 
(d) [A] terminating
sanction by one of the following orders:
 
(1) An order
striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in
the misuse of the discovery process.
 
(2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed.
 
(3) An order
dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party.
 
(4) An order
rendering a judgment by default against that party.
 
(e) [A] contempt
sanction by an order treating the misuse of the discovery process as a
contempt of court.
 
(CCP § 2023.030 [emphasis added].)
 
The party seeking to impose
sanctions need only show the failure to obey earlier discovery orders. (Puritan
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 877, 884 [interpreting
former statute dealing with “refusal” to comply].) However, numerous cases hold
that severe sanctions (i.e., terminating or evidentiary sanctions) for failure
to comply with a court order are allowed only where the failure was willful.
(See R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 486, 495; Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525,
1545; Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) The
burden of proof then shifts to the party seeking to avoid sanctions to
establish a satisfactory excuse for his or her conduct. (Corns v. Miller
(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 195, 201; Williams v. Russ (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1215, 1227.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff James Dutton moves for
terminating sanctions against Defendant Robert Ouriel, and requests that the
Court strike his Answer to Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint (FAC) and enter
this default on the grounds that Ouriel has continued a pattern of discovery
misuse.
 
Plaintiff moves against Ouriel for
his pattern of discovery misuse and, more specifically, because he has failed
to fully respond to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admission (RFA), set 2.
Counsel for Plaintiff details this pattern, including the
extreme difficulties that counsel underwent to secure discovery in this action.
For instance, Ouriel failed to respond at all to 7 sets of discovery. (Staub
Decl., ¶¶ 28-37 & 120-121.) Plaintiff had to bring 5 motions to compel, and
2 motions for sanctions (Staub Decl., ¶¶ 38, 42, 69, 80 & 88 [Motions to
compel] & ¶¶ 51 & 69 [Sanctions motions].). Plaintiff asserts that Ouriel
continues to ignore discovery by failing to respond to the RFAs and the related
form interrogatories. (Staub Decl. ¶¶ 120-121.). 
 
On May 10, 2022, Plaintiff served RFA,
set 2, and form interrogatories, set two. (Staub Decl., ¶¶ 122-123.) After not
receiving responses, Plaintiff moved to deem matters admitted on as to the RFAs.
In response to that motion, on August 25, 2023, Ouriel served substantially
compliant responses prior to the hearing on the matter. Thus, the Court
determined that the motion was moot and issued monetary sanctions against
Ouriel.
 
At most, Plaintiff has demonstrated
Ouriel’s discovery abuse, which resulted in monetary sanctions. Plaintiff does
not substantiate the claim that Ouriel is still not in compliance with any
specified discovery. For instance, Plaintiff has not explained whether Ouriel’s
responses to the RFA, set two, were acceptable. Notably, Plaintiff has not
moved to compel further responses or for any other relief related to the
subject RFAs and the corresponding form interrogatories. Therefore, the court
cannot conclude that there is any willful disobedience of a court order related
to discovery that would require additional sanctions let alone terminating
sanctions. Plaintiff also does not show that Ouriel’s failure to pay sanctions
requires the Court to issue terminating sanctions against Ouriel.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
