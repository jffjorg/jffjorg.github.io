And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff alleges childhood sexual abuse at Edison Middle School in 1984 and seeks damages against LAUSD. The court grants LAUSD's request for judicial notice of legislative history and denies the plaintiff's request for judicial notice regarding other trial court rulings.

The court holds that the plaintiff's complaint adequately pleads the claims and that LAUSD's demurrer is without merit. The court concludes that Section 340.1, which allows revival of lapsed claims, is constitutional and that the Legislature's enactment of AB 218 did not create liability for a tort where none previously existed. The court also holds that the plaintiff's claims are timely under the statute of limitations.

The demurrer is overruled, and LAUSD has 20 days to answer the complaint.
