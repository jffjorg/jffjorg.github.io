And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the petition to confirm the arbitration award, as prayed. The petition is based on an arbitration award made on August 2, 2021, which found that the Statute of Limitations had expired. The arbitrator dismissed the Claimant's case, finding no evidence of discrimination or harassment. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal, but no opposition was filed to the petition. The appellate opinion in case number B318125 resolved the overlapping issues against the plaintiffs. The court is required to enter judgment in conformity with the award, as stated in Valsan Partners Ltd. Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility (1994).
