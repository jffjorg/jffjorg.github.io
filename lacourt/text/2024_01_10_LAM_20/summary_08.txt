And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

On August 18, 2023, Stephanie Navarrete, as the plaintiff, filed a complaint alleging various claims against the defendants, including violation of Civil Code § 1942.4, tortious breach of warranty of habitability, and others. A notice of related cases was also filed, which pertains to cases involving the same property and landlord, but with habitability claims by other tenants. The court has reviewed the notice of related cases and has determined that the benefits of relating the cases are not apparent for these types of cases. Therefore, the court has decided not to relate the subject cases. The defendants are hereby given notice of this decision.
