Complaint.  On 9/29/23, Plaintiffs filed

is scheduled to be heard on 3/5/24.  On
1/31/24, Defendants filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendants’ objection 1 to the entire opposition is
overruled.  The objection is overbroad as
it includes the authority relied on by Plaintiffs, etc. which does not
constitute hearsay.  
 
Defendants’ objections 2-10 are sustained.
In ruling on a special motion to strike under CCP 425.16,
the Court must engage in a two-step analysis. 
First, the Court must determine whether the defendant(s) has shown that
the challenged cause(s) of action arises from protected activity.  CCP 425.16(b)(1).  If the defendant meets this initial burden,
the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish a probability of prevailing on
the claim(s).  Id.; Navellier
(2002) 29 C4th 82, 88.  
 
Under the first prong, protected activity means an “‘act
in furtherance of a person's right of petition or free speech under the United
States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue’ [which] includes:
(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,
executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized
by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an
issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial
body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or
oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum
in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance
of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional
right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public
interest.”  CCP 425.16(e).   
 
For plaintiffs to meet their burden under the second
prong, they must establish, through admissible evidence, that the complaint is
legally sufficient and supported by sufficient prima facie facts to support a
judgment in favor of plaintiffs.  See
Navellier, supra at 88-89; Optional Capital, Inc. (2017)
18 CA5th 95, 112.  A plaintiff may not be
granted leave to amend when a special motion to strike is granted.  Simmons (2001) 92 CA4th 1068,
1073-1074.
 
Here, Plaintiffs’ 1st,
2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th,
9th, 10th and 14th causes of action are
based on Defendants’ prosecution of an unlawful detainer action against
Plaintiffs.  (See FAC ¶¶58a-61,
67, 74, 76, 86, 104-110, 112-115, 117-118, 123, 143).  Prosecution of an unlawful detainer action is
protected activity.  CCP 425.16(e); Wallace
(2011) 196 CA4th 1169, 1182-1183 (disapproved on other grounds in Baral
(2016) 1 C5th 375, 386).
 
Communications with the police and an investigative
agency are the acts which underlie Plaintiffs’ 3rd, 7th,
9th, 14th and 15th causes of action.  (FAC ¶¶73, 90, 113, 144, 149, 154).  Such communications are also protected acts
under CCP 425.16.  Wallace, supra
at 1186.  Similarly, the acts in the 7th
and 15th causes of action are communications in connection with an
ongoing dispute and in anticipation of litigation.  (FAC ¶¶90, 92, 97-102, 149 (the second
149).  These communications are also
protected.  Wallace, supra
at 1194.  
 
Plaintiffs also incorporate all of the protected activity
into the 13th, 16th, 18th, 19th and
20th causes of action.  (See
FAC ¶¶136-137, 156-158, 166, 168, 170-171).
 
The fact that some of the foregoing causes of action may
also include unprotected activity does not save the claim from being stricken
under CCP 425.16.  Claims that mix
protected and unprotected activity are subject to a special motion to strike
under CCP 425.16 if at least one of the underlying acts is protected
conduct.  See Wallace, supra
at 1187.
 
The opposition to the instant motion also focuses on
Defendants’ conduct related to the unlawful detainer proceeding.
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants have satisfied their
burden under the first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis.
 
Plaintiffs have not met their burden under the second
prong of establishing a probability of prevailing on the challenged causes of
action.  
 
As noted above, Plaintiffs’ 1st, 2nd,
3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th,
10th and 14th causes of action all complain about
Defendants’ prosecution of the unlawful detainer action which is privileged
conduct under Civil Code 47.  See Wallace,
supra; Feldman (2008) 160 CA4th 1467, 1486.  Similarly, the communications with police
and/or a government agency complained about in Plaintiffs’ 3rd, 7th,
9th, 14th and 15th causes of action are
absolutely privileged under Civil Code 47. 
See Chabak (2007) 154 CA4th 1502, 1514; Civil Code
47(b).  The communications in
anticipation of and in connection with ongoing litigation which are included in
the 7th and 15th causes of action are also covered by the
privilege set forth in Civil Code 47 which is not limited to verbal
communications.  See Silberg
(1990) 50 C3d 205, 212; Kimmel (1990) 51 C3d 202, 209; Feldman
(2008) 160 CA4th 1467, 1468; (FAC ¶31).  The
13th, 16th, 18th, 19th and 20th
causes of action incorporate the privileged activity alleged in the other
claims.  (FAC ¶¶136-137, 156-158, 166
,168, 170-171).  Further, certain of the
causes of action (i.e., the 15th cause of action for oppression, 16th
cause of action for malice, 18th cause of action for punitive
damages and 19th cause of action for treble damages) are not
recognized causes of action.  As such,
Plaintiffs cannot establish a probability of prevailing on such claims.  
 
Plaintiffs’ argument that the litigation privilege is
somehow preempted by the Department of Veterans Affairs Supportive Services for
Veteran Families Program Act is without merit. 
Plaintiffs have failed to identify any conflict to support their
preemption argument.  Rather, it appears
that Plaintiffs are attempting to relitigate the unlawful detainer action in
their First Amended Complaint filed in this action. Similarly, Plaintiffs have
not provided any evidence to support their due process argument.  Nor have Plaintiffs provided any valid
argument or evidence to establish that the challenged claims are not barred by
the litigation privilege set forth in Civil Code 47.
 
A prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike is
entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.  CCP 425.16(c)(1); Ketchum (2001) 24
C4th 1122, 1131.  A prevailing party on a
special motion to strike may request fees in the motion itself; make a separate
noticed motion for fees after the ruling on the special motion to strike or
include the fee request in the memorandum of costs after entry of
judgment.  See American Humane
Association (2001) 92 CA4th 1095, 1103; Carpenter (2007) 151 CA4th
454, 461; Catlin Insurance Company, Inc. (2022) 73 CA5th 764, 773.
 
Defendants are entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees as
the prevailing party on this motion.  CCP
425.16(c)(1).  However, Defendants have
not provided any information from which the Court can determine a proper fee
award (number of hours spent on the motion, hourly rate – i.e., lodestar).  As such, Defendants’ request for an award of
attorneys’ fees is denied without prejudice to Defendants making a subsequent
noticed motion for such fees or including the request the memorandum of costs
after entry of judgment.    
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
