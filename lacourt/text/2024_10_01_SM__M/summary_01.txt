Statutes:
- California Civil Code
- California Code of Civil Procedure
- California Rules of Court
- Civil Code section 3334
Roles:
- Judge: determines whether the Cross-Complaint states a cause of action and whether the statute of limitations bars the instant claims
- Plaintiff: Fusco, et al.
- Defendant: Crowley, et al.
Significant Statements:
- The Judge overrules Cross-Defendants' demurrer.
- The nuisance is continuing in nature, and the statute of limitations would therefore not bar the instant claims.
- Cross-Defendants' argument that the nuisance has been abated is not supported by the facts alleged in the cross-complaint.
- The cross-complaint alleges that Cross-Defendants are "trespassing onto the Crowley-Summers Property to connect into the drainage system on the Crowley-Summers Property without authorization," and in so doing, are "continuing to commit a nuisance subject to abatement."
