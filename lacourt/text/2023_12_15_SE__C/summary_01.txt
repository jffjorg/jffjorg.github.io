And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The City of South Gate has applied for the appointment of a receiver to take control of a property located at 10325 California Avenue, South Gate, California. The property was originally zoned for commercial use but has been converted to residential use, with unpermitted construction and conversions. The city alleges that the property poses significant health and safety risks to its occupants and the public, including unpermitted plumbing and electrical wiring, unsanitary conditions, and the risk of collapse. All respondents have defaulted, and the court has granted the city's ex parte application for a receiver.
