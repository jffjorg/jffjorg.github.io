  Case Number:  23NWCP00337    Hearing Date:   December 15, 2023    Dept:  C City of South Gate vs Benjamin Delacruz, et al.,
23NWCP00337
 
Petitioner City of South Gate (“The City”) applies ex parte
for appointment of a receiver pursuant to Health and Safety Code section
17980.7. over the real property located at 10325 California Avenue, South Gate,
California 90280, Assessor Parcel Number 6208-022-038 (“Subject
Property”).  
 
The Petition filed August 14, 2023 alleges the Subject
Property, originally zoned for primarily commercial uses, has been unlawfully
converted and impermissibly used as a residential property, with the two
permitted structures (commercial and garage) converted into several dwelling
units, and additional structures constructed and rented to unsuspecting
tenants. (Petition, para. 13.) The substandard conditions and hazards posed by
the Subject Property include extensive unpermitted construction placing the integrity
of the structure at risk of possible collapse; unpermitted plumbing and
unpermitted sewer connections have not been done in a safe manner that avoids
leaks, floods, resulting mold, or sewage seepage; unpermitted constructions and
conversions of dwellings lack required certificates of occupancy certifying
their safety for use for that purpose; unpermitted electrical wiring
alterations pose a significant risk of electrical shock and increases the risk
of a fire starting, and places the lives and property of the occupants and
public in danger; the lack of adequate bathrooms and kitchens is unsanitary and
a health risk to the vulnerable tenants of the Subject Property. (Id.,
para. 14.) 
 
All respondents have defaulted.  
 
Accordingly, the City’s ex parte application for a receiver
is GRANTED as set forth more fully in the Order Appointing a Receiver filed on
today’s date.
 
Moving Party to give notice.
