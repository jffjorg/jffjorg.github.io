ANALYSIS: 
 
On September 28, 2023, Plaintiff
Daniel Lupa-Chazan, (“Plaintiff”), in pro se, filed this action for motor
vehicle negligence and general negligence against Defendants Alicia Garcia and
Sergio Garcia (“Defendants”). Following Defendants’ Motion to Strike, Plaintiff
filed a First Amended Complaint on March 11, 2024. Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Continue Trial on May 23, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
“Although continuances of
trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its
own merits. The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd.
(c).) The Court may look to the following factors in determining whether a
trial continuance is warranted: (1) proximity of the trial date; (2) whether
there was any previous continuance of trial due to any party; (3) the length of
the continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address
the problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or
witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (6) whether trial
counsel is engaged in another trial. 
(See generally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd. (d)(1)-(11).)
Additionally, factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s excused
inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence
despite diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance;
and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the
motion or application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subds. (c), (d).)
 
Plaintiff requests a continuance of the March 27, 2025 trial
date due to an overseas work trip scheduled for March 23, 2025. (Motion,
Chazan-Lupa Decl., ¶1.) Plaintiff met and
conferred regarding the trial continuance, to which defense counsel indicated
no objection. (Id. at ¶2 and Exh. 1.) These circumstances are reasonable
grounds to continue the trial date. The request is being made long before the
initial trial date, no other continuances have been sought, and there is no
prejudice to any other party. Therefore, the factors of Rule 3.1332 support the
requested trial continuance.

Plaintiff Daniel
Lupa-Chazan’s Motion to Continue the Trial Date is GRANTED. TRIAL IS CONTINUED
TO APRIL 7, 2025 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
