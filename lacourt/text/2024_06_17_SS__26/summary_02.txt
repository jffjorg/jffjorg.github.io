And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Petitioners, Zshonette Reed, Esq. and Law Offices of Lorden & Reed, have filed a Motion to Stay Enforcement of Judgment. The Court has considered the arguments presented by both parties and has concluded that the Court does not have the authority to stay enforcement of the judgment. The Court has determined that the Petitioners and Respondent Gudis are not in an adversarial posture in the federal action, and therefore, the Court's discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 918.5 does not apply. The Court's ruling is based on the express language of the statute, which requires that the parties be in an adversarial posture in the pending action. As a result, the Petitioners' Motion to Stay Enforcement of Judgment is DENIED.
