ANALYSIS: 
            
On April 26, 2022, Petitioners
Zshonette Reed, Esq. and Law Offices of Lorden & Reed (“Petitioners”) filed
the instant Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award against Respondents Erina
Gilerman (“Respondent Gilerman”) and Alexander Gudis (“Respondent Gudis”).
Respondents filed an opposition on June 1, 2022, then filed an Amended Petition
to Confirm Arbitration Award and Opposition to Vacate the Award on August 15,
2022. On February 9, 2023, the Court entered judgment in favor of Respondents
confirming the arbitration award. (Judgment, 02/09/23.) The judgment provided
that costs are to be awarded per memorandum of costs and attorney’s fees are to
be awarded per noticed motion. On June 15, 2023, the Court granted Respondents’
motion for attorney’s fees and costs. (Minute Order, 06/14/23.)
 
On April 2, 2024, Petitioners
filed the instant Motion to Stay Enforcement of Judgment. Respondent Gilerman
filed an opposition on May 31, 2024 and Petitioners replied on June 11, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
The instant
Motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 918.5, which
states: “The trial court may, in its discretion, stay the enforcement of a
judgment or order if the judgment debtor has another action pending on a
disputed claim against the judgment creditor.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 918.5, subd.
(a).) Petitioners point to the federal action United States v. Alexander
Gudis, Case No. 3:99-CR-019-13 (N.D. Tex.), in which a judgment of
$8,717,912.01 was issued against Respondent Gudis. (Motion, Reed Decl., ¶¶4-6.)
Petitioners were contacted by the Assistant United States Attorney in the
federal action with a garnishment order and instructed to file an answer of
garnishee. (Id. at ¶6 and Exh. A.) 
 
Respondent
Gilerman argues that the express language of section 918.5 does not apply to
the circumstances of this case because the federal action was not brought by
Respondent Gudis against Petitioners. In reply, Petitioners contend the section
should apply because they are parties to the garnishment proceedings and the
amount of the federal judgment far exceeds the judgment in this action. The Court
agrees that by its express language, section 918.5 does not apply to the facts
of this case. That statute was written to stay enforcement where there is
another pending action between the same parties based on a claim by the
defendant against the plaintiff. Petitioners and Respondent Gudis are not in an
adversarial posture in the federal action. Instead, it is that the federal
government appears to make a claim to the funds in Petitioners’ possession to
which Respondents are entitled pursuant to the judgment in this court.
Therefore, it does not appear that the Court has the authority to stay
enforcement of the judgment in this action under Code of Civil Procedure
section 918.5. 
 
The writ of garnishment
issued in the federal case states in relevant part:
 
You must retain any
nonexempt property in your possession until further order of the court, and you
can be held responsible for failure to withhold such property in accordance
with the law (a list of the property exempt from garnishment is provided in the
enclosed Clerk’s Notice). To assist in identification of property for
withholding and disclosure, the defendant judgment debtor’s SSN is ***-**-1423
and birth year is 1957. 
 
Please withhold all
nonexempt property until further notice, but do not disburse the withholdings
to anyone until you receive a court order to do so. You will be notified when a
final order of garnishment is entered. 
 
(Motion, Reed
Decl., Exh. A, p. 1.) Attached to the writ of garnishment is the federal
government’s ex parte application for the same, which explains that “Upon entry
of judgment, a federal tax-type lien arose against all of the defendant’s
property and rights to property. See 18 U.S.C. § 3613(c); United States v.
Loftis, 607 F.3d 173, 179 n.7 (5th Cir. 2010).” (Id. at Exh. A, p. 9 at
¶6.) The Motion, however, does not provide authority regarding enforcing the
writ of garnishment obtained by the federal government in a state court action.

 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, Petitioners Zshonette Reed, Esq. and Law Offices of Lorden &
Reed’s Motion to Stay Enforcement of Judgment is DENIED.
 
 
Court
clerk to give notice.
