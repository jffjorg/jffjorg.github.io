ANALYSIS:
 
On September 22, 2022, Plaintiff
Philip P. DeLuca, Esq. filed the instant action against Defendant Melissa
Guerra (“Defendant”) seeking a trial after attorney-client arbitration. When the
action came for trial on March 21, 2024, Plaintiff failed to appear and the
Court dismissed the action without prejudice. (Minute Order, 03/21/24.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Vacate Dismissal on March 29, 2024. No opposition to the Motion has been filed
to date, nor has proof of service of the Summons and Complaint been
filed.  
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute, an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving
party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,
143.) When based on attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default
judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be
granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the
provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have
been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
The motion was timely filed less
than one month after dismissal of the action and is supported by an attorney
affidavit of fault. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that they inadvertently failed
to appear for trial. (Motion, DeLuca Decl., ¶¶2-3.) Therefore, the case must be
reinstated under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
