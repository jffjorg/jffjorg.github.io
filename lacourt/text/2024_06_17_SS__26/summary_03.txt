And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the lawsuit. The lawsuit was dismissed on March 21, 2024, after the plaintiff failed to appear for trial. The plaintiff has now filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, citing attorney fault for the failure to appear. The motion is timely and supported by an affidavit of fault from the plaintiff's counsel. The judge has therefore reinstated the lawsuit and set an order to show cause for July 22, 2024, to address the plaintiff's failure to file proof of service of the summons and complaint.
