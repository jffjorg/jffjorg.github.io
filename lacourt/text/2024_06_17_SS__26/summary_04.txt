Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, including proximity to the original trial date, previous continuances, length of the requested continuance, and potential prejudice to parties or witnesses. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's request for a continuance is reasonable, due to an overseas work trip scheduled for March 27, 2025.
