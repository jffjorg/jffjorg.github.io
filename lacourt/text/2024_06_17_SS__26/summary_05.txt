Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules that the Defendant's motion to vacate the entry of default is granted, but only if the Defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the hearing date. The Defendant's motion is supported by a declaration of fault, which demonstrates excusable neglect in allowing her cousin to handle the matter. The Defendant's cousin was hospitalized before contacting the Plaintiff's counsel, and the Defendant promptly retained counsel after realizing the default had been entered. The Defendant's motion is granted on the condition that a copy of the proposed responsive pleading is submitted to the court by the hearing date and served on the Plaintiff within 20 days.
