And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Peter Alexan Enterprises Inc. v. Jara Blash. The plaintiff, Peter Alexan Enterprises Inc., has moved to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production from the defendant, Jara Blash. The defendant has objected to these discovery requests, arguing that they are not reasonably calculated to lead to discoverable information.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production. The judge has ruled that the requested information is not relevant to the subject matter of the pending action and that the discovery requests are not reasonably calculated to lead to discoverable information.

The judge has also ruled that the defendant's objections to the discovery requests are sustained, and that the plaintiff's arguments that the requested information is relevant to settlement and to potential claims against non-parties are without merit. The judge has declined to address the merits of the defendant's objections to the discovery requests.

The plaintiff has also argued that the discovery requests are relevant to a potential motion to disqualify the defendant's counsel, but the judge has ruled that this is not a relevant issue in this case.
