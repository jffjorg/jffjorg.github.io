And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court's tentative ruling denies all eight motions brought by plaintiff Michael Morris-Nussbaum, including motions to compel discovery responses and deem matters admitted. The motions are defective due to untimeliness and failure to include separate statements. Sanctions are imposed on the plaintiff and his counsel, Adina A. Ostoia, in the amount of $280.15 to $880.15, respectively, for the unsuccessful motions. The Court finds that the plaintiff did not act with substantial justification and that sanctions are just under the circumstances. The plaintiff and his counsel are jointly and severally liable for all sanctions.
