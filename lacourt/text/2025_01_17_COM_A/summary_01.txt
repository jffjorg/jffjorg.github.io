And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to Plaintiff Mahan Khatibi's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production, Set One, from Defendant American Honda Motor Company, Inc. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to provide adequate responses to the requests and seeks further responses to specific requests. The Judge grants the motion in part, compelling further responses to certain requests, but limits the scope of the responses and the definition of "DOCUMENTS" to exclude a search of internal emails and limits the scope of one request to only include documents concerning vehicles of the same make, model, and year as the Vehicle. The Judge also denies the motion as to certain requests, finding that the Defendant adequately responded to them. The ruling is subject to change at the January 17, 2025 hearing.
