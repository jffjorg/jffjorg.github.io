COMPLAINT
  FILED: 04/12/2024
TRIAL:
  12/01/2025
 



MOVING PARTY:              Plaintiff
Mahan Khatibi
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant
American Honda Motor Company, Inc.
1.    
Background
This is a lemon law action. Plaintiff Mahan Khatibi
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that, on March 15, 2-23, he purchased a 2013 Honda Accord
with the Vehicle Identification Number 1HGCY2F62PA008538 (the “Vehicle”) that
was manufactured and/or distributed by defendant American Honda Motor Company,
Inc. (“Defendant”). Plaintiff alleges that the Vehicle contained or developed
defects that substantially impaired its use, safety, or value.
On August 6,
2024, Plaintiff propounded Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, onto
Defendant. Defendant served responses onto Plaintiff on September 16, 2024.
Plaintiff sent Defendant meet-and-confer letters detailing deficiencies in the
responses on September 17, 2024; September 24, 2024; October 3, 2024; and
October 11, 2024, none of which Defendant responded to. On October 18, 2024,
Defendant informed Plaintiff that it did not intend to serve supplemental
responses. Plaintiff subsequently filed the instant motion on November 5, 2024.
2.    
Discussion

Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, on the grounds that Defendant
has failed to provide adequate responses. Plaintiff seeks further responses to
RFP Nos. 16-21, 59-61, and 63-64.
Any party may
obtain any discovery of information, documents, land, property or
electronically stored information so long as the discoverable matter is not
privileged, is relevant to the subject matter and can lead one to admissible
evidence. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) 
“On receipt of
a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that … [a] statement of compliance with the demand
is incomplete[;] … [a] representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive[; or] … [a]n objection in the response is without merit
or too general.”¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (a).) Such a motion shall
be filed given 45 days of service of the verified response or any supplemental
verified response. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (c).)
“The court
may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative
from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 473, subd. (b).)
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on November 5, 2024, 49 days after service of the verified
response for which Plaintiff seeks to compel further response. Plaintiff
requests relief from the time limit based on mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect, and contends that neither Defendant nor the court has been
prejudiced by the brief delay. The court will grant relief from the time limit
and hear the instant motion. 
After
consideration of the parties’ arguments and Defendant’s objections, the court
denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses as to requests 16, 18, 21,
59, 61, and 64. Defendant has adequately responded to each by stating that,
after a diligent search, Defendant was not able to find any responsive
documents and that no such documents have ever existed. The court grant’s
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses as to requests 17, 19, 20, 60,
and 63, but will limit the scope of the definition of “DOCUMENTS” to exclude a
search of internal emails in order to avoid placing an undue burden on
Defendant. Additionally, request 19 is overbroad, and the court will limit the
scope of request 19 to only include documents concerning vehicles of the same
make, model, and year as the Vehicle.
 
3.    
Conclusion

Based on the
foregoing, the court GRANTS in part Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses to Requests for Production, Set One.
 

Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
