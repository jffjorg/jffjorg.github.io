[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PETITION TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE OF
  PENDING ACTION




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 




            
Background
Plaintiff Freddy M., by and through his
guardian ad litem, Paola Mejia; Noe Reyes Lopez; and Paola Mejia (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed this action on November 16, 2018 against Defendants Joe
Oroñoz and Sarah Oroñoz. On February 13, 2019, Plaintiffs filed an amendment to
the Complaint naming PI
Properties No. 79, LLC (“PI Properties”) in place of “Doe 21.” 
Plaintiffs filed the operative Third
Amended Complaint (“TAC”) on June 26, 2020, alleging causes of action for (1) breach
of implied warranty of habitability, (2) tortious breach of implied warranty of
habitability, (3) negligence, (4) private nuisance, and (5) violation of Business and
Professions Code section 17200. This action concerns alleged uninhabitable
conditions at 6429 ½ S. Victoria Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90043 (the “Subject
Property”), where Plaintiffs resided. (TAC, ¶¶ 1, 16.) Plaintiffs allege, inter
alia, that deteriorated lead-based paint and other lead hazards at the
Subject Property resulted in Freddy M. contracting
lead poisoning and suffering permanent neurological, cognitive, and behavioral
harm. (TAC, ¶ 70.)
On June 29, 2020, PI
Properties filed a Cross-Complaint against a number of cross-defendants, alleging
causes of action for (1) declaratory relief, (2) implied equitable indemnity,
and (3) negligence.    
Plaintiffs have reached a settlement in this matter with PI Properties. Paola
Mejia as Petitioner for Claimant Freddy M. now petitions for the Court’s approval of
the settlement on behalf of the Claimant.  
            Discussion
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s claim can only be consummated
with court approval. (Prob. Code, § 3500.) “A petition for court approval of a compromise of, or a
covenant not to sue or enforce judgment, on a minor’s disputed claim; a
compromise or settlement of a pending action or proceeding to which a minor or
person with a disability is a party; or the disposition of the proceeds of a
judgment for a minor or person with a disability under Probate
Code sections 3500 and 3600-3613 or Code of Civil
Procedure section 372 must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition. Except as provided in rule 7.950.5, the petition must be submitted on a
completed Petition for Approval of
Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for
Minor or Person With a Disability (form MC-350).”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950, emphasis in original.)  
Here, the petition is prepared on form
MC-350 and is verified by Petitioner. The
Court finds that the settlement is reasonable. However, the Court notes
that Items 1(b) and 1(c) of the proposed order (form MC-351) are blank. In addition, the law firms listed in Item 8(a)(1) of the
proposed order are illegible. 
            Conclusion
Based
on the foregoing, the Court intends to grant the
petition and approve the compromise, subject to subject to Plaintiffs’
examination of Petitioner at the hearing, and subject to Petitioner
submitting a revised proposed order that corrects the defects identified above.
The proposed order shall be filed and served within five days of the date of
this Order. 
Petitioner is to
give notice of this Order.
