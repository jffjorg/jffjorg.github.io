And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the petition to approve the settlement of a minor's claim should be granted, subject to certain conditions. The settlement was reached between the plaintiffs, Freddy M. and others, and PI Properties No. 79, LLC, and alleges that the defendant's negligence caused Freddy M. to contract lead poisoning and suffer permanent harm. The court finds that the settlement is reasonable, but notes that certain defects in the proposed order must be corrected before it can be approved. Specifically, the court requires the petitioner to revise the proposed order to fill in blank spaces and to make the law firms listed legible. The court also orders that the proposed order be filed and served within five days of the date of this order, and that the petitioner give notice of this order.
