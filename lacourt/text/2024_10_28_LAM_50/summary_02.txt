And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Teresa A. Beaudet in a contempt proceeding against Defendant William Leys. The case is 20STCV47187. The plaintiff, David Mazor, commenced an action against Leys and another defendant for stalking. A judgment was entered on August 24, 2021, ordering Leys to take down a website and prohibiting him from posting certain information about Mazor and his family. Leys failed to comply with the judgment, and Mazor submitted evidence of his disobedience. The court granted Mazor's motion to show cause why Leys should not be held in contempt. The issue is whether Leys willfully failed to comply with the judgment. Leys disputes the evidence submitted by Mazor and requests a hearing to contest the contempt proceedings. The court denies Mazor's request to conclude the contempt proceedings without a hearing on the facts.
