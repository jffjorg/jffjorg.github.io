  ORDER RE:  
 
BRIEFING RE CONCLUSION OF CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS
 



 
Background
On December 9, 2020, Plaintiff David Mazor (“Plaintiff”)
commenced this action against Defendants William Leys (“Leys”) and Jose Ortiz (jointly,
“Defendants”) for stalking.  
On
August 24, 2021, Judgment was entered in this matter against Defendants,
jointly and severally, in the total amount of $1,000,855.00, plus post-judgment
interest.[1]
The August 24, 2021 Judgment also includes specified injunctive orders. 
On February 15, 2024, the Court issued a minute order in this action
providing, inter alia, that “[o]n or before 02/26/2024, plaintiff
may file and serve a brief of no more than 10 pages in support of plaintiff’s
claim that no trial is required based upon, inter alia, the ruling the motion
to dismiss [sic] and that sentencing only is required and attorney fees remain
as issues in the contempt proceeding. The Public Defender on behalf of Mr. Leys
may file a response, thereto of no more than 10 pages on or before 03/11/2024.
Any reply of up to 5 pages must be filed and served on or before 03/18/2024.” 
On July 19, 2024, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter alia, that “Defendant will serve via email his response to Plaintiff’s
brief regarding conclusion of contempt proceedings by August 9, 2024 (10 page
limit). Plaintiff will serve via email the reply thereto by August 23, 2024 (10
page Limit) No surreply.” On September 6, 2024, the Court issued another minute
order providing, inter alia, that “[t]he Court
requests and Defendant agrees to file and serve a response to the Plaintiff’s
reply papers filed August 23, 2024 with a courtesy copy delivered to Department
50. Defendant will address, inter alia, Penal Code 1043,
The subject of the Court’s order to restart the contempt trial and what is left
for the trial. Plaintiff’s [sic] requested and the Court grants their request
to respond thereto and that response will be filed and served on or before
October 11, 2024 with a courtesy copy delivered to Department 50. The hearing
thereon will be as follows: Status Conference is scheduled for 10/28/24...” 
On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “brief re conclusion of
contempt proceedings.” On August 9, 2024, Leys filed a “response to Plaintiff’s
motion re: conclusion of contempt proceedings.” On August 23, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a “reply re conclusion of contempt proceedings.” On September 20, 2024, Leys
filed a “sur-reply to Plaintiff’s response re: conclusion of contempt
proceedings.” On October 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “response to sur-reply re
conclusion of contempt proceedings.” 
Requests for Judicial Notice
The Court grants Plaintiff’s “request for judicial notice in support of
Plaintiff’s brief re conclusion of contempt proceedings” as to the specified
exhibits. The Court also grants Plaintiff’s “request for judicial notice in
support of Plaintiff’s reply re conclusion of contempt proceedings” as to the
specified exhibits.  
Discussion
In his brief filed February 26, 2024, Plaintiff states that he “submits
this brief…to show that all elements of contempt have been satisfied and that
the pending contempt proceedings…must, therefore, conclude at the
next-scheduled trial date with the entry of an order of contempt, the
imposition of punishment, and an award of attorneys’ fees and costs against
Defendant, William Leys…” (Plaintiff’s Brief at p. 1:19-23.) 
Plaintiff notes that on May 16, 2022, the Court issued an Order in this
action on Plaintiff’s motion for an order/osc re contempt against Leys. The May
16, 2022 Order noted that “[a]s a general
rule, the elements of contempt include (1) a valid order, (2) knowledge of the
order, (3) ability to comply with the order, and (4) willful failure to comply
with the order.” ((In
re Ivey (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 793, 798.) The
Court’s May 16, 2022 Order further provides as follows: 
 
“The
Court’s August 24, 2021 Judgment provides, inter alia, that ‘Defendants
are to immediately take down the website, WICRLeaks.com (‘Website’), and are
prohibited from hosting, updating, and otherwise permitting the Website to
remain up and running, being visible to any member of the public, and
continuing to render accessible the Website URL on search engines results by
any means at any time…’ The August 24, 2021 Judgment also provides that:  
 
‘Defendants
are hereby prohibited from present and future postings of Mazor’s name and
likeness, and the names and likenesses of Mazor’s immediate family, as defined
in Civil Code § 1708.7(a)(2)(A), WICR Waterproofing
and Construction, Inc. (‘WICR’), and the names, logo, and likenesses of
Lindborg & Mazor LLP, the name and logo of WICR (collectively, the ‘Protected
Persons’ and ‘Protected Material’) on any website, social media platform, or
any other method, and otherwise harassing, intimidating, molesting, attacking,
striking, stalking, threatening, assaulting, hitting, abusing, directly or
indirectly communicating, disturbing the peace of, and destroying, interfering
with, or otherwise damaging the personal property of the Protected Persons,
including Mazor’s business, by, inter alia, continuing to render
accessible any and all prior postings relating to the Protected Persons or the
Protected Material on search engines results by any means at any time…’
 
Plaintiff submits
evidence that the subject Website is up and running, openly visible to all
members of the public, and that Leys has been updating the Website after the
Judgment was entered. (Lindborg Decl., ¶ 3, Exs. 1-2.) Plaintiff provides
evidence that shortly after the Court entered its Judgment, Leys posted on the
Website that ‘[t]his website will not come down voluntarily on my part.’
(Lindborg Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 1.) Plaintiff also submits evidence that after the
Judgment was entered, Leys posted matter on another website that he owns and/or
controls, as well as on Twitter, concerning Plaintiff and his business.
(Lindborg Decl., ¶ 3, Exs. 3,
4.) 
 
In
his ‘reply/answer’ to the instant motion, Leys does not dispute the foregoing
evidence submitted by Plaintiff. Rather, he argues that ‘[t]he Declaration of David Mazor In Support of Ex
Parte Application for Temporary Restraining Order and Order To Show Cause Re
Preliminary Injunction’ and the ‘Supplemental Declaration of David Mazor In
Support of Order To Show Cause Re Preliminary Injunction’ contain false
statements. These arguments are not relevant to the instant motion, which
concerns whether Leys has failed to comply with the Court’s August
24, 2021 Judgment…Leys
also makes a ‘Request and Motion to Declare Judgment Void on Its Face Under CCP 473(D)’ in his reply/answer
to the instant motion. The Court notes that Leys’ response to
the instant motion is not the appropriate vehicle by which to make such a
request.  
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has submitted sufficient evidence to
support the issuance of an order to show cause why Defendant should not be held
in contempt for his disobedience of the August 24, 2021 Judgment.” (May 16,
2022 Order at pp. 3:1-4:7.) 
The Court’s May 16, 2022 Order further provides that “Plaintiff’s
motion is granted. The Court orders Defendant William
Leys to appear in Department 50 on 6/6/22, at 2 p.m. to show cause why
he should not be held in contempt for failing to comply with the Court’s August 24, 2021 Judgment.” (May 16, 2022 Order at p. 4:9-13.) 
The Court notes that on June 6, 2022, the Court issued a minute order
providing, inter alia, that “[o]n the Court’s own motion, the Order
to Show Cause Re: why defendant William Leys should not be held in contempt for
failing to comply with the Court’s August 24, 2021 Judgment scheduled for
06/06/2022 is continued to 06/13/22…” The Court’s June 13, 2022 minute order
provides that “[p]ursuant to the request of defendant, the Order to Show Cause
Re: why defendant William Leys should not be held in contempt for failing to comply
with the Court’s August 24, 2021 Judgment scheduled for 06/13/2022 is continued
to 07/18/22…” 
The Court’s July 18, 2022 minute order provides, inter alia, that “[t]he order to show cause is called for hearing,” and that “[t]he
contempt hearing is continued to August 1, 2022.” The Court’s August 1, 2022
minute order provides that “[t]he Court continues the Order to Show Cause (OSC)
hearing to the previously reserved date of August 8, 2022 at 3:00 p.m. in
Department 50 so the public defender can contact Mr. Leys.”  
The Court’s August 8, 2022 minute order provides, inter alia, that “Counsel from the Public Defender’s office appeared on behalf of
Defendant Leys. Counsel requested a summary of the proceedings to date which
the Court provided to her. Counsel for Plaintiff agreed with the description
provided by the Court. Counsel for Defendant requested that the proceedings
start anew because she could not adequately represent Defendant since she was
not present for the testimony of the first witness.” The August 8, 2022 minute
order further provides that “the Court determined that it was best to exercise
its discretion and to start the proceedings anew so the public defender could
counsel Defendant regarding the issues in the case and defend him in the
proceedings from the outset.” 
As discussed, in the instant briefing, Plaintiff asserts that “these
Contempt Proceedings must be concluded at the next scheduled trial date with
the entry of an order of contempt against Leys, the imposition of punishment,
and an award of attorneys’ fees and costs against him.” (Plaintiff’s Brief at
p. 10:23-25.) In his brief, Plaintiff notes that the Court of Appeal in Crittenden v. Superior Court of San Diego County (1964)
225 Cal.App.2d 101, 106-107 noted that “[i]n a constructive contempt
proceeding, the issues of fact are framed by the declarations of the parties.
The allegations in the moving party’s declaration are deemed admitted if not
denied in the defense declaration. A hearing is required only upon the
controverted issues.” (Internal citation omitted.) Plaintiff appears to assert
that there are no longer “controverted issues” in the contempt proceedings here
such that a hearing is not required. 
As set forth above, “[a]s a general
rule, the elements of contempt include (1) a valid order, (2) knowledge of the
order, (3) ability to comply with the order, and (4) willful failure to comply
with the order.” (In re Ivey, supra, 85 Cal.App.4th at p. 798.) Plaintiff
appears to argue that the second, third, and fourth elements of contempt have
been satisfied here because Leys did not dispute the evidence submitted by
Plaintiff in support of Plaintiff’s motion for an order/osc re contempt against
Leys. Plaintiff emphasizes that the Court’s May 16, 2022 Order on Plaintiff’s
motion provides, as set forth above, that “[i]n
his ‘reply/answer’ to the instant motion, Leys does not dispute the foregoing
evidence submitted by Plaintiff.” (May 16, 2022 Order at p. 3:20-22.)
However, the Court notes that in Leys’ May 2, 2022 “reply/answer”
referenced in the May 16, 2022 Order, Leys states that he “denies that he as
violated the Court Order.” Consequently, the “reply/answer” did not constitute an
admission that the fourth element of willful failure to comply with the order
was admitted by Leys.
Plaintiff also notes that on July 31,
2023, the Court issued an Order in this action denying Leys’s “motion to
dismiss contempt based upon invalidity of the underlying order and judgment.” Plaintiff
appears to argue that because the Court denied Leys’s motion to dismiss on July
31, 2023, “all elements of contempt have now been established” and a hearing is
not required. (Plaintiff’s Brief at p. 5:12-13.) It appears that Plaintiff is
arguing that the Court’s July 31, 2023 Order supports the fact that there is a
“valid order” in this action, i.e., the first element of contempt. (In
re Ivey,
supra, 85 Cal.App.4th at p. 798.)  
But
as discussed in the Court’s May 16, 2022 Order, “[a] contempt
proceeding is commenced by the filing of an affidavit and a request for an
order to show cause. After notice to the opposing party’s
lawyer, the court (if satisfied with the sufficiency of the affidavit) must
sign an order to show cause re contempt in which the date and time for a
hearing are set forth. The order to show cause acts as a summons to
appear in court on a certain day and, as its name suggests, to show cause why a
certain thing should not be done. Unless the citee has concealed himself
from the court, he must be personally served with the affidavit and the order
to show cause; otherwise, the court lacks jurisdiction to proceed.” ((Cedars-Sinai Imaging Medical Group v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1286-1287
[internal citations and emphasis omitted, underline added].) Here, Plaintiff does not appear to show (or assert) that any
contempt trial has been completed in this action.[2]
The Court also notes that “Section
1211 of the Code of Civil Procedure establishes the procedure that is to
be followed in adjudging persons in contempt of court. Contempt
committed in the immediate view and presence of the court, known as direct
contempt, may be treated summarily. All that is required is that an order be
made reciting the facts, adjudging the person guilty, and prescribing the
punishment.  If, however, the contempt did not occur in the immediate view
and presence of the court, it becomes indirect contempt and a more
elaborate procedure must be followed in order to notify the person so charged
and to allow him an opportunity to be heard. In such cases an affidavit must be
presented to the court stating the facts constituting the contempt,
an order to show cause must be issued, and a hearing on the facts must be held
by the judge.” (Arthur v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1965)
62 Cal.2d 404, 407-408 [citing Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1212-1217].) Here,
Plaintiff appears to argue that the circumstances demonstrate indirect contempt.
The Court does not find that Plaintiff has shown that the Court may conclude
the contempt proceedings without a hearing on the facts.  
Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request to conclude the contempt
proceedings “at the next scheduled trial date with the entry of an order of
contempt against Leys, the imposition of punishment, and an award of attorneys’
fees and costs against him.” (Plaintiff’s Brief at p. 10:24-25.)  
Plaintiff is
ordered to give notice of this ruling.
