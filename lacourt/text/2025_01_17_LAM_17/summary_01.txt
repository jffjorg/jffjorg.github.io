And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Filimon Garcia Ramirez's motion for leave to amend the complaint, without prejudice. The motion sought to remove paragraphs 17-48 of the original complaint and add new allegations related to the correct transmission defect in the vehicle. The judge found that the proposed amendment would cause meaningful prejudice to the Defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., as the Defendant has already completed Plaintiff's deposition and responded to discovery related to the original allegations. The judge also found that Plaintiff's motion does not comply with California Rules of Court 3.1324, which requires a separate declaration that specifies the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended pleadings were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The judge noted that Plaintiff's declaration did not provide sufficient explanation for the proposed amendment and that the uncertainty around the facts runs afoul of the rules.
