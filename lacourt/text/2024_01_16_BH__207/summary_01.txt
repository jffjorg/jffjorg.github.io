And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case between Princeton Lofts, Inc. (Plaintiff) and Gamma Investors, Group, LLP (Defendant) regarding a motion for attorneys' fees and costs. The Plaintiff brought a lawsuit against the Defendant to abate a barking dog nuisance on the property, and default was entered against the Defendant. The Plaintiff spent legal fees to bring the lawsuit and is seeking $12,000 in attorneys' fees and $744.96 in litigation costs. The Defendant did not oppose the motion, and the judge granted the Plaintiff's oral motion to dismiss with prejudice.

The judge notes that the Plaintiff is the prevailing party for purposes of Civil Code section 5975, but the Defendant has not been served with the notice of motion and moving papers. The judge is uncertain about the Defendant's position and is continuing the hearing to February 20, 2024, to allow the Defendant to be heard. The Plaintiff must provide notice of the continued hearing to the Defendant and comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 1005 by serving the moving papers on the Defendant with the notice.
