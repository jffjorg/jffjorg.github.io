[1] Errors in paragraph numbering in original pleading.


[2] “A contract should be pleaded either in haec verba or
according to its legal intendment and effect. 
An oral contract may be pleaded generally as to its effect, because it
is rarely possible to allege the exact words.” 
(Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 635, 640 [cleaned
up].)
