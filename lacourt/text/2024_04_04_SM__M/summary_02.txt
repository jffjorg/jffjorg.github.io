And here is the English-text summary:

The court has tentatively granted the motion for Payton Employment Law, PC, Marissa Leila Simmons, Esq., Johnny D. Griggs, Esq., and Rayne Brown, Esq. to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiffs Scott A. Leet and Kendall Harke. The motion was brought due to an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Despite the inability to confirm the client's current address, the court finds that reasonable service of the motion was made via email and the last known physical address. The court notes that there are no dispositive motions pending and trial is not set until January 2025, so the client will not be prejudiced by the withdrawal of counsel.
