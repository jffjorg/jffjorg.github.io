And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the request for entry of default judgment. The plaintiff's request for damages and penalties for unpaid minimum wage, missed meal and rest periods, waiting time penalties, and failure to pay wages due is supported by the plaintiff's declaration. The judge finds that the plaintiff's damages and penalties are reduced to $128,199.30. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's request for interest is denied due to lack of evidence of the interest rate and calculation of interest. The judge awards the plaintiff punitive damages of $5,000 and attorney's fees of $7,500. The judge denies the plaintiff's request for emotional distress damages of $75,000. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide a calculation of interest based on the new damages amount and excluding general damages.
