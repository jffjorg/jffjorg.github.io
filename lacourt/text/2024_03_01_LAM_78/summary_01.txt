And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by Cross-Complainants Farhad and Elham Yaghoubi and Cross-Defendant Alfonso Guerrero. The Court has denied Cross-Complainants' motion for terminating sanctions against Cross-Defendant VIP Ent., Inc. due to the lack of evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. However, the Court has granted Cross-Complainants' request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,596, payable within 10 days after the date of this order.

Cross-Defendant Alfonso Guerrero's motion to set aside default is granted. Guerrero must file his answer to the cross-complaint on or before March 5, 2024, and must immediately serve all parties. The Court finds that Guerrero's failure to answer the cross-complaint was due to his attorney's mistake, and relief is granted under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473.

The Court has considered the totality of the circumstances, including the conduct of the parties, the detriment to the propounding party, and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery. The Court has also considered the evidence showing that VIP Ent., Inc. failed to respond to discovery requests, failed to pay sanctions, and failed to comply with court orders.
