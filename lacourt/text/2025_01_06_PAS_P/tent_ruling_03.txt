 Case Number:  24NNCV02608    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER ON MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL I.               
Background
This action arises from a contractual dispute
between Plaintiff Hong Du ("Plaintiff") and Defendant Ali Hasana
Nasab ("Defendant") concerning alleged breaches of partnership
obligations. Plaintiff initiated the complaint on July 1, 2024. Defendant
subsequently filed a cross-complaint alleging misconduct related to the
partnership's dissolution.
On December 4, 2024, Plaintiff's counsel, Shun C.
Chen of the Law Offices of Shun C. Chen, APLC, filed a motion to be relieved as
counsel of record. Defendant opposes the motion, asserting that the withdrawal
is intended to evade pending monetary sanctions and that Plaintiff's counsel's
actions have disrupted the litigation's orderly progress. On December 27, 2024,
Mr. Chen filed a reply to the opposition.

Legal
Standard
The Court may issue an order allowing an attorney to
withdraw from representation after notice to the client. (CCP § 284.) The
attorney may withdraw from representation if the withdrawal would not result in
undue prejudice to the client's interest—i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a
critical point in the litigation. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.
App. 4th 904, 915; see California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.)
The Court has discretion to grant or deny a motion
to be relieved as counsel, particularly when granting such a motion would cause
undue prejudice to the client's interests or result in “an unreasonable
disruption of the orderly processes of justice.” (People v. Ortiz (1990)
51 Cal. 3d 975, 979.) Furthermore, the Court may deny an attorney’s request to
withdraw “where such withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in
the proceeding.” (Mandell v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal. App. 3d 1,
4.) However, this discretion must be exercised reasonably, balancing the
client’s right to choose representation with the court’s duty to maintain the
orderly administration of justice. (Ibid.)
In making a motion to be relieved as counsel, the
attorney must comply with procedures set forth in Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362. The motion must be made using mandatory forms:
1.
Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel directed to the client –
(MC-051).
2.
Declaration “stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship” the reasons that the
motion was brought (MC-052).
3. Proposed Order (MC-053).
The
forms must be timely filed and served on all parties who have appeared in the
case. If these documents are served on the client by mail, there must be a
declaration stating either that the address where client was served is “the
current residence or business address of the client” or “the last known
residence or business address of the client and the attorney has been unable to
locate a more current address after making reasonable efforts to do so within
30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d)(1).)
III.          
Discussion
Plaintiff's
attorney, Shun C. Chen (“Mr. Chen”), has filed the instant motion to be
relieved as counsel pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 284 and
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, citing a complete breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship. Attorney Chen contends that the relationship has
deteriorated to the point where effective representation is no longer possible,
particularly with respect to discovery obligations and the client's objectives.
Chen relies on California Rule of Professional Conduct Rule 3-700(C)(1)(d) and
(f), and (C)(6), which permit withdrawal where continued representation would
violate legal or ethical obligations. 
Defendant
and Cross-Complainant Ali Hasana Nasab ("Nasab") opposes the motion,
arguing that Chen’s withdrawal seeks to avoid accountability for discovery
violations and pending sanctions.Mr. Chen filed a reply arguing that Defendant
lacks standing to oppose the motion, as the issue of withdrawal is solely
between attorney and client. He further asserts that the ethical obligations of
confidentiality under Aceves v. Superior Court (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th
584, 595, prevent him from disclosing further details about the breakdown in
the relationship.
The
Court finds that Mr. Chen has complied with all procedural requirements under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284 and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,
including filing the mandatory MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053 forms and properly
serving notice on Plaintiff. The evidence submitted demonstrates a breakdown in
the attorney-client relationship, making continued representation untenable.
The
Court also notes that the next hearing in this case is scheduled for January
31, 2025, which the Court finds is adequate time for the Plaintiff to retain
substitute counsel. The litigation will not be unduly delayed or prejudiced by
granting the motion at this juncture. While Defendant raises concerns regarding
discovery disputes, these issues do not outweigh the Court's findings of good
cause for withdrawal.
Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds good cause to GRANT counsel’s motion.
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Counsel’s motion.
 
IV.          
Conclusion
and Order
The
Court GRANTS Mr. Chen’s motion to be relieved as counsel effective upon filing
proof of service of the signed order on Plaintiff. 
Counsel
is ordered to give notice.
