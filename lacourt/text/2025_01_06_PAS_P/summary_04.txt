And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admission (RFA) Set One admitted. The plaintiff had served the RFA on the defendant on October 1, 2024, and the defendant failed to respond despite multiple extensions. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to respond waives any objections and requires the court to deem the RFAs admitted. The judge also grants monetary sanctions in the amount of $690.00 against the defendant, which includes the cost of preparing the motion and attending the hearing. The defendant has 30 days to pay the sanctions.
