 Case Number:  24NNCV04243    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION – SET ONE ADMITTED and MONETARY SANCTIONSI.         INTRODUCTION
This is a personal injury case
brought by Plaintiff Zarui Voskanyan ("Plaintiff") against Defendant
Gino Salvatore Guzzardo ("Defendant") and Does 1 through 25.
Plaintiff alleges that on January 27, 2024, Defendant negligently operated a
motor vehicle, causing a collision with Plaintiff’s vehicle in Glendale,
California.
On December 3, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion to deem admitted Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission -
Set One pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280. The motion also
seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,635.00 against Defendant and
Defendant’s counsel. No opposition has been filed.            
            II.        REQUESTS
FOR ADMISSIONS 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other
party to the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth
of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law
to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy
between the parties.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after
service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed
shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a
copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared . . ..”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250(a).)  
If a party to whom request for admissions are served fails to provide a
timely response, the party to whom the request was directed waives any
objections, including based on privilege or the work product doctrine. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(a).) The requesting party can move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
request be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280(b).) The court shall issue this order unless the party to
whom the request was made serves a response in substantial compliance prior to
the hearing on the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) 
Here, Plaintiff served RFA - Set One on Defendant on October 1, 2024,
making Defendant’s responses due by November 5, 2024. (Voskanyan Decl., ¶ 4)
Plaintiff granted multiple extensions, moving the deadline to November 25,
2024, but Defendant failed to provide any responses despite these
accommodations. As of the hearing date, Defendant has not served any responses
nor opposed this motion.
Accordingly, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(c), the Court
must deem the RFAs admitted.
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request to deem RFAs Set One admitted.
Sanctions
Sanctions are mandatory against the party, the attorney, or both whose
failure to serve a timely response to the request necessitated the motion to
deem request for admissions as admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c); see
also Cal. Rules of Court R. 3.1348(a) [the court can award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party seeking to compel discovery even though
no opposition was filed, the opposition was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed].) 
Here, Defendant’s failure to timely serve responses to the RFAs
necessitated this motion. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that they expended 1.5
hours preparing the motion, anticipate an additional 0.5 hours to review any
opposition and draft a reply, and an additional 0.5 hours to appear for the hearing,
for a total of 2.5 hours. Counsel also incurred a $60.00 filing fee, bringing
the total requested sanction to $1,635.00. (Voskanyan Decl., ¶¶ 12-13.)
Counsel’s hourly rate is $630, which the Court finds reasonable. However,
as no opposition has been filed, the Court reduces the reasonable time spent to
1.0 hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee, resulting in a total sanction amount of
$690.00.
The Court GRANTS monetary sanctions in the amount of $690.00 against
Defendant within 30 days of this order.
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s request to deem the RFAs Set One admitted, and awards
Plaintiff $690.00 in monetary sanctions to be paid within 30 days of this
order.
            Plaintiff
is to give notice.
