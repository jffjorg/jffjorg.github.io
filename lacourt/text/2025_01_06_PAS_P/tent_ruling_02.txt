 Case Number:  24AHCV00196    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING  DEFENDANTS' DEMURRER TO THE FAC WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND and DENYING MOTION TO  STRIKE and ORDER DENYING NON-PARTY O’HARA TRUST’S MOTION TO INTERVENEI.         INTRODUCTION This action arises from an alleged  negligent real estate transaction. Plaintiffs Daniel J. Carroll and Jana D. Law  (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) allege that Defendants Lloyd Ross (“Ross”) and  Douglas Elliman (“Elliman”) (collectively, “Defendants”) failed to inform  Plaintiffs of parking restrictions in the City of San Marino and failed to  provide the required City of San Marino Information Guide. On January 31, 2024, Plaintiffs  filed the initial complaint. On August 22, 2024, the Court sustained  Defendants’ demurrer with leave to amend. On September 25, 2024, Plaintiffs  filed the First Amended Complaint (FAC). On October 29, 2024, Defendants filed  their demurrer. Plaintiffs filed an opposition on December 20, 2024, and  Defendants submitted their joint reply on December 27, 2024. Additionally, on October 9, 2024,  Non-Party Stephen and Mary O’Hara Family Trust filed a motion to intervene,  asserting that they are the sellers of the property and not parties to this  lawsuit. The Court addresses both the  demurrer and the motion to intervene in this single tentative ruling. Meet and Confer Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure  section 430.41, subdivision (a), the demurring party is required to meet and  confer with the party who filed the pleading at least five days before the  responsive pleading is due. This must occur in person, telephone or by video  conference with the aim of resolving any objections raised in the demurrer.  Additionally, the demurring party must file and serve a declaration detailing  the meet and confer efforts. It should be noted, however, that the failure to  meet and confer is not itself grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer  or granting or denying a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd.  (a)(4), 435.5, subd. (a)(4).) In this case, Defendants’ counsel  met and conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel on October 11, 2024. (Markow Decl.,  ¶ 2.) Therefore, the Court finds that Defendants have satisfied the meet and  confer requirement. Judicial Notice Defendants request judicial notice  of the following documents:  The       August 22, 2024, Order of sustaining Defendants’ Demurrer to Plaintiffs’       original Complaint City       Code of San Marino, California, Chapter XV, Article 07, Sections 23 and       27  City       Code of San Marino, California, Chapter XXII, Article 02, Section 03 City       Code of San Marino, California, Chapter XXIV, Article 01, Sections 01       through 04 California       Civil Code section 2079.16,   Judicial notice of court records is  proper under Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d). Judicial notice of  municipal codes and legislative enactments is proper under Evidence Code  section 452, subdivision (b). As such, the Court GRANTS  Defendants’ request for judicial notice. II.        LEGAL STANDARD A demurrer tests the legal  sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.  Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. A plaintiff’s allegations  must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable”  they are. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.  Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be  accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224  Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.)  Pleadings are to be broadly  construed (Code Civ. Proc., § 452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the  facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart  Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.) Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,  subdivision (f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain. Demurrers  for uncertainty are disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible  a defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,  Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  III.      ANALYSIS Defendants demur to both causes of action: (1) Professional Negligence  and (2) Negligence, arguing that the First Amended Complaint (FAC) fails to  state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.  (Demurrer, p. 3.) Defendants argue that the FAC is defective for a variety of reasons.  First, they assert there was no duty to disclose because they did not owe  Plaintiffs a duty of care to disclose San Marino’s parking regulations, as such  information is publicly available. (Demurrer, p. 10.) Second, Defendants  contend that the parking regulations and the informational guide are matters of  public record that Plaintiffs could have accessed independently through  reasonable diligence. (Demurrer, p. 9.) Third, Defendants maintain that  California law does not impose a duty on real estate professionals to disclose  public records unless those records are not reasonably accessible to the buyer.  (Demurrer, p. 11.) Defendants further argue that Plaintiffs’ claim they were unaware of the  local ordinances is of no legal consequence, as the information was readily  available. (Demurrer, p. 12.) Additionally, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’  reference to Section 11(N) of the Purchase Agreement is irrelevant, as  Defendants are not parties to the agreement. (Demurrer, p. 14.) Finally,  Defendants maintain that the terms of the agreement confirm that, as real  estate brokers and agents, they did not owe Plaintiffs a duty of care to  disclose the local ordinances or provide the informational guide. (Demurrer, p.  14-15.) In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants were required to provide  the informational guide under local regulations, specifically citing the City  of San Marino's procedures for residential compliance. According to Plaintiffs,  the guide is a mandatory disclosure intended to inform new buyers of the City’s  unique ordinances, and Defendants' failure to provide this guide constitutes a  breach of duty. (FAC, ¶¶ 21-24; Opposition, p. 3.) Plaintiffs also contend that Section 11(N) of the Purchase Agreement  required Defendants to disclose all material information, including the City’s  restrictive parking regulations. They argue that this provision imposes an  obligation on Defendants, as real estate brokers and agents, to ensure all  necessary disclosures were made, including providing the informational guide.  (FAC, ¶¶ 25-26; Opposition, p. 4.) Finally, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants' failure to provide the  informational guide as part of the compliance certificate process violated both  statutory and professional obligations. Plaintiffs cite California Civil Code  section 2079, which imposes a duty on brokers to investigate and disclose all  facts materially affecting the value or desirability of a property. Plaintiffs  assert that Defendants’ omission caused them material harm, including financial  losses associated with the sale of the property and related substantial  damages. (FAC, ¶¶ 35-37; Opposition, p. 6-7.) The Court, consistent with its prior ruling, finds that Defendants did  not owe Plaintiffs a legal duty to disclose the City of San Marino’s parking  regulations or the informational guide, as these are matters of public record  accessible to Plaintiffs through reasonable diligence. Furthermore, the Court  previously determined that the "Notification Form" does not impose a  legal duty on Defendants to disclose information that Plaintiffs could have  independently discovered. Plaintiffs’ attachment of the Notification Form to  the FAC does not cure this deficiency. Given that the parking restrictions are matters of public record, which Plaintiff  could have learned about through minimal effort, the Court remains unpersuaded  by Plaintiffs’ arguments. Plaintiffs have failed to address the deficiencies  identified in the prior ruling or to establish an actionable cause of action  against Defendants. Further amendment cannot create a legal duty where none  exists under the facts and law. Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS Defendants’ demurrer without leave to  amend. Motion to Strike The court may, upon a motion, or at  any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any  irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not  drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an  order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike  are that the pleading has irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has not  been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Id. § 436.) The grounds  for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of  judicial notice. (Id. § 437.)   Here, Defendants move to strike  portions of the FAC. Given that the Court has sustained the demurrer to the FAC  without leave to amend, the Court DENIES the motion to strike as MOOT.   Motion to Intervene CCP section¿387(a) provides that,  “[u]pon¿timely application, any person, who has an interest in the matter in  litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against  both, may intervene in the action or proceeding.¿ An intervention takes  place when a third person is permitted to become a party to an action or  proceeding between other persons, either by joining the plaintiff in claiming  what is sought by the complaint, or by uniting with the defendant in resisting  the claims of the plaintiff, or by¿demanding anything adversely to both the  plaintiff and the defendant, and is made by complaint, setting forth the  grounds upon which the intervention rests, filed by leave of the court and  served upon the parties to the action or proceeding who have not appeared in  the same manner as upon the commencement of an original action, and upon the  attorneys of the parties who have appeared, or upon the party if he has  appeared without an attorney, in the manner provided for service of summons or  in the manner provided by Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 1010) Title 14 of  Part 2.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 387(a).)¿  ¿            To  establish a direct and immediate interest in the litigation for purposes of  permissive intervention, a non-party seeking intervention must show that he or  she stands to gain or lose by direct operation of the judgment, even if no  specific interest in the property or transaction at issue exists.¿ (Simpson  Redwood Co. v. State of California¿(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1192, 1201.)¿ “Whether  the intervener’s interest is sufficiently direct must be decided on the facts  of each case¿. . ..¿And section 387 should be liberally construed in favor of  intervention.”¿ (Id.¿at 1200.)¿ “In order that a party may be permitted  to intervene it is not necessary that his interest in the action be such that  he will inevitably be affected by the judgment.¿ It is enough that there be a  substantial probability that his interests will also be so affected.¿ ‘The  purposes of intervention are to protect the interests of those who may be  affected by the judgment¿. . ..’”¿ (Timberidge¿Enterprises, Inc. v. City of  Santa Rosa¿(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 873, 881-82 (citations and emphasis  omitted).)¿  Here, The O’Hara Trust asserts an  interest as the sellers of the property at the center of this litigation. They  argue that their rights may be directly affected by the outcome of this case,  particularly if liability for failure to disclose rests on facts stemming from  their role as sellers. However, because the Court has sustained the demurrer to  Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint without leave to amend, the underlying  action is resolved in favor of Defendants, rendering the motion to intervene  moot.             Accordingly,  the Court DENIES O’Hara Trust’s motion to intervene.   IV.       ORDER The Court SUSTAINS Defendants’  demurrer to the FAC without leave to amend. The Court DENIES Defendants' motion  to strike as MOOT. The Court DENIES Non-Party Motion  to Intervene as MOOT. Defendants to give notice.             Defendants to submit a proposed judgment consistent with this order within thirty days.               Dated: January 6, 2025                                                                                              JARED D.
