Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Shun C. Chen, the attorney representing Hong Du, the plaintiff in the case. The motion was opposed by Ali Hasana Nasab, the defendant, who argued that Chen's withdrawal was intended to avoid accountability for discovery violations and pending sanctions. The Court finds that Chen has complied with the procedural requirements and that there is good cause for his withdrawal due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Court grants the motion, allowing Chen to withdraw as counsel, and orders him to give notice to the plaintiff.
