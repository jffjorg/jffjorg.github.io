  Case Number:  23AHCV02487    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO
COMPEL FORM INTERROGATORIES - SET ONE, SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES - SET ONE AND
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION - SET ONE IN PART and GRANTING IN PARTI.               
INTRODUCTION
This is a personal injury case filed on October 26, 2023, by Plaintiffs
Heriberto Sanchez-Hernandez and Victoria Mendez-Cruz (“Plaintiffs”) against
Defendants Harpreet Singh Sandhu, PB Transport Inc., and Does 1–25
(“Defendants”). The Complaint asserts a cause of action for general negligence.
On December 2, 2024, Defendants filed a total of four motions to compel,
two for each Plaintiff, addressing Form Interrogatories – Set One, Special
Interrogatories – Set One, and Requests for Production – Set One, along with
requests for monetary sanctions. On the same date, Plaintiffs filed a combined
opposition to Defendants’ motions. On December 30, 2024, Defendants filed a
late reply.
The Court reviews Defendants' motions and consolidates them into the
following tentative ruling.
II.  INTERROGATORIES
– Form Interrogatories– Set One and Special Interrogatories – Set One
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(a), unverified responses
are tantamount to no response at all and are subject to a motion to compel
initial responses (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632,
635–36). Objections, however, do not require verification and are sufficient to
render the responses timely if served within the statutory period (Blue
Ridge Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 339, 344–345; Food
4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651,
657–658). Where responses consist of a "hybrid" of objections and
substantive answers, the failure to provide verifications only affects the
substantive responses, leaving the objections intact (Food 4 Less
Supermarkets, Inc., supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 658).
Defendants served Requests for Production of Documents – Set One on
Plaintiffs Victoria Mendez-Cruz and Heriberto Sanchez-Hernandez on March 6,
2024. The initial deadline to respond was April 9, 2024, after accounting for
two additional court days for electronic service. However, an email from
Plaintiffs’ counsel dated April 2, 2024, confirms that the parties agreed to
extend the response deadline to April 30, 2024. Plaintiffs subsequently served
objections-only responses on April 30, 2024, in accordance with the agreed
extension. (Opposition, Ex. B.)
Plaintiffs timely served objections-only responses on April 30, 2024,
pursuant to an agreed extension. For Form Interrogatory No. 10.3, Plaintiffs
included a partial answer, but the response was unverified. Under Appleton,
the unverified partial response is deemed no response at all and is properly
subject to a motion to compel initial responses. However, for the
objections-only responses to the other interrogatories, Plaintiffs complied
with their statutory obligations. Defendants' motions to compel initial
responses to these objections is procedurally improper and should have been
filed as motions to compel further responses under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motions to compel initial
responses as to Form Interrogatory No. 10.3, requiring Plaintiffs to serve a
verified response within 20 days of this order. The Court however DENIES the
motions as to all other Form Interrogatories in Set One and Special
Interrogatories - Set One, as the proper procedure would have been to file
motions to compel further responses.
 
III.  REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION – RFP Set One
A propounding party may move to compel responses to requests for
production of documents where the responding party fails to provide responses.
(CCP § 2031.300.) The responding party must provide responses within thirty
days after the demand is served. (CCP § 2031.030(c)(2) & (3).) The
responding party waives all objections, including privilege and work product,
by failing to timely respond to requests for production of documents. (CCP §
2031.300.)
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, if a party fails to
timely respond to requests for the production of documents, they waive all
objections, including those based on privilege or work product protection, and
the propounding party may move to compel responses. However, where the
responding party serves timely objections-only responses, the proper remedy is
a motion to compel further responses under section 2031.310, which must be
filed within 45 days of service of the objections. This deadline is both
mandatory and jurisdictional (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410).
Defendants served Requests for Production of Documents – Set One on
Plaintiffs Victoria Mendez-Cruz and Heriberto Sanchez-Hernandez on March 6, 2024.
The initial deadline to respond was April 9, 2024, after accounting for two
additional court days for electronic service. However, an email from
Plaintiffs’ counsel dated April 2, 2024, confirms that the parties agreed to
extend the response deadline to April 30, 2024. Plaintiffs subsequently served
objections-only responses on April 30, 2024, in accordance with the agreed
extension. (Opposition, Ex. B.)
Plaintiffs argue that their responses were timely and code-compliant, and
Defendants’ motions to compel responses under section 2031.300 is procedurally
improper. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ objections waived any privilege
claims and justify compelling responses without objections. However, as
Plaintiffs timely served their objections, the proper remedy for challenging
the sufficiency of these responses is a motion to compel further responses
under section 2031.310, not a motion to compel initial responses under section
2031.300 (Board of Registered Nursing v. Superior Court of Orange County (2021)
59 Cal.App.5th 1011, 1020).
Here, Defendants served Requests for Production – Set One on Plaintiffs
on March 6, 2024, with responses due on April 9, 2024. Plaintiffs timely served
objections-only responses on April 30, 2024, pursuant to an agreed extension.
These objections do not require verification and are thus timely and compliant
under Blue Ridge Ins. Co. and Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc.
Defendants' motions to compel initial responses are procedurally improper, as
objections were timely asserted and should have been challenged via a motion to
compel further responses under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310.
Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motions to compel initial
responses to the request for production as being procedurally improper.
 
V.        SANCTIONS
Sanctions are mandatory under the California Code of Civil Procedure when
a party’s failure to respond to discovery necessitates a motion, regardless of
whether responses are eventually served, or the motions are resolved as moot.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.030(a), 2030.290(c), 2033.280(c).
Here, Defendants requested monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,060.00
for each motion, totaling $12,180.00. However, as the Court denies Defendants’
motions for being procedurally improper, the Court also DENIES Defendants’
requests for monetary sanctions. 
VI.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
The Court DENIES Defendants’
motions to compel as procedurally improper, except as to the unverified partial
response to Form Interrogatory No. 10.3, for which the motion is GRANTED.
Plaintiffs are ordered to provide a verified response to Form Interrogatory No.
10.3 within 20 days of this order.
The Court DENIES Defendants’
request for monetary sanctions.
Defendants to give notice.
