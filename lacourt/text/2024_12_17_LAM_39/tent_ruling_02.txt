MOTION
            Attorney
Stephen M. Garcia of Garcia & Artigliere  and Garcia & Artigliere (“Counsel”) move
to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Victoria Spelman (“Plaintiff”).  Counsel initially gave Plaintiff notice of
this motion with a hearing date of March 11, 2025.  In its order of November 14, 2024, the Court
advanced the hearing on the motion to this date and ordered Counsel to submit a
revised proposed order to be relieved as counsel.  (See November 14, 2024 Minute Order.)  On November 14, 2024, Counsel filed and
served a notice of ruling indicating he had provided notice to Plaintiff and Defendants
of the new date for the hearing and a proposed order granting the motion that
also reflected the new date.  
As such, the Court
has determined Plaintiff received proper notice of the current hearing
date.  
ANALYSIS
Counsel has filed
forms MC-051 and MC-052 and has lodged with the court a copy of the proposed
order on form MC-053, as required.  (Cal
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)  The basis
for the motion is the professional relationship between Counsel and Plaintiff has
broken down.  This is a valid reason for
withdrawal.  Accordingly, the motion is granted.  
Counsel should
note the order will become effective upon the filing of a proof of service of the
signed copy of the order on Plaintiff, until which time Counsel will remain the
attorney of record for Plaintiff. 
Counsel is to serve a copy of the signed order (form MC-053) on Plaintiff
within 10 days and file proof of service of same.
Counsel is ordered
to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
