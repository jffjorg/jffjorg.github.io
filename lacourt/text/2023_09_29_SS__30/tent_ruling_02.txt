Proc. § 426.30, subd. (a); see also Crocker Nat. Bank v. Emerald (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 852, 864.)¿ A related cause of action is “. . . a cause of action which arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as the cause of action which the plaintiff alleges in his complaint.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 426.10, subd. (c).)¿ Leave must be granted to file a compulsory cross-complaint when the defendant is acting in good faith.¿ (See Code Civ. Proc. § 426.50.)¿The evidence shows that PAC-’94 had claimed in fall 2022 that Equinox, not PAC-’94, was responsible for control of the parking lot at issue. (Decl. Lee-Gulley, ¶4.) PAC-’94 had provided excerpts from the operative lease agreement between the parties as proof. (Decl. Lee-Gulley, ¶5.) At the end of February 2023, Equinox received, for the first time, most of the pages of the operative lease and the addendums after a request for the entire contract be provided. (Decl. Lee-Gulley, ¶¶ 6,7.) A review of the lease indicates that it is PAC-’94 that is responsible for the parking lot. (Decl. Lee-Gulley, ¶10.)

In addition, Equinox’s cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises from the same injury Plaintiff alleges in its complaint. Equinox properly filed a proposed cross-complaint.
