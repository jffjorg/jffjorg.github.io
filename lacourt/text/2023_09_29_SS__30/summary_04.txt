And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Willie Perrymon vs. Kyle Shores, et al. The judge has granted three motions filed by the defendant: a motion to compel Willie Perrymon's responses to supplemental interrogatories, a motion to compel Willie Perrymon's responses to special interrogatories, and a motion to compel Willie Perrymon's responses to a supplemental request for production of documents. The defendant served these discovery requests on December 22, 2022, and Willie Perrymon failed to respond by the deadline. The judge has ordered Willie Perrymon to serve responses to these requests within 20 days, without objection. The request for sanctions is denied because the motions are unopposed. The judge will give notice to the parties of the ruling.
