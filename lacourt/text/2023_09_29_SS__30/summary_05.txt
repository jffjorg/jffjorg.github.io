And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to set aside/vacate the dismissal of their complaint. The complaint was initially dismissed on June 15, 2023, due to the plaintiff's failure to appear for trial. However, the plaintiff's counsel claims that the failure to appear was due to a mistake by their paralegal, who calendared the wrong date. The plaintiff filed the motion to set aside the dismissal on September 6, 2023, within the six-month deadline. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to appear was due to their counsel's neglect, and therefore grants the motion.
