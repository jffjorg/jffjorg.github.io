The complaint was initially dismissed on June 15, 2023, due to the plaintiff's failure to appear for trial. However, the plaintiff's counsel claims that the failure to appear was due to a mistake by their paralegal, who calendared the wrong date. The plaintiff filed the motion to set aside the dismissal on September 6, 2023, within the six-month deadline. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to appear was due to their counsel's neglect, and therefore grants the motion.

This tentative ruling states that the plaintiff's motion to set aside/vacate the dismissal of her complaint is granted. The court had previously dismissed the plaintiff's complaint on June 15, 2023 due to the plaintiff's failure to appear for trial. However, the plaintiff's counsel asserts that this failure was due to the mistake of the counsel's paralegal, who had mistakenly calendared the trial date. As the plaintiff filed the motion to set aside/vacate the dismissal within the six-month deadline of Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the court grants the motion. This motion was unopposed.
