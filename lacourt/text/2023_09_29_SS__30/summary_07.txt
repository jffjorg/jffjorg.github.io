And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion for orders allowing discovery of the Defendant's financial condition. The motion is denied. The Plaintiff sought to discover the Defendant's financial condition on the grounds that there is a significant probability that the Plaintiff will prevail on her demand for punitive damages. However, the Judge found that the evidence presented by both parties is insufficient to determine which account of the events leading up to the altercation is accurate. Additionally, neither party presented evidence of the malice or oppression necessary to prevail on a claim for punitive damages. Therefore, the Judge denied the Plaintiff's motion for discovery of the Defendant's financial condition.
