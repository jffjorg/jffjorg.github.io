The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to allow discovery of the defendant's financial condition. The plaintiff, Lani Miller, had requested this discovery in order to support her claim for punitive damages against the defendant, Joanna Defirman. However, the judge found that there was insufficient evidence to determine which party was at fault in the altercation that led to the lawsuit, and that neither party had provided evidence of malice or oppression, which is necessary to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge therefore denied the plaintiff's motion, citing a lack of sufficient evidence to support the claim for punitive damages. The plaintiff must now give notice of the ruling to the defendant.
