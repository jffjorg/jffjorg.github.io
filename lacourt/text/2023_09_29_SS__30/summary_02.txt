And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Equinox's motion for leave to file a Cross-Complaint against PAC-'49. The Cross-Complaint must be filed within 10 days. The judge found that Equinox made this motion in good faith, as they had made efforts to learn who was responsible for the parking lot at issue. The judge also found that the Cross-Complaint is compulsory, as it arises from the same injury that the plaintiff alleges in its complaint. The lease agreement between the parties shows that PAC-'94 is responsible for the parking lot, and Equinox's Cross-Complaint is related to this issue.
