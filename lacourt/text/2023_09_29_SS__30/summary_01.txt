The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lusine Shahnazaryan (Petitioner) vs Luc John Doody (Claimant). The case involves a petition to approve a settlement reached in a minor's legal action.  

The Judge has continued the hearing to allow the Petitioner to correct certain deficiencies in the forms submitted. Specifically, the Petitioner needs to:

*  Check a box on form MC-350 indicating they will receive money under the settlement.
*  Correctly fill out form MC-350, item 14b, which asks for the amount of medical expenses to be reimbursed, not the total medical expenses incurred.
*  Complete form MC-350, item 13.

The Judge has found that the requested attorney's fees of $1,000 or 25% of the gross settlement are reasonable, given the contingency fee arrangement in place since 2019. The Judge also noted that the Petitioner has properly filed form MC-355.

Once the deficiencies are corrected, the Judge will approve the petition.
