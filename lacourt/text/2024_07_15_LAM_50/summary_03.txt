The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's second amended motion for entry of stipulated consent judgment.

The judge found that the warning provided in the settlement complies with Health and Safety Code § 25249.7 and that the amount allocated for attorney's fees and costs in the Proposed Consent Judgment is reasonable. The judge also found that the civil penalty amount provided for in the Proposed Consent Judgment is reasonable.
