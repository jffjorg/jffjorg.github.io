[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
MOTION TO COMPEL
  FURTHER RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFFS XIANG HAO CUI; 800 EAST PICO BLVD, LLC.; 808
  EAST PICO BLVD, LLC.; AND STANFORD PLAZA HOLDINGS, LLC.’S FIRST SET OF
  REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION, FORM INTERROGATORIES, SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, AND
  REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS TO STANFORD PLAZA ASSOCIATION, INC.
 




 
Plaintiffs Xiang
Hao Cui, 800 East Pico Blvd, LLC, 808 East Pico Blvd, LLC, and Stanford Plaza
Holdings, LLC (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) move for an order compelling Nominal
Defendant Stanford Plaza Association, Inc. (the “Association”) to serve further
responses to Plaintiffs’ First Set of Requests for Admission, Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of
Documents, served on the Association on August 14, 2023. The Association
opposes the motion. 
The Court notes that on July 11, 2024, the court issued a minute order
providing, inter alia, that “[t]he Motion for Summary Judgment filed by
Stanford Plaza Association, Inc. on 03/19/2024 is Granted.” Thus, the Court
finds that Plaintiffs’ instant motion to compel further responses is moot. 
The Association is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
