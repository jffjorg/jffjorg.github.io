  ORDER RE:
 
SECOND
  AMENDED MOTION FOR ENTRY OF STIPULATED CONSENT JUDGMENT
 



 
Background 
Plaintiff Tamar
Kaloustian (“Plaintiff”) filed this
Proposition 65 action on 
November 16, 2022 against Defendants
Baker’s Breakfast Cookies, Inc. (“Baker’s”) and Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.
The Complaint alleges one cause of action for violations of Health and Safety Code section 25249.6. 
            In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges
that “[t]his Complaint seeks to remedy Defendants’ continuing failure to
adequately warn individuals in California that they are being exposed to lead,
a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects and other
reproductive harm. Such exposures have occurred, and continue to occur, through
the manufacture, distribution, sale and consumption of Defendants’ Erin Baker’s
- Grain-Free Better Cookie - Salted Chocolate Cashew; UPC 7 08875 00601 0 (the ‘Product’).
The Product is available to consumers in California through a multitude of
retail channels including, without limitation (a) third-party traditional
brick-and-mortar retail locations; (b) via the internet through Defendants’
website; and (c) via the internet through third-party retail websites.
Consumers are exposed to lead when they consume the Product.” (Compl., ¶ 1.)
Plaintiff further alleges that “Defendants have failed, and continue to fail,
to provide clear and reasonable warnings regarding the reproductive toxicity of
lead to users of the Products.” (Compl., ¶ 33.)
In his supporting declaration, Plaintiff’s counsel states that “the
parties have agreed to terms of a settlement, embodied within a stipulated form
of [Proposed] Consent Judgment, true and correct copy of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit C.” (Second Amended Krikorian Decl., ¶ 10.) The [Proposed]
Consent Judgment (herein, “Proposed Consent Judgment”) attached as Exhibit C to
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration is entered into between Baker’s and
Plaintiff. (Second Amended Krikorian Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. C.)[1] 
Plaintiff previously moved “for an order to enter judgment pursuant to
the terms of the stipulated settlement of this case executed by all parties on
or about January 24, 2024.” On March 11, 2024, the Court issued an Order
denying Plaintiff’s previous motion without prejudice. The Court’s March 11,
2024 Order provides, inter alia, that “it does not appear that the ‘[t]he warning that is required by the settlement complies
with this chapter.’ (Health & Saf.
Code, § 25249.7, subd. (f)(4)(A).) Thus, the Court denies Plaintiff’s
motion without prejudice.” (March 11, 2024 Order at p. 7:6-8.)
Plaintiff previously
moved again for “an order to enter judgment pursuant to the terms
of the stipulated settlement of this case executed by all parties on or about
January 24, 2024.” On May 3, 2024, the Court issued an Order denying
Plaintiff’s amended motion. The Court’s May 3, 2024 Order provides, inter
alia, that “Plaintiff still does not appear to show that the ‘[t]he warning that is required by the settlement complies
with this chapter.’ (Health & Saf.
Code, § 25249.7, subd. (f)(4)(A).).” (May 3, 2024 Order at p. 8:11-12.) The
Court’s May 3, 2024 minute order provides, inter alia,
that “[a]t the hearing, the parties agreed to prepare a stipulation revising
the settlement to include compliance with Health and Safety [C]ode § 25249.7, subd. (f)(4)(A) and to file that with a
proposed order on or before July 1, 2024 with a courtesy copy delivered to
Department 50.”  
On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a second amended motion for entry of
stipulated consent judgment, a second amended declaration of Tro Krikorian in
support of the motion, and a proposed judgment. The second amended motion is
unopposed. 
Discussion 
Under Health and Safety Code section
25249.6, “[n]o person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and
intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause
cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable
warning to such individual, except as provided in Section
25249.10.”
 “If there is a settlement of an
action brought by a person in the public interest under subdivision (d), the
plaintiff shall submit the settlement, other than a voluntary dismissal in
which no consideration is received from the defendant, to the court for
approval upon noticed motion, and the court may approve the settlement only if
the court makes all of the following findings: (A) The warning that is
required by the settlement complies with this chapter. (B) The award of
attorney’s fees is reasonable under California law. (C) The penalty amount
is reasonable based on the criteria set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision
(b).” (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.7, subd. (f)(4).)
The plaintiff “has the burden of producing evidence sufficient to sustain each
required finding. The plaintiff shall serve the motion and all supporting
papers on the Attorney General, who may appear and participate in a proceeding
without intervening in the case.” (Health & Saf.
Code, § 25249.7, subd. (f)(5).)
Here, Plaintiff’s proof of service filed on
May 30, 2024 states that the second amended moving papers were served on
Defendants’ counsel and “Office of the Attorney General” on May 30, 2024. 
The Warning’s Compliance
Health and Safety Code section 25249.6 provides, “[n]o person in the course
of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a
chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without
first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual, except as provided
in Section 25249.10.” Pursuant to California Code of Regulations, title
27, section 25601, subdivision
(a), “[a] warning is ‘clear and reasonable’
within the meaning of Section 25249.6 of the Act if
the warning complies with all applicable requirements of this article.” 
Under the Proposed Consent Judgment, Baker’s agrees to discontinue
“Distributing into the State of California” or manufacturing the “Covered
Product,” which is defined as “Erin Baker’s - Grain-Free Better Cookie - Salted
Chocolate Cashew; UPC 7 08875 00601 0.” (Second Amended Krikorian Decl., ¶ 10,
Ex. C., ¶¶ 1.3, 3.1.)[2]
Such injunctive relief does not apply to any “Covered Product” that “was
manufactured, distributed, or sold prior to the Effective Date…” (Id., ¶ 3.1.)[3] 
The Proposed Consent Judgment further provides that “[i]n the event
Baker’s decides to manufacture or sell the Covered Product again in the future,
any Covered Product sold in the State of California shall not expose a person
to a ‘Daily Lead Exposure Level’ of more than 0.5 micrograms of lead per day
unless it meets the warning requirements under Section
3.2.”  (Second Amended Krikorian
Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. C., ¶ 3.1.) Paragraph 3.2.1 of the Proposed Consent Judgment
provides that “[i]f Baker’s is required to provide a warning pursuant to Section 3.1, one of the following warnings must be
utilized pursuant to California Code of Regulations (‘CCR’) title 27, sections 25603 and 25607.2 (‘Warning’):…” (Id.,
¶ 3.2.1.)  
The Court finds that the “Option 1” warning listed in Paragraph 3.2.1
of the Proposed Consent Judgment is in compliance with California
Code of Regulations title 27, sections 25603 and 25607.2. The Court finds that the “Option 2”
warning listed in Paragraph 3.2.1 of the Proposed Consent
Judgment is in compliance with California Code of Regulations,
title 27, section 25603. 
             Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has shown that the “[t]he warning that is required by the settlement complies
with this chapter.” (Health & Saf. Code,
§ 25249.7, subd. (f)(4)(A).)
Reasonableness of Award of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs 
The Proposed Consent
Judgment requires Baker’s to
pay Plaintiff’s counsel $55,500.00 for all attorneys’ fees, expert and
investigation fees, and related costs associated with this matter and the
Notice. (Second Amended Krikorian
Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. C, ¶ 5.) 
The Court finds that
Plaintiff’s counsel’s supporting declaration justifies the fee award. Plaintiff’s
counsel sets forth the experience and background of each of the attorneys who
worked on this case, as well as the requested hourly rate for each attorney. (Second
Amended Krikorian Decl., ¶¶ 1-5, pp. 4-5.) Mr. Krikorian’s hourly rate
is $450/hour, Mr. Thomassian’s hourly rate is $550/hour, and Mr. Jivalagian’s
hourly rate is $550/hour. (Second
Amended Krikorian Decl., ¶¶ 1, 4, 5, pp. 4-5.) The Court finds that
these requested hourly rates are reasonable. 
            Plaintiff’s counsel attests to the fact that “a total lodestar
of $55,500” has been expended on this case. (Second Amended Krikorian Decl., ¶ 6, p. 6.) No time records are included, but
Plaintiff’s counsel does provide a detailed review of the work performed by the
attorneys. (Ibid.) In addition,
Plaintiff’s counsel states that his firm has advanced approximately $4,000.00
in unreimbursed expenses in this matter. (Second Amended Krikorian Decl., ¶ 6, p. 7.) 
The Court finds that the
amount allocated for attorney’s fees and costs in the Proposed Consent Judgment
is reasonable. 
Reasonableness of Penalty Amount
Under Health and Safety Code section 25249.7,
subdivision (b)(2), the Court shall consider the following factors in
assessing the amount of the civil penalty: “(A) The nature and extent of
the violation. (B) The number of, and severity of, the violations.
(C) The economic effect of the penalty on the violator. (D) Whether
the violator took good faith measures to comply with this chapter and the time
these measures were taken. (E) The willfulness of the violator’s
misconduct. (F) The deterrent effect that the imposition of the penalty
would have on both the violator and the regulated community as a whole.
(G) Any other factor that justice may require.”
The Proposed Consent
Judgment provides that Baker’s will pay a civil penalty in the amount of $7,000.00.
(Second Amended Krikorian Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. C., ¶ 4.) In compliance with Health and Safety Code section 25249.12, the Proposed Consent
Judgment provides that 75% ($5,250.00) of the civil penalty shall be disbursed
to the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, and the
remaining 25% ($1,750.00) shall be paid to Plaintiff. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff’s counsel asserts that the “penalty is appropriate given a
number of mitigating factors, including, without limitation: (1) Defendant’s
willingness to agree, pursuant to the terms of the Consent Judgment, to
discontinue the manufacturing of the Covered Product, or to maintain an
appropriate warning to consumers directly on the label of the packaging or
container of the Covered Product that it contains Lead, and to warn of its
reproductive toxicity and carcinogenic potential; (2) the relatively low lead
levels contained in the Subject Product which, while well in excess of the safe
harbor Maximum Allowable Dosage Level of 0.5 micrograms per grams of product,
were nonetheless well below the thousand-fold level known to cause reproductive
toxicity.” (Second Amended Krikorian Decl., ¶ 14, p. 4.)
Plaintiff asserts that “the nature and severity of the subject
violation is best described as moderate,” and that “Defendant has been very
cooperative in providing Plaintiff with any information requested, and,
consistent with the aims of the Act, has been amenable to crafting an
appropriate resolution.” (Second Amended Mot. at pp. 11:20-21; 12:3-5.) The Court finds that the civil penalty
amount provided for in the Proposed Consent Judgment is reasonable.
Conclusion 
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s second amended motion for entry of stipulated
consent judgment is granted. The Court will sign the proposed Judgment on
Proposition 65 Settlement submitted on May 30, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
