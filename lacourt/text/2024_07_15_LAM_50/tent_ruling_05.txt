[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Jewelers Mutual Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default
judgment against Defendants R Purnell Jewelers, Richard Joseph Purnell, and
Valerie M. Purnell (collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiff seeks judgment
against each of the Defendants in the total amount of $24,775.77, comprising
$24,102.32 in damages and $673.45 in costs. 
The
Court notes a few defects with the requests for default judgment. 
First,
no proposed judgment (Form JUD-100) was submitted with any of
the requests. Pursuant to ¿California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800, subd¿. (a)(6), the request must include “¿[a] proposed form
of judgment.¿”
Second,
the requests for court judgment (Forms CIV-100) pertaining to R Purnell
Jewelers and Richard Joseph Purnell do not appear to have been filed. Rather,
these documents show that they were “electronically received” on March 1, 2024.
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s requests for default judgment
without prejudice. The Court will discuss further proceedings with Plaintiff at
the hearing.
