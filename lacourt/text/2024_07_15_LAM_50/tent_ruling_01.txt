[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
MOTION FOR ORDER
  UNDER CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 377.32 TO APPOINT PAULA R. GREEN AS
  SUCCESSOR-IN-INTEREST PLAINTIFF IN PLACE OF DOROTHY L. GREEN
 



            
            On August 20, 2019, Plaintiffs Dorothy L. Green and
Paula R. Green (“Paula Green”) filed this action against Defendants Patricia
“Patty” Glaser, Glaser Weil LLP, and Adam Pines. The Complaint alleges causes
of action for (1) legal malpractice and (2) breach of fiduciary duty.
            Paula
Green filed a motion “to
appoint her as successor plaintiff to the late Dorothy L. Green in this
action.” Defendant Glaser Weil Fink Howard Avchen &
Shapiro LLP opposed the motion. In addition, non-parties Matthew Green and
Robert Green filed oppositions to the motion. 
            On
July 5, 2024, Paula Green filed a “reply” in support of the motion indicating, inter alia, that “Paula Green withdraws her Motion for
Appointment as Successor in Interest to Dorothy L. Green in this action.” (Reply
at p. 2:8-9.)

Accordingly,
the instant motion is moot.
