 Case Number:  22STCV16972    Hearing Date:   February 6, 2024    Dept:  29 Motions to Deem the Truth of the Matter Asserted filed by
Plaintiffs Ana Martinez and Walter Melendez.
 
Tentative
The motions are GRANTED. 
Background
On May 23,
2022, Plaintiffs Ana Martinez and Walter Melendez (collectively “Plaintiffs’)
filed their complaint against Defendant Abel Nathaniel Concho (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 through 50 for personal injuries arising out of an auto accident
occurring on October 25, 2020.  Defendant
filed his answer on September 30, 2022.
 
On July
20, 2023, Plaintiff Martinez served on Defendant Request for Admissions (Set
Two). (Plaintiff Martinez Motion, Pellegrino Decl., ¶ 3.) On August 30, 2023, Plaintiff
Melendez served on Defendant Request for Admissions (Set Two). (Plaintiff
Melendez Motion, Pellegrino Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
On December
5, 2023, each Plaintiff filed a motion to deem the truth of the matters
asserted in the Request for Admission propounded on Defendant. 
 
No
opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the matters contained in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the
trial court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.) 
Even if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and]
substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses …
the trial court retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important incentive for parties to
respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,”
the trial court may “deny the motion to compel responses as essentially
unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs
request the Court deem as true the matters specified in the Requests for
Admission (Set Two) propounded by Plaintiff Martinez and Requests for
Admissions (Set Two) propounded by Plaintiff Melendez. 
 
On July
20, 2023, Plaintiff Martinez served on Defendant Request for Admissions (Set
Two). (Plaintiff Martinez Motion, Pellegrino Decl., ¶ 3.) On August 30, 2023,
Plaintiff Melendez served on Defendant Request for Admissions (Set Two).
(Plaintiff Melendez Motion, Pellegrino Decl., ¶ 3.) Defendant has not provided
any responses. (Pellegrino Decls., ¶ 8.) 
 
Plaintiffs
need not show anything more.  The Court
GRANTS the motions of both Plaintiffs.
 
Plaintiffs’
requests for sanctions are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  Given the relatively straightforward nature
of a motion to deem the truth of the matters, and the economies of scale
associated with filing multiple discovery motions, the Court sets sanctions on
each motion in the amount of $436.65, calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney
work, multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of $250 per hour, plus a $61.65
filing fee.  (See Pellegrino Decls., ¶
9.)
 
Conclusion
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’
motions to deem the truth of the matters asserted are GRANTED. 
 
The
Court ORDERS that all matters specified in Plaintiff Martinez’s Requests for
Admission (Set Two) and in Plaintiff Melendez’s Requests for Admissions (Set
Two) are deemed admitted as true by Defendant. 
 
The
Court GRANTS in part Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
The
Court ORDERS Defendant to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act
to each Plaintiff in the amount of $436.65 ($873.30 in total) within 30 days of
notice.
 
Moving
Parties are ordered to give notice.
