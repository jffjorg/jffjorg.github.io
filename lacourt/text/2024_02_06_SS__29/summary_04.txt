English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Angelica Arroyo's motions to compel Defendant Leonardo Moreno Gonzalez's responses to discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One), and a motion to deem the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One) as admitted. The ruling grants the request for sanctions against Defendant and his counsel, Shingo Andrew Amano of the Martinez, Dietrich & Zarcone Legal Group, in the amount of $1,534.95, which includes $511.65 in attorney fees and a $61.65 filing fee. The ruling explains that Defendant's failure to respond to discovery requests was not substantially justified and that the late service of discovery responses does not render moot the request for sanctions.
