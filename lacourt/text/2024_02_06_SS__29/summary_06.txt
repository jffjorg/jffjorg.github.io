And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel plaintiff Connie Binkley's responses to the defendant's request for production of documents (Set One). The plaintiff did not respond to the request, which was served on July 17, 2023. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant written responses without objection within 30 days of notice.

The judge has also granted the defendant's request for sanctions in part, ordering the plaintiff and her counsel to pay monetary sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $526.65 within 30 days of notice. The sanctions are calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney work, multiplied by counsel's billing rate of $310 per hour, plus a $61.65 filing fee.

The judge has noted that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the request for production does not divest the court of its authority to hear the motion to compel responses, and that the court retains the authority to hear the motion even if the untimely response does not contain objections and substantially resolve the issues raised by the motion. The judge has emphasized the importance of parties responding to discovery in a timely fashion, and has awarded sanctions to the defendant as a result of the plaintiff's failure to do so.
