And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to continue trial or, in the alternative, to specially set the hearing on its motion for summary judgment. The Judge has denied the request to advance the hearing date on the summary judgment motion, as the Court does not have dates available prior to the current trial date. The Judge has granted the request to continue trial, finding good cause due to the Defendant's need to depose the Plaintiff and prepare its summary judgment motion. The trial will be advanced and continued to a date in early March 2025, and all deadlines will be reset accordingly.
