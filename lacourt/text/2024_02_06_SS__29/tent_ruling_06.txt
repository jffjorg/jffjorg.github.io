Production (Set One) filed by Defendant American Freight Outlet Stores, LLC.
 
Tentative
The motion to compel is granted.  The request for sanctions is granted in part.
Background
On September 1, 2022, Plaintiff Connie
Binkley (“Plaintiff”) filed her complaint against Defendants American Freight
Outlet Stores, LLC, LW Acquisitions, LLC, and
DOES 1 through 10, for the causes of action of (1) General Negligence and (2) Premises
Liability. 
 
On July
17, 2023, Defendant American Freight Outlet Stores, LLC (“Defendant”) served Plaintiff
with Request for Production of Documents (Set One). (Stevens Decl., ¶ 4.)
Plaintiff did not respond.
 
On January
9, 2024, Defendant filed the Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Request for Production (Set One). 
 
No opposition was filed. 
 
Legal Standard
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7
of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the
trial court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.) 
Even if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and]
substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses …
the trial court retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important incentive for parties to
respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,”
the trial court may “deny the motion to compel responses as essentially
unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)  
Discussion
On July
17, 2023, Defendant Plaintiff with Request for Production of Documents (Set
One). (Stevens Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff did not respond. (Id., ¶ 7.)
 
Defendant
need show nothing more. As such, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Request for
Production of Documents (Set One).
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in part.  Given the relatively straightforward nature
of a motion to compel initial responses, the Court sets sanctions on the motion
in the amount of $526.65, calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney work,
multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of $310 per hour, plus a $61.65 filing
fee.  (See Stevens Decl., ¶ 9.)
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to
Defendant’s Requests for Production (Set One) is GRANTED.  
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant
written responses, without objection, within 30 days of notice.
Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in part.  
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff and counsel of record the Law
Offices of Brian J. Breiter, LLP, jointly and severally, to pay monetary
sanctions to Defendant under the Civil Discovery Act in the total amount of
$526.65 within 30 days of notice.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
