And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the motion to contest the good faith of the settlement by Specialty Healthcare Properties, LLC, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The settlement is between Nune Badalyan, a defendant, and the two plaintiffs, Sigrid Hazel Soto and Jorge Manrique, for a total amount of $50,000. The court has considered the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates, including the rough approximation of the plaintiffs' total recovery, the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of the settlement proceeds, and the recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than they would if they were found liable after a trial. The court finds that the settlement is not in the ballpark and that Badalyan has not met her initial burden of presenting evidence sufficient to show that the settlement is in good faith. The motion is granted without prejudice to Badalyan submitting a subsequent application or motion for a good faith determination.
