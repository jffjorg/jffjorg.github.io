And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by Andrews International, Inc. and Allied Universal Risk Advisory and Consulting Services, Inc. (Allied) to enforce a settlement agreement, set aside the default and default judgment, and amend the judgment.

The court denies the motion to enforce the settlement agreement because the parties did not enter into a written agreement that can be enforced under the summary procedures of Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.

The court grants the motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered against Andrews International, Inc. under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5 because the service of the summons did not result in actual notice to the party, and the lack of notice was not caused by avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect.

The court sets aside the default entered on November 5, 2019, and the default judgment entered on November 30, 2022.

The court denies as moot the motion to amend the judgment.

The court orders Allied to give notice of the ruling.
