Legal Standard
A party
must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the matters contained in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the trial court of
its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.) 
Even if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and]
substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses …
the trial court retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important
incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding
party [does not] take the motion off calendar or narrow its scope to the issue
of sanctions,” the trial court may “deny the motion to
compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just
impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
Discussion
On November
30, 2022, Plaintiff served Defendant with Form Interrogatories (Set One),
Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Admission (Set One). (Allton
Decls., ¶2.)  At the time of filing this motion,
Plaintiff had not received responses. (Id., ¶6.)
 
Defendant
(belatedly) served initial responses to the discovery on November 2, 2023,
almost a year late. (Amano Decls., ¶ 2.) 
 
Therefore,
the motion to compel responses to interrogatories is denied as moot, and the motion
for a deemed-admitted order is denied.  
 
The late
service of discovery responses does not, however, render moot the request for sanctions.  The requests for sanctions are granted.  Without these motions, it is unclear whether
Defendant would have ever responded to the discover requests, and Defendant’s
failure to comply with his obligations under the Civil Discovery Act was not
substantially justified.  Given
the relatively straightforward nature of a motion to compel initial responses,
and the economies of scale associated with filing multiple discovery motions,
the Court sets sanctions on each motion in the amount of $511.65, calculated
based on 1 hours of attorney work, multiplied by attorney’s billing rate of $450.00
per hour plus the $61.65 filing fee.  (Allton
Decls., ¶ 7.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES as MOOT Plaintiff’s motions
to compel responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) and Form Interrogatories
(Set One).
 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for an order deeming admitted as true the
matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One).
 
The
Court GRANTS in part the request for sanctions.
 
The Court ORDERS Defendant and counsel of
record Shingo Andrew Amano of the Martinez, Dietrich & Zarcone Legal Group,
jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff in the total
amount of $1,534.95 ($511.65 per motion multiplied by three motions) within 30
days of notice. 
 
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
