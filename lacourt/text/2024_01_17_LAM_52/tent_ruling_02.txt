 Case Number:  23STCP03935    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2024    Dept:  52 Petitioner J.G. Wentworth
Originations, LLC’s Verified Petition for Approval of Transfer of Payment
Rights 
Petitioner J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC petitions
for approval of transfer of structured settlement rights by payee Cecily
Hunter.  “A transfer of structured
settlement payment rights is void unless a court reviews and approves the
transfer and finds … [t]he transfer of the structured settlement payment rights
is fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the payee, taking into
account the welfare and support of his or her dependents.”  (Ins. Code, § 10137(a).)  To approve such a transfer, the court must
make “express written findings” including that “[t]he transfer is in the best
interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the
payee’s dependents.”  (Ins. Code, §
10139.5(a)(1).)  
            The
court cannot make that express written finding. 
Payee Cecily Hunter agreed to transfer her right to a payment of
$76,116.95 on December 9, 2024.  (Petition,
p. 7; Ex. A, § 2.A.)  The court notes,
however, that the order approving compromise of the claim in 2004 states Hunter
will be paid $86,116.95 on that date. (Ex. D, pp. 4 -5.)  Under the transfer agreement, petitioner will
pay Hunter $58,940.65.  (Pet., p. 7; Ex.
A, § 10.)  Hunter therefore “will be
paying the equivalent of an interest rate of 24.99% per year.”  (Ex. A, § 10.)  
The rate of 24.99% is too high.  If payee Cecily Hunter waits until December
9, 2024, she will receive $17,176.30 more than petitioner agreed to pay her
now.  This transfer is not fair and
reasonable and not in Hunter’s best interest. 
Waiting 11 months and receiving an extra $17,176.30 is in her best
interest.  Petitioner shows no basis to
conclude otherwise. 
Disposition
The court hereby denies petitioner
J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC’s petition for approval for transfer of
payment rights.
