And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC's petition for approval of the transfer of structured settlement payment rights from Cecily Hunter. The Judge finds that the transfer agreement is not fair and reasonable, as it would result in Hunter paying an interest rate of 24.99% per year, whereas she would receive $17,176.30 more if she waits until December 9, 2024. The Judge concludes that waiting 11 months and receiving the additional amount is in Hunter's best interest. The ruling is based on the insurance code, specifically sections 10137(a) and 10139.5(a)(1), which require that the court make express written findings that the transfer is fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the payee.
