  Case Number:  22STCV34840    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Ryan Reeder’s Motion for Attorney
Fees
Plaintiff Ryan Reeder moves for $11,115 in attorney
fees and $1,301.72 in costs from defendant Adam Sandahl.  
Plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney fees under
the parties’ written loan agreement. 
Plaintiff prevailed on his causes of action for breach of loan agreement
and for common counts arising from the same dispute.  The loan agreement includes the following
provision for attorney fees: “All
costs, expenses and expenditures including, without limitation, the complete
legal costs incurred by enforcing this Agreement as a result of any default by
the Borrower, will be added to the principal then outstanding and will
immediately be paid by the Borrower.” 
(Comp., Ex. 1, ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff
incurred these attorney fees as legal costs to enforce the loan agreement.  Plaintiff therefore may recover attorney fees
pursuant to the contract.  (CCP §
1033.5(a)(10)(A).)
Plaintiff presents
billing records showing $9,655 in attorney fees for 28.4 hours of work.  (Normandin Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. 1.)  Plaintiff reasonably incurred these
fees.  Attorney Tom R. Normandin’s hourly
rate reflects the reasonable market value of his services.
Plaintiff, however, claims
“attorney’s fees of $11,115.00 (including preparation of the instant motion,
analysis of the opposition, preparation of a reply brief, and attendance at the
hearing).”  (Normandin Decl., ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff thus claims an extra $1,460 not
included in the billing entries.  He does
not explain how he arrived at that amount. 
At Normandin’s rate of $350 hourly, that would be 4.17 hours of
fees.  Defendant did not file an
opposition.  Plaintiff did not file a
reply brief.  Plaintiff reasonably incurred
no more than an additional hour of fees at $350 hourly.  The court will therefore award plaintiff $10,005
in attorney fees.
In this motion, plaintiff
also claims $1,301.72 in costs. 
Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs for the same costs.  All costs are facially proper.  Defendant did not move to strike or tax the
memorandum of costs.  The court will
award all costs.
Disposition
            Plaintiff Ryan Reeder’s motion for attorney fees and
costs is granted in part.  Plaintiff Ryan Reeder shall
recover $10,005.00 in attorney fees and $1,301.72 in costs from defendant Adam
Sandahl.
