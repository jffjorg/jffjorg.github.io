ATTORNEY: Joshua Kohanim
CLIENT:
 Plaintiff, Patrick Donald
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
of Record
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
On April 11, 2024, Plaintiff Patrick Donald filed a form
complaint for motor vehicle and negligence arising from Plaintiff entering a
bus operated by Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Authority (LACMTA),
and said bus proceeding “without notice” thereby causing “severe injruies.”
LACMTA answered the complaint on May 14, 2024.
 
RULING: Denied.
Counsel for Plaintiff Patrick Donald moves to be relieved as
counsel of record, due to an “irremediable breakdown in the attorney client
relationship that stands in the way of effective representation.” 
 
Although the motion complies with all procedural
requirements, the motion was only served on Plaintiff, and not on Defendant Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Authority (LACMTA). LACMTA answered on May 14,
2024, and the instant motion was filed on May 31, 2024, thereby entitling
LACMTA to notice of all proceedings. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1014.)
 
Case Management Conference set for September 18, 2024.
 
Moving
attorney to provide notice to all parties.
