Following
the April 16, 2024, filing of the motion, the court stayed the entire action,
due to the bankruptcy of Shift Operations, LLC. Plaintiffs subsequently
dismissed Shift Operations, LLC without prejudice on June 11, 2024, and request
the court reinstate the action to the civil active list. [Declaration of

and Stay, etc.] The OSC re: Bankruptcy Proceedings is currently set for August
28, 2024. The court therefore continues the subject hearing pending the OSC or

active list on August 28, 2024, or sooner, the court will set new hearing
dates, including the instant motion, in order to allow Defendants an
opportunity to oppose.
