And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint by the plaintiffs, Julian Cano and Shaniqua Cones, against the defendants, Capital One, N.A., et al. The plaintiffs are seeking to add new allegations, delete certain claims, and update certain material information. The judge notes that the case has been stayed due to the bankruptcy of Shift Operations, LLC, which was dismissed without prejudice on June 11, 2024. The judge continues the subject hearing pending a further order to show cause regarding the bankruptcy status and stay, or at the subject hearing. If the case is reinstated to the civil active list, the judge will set new hearing dates, including the instant motion, to allow the defendants an opportunity to oppose.
