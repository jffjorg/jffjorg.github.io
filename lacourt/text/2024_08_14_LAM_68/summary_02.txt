And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion of Plaintiff Patrick Donald's attorney, Joshua Kohanim, to be relieved as counsel of record. Kohanim claims that there has been an "irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship" that prevents effective representation. However, the court notes that the motion was only served on the plaintiff and not on the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Authority (LACMTA), which had answered the complaint on May 14, 2024. The court finds that LACMTA is entitled to notice of all proceedings and that the motion should have been served on both parties. The court sets a Case Management Conference for September 18, 2024, and orders the moving attorney to provide notice to all parties.
