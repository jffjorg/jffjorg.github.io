English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., The Permanente Federation LLC, and Southern California Permanente Medical Group to the First Amended Complaint. The ruling states that the first cause of action, alleging wrongful death and survival against the defendants, is not sufficiently alleged as to vicarious liability and direct liability against the defendants. The ruling sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to file an amended pleading relating solely to the first cause of action and background allegations no later than 10 days after this ruling. The ruling also rejects the plaintiff's arguments that the defendants have a duty to protect the plaintiff from the alleged harassment and hostile work environment.
