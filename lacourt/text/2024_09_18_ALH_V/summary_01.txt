And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant City of Glendale to the complaint filed by plaintiff Argine Shanlian. The plaintiff alleges that she was injured while using playground equipment at Carr Park in the City of Glendale, California, and seeks to hold the defendants liable for negligence and a dangerous condition of public property. The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to identify the statutory authority to support her negligence claim and therefore has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the first cause of action for negligence. The plaintiff has 20 days to amend her complaint to address the issues raised by the demurrer.
