**English Summary:**

This is a tentative ruling on a default judgment application filed by BMO HARRIS BANK N.A against ZYG World Inc. and Yurong Lin. The bank alleges the defendants defaulted on two loan agreements. 

The judge is denying the application without prejudice regarding interest and repossession costs. The judge finds that the proposed 18% interest rate is illegal under California law, which limits the interest rate on commercial loans to 10% per annum. 

The court requests the bank to submit a revised calculation of interest using the legal 10% rate.  Additionally, the bank must provide evidence of the repossession fees. If these revisions are submitted before the hearing, the judge will grant the default judgment.

**Summary in English Text:**

This is a tentative ruling for Case Number 23PSCV01427, scheduled for a hearing on September 18, 2023.  BMO Harris Bank N.A., the plaintiff, is seeking a default judgment against ZYG World Inc. and Yurong Lin, the defendants, for defaulting on two loan agreements. The Judge is denying the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice, specifically regarding the calculation of interest and the evidence of repossession costs.  The Judge is questioning the plaintiff's proposed 18% interest rate, stating it may violate California law. The Judge is asking the plaintiff to submit a supplemental declaration with a corrected interest calculation and proof of repossession fees. If the plaintiff provides this information before the hearing, the Judge will likely grant the default judgment, rendering the pending writ of possession applications moot.

**English Text Summary of Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge has tentatively DENIED BMO Harris Bank's application for a default judgment against ZYG World Inc. and Yurong Lin.  The denial is "without prejudice," meaning the bank can reapply. The Judge has two main issues:

1.  **Incorrect Interest Calculation:** The bank requested an 18% interest rate on the defaulted loans.  California law limits this to 10%. The Judge wants the bank to recalculate the interest owed using the legal rate.

2.  **Missing Evidence:** The bank claimed $4,926.22 in repossession costs but didn't provide any documentation to prove these costs.

The Judge has instructed the bank to submit a supplemental declaration before the hearing. This declaration must include: (1) proof of the repossession costs, and (2) a revised calculation of the interest owed, using the 10% legal limit. If the bank provides this information, the Judge will likely *grant* the default judgment at the hearing. If the default judgment is granted, the bank's separate requests for a writ of possession (the right to seize property) will become unnecessary (moot). The hearing for the Writ of Possession for Defendant Lin is scheduled for September 28, 2023.
