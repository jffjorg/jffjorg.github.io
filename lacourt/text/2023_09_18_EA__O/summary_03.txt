**English Summary:**

This is a tentative ruling on a default judgment application filed by BMO HARRIS BANK N.A against ZYG World Inc. and Yurong Lin. The bank alleges the defendants defaulted on two loan agreements. 

The judge is denying the application without prejudice regarding interest and repossession costs. The judge finds that the proposed 18% interest rate is illegal under California law, which limits the interest rate on commercial loans to 10% per annum. 

The court requests the bank to submit a revised calculation of interest using the legal 10% rate.  Additionally, the bank must provide evidence of the repossession fees. If these revisions are submitted before the hearing, the judge will grant the default judgment.
