The judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) in this lemon law case. 

The Plaintiff is dropping claims against Envision for breach of warranty and Song-Beverly Act violations, but adding claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, violation of California's Unfair Competition Law, and violation of the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act. 

The judge found that the new legal theories are based on the same facts and that granting the amendment would not prejudice the Defendant.  This decision allows the Plaintiff to pursue additional claims against Envision based on evidence suggesting the vehicle was misrepresented as new.
