And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint (FAC). The plaintiff seeks to add claims against Envision for fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, and violation of Business and Professions Code ยง 17200 and California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act. The plaintiff argues that Envision sold used vehicles as new, and discovered evidence of this during the discovery process. The court finds that the proposed amendments relate to the same general set of facts and do not cause prejudice to the opposing party. Therefore, the court exercises its discretion liberally in favor of the amendments, granting the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint.
