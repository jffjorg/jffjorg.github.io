**Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff, David Shakhbazyan's, motion to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) in his lemon law case against Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC and Envision WC MB Auto. The Plaintiff seeks to dismiss certain claims against Envision and add new claims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, and violation of California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act. The Judge's decision is based on the principle of liberally allowing amendments to pleadings to ensure resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit, as long as the amendments relate to the same general set of facts, which the Judge believes is the case here. The Plaintiff's claim is that Envision sold him a used vehicle as new, which he discovered during the discovery process after experiencing problems with the vehicle.

**Summary in English Text:**

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to amend their complaint in this lemon law case (Case Number 22PSCV01792). The Plaintiff, David Shakhbazyan, originally sued Mercedes-Benz and Envision for breach of warranty and violations of the Song-Beverly Act and Uniform Commercial Code, related to the purchase of a vehicle that was represented as new.  The Plaintiff now seeks to amend the complaint to drop those claims against Envision, and instead add claims of fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, and violations of California's Business & Professions Code § 17200 and Consumer Legal Remedies Act against Envision. This is based on evidence discovered during the case, including a Lease Application that indicates the vehicle was "used," contradicting the initial representation of it being "new." The Judge found that, although new legal theories are being introduced, the amendments relate to the same general set of facts as the original complaint, and therefore, the motion to amend is granted, favoring a full resolution of the dispute.
