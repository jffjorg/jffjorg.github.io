Local Rule 3.214 [$2,890.00 + ($177,983.37 - $100,000.00) x 1%]. 
 


[3] As the complaint seeks repossession fees, recovery
for this cost is permissible. (See (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822 [discussion on damages on
default judgment; see also CCP section 580 [“The relief granted to the
plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that which he or she shall have
demanded in his or her complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11,
or in the statement provided for by Section 425.115.”].) However, the court
requests evidence of the repossession fee (i.e., an invoice).
