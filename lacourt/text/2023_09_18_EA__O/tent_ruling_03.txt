 Case Number:  23PSCV01427    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2023    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
(1)   Plaintiff
BMO HARRIS BANK N.A’s APPLICATION FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT is DENIED
without prejudice re: interest and evidence of repossession costs; but see
‘Conclusion’ section below. 
 
(2)  
Writ of Possession Re: ZYG World Inc. is TBD/MOOT.

 
Background
 
This is a contracts case. Plaintiff BMO HARRIS BANK N.A
alleges that Plaintiff and Defendants ZYG WORLD INC, a California corporation;
YURONG LIN, an individual, entered into two Loan and Security Agreements, and
Defendants have defaulted on both.[1]

 
On May 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants for
Breach of Written Agreement, Breach of Continuing Guaranty, Claim and Delivery,
and Conversion.
 
On May 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed two applications for writ
of possession (one as to each Defendant). (Based upon the ‘Notice of
Application[s] for Writ of Possession and Hearing’ filed on 5/26/23, the
hearing on ZYG’s application is scheduled for 9/18/23 and hearing on Lin’s
application is scheduled for 9/28/23).
 
On July 21, 2023, default was entered against Defendants.
 
On August 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant application
for default judgment.
 
 
 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff seeks entry of judgment against Defendants for the
total amount of $201,026.56, calculated as follows: $177,983.37 in damages,
$13,761.60 in prejudgment interest, $3,669.83 in attorney fees,[2]
$685.54, and $4,926.22 in repossession costs.[3]

 
The principal due on agreement #0001 is $55,280.95 (with
incurred interest and fees in $4,799.54) and the principal due on agreement
#7001 is $122,702.42 (with incurred interest and fees of $10,868.28).
 
According to the complaint,
attached agreements, and declaration filed in support of the application for
default judgment, Plaintiff seeks default interest at a rate of 18% per annum. (See
Schrepel Decl., Ex. 87, pp. 33-35 of 35 of PDF [Loan Damage Calculator]. However,
California Constitution, article XV, section 1 limits the interest rate for a
‘loan or forbearance’ of money not primarily for personal, family or household
purposes, to the higher of: (1) 10 percent per annum. Thus, even if the agreements
(for loans) allow for an interest rate higher than 10%, an interest rate of 18%
is illegal.  
 
Therefore, the court requests Plaintiff to provide a
computation of interest using an interest rate that is in conformity with the
state law. 
 
Conclusion
 
As all other application material is complied with, rather
than have Plaintiff submit a new application and set a new hearing date, the court asks Plaintiff to
submit a supplemental declaration that (1) provides evidence of the
repossession fee(s) and (2) an updated computation of interest. Should
Plaintiff provide this supplemental declaration within a reasonable time prior
to the hearing, the court will grant the application during the hearing,
subject to the filing of a new/modified proposed order. Effectively, should the
court grant the application for entry of default judgment, that would render
the applications for writ of possession moot.
