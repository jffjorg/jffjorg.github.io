And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on agreements entered on different dates (#0001 and #7001). The court calculates a total of $2,890.00 + ($177,983.37 - $100,000.00) x 1% as the repossession fees. The Judge finds that the complaint seeks repossession fees, which are permissible, but requests evidence of the repossession fee (an invoice) to support the claim. The Judge notes that the relief granted to the plaintiff cannot exceed what was demanded in the complaint, and cites relevant laws and cases (CCP section 580, Greenup v. Rodman, and CCP sections 425.11 and 425.115).
