Here is the English text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling considers two agreements (#0001 and #7001) entered on different dates. The ruling addresses the issue of calculating certain fees according to the Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.214. It mentions that repossession fees can be recovered, referencing a 1986 California case, Greenup v. Rodman. The ruling quotes a specific part of the California Code of Civil Procedure, CCP section 580. It further discusses a requested payment calculated by an established local court rule but the payment, described by law will have no over charge which demands documented support that this action could make proof needed legally - meaning proper repossession charge by "paper record for reposition evidence which, when is completed (called payment here 'fact repossession charges and  for other repon process related law cost will proceed normally (thus here said case: reprocessing fact money payments (of total court fact 'fact sum charges'.), all done without, stated fee costs: when total has then already legal stated charges' reponse.).).

significant\_statements:
- "The Agreements (#0001 and #7001) were entered on different dates."
- "Calculated pursuant to Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.214 [$2,890.00 + ($177,983.37 - $100,000.00) x 1%]."
- "As the complaint seeks repossession fees, recovery for this cost is permissible. However, the court requests evidence of the repossession fee (i.e., an invoice)."

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the agreements #0001 and #7001, which were entered on different dates. The Judge calculated the repossession fees according to Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.214. The Judge permits the recovery of repossession fees, but requests evidence of the repossession fee, such as an invoice. The Judge referred to Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822 and CCP section 580 regarding damages on default judgment.
