Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the County's demurrer to Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint with leave to amend. The demurrer was filed by the County in August 2023, and the Court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to support their claims against the County, including claims of negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and sexual battery. The Court also finds that the County's immunities under Government Code sections 818.2, 818.8, 820.2, 820.4, and 820.8 apply to the case. The Court orders the Plaintiffs to file their amended complaint within 30 days of the date of the order.
