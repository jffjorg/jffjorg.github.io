considered the moving papers. The motion is GRANTED. 

 

Background
            Daniel
Jacobs (Plaintiff) was a Clinical Associate Professor in the College of
Business Administration at his former employer, Loyola Marymount University
(Defendant). Plaintiff brings a Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) claim
against Defendant and alleges several violations of the California Labor Code. 
            The
motion before the Court is Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel filed on December 14, 2023. 
Legal
Standard
            An
application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form
MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)),
MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053
(Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed order must
specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the
date of trial, if known. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) Further, the
requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have
appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).)
Discussion
             Here,
Plaintiff’s counsel has met all the necessary requirements to grant the Motion.
Counsel has filed both forms MC-051 and MC-052. Additionally, form MC-052
denotes all upcoming hearings, including the Case Management Conference on September
4, 2024 and the trial beginning on September 16, 2024. Finally, counsel files
this Motion under Rule 1.16 of the Rules of Professional Conduct noting that
there has been an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.
All appropriate notice has been given.
 
            Based
on the foregoing, the court grants Plaintiff’s counsel’s Motion to Be Relieved
As Counsel.  
 
 
 
            It
is so ordered.
