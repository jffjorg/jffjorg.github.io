And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the first amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add new parties, title documents, and theories of liability to the complaint. The defendants, Arrowhead Financial Group, et al., demurred to the amended complaint, arguing that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations, vague and ambiguous, and do not plead fraud with the requisite specificity. The plaintiff argues that leave to amend should be liberally granted, except where an unreasonable delay would cause prejudice to the other party. The judge finds that the proposed amendments will not prejudice the defendants and grants the motion.
