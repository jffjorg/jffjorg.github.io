  Case Number:  23STCV02267    Hearing Date:   December 1, 2023    Dept:  74 Andrew
Leavenworth v. Self-Realization Church, et al.
Defendant Chris Bagley’s Demurrer to
First Amended Complaint
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a dispute over personal property.
            On
June 22, 2023, Plaintiff Andrew Leavenworth (Plaintiff) filed a first amended
complaint (FAC) on behalf of Joan Wight (Decedent). Chris Bagley (Defendant
Bagley), Self-Realization Fellowship Church, Gurbir Maker, Ujjal Maker, Alisa
Miller, Doris Schneider, and Rosario Hurley are the named Defendants.
            The
FAC alleges the following causes of action against Defendant: financial elder
abuse, conversion, and violation of Penal Code section 496.
            On
July 24, 2023, Defendant Chris Bagley filed this demurrer.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (¿¿Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318¿¿.) “¿To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.¿” (¿¿C.A. v. William S. Hart Union
High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872¿¿.) For the purpose of testing
the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer
admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (¿Aubry v. Tri-City
Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967¿.) A demurrer “¿does not
admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.¿” (¿¿Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713¿¿.) DISCUSSION  
Conspiracy
            “In order to state a cause of action
based upon a conspiracy theory the plaintiff must allege the formation and
operation of the conspiracy, the wrongful act or acts done pursuant to it, and
the damage resulting from such acts.” (117 Sales Corp. v. Olsen (1978)
80 Cal.App.3d 645, 650.) Defendant Bagley contends the FAC does not contain
allegations that he engaged in any actionable conduct. But Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant Bagley and Defendant Self-Realization Fellowship Church
(Defendant SRF) entered a conspiracy with the other named Defendants. Plaintiff
alleges all Defendants (including Defendant Bagley) and other SRF monastics and
members entered a conspiracy to wrongfully acquire Decedent’s property and
intellectual property rights for Defendant SRF. (FAC, ¶ 53.) Paragraph 57 of
the FAC details some of Defendant Bagley’s acts to further the conspiracy.
Plaintiff also alleges resulting damage. (FAC, ¶¶ 187-188, 202-203, 217-218,
230, 234, 240, 244, 252, 260, 271, 280, 284.) Thus, Plaintiff has sufficiently
alleged a conspiracy in which Defendant Bagley participated.
Third Cause of Action – Financial
Elder Abuse
            Financial elder abuse occurs when a
person takes, retains, or assists in taking or retaining the personal property
of an elder for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud. (Welf. & Inst.
Code, § 15610.30, subd. (a)(1)(2).) 
            Defendant
Bagley contends Plaintiff’s claim for financial elder abuse fails. But
Plaintiff alleges in part that Defendant SRF’s
monastics and agents stole Decedent’s personal property from her home in
January 2019, loaded the personal property into vans owned by Defendant SRF,
and transported the personal property to Defendant SRF’s headquarters. (FAC, ¶
143.) Moreover, Defendant SRF allegedly received
the stolen property. (FAC, ¶ 144.) A list of Decedent’s missing personal
property, compiled the following October, supports as much. (FAC, ¶ 166.) Defendant Bagley claims the FAC lacks any
allegation that he directed or assisted in the “looting.” However, Plaintiff
alleges Defendant Bagley was a co-conspirator of
Defendant SRF and its monastics. (FAC, ¶ 53.) Moreover, the trier of fact could
conclude that the alleged misconduct furthered the Defendants’ conspiracy to
wrongfully obtain Decedent’s personal property. 
            In
addition, Defendant Bagley argues fraud-based claims must be supported by
specific facts (who, what, where, when, and how). (See Estate of Marler (1957)
148 Cal.App.2d 30, 37.) But a financial elder abuse claim need not be based on
fraud; it may also be based, as here, on the taking or retention of personal
property for wrongful use. Thus, the court overrules the demurrer to this cause
of action.
Fifth Cause of Action – Conversion
            “Conversion
is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property of another.” (Oakdale
Village Group v. Fong (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 539, 543-544.) The elements for
this cause of action are as follows: (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or right to
possession of the property at the time of the conversion, (2) the defendant’s
conversion by a wrongful act, and (3) damages. (Farmers Ins. Exchange v.
Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 451.) 
            In
support of his demurrer, Defendant Bagley contends no allegations in the FAC
indicate he himself converted Decedent’s personal property. As noted above,
though, Plaintiff alleges in part that Defendant SRF’s monastics and agents
stole Decedent’s personal property from her home in January 2019, loaded the
personal property into vans owned by Defendant SRF, and transported the
personal property to Defendant SRF’s headquarters. (FAC, ¶ 143.) Moreover,
Defendant SRF allegedly received the personal property. (FAC, ¶ 144.) Plaintiff
has further provided a list of items missing from Decedent’s home. (FAC, ¶
166.) For his part, Defendant Bagley was a co-conspirator of Defendant SRF and
its monastics. (FAC, ¶ 53.) The trier of fact could conclude that the alleged
conversion furthered the Defendants’ conspiracy to wrongfully obtain Decedent’s
personal property. Given the foregoing, the court overrules the demurrer to
this cause of action.
Sixth Cause of Action – Violation of
Penal Code section 496 
            Penal Code section 496 concerns the
receipt of stolen property. The elements for this cause of action are as
follows: (1) the property has been stolen, (2) the accused received it, and (3)
and the accused knew the property was stolen. (People v. Stuart (1969)
272 Cal.App.2d 653, 656.) 
            Defendant
Bagley argues the FAC lacks factual allegations to support this claim against
him. The court disagrees. Plaintiff alleges in part that Defendant SRF’s
monastics and agents stole Decedent’s personal property from her home in
January 2019, loaded the personal property into vans owned by Defendant SRF,
and transported the personal property to Defendant SRF’s headquarters. (FAC, ¶
143.) Moreover, Defendant SRF allegedly received the personal property. (FAC, ¶
144.) Plaintiff has further provided a list of items missing from Decedent’s
home. (FAC, ¶ 166.) For his part, Defendant Bagley was an alleged
co-conspirator of Defendant SRF and its monastics. (FAC, ¶ 53.) The trier of
fact could conclude that the alleged receipt of stolen property furthered the
Defendants’ conspiracy to wrongfully obtain Decedent’s personal property. Thus,
the court overrules the demurrer to this cause of action.
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court overrules Defendant’s demurrer.
Defendant
must file and serve his answer within 20 days.
Defendant
shall give notice.
