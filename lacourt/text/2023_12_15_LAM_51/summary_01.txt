English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling denies Ford Motor Company's motion for summary adjudication of the second and third causes of action brought by plaintiffs Laura Pensamiento and Marcelo Fleitas. The motion was based on the defendant's contention that it offered to repurchase or replace the subject vehicle, there were no facts of a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff, and no facts that the defendant intended to defraud the plaintiffs. The court finds that the defendant has not met its burden to show that there are no triable issues of material fact and that the motion is denied in its entirety. The court notes that the defendant's arguments are the same as those presented in a prior motion for summary judgment and that there is no newly discovered evidence or change in law warranting the reconsideration of the motion."
