And here is the English-text summary:

This Tentative Ruling addresses a Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and a Motion to Strike Portions of the First Amended Complaint filed by Defendant R&E Management, Inc. (Defendant) against Plaintiff Jessica Vacha (Plaintiff). The Demurrer argues that the fifth cause of action for retaliation pursuant to Civil Code section 1942.5 is insufficient. The Court disagrees and OVERRULES the Demurrer. The Motion to Strike seeks to strike sections of the Complaint that allege Defendant acted with malice, fraud, and/or oppression and that Plaintiff should obtain punitive damages. The Court disagrees and DENIES the Motion to Strike. Plaintiff had alleged that she made complaints to Defendant for more than a year, including as recently as April 2023, and that Defendant served an unlawful 3-day notice to pay rent or quiet, intending to terminate the tenancy. The Court finds that these allegations are sufficient to constitute the elements of a cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 1942.5.
