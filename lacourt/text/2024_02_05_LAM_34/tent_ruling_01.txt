II.      
ANALYSIS
 
 
        The Request for Default Judgment is
GRANTED in part. 
 
        The Court has reviewed the Verified
Petition and finds that all requirements for such a petition have been met. 
 
It is DECLARED AND ADJUDGED that the
mechanic’s lien described below is expired and unenforceable, that the property
is released from the claim of lien, and that the lien no longer exists. 
 
California Mechanic’s Lien, recorded on November 23, 2022 in
the Official Records of the Recorder’s Office of Los Angeles County,
California, Instrument #20221105367, Page 007, located at 20315 Hartland
Street, Canoga Park, California 91306. 
 
        However, the Court is unable to award
any damages because no damages were prayed for in the Verified Petition.  Plaintiff’s   prayer
in his complaint for “Such other relief as may be just” is not sufficient to
put defendants on notice that damages might be awarded.  (See Complaint, p. 2:27.)
 
        The Court awards the costs requested,
except for attorney’s fees. Although attorney’s fees are available here
pursuant to Civil Code section 8488, subdivision (c), attorney’s fees cannot be
awarded on a default judgment because no damages have been awarded. Further, Plaintiff’s
counsel did not file an attorney’s fees declaration; the Court is unable to
award attorney’s fees without knowing the reasonableness of the fees
incurred.  
 
Costs are AWARDED in favor of Petitioner and against Respondents,
jointly and severally, in the total amount of $665.61.
