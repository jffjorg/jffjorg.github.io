 Case Number:  23STCV28097    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78   YU ZHENG CHEN, AN INDIVIDUAL,Plaintiff, vs. BRADLEY P. CHILDERS, AN INDIVIDUAL, ET AL.,  Defendants.  Case No: 23STCV28097 Hearing Date: January 24, 2024      [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:  SPECIALLY APPEARING DEFENDANT RONALD M. HIRANO’S MOTION TO QUASH PLAINTIFF’S SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT Specially Appearing Defendant Ronald M. Hirano’s Motion to Quash Plaintiff’s Summons and Complaint is GRANTED.Moving party to provide notice and to file proof of service of such notice within five court days after the date of this order.FACTUAL BACKGROUND This is an action for Breach of Contract and Forgery. PROCEDURAL HISTORY On November 16, 2023, Plaintiff Yu Zheng Chen filed the Complaint asserting causes of action for breach of contract and forgery of documents and evidence. On December 26, 2023, Specially Appearing Defendant Ronald M. Hirano moved to quash service of summons. DISCUSSION I. MOTION TO QUASH PLAINTIFF’S SUMMONS AND COMPLAINTSpecially Appearing Defendant Ronald M. Hirano moves the Court to quash Plaintiff’s service of the Summons and Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 414.10.“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).) Where service is challenged, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the facts requisite to an effective service. “When a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413; see also Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160.) However, a proof of service containing a declaration from a registered process server invokes a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of the facts stated in the return. (Evid. Code, § 647; see American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.)Here, Plaintiff has not filed any proof of service of summons on Specially Appearing Defendant Ronald M. Hirano. In addition, Plaintiff has not opposed the motion. Thus, as Plaintiff has failed to prove the facts requisite to effectuate service, Defendant’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons is granted. DATED: January 24, 2024   ________________________________ Hon.
