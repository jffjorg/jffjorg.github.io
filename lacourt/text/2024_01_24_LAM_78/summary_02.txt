And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant/Cross-Complainant's motion to quash the deposition notice and orders him to appear for deposition within 30 days. The parties are required to meet and confer to set a mutually agreeable date for the deposition. The Judge also grants a protective order to protect confidential information in response to the Plaintiff's request. The motion to disqualify counsel must be filed separately if the Defendant/Cross-Complainant believes the Plaintiff's attorney should be disqualified from the case. The Court declines to impose sanctions and notes that the matter could have been resolved without the intervention of the court.
