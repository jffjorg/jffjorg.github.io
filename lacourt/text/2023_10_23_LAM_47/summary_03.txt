And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Attorney Dale J. Park to be relieved as counsel for Defendant David Okju An. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the defendant's failure to pay the attorney's fees. The judge found that the risk of prejudice to the plaintiff was relatively low, given that the trial is approximately six months away. The judge also noted that the court has discretion to deny an attorney's request to withdraw where the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding. However, in this case, the judge found that the circumstances warranted permitting withdrawal. The motion is granted, contingent on the moving counsel serving notice on all parties within 10 days of this order.
