And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the motion filed by defendants Amrep, Inc. and Zep, Inc. to require plaintiffs Timothy Joseph Toups (deceased), Breanna Patton, and Kylie Young to post an undertaking in the amount of $93,140.16. The defendants had argued that the plaintiffs are out-of-state residents and that there is a reasonable possibility of defendants prevailing on the causes of action asserted against them. However, the judge found that the defendants failed to demonstrate a reasonable possibility of prevailing and that the plaintiffs are indigent. The judge noted that the plaintiffs have provided sworn declarations stating that they are unable to afford the bond and are unable to obtain the undertaking as a loan. The judge has exercised its discretion to waive the requirement of posting an undertaking and has denied the motion.
