STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and elder abuse
arising from a series of agreements with Defendants to perform construction
work for Plaintiff
 
Attorney Dale J. Park, counsel for
Defendant David Okju An, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Dale J. Park, counsel for
Defendant David Okju An, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) and included a proof of service as required by California Rules
of Court rule 3.1362(d).  Moving counsel’s
declaration states that he served Defendant An by mail and confirmed the
address is current by way of telephone. (MC-052 ¶ 3.) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause as long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
Here, the matter is set for trial on April
16, 2024 at 10:00 AM. (MC-052 ¶ 6.) The next hearing on calendar is a Post-Mediation
Status Conference scheduled for November 2, 2023 at 8:30 am. (MC-052 ¶ 5.).
Moving Counsel’s
declaration states that he is no longer able to represent Defendant due to a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and Defendant’s failure to pay
his fees.  (MC-052 ¶ 2.) As trial is
approximately six months out, the Court finds the risk of prejudice to
Plaintiff to be relatively low. In light of the breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship, the Court finds these circumstances warrant
permitting withdrawal.
 
Accordingly, Attorney Dale J. Park’s Motion to Be Relieved
As Counsel for Defendant David Okju An is GRANTED, contingent on Moving Counsel
serving notice on all parties within 10 days of this order. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

ruling the court will still conduct a hearing if any party appears. By
submitting on the tentative you have, in essence, waived your right to be
present at the hearing, and you should be aware that the court may not adopt
the tentative, and may issue an order which modifies the tentative ruling in
whole or in part.
