And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in response to the Defendant's motion to quash service. The Defendant, Jeremy Samuel Grau, disputes that substituted service was ever effected. The Defendant claims to live alone and did not receive a copy of the summons and complaint by mail. The Court found that the Plaintiff's proof of service meets the statutory requirements for substituted service, and therefore, the Defendant has failed to overcome the rebuttable presumption that the service was proper. The Court denied the Defendant's motion to quash service.
