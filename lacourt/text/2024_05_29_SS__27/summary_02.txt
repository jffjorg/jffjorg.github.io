And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion of Plaintiff's Counsel, Alex Vandenberg, to be relieved as counsel due to an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Although no opposition has been filed, the Court finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is proper grounds for withdrawal. However, the Court notes that there is a hearing on demurrer with motion to strike scheduled for May 30, 2024, and that withdrawal at this time would be prejudicial and disrupt the orderly process of justice. Therefore, the Court has continued the motion to May 30, 2024.
