Ruling: MOTIONS TO COMPEL INTIAL RESPONSES AND
REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS ARE GRANTED 
 
Legal Standard
 
A defendant may make a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling without leave of court at any time.
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd.
(a).) The demand for production of documents is not limited by number, but the
request must comply with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.030. A party may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories
that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action and any
additional number of official form interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd.
(a)(1) - (a)(2).) 
 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).) 
 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose
a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone
as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes failing
to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.) 
 
Discussion
 
On January 19, 2024, Defendant Sorough Yegan
served his Demand for Production (Set Number One), Special Interrogatories (Set
Number One), and Form Interrogatories (Set Number One) on Plaintiff William
Kim. Plaintiff failed to serve discovery responses by the statutory deadline.
As of April 15, 2024, the date the present motions were filed, Defendant has
not received the outstanding discovery responses. No opposition or other
documents showing that the discovery responses were served prior to the hearing
have been filed. Thus, the present motions are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ORDERED to serve verified and
complete responses to the discovery requests at issue without objections within
20 days of today.
 
Plaintiff’s non-responsiveness forced
Defendant to file the present motions and incur attorney’s fees. Defendant
requests attorney’s fees in the amount of $585.00 for each of the three
motions. Considering the simplicity of the issues and the lack of opposition,
the Court exercises discretion and lowers the sanction amount to $1000 for all
three motions. Plaintiff and his counsel are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to
pay sanctions of $1000 to Defendant within 20 days of today’s date.
