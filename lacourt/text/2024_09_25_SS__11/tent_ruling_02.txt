   [1]  Defendants state that Smith is bad law and argue that the High Court  wants to overturn it.  (Motion, p.  11.)     The Court disagrees.  In Fulton, the majority found that Smith  did not need to be revisited.  (See Fulton,  supra, 593 U.S. at 533.)  At this point,  it remains good law.     [2]  Defendants cite one post-Fulton case that they claim applies strict  scrutiny to document requests propounded on a church.  (See Motion, p. 14; see also Reply, p.  9.)  Hotchalk, Inc. v. Synod (Or.  Cir. Ct., Aug. 8, 2022 No. 20CV15620) 2022 WL 4299957 (“Hotchalk”) is an  opinion from an Oregon trial court.  The  judge looked at the documents in camera, decided that most should not be  produced, and, in one sentence, mentioned the Perry v. Schwarzenegger (9th  Cir. 2010) 591 F.3d 1147 standard.  (See Hotchalk,  supra, 2022 WL 4299957, at *1.)  The  decision is nonbinding and unhelpful.        [3] Notably, the Second District  found the strict-scrutiny test satisfied in Archbishop.  (See Archbishop, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th  at 437-440.)       [4]  The discovery referee is still considering Defendants’ attorney-client and  work-product objections, so, for now, the Court declines to order production.  **********************************************************************************************************************************************************Southern California Clergy Cases (JCCP 5101)

TENTATIVE RULING

 

Defendants’ motion for summary judgment/adjudication is denied in full.

 

BACKGROUND

 

This action (30-2019-01120133-CU-PO-NJC) is part of the coordinated Southern California Clergy Cases
(JCCP 5101).  Plaintiff claims a priest
named Father Michael Harris sexually abused him at Mater Dei in Orange County
in 1978 when he was a minor.  Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants failed to protect him despite having actual or
constructive knowledge of Harris’s pedophilia.

 

Here, Defendants move for summary judgment/adjudication.

 

LAW

 

Summary
Judgment

 

A defendant or
cross-defendant has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has
no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of
action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is
a complete defense to the cause of action.

 

(Code Civ.
Proc. § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)

 

“The ‘tried and true’ way for defendants to meet their burden
of proof on summary judgment motions is to present affirmative evidence
(declarations, etc.) negating, as a matter of law, an essential element of plaintiff's
claim.”  (Edmond & Karnow, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2023 Update)
¶ 10:241, emphasis in original.)  “A
cause of action ‘cannot be established’ if the undisputed facts presented by
defendant prove the contrary of plaintiff's allegations as a matter of law.” 
(Id. at ¶ 10:241.10, emphasis in original.)  “The moving party's declarations and evidence
will be strictly construed in determining whether they negate (disprove) an
essential element of plaintiff's claim ‘in order to resolve any evidentiary
doubts or ambiguities in plaintiff's [opposing party's] favor.’”  (Id. at ¶ 10:241.20.)

 

A second way to meet the initial burden “is to ‘show’ that an
essential element of plaintiff's claim cannot be established.”  (Id. at ¶ 10:242.)  “Defendant does so by presenting evidence that plaintiff ‘does not possess and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence . . . .”  (Ibid., emphasis in original.)  The moving party must present evidence
of discovery admissions and/or factually devoid “all facts” discovery
responses.  (See id. at ¶¶
10:244-10:245.27.)

 

The third way is to show a
complete defense.  (See id. at ¶
10:246.)  “To ‘show’ a complete defense, defendant must present
admissible evidence of each essential element . . . upon which it bears the burden of proof at
trial.”  (Id. at ¶ 10:247, emphasis in
original.)  “Thus, where a defense has
several elements, lack of substantial evidence on any element bars relief, ‘even if the plaintiff failed to introduce a
scintilla of evidence challenging
that element.’”  (Ibid., emphasis in
original.)

 

Once met, “the burden shifts to plaintiff to prove the existence of a triable issue of
fact regarding that element of its cause of action or that defense.  If plaintiff is unable to do so, defendants
are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” 
(Id. at ¶ 10:240, emphasis in original.) 

 

Summary
Adjudication

 

“A motion for summary adjudication asks the court to adjudicate the merits of a particular
cause of action, affirmative defense, issue of duty or claim for damages,
including a punitive damage request.” 
(Id. at ¶ 10:1, emphasis in original.)

 

A defendant (or
cross-defendant) moving for summary [adjudication] must “show” that either:

 

* one or more elements of
the “cause of action … cannot
be established”; OR

 

* there is a complete defense to
that cause of action. [Citation.]

 

This means that where
plaintiff has the burden of proof at trial by a preponderance of evidence,
defendant “must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of
fact not to find any underlying material fact more likely
than not—otherwise, he [defendant] would not be entitled to judgment as a matter of law, but
would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact.” [Citation.]

 

The import of “more likely
than not” in the foregoing quote is that a moving defendant must generally
present evidence that, if uncontradicted, “would constitute a preponderance of
evidence that an essential element of the plaintiff's case cannot be established
… The same is true when a moving defendant seeks to secure dismissal of the
complaint based on an affirmative defense.” [Ciation.]

 

. . . Once defendants meet this burden, the burden shifts to plaintiff to prove the existence
of a triable issue of fact regarding that element of its cause of action or
that defense. If plaintiff is unable to do so, defendants are entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. [Citations.] 

 

. . . If defendants fail to meet their burden, their motion
must be denied; plaintiff need not make any showing at all. [Citation.]

 

(Id. at ¶ 10:240, emphasis
in original.)

 

DISCUSSION

 

Summary Judgment

 

The Court notes that Defendants’ separate
statement does not include a section devoted specifically to summary
judgment.  Instead, it contains four
sections, one for each negligence-based cause of action.  It is arranged in the format of a
summary-adjudication separate statement. 
(See Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶¶ 10:96.5, 10:96.6.)  Therefore, the Court will proceed to the
summary-adjudication analysis and will address Defendants’ arguments on a
claim-by-claim basis.

 

Summary Adjudication

 

Third Cause of Action for Negligence

 

“To establish a cause of
action for negligence, the plaintiff must show that the defendant had a duty to
use due care, that he breached that duty, and that the breach was the proximate
or legal cause of the resulting injury.” 
(Doe v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles (2021) 70
Cal.App.5th 657, 669 (“Archbishop”), internal quotation marks
omitted.)  “Recovery for negligence
depends as a threshold matter on the existence of a legal duty of care.”  (Ibid.)

 

Plaintiff alleges that Harris abused him at
Mater Dei in 1978.  (See Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement, Undisputed Material Fact (“UMF”) No. 1.)  It is undisputed that Defendants did not have
actual knowledge of Plaintiff’s allegations until March 2020.  (See id. at UMF No. 8.)

 

Defendants

 

Defendants contend they did not owe a
duty to Plaintiff, and they did not breach the duty, assuming one existed,
because sexual abuse by priests was not foreseeable in 1978.  (See Motion, pp. 12-17; see also, e.g.,
Defendants’ Separate Statement, UMF Nos. 1-23, 42-55.)

 

 

 

Plaintiff

 

Plaintiff disagrees.  He claims the alleged abuse was foreseeable,
and Defendants knew or should have known that Harris posed a risk, because:

 

* in 1964, when Harris applied to St.
John’s Seminary, his principal sent a letter to the dean, stating that Harris
was “effeminate” and that “you have to be careful in a matter like this”
(Opposition, p. 5 [claiming the Catholic Church used “effeminate” as a code
word for “sexual violations of children”]);

 

* in 1970, Dr. Robert Rabe treated Harris
for “his problem” (id. at p. 2 [claiming “problem” was also code for “sexual
violations of children”]);

 

* in 1972, Harris “receiv[ed] psychiatric
treatment for ‘sexual conflicts’” (id. at p. 10; see also id. at p. 2 [claiming
“sexual conflicts” was another code term for “sexual violations of children”]);

 

* from 1972 to 1975, Harris sexually
abused four minors (see id. at p. 2);

 

* in 1975, a female minor reported sexual
abuse by Harris to a Los Angeles priest (see id. at pp. 2, 10);

 

* at that time ,the Los Angeles priest
worked under William Johnson, who later became RCBO’s first bishop (see ibid.);
and,

 

* in 1977, Harris started hosting movie
nights and sleepovers with students (see id. at pp. 3, 10.)

 

Additionally, Plaintiff asserts: 

 

* in 1947, the Catholic Church began
opening facilities to treat priests who molested children (see id. at p. 6);

 

* in 1962, the Vatican issued rules and
procedures covering sexual-abuse cases (see ibid.); and, 

 

* in 1976, RCBO and Bishop Johnson
received a letter from the Archdiocese of Milwaukee regarding sexual misconduct
with a minor by a priest (Father Sigfried Widera) who ended up being
transferred to RCBO.  (See id. at pp.
6-7).

 

Plaintiff also claims Defendants are
liable because they failed to implement policies and procedures to prevent
minor from being sexually abused.  (See
id. at pp. 7-8, 11-12.) 

 

Analysis

 

“A duty exists only if the plaintiff's interests are entitled
to legal protection against the defendant's conduct.”  (Archbishop, supra, 70 Cal.App.5th
at 669, internal quotation marks omitted.) 
“[T]he law imposes a general duty of care on a defendant only when it is
the defendant who has created a risk of harm to the plaintiff, including when
the defendant is responsible for making the plaintiff's position worse.”  (Ibid., internal quotation marks omitted.)  “The law does not impose the same duty on a
defendant who did not contribute to the risk that the plaintiff would suffer
the harm alleged.”  (Ibid.)  “Generally, the person who has not created a
peril is not liable in tort merely for failure to take affirmative action
to assist or protect another from that peril.” 
(Id. at 669-670, internal quotation marks omitted.)  

 

“But this ‘no-duty-to-protect
rule’ is not absolute.”  (Id. at 670.)  “Under some circumstances, a defendant may
have an affirmative duty to protect the plaintiff from harm at the hands of a
third party, even though the risk of harm is not of the defendant's own
making.”  (Ibid.)

 

“[T]he Supreme Court
[has] established a two-step inquiry to determine whether a defendant has a
legal duty to take action to protect a plaintiff from injuries caused by a
third party[.]”  (Ibid.)  “First, the court must determine whether
there exists a special relationship between the parties or some other set of
circumstances giving rise to an affirmative duty to protect.”  (Ibid.) 
“Second, if so, the court must consult the” the Rowland v. Christian
(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108 factors “to determine whether relevant policy
considerations counsel limiting that duty.” 
(Ibid.)

 

In the school setting, “the
issue [] is not whether it is foreseeable a particular adult will sexually
abuse a student if left alone with the student.”  (Doe v. Lawndale Elementary School Dist.
(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 113, 132 (“Lawndale”).)  “[T]he issue is whether it is reasonably
foreseeable that organizations or entities that provide services primarily or
exclusively for children have employees who may sexually abuse a child if the
organization fails to take reasonable measures to prevent the abuse.”  (Ibid.)    

 

With these rules in mind, the Court turns
to the record.

 

The fact that Defendants did not have
actual knowledge at or before the time of Plaintiff’s alleged abuse seems to be
conceded, so the core issue is constructive knowledge/foreseeability.  

 

Defendants claim
they did not know that students were staying the night at Harris’s house when
he worked for RCBO, and they assert that they did not learn about sexual-abuse
allegations against Harris until December 1993. 
In support, they cite their own fact
sheet, their own interrogatory responses, and an expert declaration.  (See Defendants’ Separate Statement, UMF Nos.
19-21, 23, 42-55.)  

 

The Court disagrees.  First, a party cannot “use its own discovery responses
in its own favor” on summary adjudication.  (Great American Ins. Cos. v. Gordon
Trucking, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 445, 450; see also Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.410.)  Second, the
expert’s opinions are inadmissible.  Dr. Elizabeth Jeglic opines:

 

12.
. . . when assessing RCBO’s liability for negligence in this matter, the
prevailing standard of care against which RCBO’s actions, policies, procedures,
trainings, and the like must be judged with respect to the information
available to it on clergy child sexual abuse at the time of the abuse in
question—here in 1978. . . .

 

13.
Based on the available scientific and societal awareness of child sexual abuse
in the 1970s and earlier, no reasonable religious organization would have
concluded childhood sexual abuse within youth-serving organizations, including
the Catholic church, could be prevalent enough to take affirmative actions as
is the case today.

 

(Defendants’
Compendium, Ex. 11, ¶¶ 12-13.)  These paragraphs
are speculative and state legal conclusions.[1]  Consequently, the Court finds that summary
adjudication should be denied because Defendants’ evidence fails to negate
foreseeability as a matter of law and fails to shift the burden to Plaintiff.

 

As a matter of
guidance, the Court provides the following analysis (10 points) of Plaintiff’s
evidence:

 

(1) Plaintiff’s
exhibits lack authentication. 
Plaintiff’s counsel lacks personal knowledge to authenticate the
documents.  (See Lotfi Decl., ¶¶ 2-62.)  The Court would need to continue the hearing
to give Plaintiff a chance to fix these problems before the exhibits could be
considered.

 

(2) Plaintiff’s
assertion – in 1964, when Harris applied to
St. John’s Seminary, his principal sent a letter to the dean, stating that
Harris was “effeminate” and that “you have to be careful in a matter like this”
(Opposition, p. 5) – requires further support. 
The cited letter is written in an illegible cursive.  The Court cannot tell what it says.  (See Plaintiff’s Compendium, Ex. 28.)

 

(3) Plaintiff’s assertion – in 1970, Dr.
Robert Rabe treated Harris for “his problem” (Opposition, p. 2) – is
unavailing.  The letter states: “I
finally got straightened out and saw Mike Harris.  Will see him again in 3 wks.  There is no urgency on his problem.  This is an integrated person.”  (Plaintiff’s Compendium, Ex. 6, emphasis
added.)  The Court doubts that the
emphasized wording would create constructive notice of a risk of sexual abuse
of minors by Harris or by any other priest.

 

(4) Plaintiff’s assertion – in 1972,
Harris “receiv[ed] psychiatric treatment for ‘sexual conflicts’” (Opposition,
p. 10; see also id. at p. 2)  – comes
from a March 1994 letter.  (See
Plaintiff’s Separate Statement, Additional Undisputed Material Fact (“AUMF”)
No. 154; see also Plaintiff’s Compendium, Ex. 1.)  The letter postdates Plaintiff’s alleged
abuse, and Plaintiff fails to show that Defendants knew about the treatment
prior to the date when Harris allegedly abused Plaintiff.[2]

 

(5) Plaintiff’s assertion – from 1972 to
1975, Harris sexually abused four minors (see Opposition, p. 2) – lacks factual
support.  The statement is based on allegations
from complaints filed in other cases. 
(See Plaintiff’s Separate Statement, AUMF No. 166.)

 

(6) Plaintiff’s assertion – in 1975, a
female minor reported sexual abuse by Harris to a Los Angeles priest (see
Opposition, pp. 2, 10) – may need additional support.  The female minor’s declaration states that
the incident occurred at the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church and that she
told Father John Foley; however, the declaration says nothing about whether
Father Foley ever disclosed the conversation to the Los Angeles hierarchy,
Bishop Johnson, or Defendants.  (See
Plaintiff’s Compendium, Ex. 8, ¶¶ 6-9.)[3]

 

(7) Plaintiff’s assertion – in 1977,
Harris started hosting movie nights and sleepovers with students (see
Opposition, pp. 3, 10) – should be divided into two parts.  The movie-nights portion likely fails to
create a triable issue.  Harris testified
that the movie nights took place once to twice a month.  (See Plaintiff’s Compendium, Ex. 4, p.
80.)  A deponent named Bronselo Balsis
(Plaintiff fails to explain who Balsis is) testified that he heard that the
movie nights involved the basketball team or the football team coming over to
watch games.  (See id. at Ex. 11, p.
32.)  Bishop Norman McFarland testified
in 2001 that he had “no remembrance” of sleepovers but that he was aware of the
movie nights (see id. at Ex. 13, p. 111), but the statement needs to be read in
context with Balsis’s description. 
Having a whole team over for movies probably would not cause a
reasonable person or entity to foresee sexual abuse.  

 

The sleepover portion is stronger.  The priests’ residence had a front house and
a back house.  Harris lived in the back
house.  He testified that he did not keep
the sleepovers a secret and that other priests at the residence knew kids were
spending the night.  (See id. at Ex. 17,
p. 67.)  Harris also speculated that some
of the Diocesan officials knew about the sleepovers.  (See id. at Ex. 17, pp. 67-68.)  A former Mater Dei student named Mark Curran
testified that a Mater Dei faculty member named John Merino saw him sleeping on
Harris’s couch one night.  (Id. at Ex.
18, pp. 45-47.)  Curran also stated that
Fathers James Farris and John Montesero, who lived in the front house, saw him
on multiple occasions when he slept at Harris’s place.  (See id. at Ex. 18, pp. 58-60.)[4]  Although 1977 is different than today, the
Court would be inclined to find a triable issue (if Plaintiff could
authenticate the evidence).  The jury
should decide whether a single boy – as opposed to a whole team – staying the
night at a priest’s house multiple times was sufficient to raise red flags and
to create constructive notice/foreseeability, especially since other priests
(Defendants’ agents?) were aware of the sleepovers.

 

(8) Plaintiff’s assertion – in 1947, the
Catholic Church began opening facilities to treat priests who molested children
(see Opposition, p. 6) – comes from the declaration of Plaintiff’s expert.  Robert Wilcox is an ordained Catholic
priest.  Paragraphs 23 through 33 discuss
the development of the treatment facilities, studies sponsored by the Catholic
Church concerning priests’ sexual abuse, and the Vatican’s and United States
bishops’ knowledge of the treatment facilities and studies for many years before
Plaintiff’s alleged incident.  (See Plaintiff’s
Compendium, Ex. 3, ¶¶ 23-33.)  Notably,
an expert is allowed to “testify to non-case-specific facts and general
background information, even if it is hearsay, provided that the information is
within their general knowledge in the field of expertise.”  (Fairbank, et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civ.
Trials and Evidence (The Rutter Group October 2023 Update) ¶ 8:752, emphasis in
original.)  And the expert “may consult
specific sources in a case and furnish information contained within them as
‘background . . . without running afoul of the hearsay rules[.]’”  (Ibid.) 
If coupled with the sleepover evidence, a jury could find this information
relevant in assessing constructive knowledge/foreseeability.[5]  

 

(9) Plaintiff’s assertion – in 1962, the
Vatican issued rules and procedures covering sexual-abuse cases (see
Opposition, p. 6) – leads to the same analysis as point (8).  The source of the assertion is Wilcox’s
declaration.  (See Plaintiff’s Separate
Statement, AUMF Nos. 241-244; see also Plaintiff’s Compendium, Ex. 3, ¶¶
17-19.)  If admitted, and if coupled with
the sleepover evidence, the Court believes a jury could find the declaration
material as to constructive knowledge/foreseeability. 

 

(10) Plaintiff’s assertion – in 1976, RCBO
and Bishop Johnson received a letter from the Milwaukee Archdiocese about
Widera’s alleged misconduct (see Opposition, pp. 6-7) – is a close call.  The letter is about a specific incident by a
different priest in a different state. 
On one hand, it is a stretch to say the letter supports a finding of
constructive knowledge/foreseeability regarding Harris and priest conduct in Orange
County.  On the other hand, the letter
arguably triggered a need to enact sexual-abuse policies and procedures in
Orange County given that RCBO allowed Widera to transfer there.  (See, e.g., Plaintiff’s Separate Statement,
AUMF No. 250.)  If such policies and
procedures had been enacted, perhaps Defendants would have stopped Harris
before he hurt Plaintiff.  On balance, the
Court’s inclination would be to find that point (10) raises a trial issue when read
together with the sleepover evidence and points (8) and (9).

 

Last point.  Lawndale also seems to support denying
summary adjudication.  There, a music
teacher sexually assaulted the plaintiff; she sued the school district for
negligent hiring, supervision, and retention; and the Second District Court of
Appeal held that “school administrators have a duty to protect students from
sexual abuse by school employees, even if the school does not have actual
knowledge of a particular employee’s history of committing, or propensity to
commit, such abuse.”  (Lawndale,
supra, 72 Cal.App.5th at 119.) 
Defendants contend the holding should be construed narrowly.  (See Motion, pp. 16-17.)  The Court tends to disagree.  The opinion cites the Supreme Court’s
decision in C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School District (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861 with approval, broadly stating that “school personnel
owe students a duty to take reasonable measures to protect them from
foreseeable injury, including ‘injuries to a student resulting from a teacher’s
sexual assault.’”  (Lawndale,
supra, 72 Cal.App.5th at 132.) 
That is what Plaintiff alleges happened.

 

Fourth Cause of Action for Negligent
Supervision

 

“To establish negligent supervision, a
plaintiff must show that a person in a supervisorial position over the actor
had prior knowledge of the actor’s propensity to do the bad act.”  (Z.V. v. County of Riverside (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 889, 902.) 
The claim “depends, in part, on a showing that the risk of harm was
reasonably foreseeable.”  (D.Z. v. Los
Angeles Unified School Dist. (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 210,
229.)  “Foreseeability is determined in light of all the
circumstances and does not require prior identical events or injuries.”  (Ibid.) 
“It is not necessary to prove that the very injury which occurred must
have been foreseeable by the school authorities. . . . Their negligence is
established if a reasonably prudent person would foresee that injuries of the
same general type would be likely to happen in the absence of [adequate]
safeguards.”  (Ibid., internal quotation
marks omitted.)

 

The motion is denied.  Defendants cite most of the same UMFs that
they cite for the negligence cause of action. 
Again, they cite their fact sheet and interrogatory responses and
Jeglic’s expert declaration.  (See
Defendants’ Separate Statement, UMFs 19, 23, 42-55,
63, 66, 73-87.)  As explained above, the
evidence fails to shift the burden.  On
top of that, the Court believes Plaintiff’s evidence, if authenticated, creates
a triable issue as to constructive knowledge/foreseeability.    

 

Defendants cite Jeffrey E. v. Central
Baptist Church (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 178 for the proposition that “any
abuse committed by Harris” fell outside the scope of his work.  (Opposition, p. 19.)  

 

The Court disagrees.  The Second District appears to have rejected
this argument in Lawndale:

 

The
District also contends it is not foreseeable school employees will sexually
abuse students. According to the District, “sexual abuse is so
unforeseeable that it is outside the course and scope of everyone's
employment as a matter of law.” But a school district is not like every
employer. As the court recognized in [Doe v. United States Youth Soccer
Association (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 1118], sexual abuse by members
“of an organization that provide[s] activities exclusively for children”—like
an elementary school district—is reasonably foreseeable, even where the
organization “had no knowledge that [the employee] had previously sexually or
physically abused anyone or had a propensity to do so.”

 

(Lawndale,
supra, 72 Cal.App.5th at 132.)

 

Fifth Cause of Action
for Negligent Hiring/Retention and Sixth Cause of Action for Negligent Failure to Warn

 

The
elements of negligent hiring/retention are:

 

[Name of plaintiff] claims that [he/she/nonbinary
pronoun] was harmed by [name of employee] and that
[name of employer defendant]
is responsible for that harm because [name
of employer defendant] negligently
[hired/ supervised/ [or] retained] [name
of employee]. To establish this claim,
[name of plaintiff] must
prove all of the following:

 

1. [That [name
of employer defendant] hired [name of employee];]

 

2. That [name
of employee] [[was/became] [unfit [or]
incompetent] to perform the work for which [he/she/nonbinary pronoun] was
hired/[specify other particular risk]];

 

3. That [name
of employer defendant] knew or should
have known that [name of employee] [[was/became] [unfit/ [or] incompetent]/[other particular risk]]
and that this [unfitness [or] incompetence/ [other
particular risk]] created a particular
risk to others;

 

4. That [name
of employee]’s [unfitness [or]
incompetence/ [other particular risk]] harmed [name
of plaintiff]; and

 

5. That [name
of employer defendant]'s negligence in
[hiring/ supervising/ [or] retaining] [name
of employee] was a substantial factor
in causing [name of plaintiff]’s harm.

 

(CACI No. 426, italics in original.)

 

For negligent failure to warn, Plaintiff
must show that Defendants “knew or should have known of [Harris’s] alleged
misconduct and did not act in a reasonable manner” to provide warnings and to
remove him.  (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 591.)

 

Defendants state:

 

Like
Plaintiff’s other negligence-based causes of action, Plaintiff cannot provide
evidence that Defendants knew in 1978 that Harris was likely to commit child
sexual abuse such that Defendants could have prevented Plaintiff’s alleged
damages. It is axiomatic that Defendants could not have warned Plaintiff about
Harris if they had no knowledge of Harris’ propensity to commit abuse, or any
priest, in 1978.

 

(Motion, pp.
20-21.)

 

The motion is denied.  Defendants repeat the same UMFs and cite the
same evidence. (See Defendants’ Separate
Statement, UMFs 19, 23, 42-55, 63,
66, 73-87, 95, 98, 105-119, 127, 130, 137-152.) 
The same analysis applies.

 

Vicarious Liability and Ratification

 

Defendants claim they cannot be
vicariously liable for Harris’s alleged acts, or liable for ratification,
because sexual abuse is outside the scope of employment.  (See Motion, pp. 21-23.)

 

The motion is denied.  This is not an independent cause of action
(see id. at p. 21); Defendants’ notice does not request summary adjudication of
these sub-issues (see Notice, p. 2); and Defendants fail to show that they satisfied
Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(t). 
Moreover, Defendants rely on the same inadequate UMFs and evidence.  (See Motion, p. 23 [citing Defendants’ UMF
Nos. 19 through 22 and 42 through 55].) 
Their burden is unmet.[6]
