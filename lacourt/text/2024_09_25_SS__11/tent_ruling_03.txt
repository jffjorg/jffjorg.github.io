Defendants might be able to rely on Jeglic’s discussion of the history of
societal awareness, studies, and approaches to child sexual abuse, but her
ultimate opinions, which are legal conclusions, are inadmissible.  Her descriptions of statutes and legislation look
inadmissible too.  (See id. at Ex. 11, ¶¶
7, 10-11.)





 

[2] Plaintiff also cites pages 145:24 to
146:2 of Harris’s deposition transcript and excerpts from Harris’s personal
record.  (See Plaintiff’s Separate
Statement, AUMF 156.)  Pages 145:24 to
146.2 merely state that Harris taught at Bishop Amat High School in 1972.  (See Plaintiff’s Compendium, Ex. 4, pp.
45:24-146:2.)  The personal record does
not mention any treatment.  (See id. at
Ex. 5.)





[3]
The Orange Diocese was created in 1976. 
Even if the Court were to treat Father Foley as an agent of the Los
Angeles Diocese for the purpose of notice, the female minor’s declaration does
not show that Defendants or an Orange Diocese official or agent ever received
the information.





 

[4]
Plaintiff claims Father Farris testified that he saw a student named David
Price leaving Harris’s house.  (See
Plaintiff’s Separate Statement, AUMF No. 190.)  Incorrect.  Father Farris said he could not recall.  (See Plaintiff’s Compendium, Ex. 10, pp.
66-67.)





[5] In the
alternative, the Court
would consider subjecting Wilcox to a hearing under Sargon Enterprises, Inc.
v. University of Southern California (2012) 55 Cal.4th 747 prior
to making a final ruling on summary adjudication.

 

For now, if nothing
else, the Court would be inclined to find that Wilcox’s declaration and
Jeglic’s declaration create a “battling experts” scenario.





[6]
The Court reiterates that Lawndale appears to reject Defendants’ scope
argument.  (See Lawndale, supra, 72 Cal.App.5th at
132.)
