```yaml
Case Number: JCCP5101
Hearing Date: September 25, 2024
Department: 11 Southern California Clergy Cases (JCCP 5101)
Moving Party: Roman Catholic Bishop of Orange ("RCBO") and Mater Dei High School ("Mater Dei") (collectively "Defendants")
Opposing Party: John Doe OG 1003 ("Plaintiff")
Judge: David S. Cunningham III

---
Tentative Ruling:
  - Defendants' objections are overruled, and Defendants' motion for protective order is denied.

Background:
  - This action is part of the coordinated Southern California Clergy Cases (JCCP 5101).
  - Plaintiff claims a priest named Father Michael Harris sexually abused him at Mater Dei in Orange County in 1978 when he was a minor.
  - Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to protect him despite having actual or constructive knowledge of Harris's pedophilia.

Discussion:
  - Plaintiff requested production of "all documents associated with all laicization processes involving Harris".
  - Defendants objected, relying on the clergy-penitent privilege, church-autonomy doctrine, and the First Amendment.
  - The discovery referee overruled the objections and recommended that the laicization documents be produced.
  - In response, Defendants filed this motion.

Prior Actions:
  - Similar objections were made and rejected in Clergy I (JCCP 4286), II (JCCP 4297), and III (JCCP 4359).

Overbroad:
  - Plaintiff's request is overbroad. The purpose of the discovery request is to obtain documents showing notice to Defendants at or before the time of the alleged abuse.
  - Production, if any, should be limited to laicization documents that relate to such notice.
  - Laicization documents unrelated to such notice should not be ordered produced.

Clergy-Penitent Privilege:
  - Defendants contend the laicization documents "qualify as penitential communications" because they were intended to be in confidence and made to a member of the clergy who is authorized to hear such communications.

Church-Autonomy Doctrine:
  - The church-autonomy doctrine affords churches "independence in matters of faith and doctrine and in closely linked matters of internal government".
  - The doctrine does not bar Plaintiff from utilizing civil discovery to probe the laicization proceeding and Defendants' interpretation of canon law.

Establishment Clause:
  - Defendants raise the Establishment Clause in their argument regarding the church-autonomy doctrine.
  - The objection is overruled.

Free Exercise:
  - Defendants assert that "compelled disclosure of canonical proceedings chills the Diocese's right to free exercise of religion".
  - The Court holds that the rational-basis test applies when a law is neutral and generally applicable, even if the law incidentally burdens the plaintiff's free exercise.

Intentions:
  - The Court intends to deny Defendants' motion for protective order.

Facts:
  - The laicization documents were shared with several people during the investigation and laicization process.
  - Plaintiff and Defendants submitted competing fact declarations on this point.

Disputes:
  - The Court disagrees with Defendants' arguments regarding the clergy-penitent privilege, church-autonomy doctrine, and the First Amendment.

Acts:
  - The Court has overruled Defendants' objections and denied their motion for protective order.

Agreements:
  - None

Laws:
  - Evidence Code section 1032
  - Evidence Code section 1034
  - Code of Civil Procedure section 2017.020(a)

Case Citations:
  - Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 417
  - Tandon v. Newsom (2021) 593 U.S. 61
  - Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (2021) 593 U.S. 522
  - In re Diocese of Lubbock (Tex. 2021) 624 S.W.3d 506
  - Fellowship of Christian Athletes v. San Jose Unified School District (9th Cir. 2023) 82 F.4th 664

Roles:
  - Judge: David S. Cunningham III

Significant Statements:
  - "The Court doubts that the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit intended Fulton and FAC to have this kind of effect on the discovery process."
  - "The practical effect of Defendants' argument is that strict scrutiny would apply in the large majority of instances where a religious entity receives a discovery request, no matter the type of case, and no matter whether the request actually challenges a religious activity."
  - "The Court believes it would be a mistake to stretch Fulton's and FAC's reach as far as Defendants want."
