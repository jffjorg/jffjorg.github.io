And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case involving child sexual abuse and is reviewing the information presented by the parties. The judge says that the defendants may be able to rely on some of the expert testimony presented, but not the ultimate opinions or conclusions drawn by the expert. The judge also notes that some of the information presented is not admissible.

The judge is considering whether to grant summary adjudication to the defendants, but is hesitant to make a final decision without further information. In the alternative, the judge suggests subjecting one of the parties to a hearing under a previous court decision, Sargon Enterprises, Inc. v. University of Southern California (2012).

The judge also notes that the case involves a "battling experts" scenario, where the parties have presented conflicting expert testimony. The judge suggests that this may require a hearing to resolve the issue. Overall, the judge is still considering the evidence and is not yet making a final decision.
