And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the defendants (Eduardo Gonzalez, Luxe Seafood Company, and Does 1 to 50) to allow them to file a cross-complaint against third parties (Jairo Hernandez, David Arcos, and Roes 1 to 100) for indemnification or contribution. The defendants are seeking to hold these third parties responsible for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff (Sebastian Lee) in a motor vehicle accident that occurred on March 26, 2022. The judge notes that the cross-complaint is permissive and must be filed at any time before the court sets a trial date. The defendants have filed the necessary moving papers, including a notice, a declaration by their counsel, points and authorities, and a copy of the proposed cross-complaint. The judge finds that the interests of justice will be served by granting the motion, as it would prevent the need for a separate lawsuit between the defendants and the cross-defendants and would not unreasonably burden the plaintiff's lawsuit. Therefore, the judge grants the defendants' motion to file a cross-complaint.
