And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff Cald Holdings, LLC (the "Plaintiff") to amend its complaint and continue the trial. The Plaintiff filed its original complaint on August 2, 2022, against multiple defendants, including Richard Madokoro, Steve Najera, Abel Aureliano Galvez Carrillo, and Anastasia Prakharenka. The complaint alleged various causes of action, including breach of contract, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, and fraud.

The Defendant Najera filed an answer and cross-complaint, and the Plaintiff began discovery. The court granted a motion to compel further discovery responses from Defendant Najera on March 22, 2024. On September 17, 2024, the Plaintiff made an oral motion to continue the trial, which was denied.

On September 18, 2024, the Plaintiff filed a motion to amend the complaint and continue the trial. The Plaintiff seeks to add new defendants and causes of action. The court has granted the motion, finding that the Plaintiff has shown good cause for a continuance based on the addition of new defendants and causes of action. The court has also granted the motion to continue the trial, setting the new trial date at the hearing.

The court's decision is based on the principles of liberality in allowing amendments to complaints and the need to ensure that all parties have a fair opportunity to present their case. The court has considered the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, including the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the prejudice that parties or witnesses may suffer as a result of the continuance.
