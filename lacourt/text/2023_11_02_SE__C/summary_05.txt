And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash deposition subpoenas served by Plaintiff Schubert Investments, Inc. on Defendant Allan Roberto Tay. The subpoenas seek financial records from JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. related to Tay's personal and business accounts. The Judge has denied the motion to quash, but modified the subpoenas to limit the scope of the documents sought. The Judge has also ordered a protective order to govern the disclosure of the documents produced or to be produced during the course of discovery. The protective order requires that the documents and information contained therein be treated as confidential and only disclosed to parties and their counsel in the litigation, or with the prior written consent of Defendant Tay or further order of the Court.
