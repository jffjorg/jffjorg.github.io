And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Riderwood USA Inc. v. NKM Capital Group LLC, an unlawful detainer action. The court has overruled NKM's demurrer in part and denied its motion to strike the complaint. The demurrer was filed on November 20, 2023, and the motion to strike was filed on November 22, 2023.

The court found that the complaint adequately states a cause of action against NKM, despite NKM's claims that it fails to state facts sufficient for a cause of action and is uncertain. The court also found that the complaint is verified by Donna Guerrero, the Senior General Manager for Avison Young, Plaintiff's real estate agent.

The court granted NKM's request to strike the complaint on the grounds that it does not include a proof of service of the 3-Day Notice to Quit the Premises. The court gave Riderwood 5 days to amend the complaint to include a proof of service of the 3-Day Notice to Vacate the Premises.

The court denied NKM's motion to strike the complaint, finding that Ms. Guerrero's verification is adequate. The court also denied NKM's request to strike the complaint on the grounds that it is uncertain, finding that the description of the odor is sufficient.

Finally, the court ordered NKM to give notice of this ruling and granted Riderwood's request to proceed with the unlawful detainer action.
