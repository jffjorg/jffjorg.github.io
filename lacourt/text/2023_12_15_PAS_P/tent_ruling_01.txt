Case No.: 23AHCV01447
 
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION
 
Date:   December
  15, 2023
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
 
I.        INTRODUCTION
          This litigation stems from a stay at a skilled nursing
facility (SNF). Plaintiff Ruth Montury (Ruth), 93 years old, was admitted to
Defendant Gem Transitional Care Center (Gem) on February 11, 2022. Defendant
Saint Cabrini Healthcare Services LLC is the management company of the Gem
facility. Ruth alleges she experienced a dramatic decline in condition over the
course of her stay at Gem. Specifically, it is alleged that she fell during her
stay at Gem, fracturing her hip. She alleges that she left the facility with a
fractured hip and incontinence, which left her reliant on pain medication and
requiring   significant assistance with activities of
daily living. Her complaint alleges three causes of action: (1) elder abuse and
neglect under WIC Section 15600, (2) violation of residents’ bill of rights
under HSC Section 1430(b) and (3) negligence. 
Defendants
Gem and Saint Cabrini (collectively Defendants) filed a motion to compel
arbitration on August 14, 2023. Plaintiffs submitted an opposition on November
7, 2023. Defendants submitted a reply on November 14, 2023.  
Plaintiff
opposes the motion to compel on the grounds of “falsity” of the agreement,
among other arguments; but these arguments are unpersuasive. The motion is therefore
granted. 
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
Code
Civ. Proc. §1281 provides: “A written agreement to submit to arbitration an
existing controversy or a controversy thereafter existing is valid,
enforceable, and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for the
revocation of any contract.” (CCP § 1281.)
Paraphrased,
Code Civ. Proc. §1281.2 provides that upon petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate and a party’s refusal to submit to arbitration, the court shall
order the parties to arbitrate the controversy if it determines (1) that an
agreement exists, (2) unless it determines that the right to arbitrate
has been waived, that grounds exist for revocation, or that a party
to the agreement is also party to a pending litigation arising out of the same
facts and there exists a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue
of fact or law. (CCP § 1281.2.)
 
 
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          A. A Written Agreement to Arbitrate Exists
When a petition to compel arbitration is “filed and
accompanied by prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate the
controversy, the court itself determines whether the agreement exists and, if
any defense to its enforcement is raised, whether it is enforceable.” (Rosenthal v.
Great Western Fin. Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413 (Rosenthal).)  Defendants bear the burden of establishing
the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate. 
In this case, Defendants offer as evidence the
declaration of their attorney, Jenifer M. Hassell, who attaches as Exhibit A a
copy of the “Resident-Facility Arbitration Agreement” entered into by Frank
Montury, Ruth’s Power of Attorney. Plaintiffs have objected to this evidence on
the grounds of falsity. 
The contract consists of two pages. At the bottom
of the second page, in language in all capital letters about the first signature
line, are the words, “NOTICE: BY SIGNING THIS CONTRACT YOU ARE AGREEING TO HAVE
ANY ISSUE OF MEDICAL MALPRACTICE DECIDED BY NEUTRAL ARBITRATION AND YOU ARE
GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY OR COURT TRIAL. SEE ARTICLE 1 OF THIS CONTRACT.”

After the first signature line, there is a second
notice and related signature line. The second notice provides “BY SIGNING THIS
CONTRACT YOU ARE AGREEING TO HAVE ALL CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS OTHER THAN A
CLAIM FOR MEDICAL MALPRACTICE, DECIDED BY ARBITRATION AND YOU ARE GIVING UP
YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY OR COURT TRIAL.” 
Plaintiff also argues that Defendant did not
adequately establish that Ruth lacked sufficient capacity, therefore permitting
Frank to act on her behalf. 
In support, Defendants attach a History and
Physical of Ruth Montury to their Motion. This history was taken on February
24, 2022, 10 days after the arbitration agreement was signed by Frank. Although
this is not necessarily conclusive as to Ruth’s competence February 14, the Complaint
states that, prior to her stay at Gem, Ruth “had dementia.” (Complaint ¶ 12.)
Frank Montury states that he does not recall
signing the arbitration agreement; or ever even seeing it. (Montury Decl. ¶ 3.)
The fact that Mr. Montury does not recollect signing the document, however, is
insufficient to support a finding that he in fact did not sign it.  For example, Mr. Montury does not state that
the initials are not his; or that his initials were forged. 
Based on this record, the Court concludes that
Plaintiffs did agree to the arbitration agreement. 
The language of the arbitration provision is broad.
It covers, “ANY ISSUE OF MEDICAL MALPRACTICE”. It provides, “BY SIGNING THIS
CONTRACT YOU ARE AGREEING TO HAVE ANY ISSUE OF MEDICAL MALPRACTICE DECIDED BY
NEUTRAL ARBITRATION AND YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY OR COURT TRIAL.”

This language is broad enough to cover the claims
alleged in this lawsuit.  
B. Unconscionability
Plaintiffs also urge that the arbitration agreement should
not be enforced as it is unconscionable. (Opposition, p. 14: 23-24.) Unconscionability
may invalidate an arbitration agreement subject to the FAA, if it is
procedurally or substantively unconscionable. (Swain v. LaserAway Medical
Group, Inc. (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th 59, 66-67.) Procedural unconscionability
includes adhesion contracts, where the party with superior bargaining power
offers a standardized contract to the other party and essentially says take it
or leave it, without bargaining. (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychare
Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 113.) 
Here, Plaintiffs urge procedural unconscionability
on the basis that the arbitration agreement is a contract of adhesion.
(Opposition, p. 15: 16-17.) Specifically, they urge that “Since Ms. Montury
needed care, Frank Montury, Jr. was not provided with an opportunity to not
sign.” (Opposition, p. 15: 19-20.)
Defendants argue in their reply that the arbitration
agreement was not unconscionable. In support, they cite that the arbitration
agreement at issue states:  “Residents
shall not be required to sign this arbitration agreement as a condition of
admission to this facility” in boldface type on the first page. (Motion, p.
41.) Additionally, the agreement had a rescission provision, which states that
“This Agreement may be rescinded by written notice within thirty (30) days of
signature.” (Motion, p. 41, art. 4.) Frank Montury therefore not only had an
opportunity to refuse to sign the agreement, but he also had an opportunity to
rescind the arbitration agreement once he did sign it. Accordingly, the Court
declines to find that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable. 
C. The Health and Safety Code 1430
Claims are Not Barred from Arbitration Under the Federal Arbitration Act 
Plaintiffs argue that all causes of action under H&S
Section 1430 are barred from arbitration. Health and Safety Code Section
1430(b) provides a vehicle for current and former residents to sue SNFs for
violations of their rights. (Id. at § 1430(b).) Section 1430(b)(1)(C)
also provides that an agreement by a resident of a SNF to waive his/her rights
to sue is void as a matter of public policy. (Id. at § 1430(b)(1)(C).) 
However, the FAA preempts contrary California Law. (Valley View Health Care, Inc. v. Ronald Chapman (2014) 992 F. Supp. 2d 1016, 1042.) In Valley View,
a suit against a SNF by a resident under Section 1430(b) was not precluded from
arbitration because the FAA, via the Supremacy Clause, controlled. (Id.,
see also Scott v. Yoho (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 392, 407 [FAA preempted CA
statute mandating rescission period for medical malpractice arbitration
agreements].) Here, the FAA was explicitly identified as the arbitration forum
in the agreement. (Motion, Exh. A, p. 13.)
D.
 CCP 1281.2(c)
Lastly,
plaintiffs urge that the motion to compel arbitration should not be granted as
Defendant St. Cabrini was not a party to the arbitration agreement. On the
contrary, the arbitration agreement provides that that the arbitration
agreement includes: “any dispute between Resident and GEM Transitional Care
Center, its owners, operators, officers, directors, administrators, staff,
employees, agents, and any management company that provides services to the
Facility”. (Opposition, p. 41, art. 2.) St. Cabrini is the management company
of the facility and thus, is a party to the agreement. 
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Defendants have presented evidence establishing the
existence of a signed agreement to arbitrate. That agreement encompasses the
claims alleged by Plaintiff. The agreement was signed, it is not unconscionable,
and the claims are not precluded from going to arbitration. Consequently, the
motion is granted, and this action is stayed. 
A post-arbitration status conference is set for
______________, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  The
parties are ordered to file a joint Status Report at least five (5) days before
the  status conference.
Defendants
are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
