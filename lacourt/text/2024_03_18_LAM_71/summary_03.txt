And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled on the demurrers and motions to strike filed by the defendants. The demurrer to the first amended complaint filed by American Marble is overruled as moot, and the motion to strike is denied as moot. The demurrer to the second amended complaint filed by Terrazzo is overruled.

The motion to strike the request for punitive damages from the second amended complaint filed by plaintiff is granted with 20 days leave to amend. The court has also ruled that the plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent concealment support his request for punitive damages, but an award of punitive damages against a corporation also requires proof of oppression, fraud, or malice committed or authorized by a corporate officer, director, or managing agent who exercises substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy.

The court has also noted that corporations are legal entities that do not have minds capable of recklessness, wickedness, or intent to injure or deceive, and that a plaintiff is required to identify a specific individual of the corporation and prove the intentional tortious conduct by said individual to establish intentional conduct against a corporation.
