And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed Cross-Defendant Hormoz Pourat's unopposed motion for judgment on the pleadings. The motion fails to state the grounds on which Cross-Defendant moves for judgment on the pleadings and which pleading the motion applies to. Additionally, the relief sought in the motion is procedurally improper. Therefore, the Court denies Cross-Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Plaintiff's unopposed motion for judgment on the pleadings is also denied.
