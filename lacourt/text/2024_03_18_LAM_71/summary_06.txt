The court has denied plaintiff Rafael Adan Rebolledo's unopposed motion to compel defendant General Motors LLC to provide further responses to his request for production of documents. The court has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against defendant and its counsel, Erskine Law Group, PC, in the amount of $2,004.15. The court's decision is based on the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's procedures, specifically failing to schedule an informal discovery conference before the hearing. As a result, the court's motion to compel further responses is denied.
