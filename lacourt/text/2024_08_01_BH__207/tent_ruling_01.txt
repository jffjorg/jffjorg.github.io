MOTION
 
Defendant Hansueli Overturf aka Hans Overturf (“Defendant”) moves
to continue the hearing on the Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Default.  Plaintiff opposes the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
            Defendant filed the Motion to Set
Aside/Vacate Entry of Default and Default Judgment on February 22, 2024. The
motion was originally scheduled for hearing on March 20, 2024.  On March 6, 2024, the parties filed a
stipulation to continue the hearing, which the Court granted and continued the
hearing to June 5.  On March 7, 2024,
Defendant filed a Notice of Rescheduled Hearing, erroneously indicating the
hearing had been rescheduled to May 23, 2024.
 
            On May 28, 2024, Defendant filed a
Motion to Continue the hearing on the underlying Motion to Set Aside/Vacate and
to extend the time for Defendant to file a reply brief.  But  Defendant set the hearing on the Motion to
Continue on August 1, 2024.
 
            The Motion to Set Aside/Vacate was
on June 5, as scheduled by the Court. 
Defendant did not appear.  At the
hearing, the Court denied the motion. 
(See Minute Order, June 5, 2024.) 

 
             
Because the hearing on the Motion to Set Aside/Vacate has already
occurred, and the Court has already issued a ruling on that motion, Defendant’s
motion to continue that hearing is moot.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court denies Defendant’s motion to continue the hearing
on the Motion to Set Aside/Vacate as moot. 

 
            Plaintiff shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
