Supplemental
     Declaration of Plaintiff David Kermani

 
BACKGROUND
 
On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff David Kermani (“Plaintiff”) brought suit
against Defendants Gold Coast Crave, LLC (“Gold Coast”) and Cory Rooney
(“Rooney” or “Defendant”) alleging two causes of action: (1) breach of written
lease (against Gold Coast) and (2) breach of written guaranty of lease (against
Rooney).  
 
Plaintiff moves for summary judgment, or in the alternative summary
adjudication, as to the following issues:
 
(1) Issue No. 1: Plaintiff is entitled to summary
adjudication in its favor on Plaintiff's First Cause of Action for Breach of
Written Lease against Gold Coast; and 
 
(2) Issue No. 2: Plaintiff is entitled to summary
adjudication in its favor on Plaintiff's Second Cause of Action for Breach of
Written Guaranty of Lease against Guarantor.
 
            Prior to the initial hearing, the
Court issued a tentative ruling, indicating that because Defendant Gold Coast
had defaulted, the proper procedure for obtaining a judgment was a default
judgment, not a summary judgment.  Additionally,
the Court requested Plaintiff provide a supplemental declaration explaining why
the lease agreement indicates a “Security Deposit” of $9,200 plus an
“Additional Security Deposit” of $9,200, yet Plaintiff has only credited one
$9,200 security deposit against the outstanding rent owed.      
 
On July 26, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Defendant Gold Coast and the
first cause of action.  Thus, only Issue
No. 2 remains at issue.  Plaintiff also
filed the requested supplemental declaration.
 
            Plaintiff’s motion remains
unopposed.
 
LEGAL STANDARDS – MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT/ADJUDICATION
 
“[T]he party moving for
summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue
of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.]
There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would
allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the
party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.”
¿(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850
(hereafter Aguilar).) ¿“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an
initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence
of any triable issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production,
he causes a shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of
production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a
triable issue of material fact.” ¿(Ibid.; Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474 [summary judgment standards held by Aguilar
apply to summary adjudication motions].)  
 
Further, “the trial court
may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine whose
version is more likely true.  Nor may the
trial court grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of credibility.”  (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th. at p. 840
[cleaned up]; see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department of Transportation
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or
summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the
light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences
in favor of that party”].)  
 
A party may move for
summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action, affirmative defenses,
claims for damages, or issues of duty if that party contends that there is no
merit to the cause of action, defense, or claim for damages, or if the party
contends that there is no duty owed.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1).)  “A motion for summary adjudication shall be
granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative
defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.”  (Ibid.)  A cause of action has no merit if: (1) one or
more elements of the cause of action cannot be separately established, even if
that element is separately pleaded, or (2) a defendant establishes an
affirmative defense to that cause of action. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (n); Union Bank v. Superior
Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 583.) 
Once the defendant has shown that a cause of action has no merit, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact
exists as to that cause of action.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (o)(2); Union Bank v. Superior Court, supra, 31 Cal.App.4th at p.
583.)  Additionally, in line with Aguilar,
“[o]n a motion for summary adjudication, the trial court has no discretion to
exercise.  If a triable issue of material fact exists as to the challenged
causes of action, the motion must be denied. If there is no triable issue of
fact, the motion must be granted.”  (Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise Corp.
v. Superior Court (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320.) 
 
DISCUSSION

 
“To prevail on a cause of
action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2)
the plaintiff's performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
the defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.”  (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)  
 
Similarly, “A lender is
entitled to judgment on a breach of guaranty claim based upon undisputed
evidence that (1) there is a valid guaranty, (2) the borrower has defaulted,
and (3) the guarantor failed to perform under the guaranty.”  (Gray1 CPB, LLC v. Kolokotronis (2011)
202 Cal.App.4th 480, 486.)
 
 
Here, Plaintiff has provided the
Declaration of David Kermani, which indicates as follows:
 
3. On or about August 6, 2020, Plaintiff, as
landlord, and defendant Gold Coast Crave, LLC, a New York limited liability
company ("Tenant" or "Gold Coast"), as tenant, entered into
that certain written Commercial Lease Agreement (the "Original
Lease") and that certain First Amendment to the Lease and Landlord's
Consent (the "First Amendment" and together with the Original Lease,
the "Lease" or "Commercial Lease") concerning the Premises.
The term of the Lease was for five (5) years, commencing on September 1, 2020
and ending on August 31, 2025. The Lease provided for the payment of monthly
base rent, pursuant to paragraph 3.A.(4) and Exhibit A to the Lease ("Base
Rent") of: 
 
(i) $6,500.00 per month from September 1, 2020 to
August 31, 2021; 
 
(ii) $9,200.00 per month from September 1, 2021
to August 31, 2022; 
 
(iii) $9,476.00 per month from September 1, 2022
to August 31, 2023; 
 
(iv) $9,760.28 per month from September 1, 2023
to August 31, 2024; and 
 
(v) $10,053.08 per month from September 1, 2024
to August 31, 2025. 
 
In addition to Base Rent, Tenant agreed to pay,
as additional rent, Tenant's share of property taxes and property insurance,
pursuant to Paragraph 14 of the Lease. Tenant also paid a security deposit
under the Lease in the sum of $9,200.00 (the "Security Deposit").
Attached to the concurrently filed Appendix of Evidence ("Appendix")
as Exhibit "2" is a true and correct copy of the referenced
Commercial Lease, which is incorporated by reference herein.  
 
4. Concurrently with the execution of the Lease,
defendant Cory Rooney, an individual, aka Mark C. Rooney
("Guarantor") executed a Guaranty of Lease (the
"Guaranty"), which provides that Guarantor "jointly, severally,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee[s] the prompt payment by Tenant of
all rents and all other sums payable by Tenant s under said Lease and the
faithful and prompt performance by Tenant of each and every one of the terms,
conditions and covenants of said Lease to be kept and performed by
Tenant." Attached to the Appendix as Exhibit "3" is a true and
correct copy of the Guaranty, which is incorporated by reference herein. Tenant
and Guarantors are collectively, "Defendants".
 
5. I was directly involved in negotiations
concerning the Lease and the Guaranty, including the signing of same. I was
also directly involved in personally collecting rent checks from Tenant. I also
have personal knowledge of leasing commissions, advertising costs, property
taxes, and prope1iy insurance expenses relating to the Premises. I also have
personal knowledge of all rent payments by Tenant and all defaults by Tenant in
the payment of rent under the Lease. I also have personal knowledge of the New
Lease, defined in paragraph 7 of this declaration. 
 
6. Pursuant to the terms of the Lease, Tenant
entered into possession of the Premises on or about September 1, 2020, but
Defendants have not performed under the Lease and Guaranty, respectively, by
failing to pay Plaintiff certain Base Rent under the Lease. 
 
7. Furthermore, in violation of, without
limitation, paragraph 25 of the Lease, on or about January 11, 2023 (the
"Abandonment Date"), Tenant abandoned the Premises and surrendered
the keys to Plaintiff. Thereafter, Plaintiff diligently pursued mitigating its
damages and secured a new lease (the "New Lease") concerning the
Premises with a new lessee. The term of the New Lease is from July 15, 2023
through July 15, 2025. The new lessee began paying base rent only on July 15,
2023 at the rate of $5,000.00 per month through July 14, 2024, and the new
lessee is obligated under the New Lease to pay base rent only at the rate of
$5,500.00 per month for the period from July 15, 2024 through July 15, 2025.
 
8. Gold Coast under the Lease and Guarantor under
the Guaranty remain jointly and severally liable for rental damages which were
not mitigated by the New Lease, and which are available under, without
limitation, paragraph 25 of the Lease and California Civil Code Section 1951.2
on account of the termination of the Lease due to Gold Coast's failure to perform
under the Lease by its non-payment of rent and its abandonment of the Premises.

 
9. In view of Tenant's failure to perform under
the Lease, and pursuant to paragraphs 3.A.(4), 25 and rent schedule in Exhibit
"A" to the First Amendment, there remains the gross amount of rental
damages owing to Plaintiff, as a result of Gold Coast's failure to perform
under the Lease, in an amount of $340,372.32 for the period from December 1,
2021 through August 31, 2025 (the "Period"), comprised of: 
 
(i) Base Rent for the period from December 1,
2021 through August 31, 2022, at the rate of $9,200.00 per month, in the total
sum of $82,800.00, exclusive of interest, reasonable attorney's fees and costs;
plus 
 
(ii) Base Rent for the period from September 1,
2022 through August 31, 2023, at the rate of $9,476.00 per month, in the total
sum of $113,712.00, exclusive of leasing commissions, advertising costs,
interest, reasonable attorney's fees and costs; plus 
 
(iii) Base Rent for the period from September 1,
2023 through August 31, 2024, at the rate of $9,760.28 per month, in the total
sum of $117,123.36 exclusive of leasing commissions, advertising costs,
interest, reasonable attorney's fees and costs; plus 
 
(iv) Base Rent for the period from September 1,
2024 through August 31, 2025, at the rate of $10,053.08 per month, in the total
sum of $120,636.96 exclusive of leasing commissions, advertising costs,
interest, reasonable attorney's fees and costs; plus 
 
(v) Tenant's share of property tax during the
period from September 1, 2020 through August 31, 2025, at the rate of
$16,260.00 per year, in the total sum of $81,300.00; plus
 
(vi) Tenant's share of property insurance during
the period from September 1, 2020 through August 31, 2025, at the rate of
$1,200 per year, in the total sum of $6,000.00; less 
 
(vii) Rent reduction on account of mitigation
under the New Lease at the Premises for the period from July 15, 2023 through
July 14, 2024, at the rate of $5,000.00 per month, in the total sum of
$60,000.00; less 
 
(viii) Rent reduction on account of mitigation
under the New Lease at the Premises for the period from July 15, 2024 through
July 15, 2025, at the rate of $5,500.00 per month, in the total sum of
$66,000.00; less 
 
(ix) Rent reduction at the Premises, per separate
agreement of Plaintiff and Tenant, during the period from December 1, 2021
through January 2023, at the rate of $1,500.00 per month, in the total sum
$21,000.00; less
 
(x) Rent payments made by Gold Coast since
November 1, 2021 in the total sum of $25,000.00; less
 
(xi) Application of the Security Deposit under
the Lease in the sum of $9,200.00 for the month of December 2021. 
 
10. As past due rent and other charges under the
Lease are due and owing by Defendants to Plaintiff in an amount of $340,372.32
through the Period, Guarantor is personally, jointly and severally, liable to
Plaintiff for $340,372.32.
 
(Kermani Decl. ¶¶ 3-10.)  
 
Attached as Exhibit 2 is a fully
executed copy of the lease agreement, which matches the description in
Kermani’s declaration, except that the lease agreement indicates Gold Coast was
to pay a “Security Deposit” in the amount of $9,200 plus an “Additional
Security Deposit” in the amount of $9,200 due on January 1, 2021, whereas the
Kermani declaration addresses only a single security deposit in the amount of
$9,200.  Attached as Exhibit 3 is a copy
of the Guaranty, signed by “Mark Cory Rooney” as described in the Kermani
Declaration.
 
The Supplemental Declaration
of David Kermani clarifies:
 
2. In furtherance of the Tentative Ruling of this
Court dated June 28, 2024 in the above-entitled action (the
"Action"), adopted as the ruling of the Court, I make this
supplemental declaration in support of Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Adjudication
against defendant Cory Rooney, an individual, aka Mark C. Rooney, on Plaintiffs
Second Cause of Action in the Complaint for Breach of Written Guaranty of Lease
in Action. 
 
3. At or about the time of entering into the
Original Lease, attached as Exhibit 2 to Plaintiffs Appendix of Exhibits filed
in the Action on March 26, 2024 (the "Appendix of Exhibits"),
Plaintiff, as landlord, and Gold Coast Crave, LLC, , a New York limited
liability company ("Tenant" or "Gold Coast"), as tenant,
contemplated a total Security Deposit in the aggregate sum of$ 18,400.00, with
Tenant paying Plaintiff half ($9,200.00) concurrently with entering into the
Lease and paying Plaintiff the remaining half ($9,200.00) on January 1, 2021.
[See Appendix of Exhibits, Exhibit 2, page 2-001, ¶ 6.A., and page 2-002, ¶
7.C.] 
 
4. Notwithstanding the parties' plan to divide
the Security Deposit into two (2) payments, as described in paragraph 3 above,
no additional security deposit payment was received by Plaintiff under the
Lease, other than the single initial security deposit payment of $9,200.00. 
 
5. Based on the foregoing, there is no need to
deduct any amount from the judgment sought by Plaintiff in the aggregate
principal sum of $340,372.32, which includes deduction of the only Security
Deposit payment received by Plaintiff under the Lease in the sum of $9,200.00,
applied by Plaintiff to unpaid rent the month of December 2021.
 
(Supp. Kermani Decl. ¶¶ 2-5.)
 
Thus, Plaintiff has
demonstrated the elements of the claim are satisfied.  Namely, Plaintiff has demonstrated (1) the
existence of a valid guaranty (Kermani Decl. ¶ 4 and Ex. 3); (2) Defendant’s
default (Kermani Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8); and (3) Defendant’s failure to perform under
the guaranty (Ibid.)
 
The evidence supporting
Undisputed Material Facts, Nos. 1-14 and 27-40, meets Plaintiff’s burden of
production/persuasion that Defendant breached the Written Guaranty of Lease.  Plaintiff has shifted the burden of
production to Defendant to raise triable issues of material fact.   
 
Defendant has not opposed the
Motion.  As such, Defendant has not met
his burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a
triable issue of material fact regarding whether Defendant breached the Written
Guaranty of Lease.  Absent that showing, Defendant
cannot prevail.  
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
In considering the competent
evidence proffered by Plaintiff, the Court finds that there are no triable
issues of material fact, and determines, as a matter of law, that Defendant
breached the Written Guaranty of Lease.  
 
Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
motion for summary judgment on the complaint, and finds that Plaintiff is
entitled to a judgment including rental damages in the aggregate sum of
$340,372.32, plus interest, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, as allowed
under the subject lease and guaranty of lease, in an amount to be determined.  
 
Plaintiff shall file a
proposed Judgment in conformance with the Court’s ruling on or before August
15, 2024.  In addition, as a consequence
of the Court’s ruling, the Court vacates the Final Status Conference and
Trial.  
 
Further, Plaintiff shall provide
notice of the Court’s ruling, and to file the notice a proof of service forthwith.

MOTION
 
            Plaintiff David Kermani, as Trustee
of the David Kermani Trust (“Plaintiff”) moves to deem admitted the matters
specified in Requests for Admission, set one (RFA) propounded to Defendant Cory
Rooney, aka Mark C. Rooney (“Defendant”). 
Plaintiff also requested monetary sanctions against Defendant.  Defendant has not filed an opposition to the
motion. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
           
Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), “[i]f a party to whom requests
or admission are directed fails to serve a timely response . . .  [t]he party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product[.]”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)  Where a party fails to respond to
requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
1.    
Motion to Deem Admitted
 
Plaintiff served Defendant the RFA via Federal Express and email on
December 27, 2023.  (Lewiston Decl. ¶ 3
and Ex. A.)  Thus, Defendant’s responses
were due January 30, 2024.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2033.250, subd. (a), 1013, subd. (c).)  As of February 20, 2024, when the Lewiston
Declaration was signed, Defendant had not served any response to the RFA.  (Lewiston Decl. ¶ 5.)  Defendant also did not request an extension
to respond, nor has Defendant’s deadline to respond been extended by stipulation
or court order. (Ibid.)  
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant
has failed to serve timely responses to the RFA. 
 
2.    
Monetary Sanctions
Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions in connection with the motion. “It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under [Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010, et seq.] on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)  
 
Thus, the
Court will impose monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $810,
which represents two hours of attorney time to prepare the motion and attend
the hearing at $350 per hour, plus the motion filing fee of $60.00.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the foregoing reasons, the
Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the
RFA per Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, and orders the matters
specified in the RFA deemed admitted.
 
Further, the Court orders Defendant to pay monetary sanctions in the
amount of $810 to Plaintiff, through counsel for Plaintiff, within 30 days of
notice of the Court’s orders.
 
            Plaintiff
shall provide notice of the Court’s orders and file the notice with a proof of
service forthwith.
