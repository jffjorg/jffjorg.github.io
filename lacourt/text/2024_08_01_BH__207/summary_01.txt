Judge Michael E. Whitaker has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to continue the hearing on the Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Default. The defendant, Hansueli Overturf, had filed the motion on May 28, 2024, seeking to continue the hearing, while the plaintiff, Sally Maslon, opposed the motion. The Court notes that the hearing on the Motion to Set Aside/Vacate had already occurred on June 5, 2024, and the Court had already issued a ruling denying the motion. Therefore, the Court finds that the defendant's motion to continue the hearing is moot and denies the motion. The plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
