Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the Third Amended Complaint (TAC) and the demurrer filed by Defendant Svetlana Vodolazhskaya. The parties have a dispute over a broker's commission related to the sale of real property.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action for common counts, finding that the allegations in the TAC are sufficient to state a cause of action. The court also rejects the defendant's argument that the statute of frauds bars the common counts claim, as a written agreement is not necessary for a claim based on unjust enrichment.

The court orders the defendant to file and serve an answer to the TAC on or before August 22, 2024.
