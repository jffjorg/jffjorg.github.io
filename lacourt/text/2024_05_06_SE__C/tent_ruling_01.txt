  Case Number:  21NWCV00400    Hearing Date:   May 6, 2024    Dept:  C The Windmill Co. Inc.
v. Sedrak 21NWCV00400
 
Plaintiff Windmill Co.'s Ex
Parte Application to Advance Hearing Dates and Set Shortened Briefing Schedule
is DENIED. Plaintiff moves to advance the hearing dates for Defendants’
Motion for Reconsideration of this Court's January 3, 2024 Order (set for
hearing on September 24, 2024) and Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration of
this Court's January 29, 2024 Order (set for hearing on October 29, 2024).
 Plaintiff is seeking to have the motions heard before the May 20, 2024
trial date.  Plaintiff expalins it attempted to continue trial by
obtaining a stipulation from Defendants and by moving to continue trial in
Dept. F, neither of which proved successful.   Yet, these efforts
come too late, as the motions Plaintiff are seeking to advance were filed
months ago.  Plaintiff's delay in seeking the relief it is now requesting
is the cause of the "exigent circumstances" here.  Ex parte
relief is not warranted under these circumstances. Opposing Party to give
notice.
