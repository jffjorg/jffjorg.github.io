petition in the county in which the transferor resides for approval of the
transfer, attaching copies of the petition, the transfer agreement, the
disclosure form, the annuity contract, any qualified assignment agreement and
the structured settlement agreement, a list of the names and ages of the

of a tort claim in which the payment of the judgment or award is paid in whole,
or in part, in periodic tax-free payments rather than a lump-sum payment.’ ” Matthews

and structured settlement obligors are defined as ‘interested parties’ under
the SSPA (§ 10134, subd. (g)), and as such, are entitled to notice of petitions
to authorize transfer of payments under a structured settlement agreement.” RSL

ANALYSIS
Reportedly, about 8/25/2000, Payee, became entitled to
structured settlement payments in connection with a wrongful death claim. The
settlement agreed provides for periodic structured  payments including 180 monthly Life
Contingent payments of $3,098.94 each, increasing at 3% annually, beginning on 5/31/2053
and ending 4/30/2068. 
Payee is 35 years old, and single with one minor child
who is 8 years old. Payee is currently employed. Payee would receive $8,500.00.
Payee feels it is in their best interest to sell a portion of their underlying
annuity payments so that they can have the financial means to pay the child's
school expenses, and to pay off debts such as credit cards. Payee
already has done several similar transactions as to other years of structured settlement
payments. If Payee did not sell these rights, and instead borrowed the net
amount of $8,500.00 and paid that loan back in installments with each of the
payments being sold, the equivalent interest rate Payee would be paying for
that loan would be 12.91 percent per year.
The Court finds that the relatively small amount of
$8,500.00 is nonetheless in the Payee’s and child’s interests, given that the
sold payments would not become due for very many years into the future, and
Payee already sold payment rights as to closer years. Further, Payee’s plans to
use the money to support the child and to pay off debt are in their best
interests.
CONCLUSION
The Court finds that the papers sufficiently comply
with the procedural requirements. The Court further finds that the proposed
transfer is in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare
and support of any dependents of Payee.
Thus, the Court grants the petition as prayed. The
Court will sign and file a lodged order from Petitioner that is in statutory compliance
and includes all required findings.
