The Court finds that the proposed transfer is in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee's dependent child. The payee has been advised to seek independent professional advice regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived that advice in writing. The transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the order of any court or other government authority. The Court grants the petition as prayed and will sign and file a lodged order from Petitioner that is in statutory compliance and includes all required findings.
