 Case Number:  23STCV20476    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Defendant to Strike- Rent Not
Payable with No Notice (Death Landlord) and No Proof of Ownership.
BACKGROUND
JOHN OURSLAND (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against
self-represented litigant JOE SHERMAN (Defendant), alleging that Defendant is
one of Plaintiff’s tenants renting one of the apartments that has been owned by
Plaintiff and his deceased ex-spouse, and who is at least $94,065.00 behind in
past due rent. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has been making false
statements to cause other tenants not to pay rent and prospective tenants to
decline rentals. The causes of action are: 1) Defamation; 2) Intentional
Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; and 3) Civil Harassment.
On 1/29/24, Defendant filed a “Motion of Defendant to
Strike- Rent Not Payable with No Notice (Death Landlord) and No Proof of
Ownership.” Notably, the Court ordered a prior motion to strike off calendar on
1/19/24 due to the absence of a proof of service and specific notice. That
prior motion to strike appears identical to the motion to strike filed on
1/29/24. Plaintiff opposes the motion.
LEGAL STANDARD
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the
face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. Code Civ. Proc., §437.   
ANALYSIS
Here, the motion requests an order striking the
Complaint’s references to rent owed, based upon many factual assertions not
found in the Complaint, such as that the new landlord failed to give statutory notice
to the tenants. Procedurally, a motion to strike cannot be based upon facts
asserted outside of the complaint.
Additionally, the Court exercises its discretion to
not consider the untimely motion filed after the Answer filed 10/13/23. Judges
have discretion as to whether to consider an untimely motion to strike. E.g., McAllister
v. County of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281.
Finally, the opposition preserved notice objections,
by stating them and not addressing the merits. Objections to defects in motion
service are waived if an opposition was filed or argued, addressing the merits.
In re Marriage of Falcone and Fyke 
(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 814, 826.
CONCLUSION
Thus, the Court denies the motion.
