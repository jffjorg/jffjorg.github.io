And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is about a motion filed by the defendant, Joe Sherman, to strike the complaint filed by the plaintiff, John Oursland, alleging that the defendant is behind in rent payments. The defendant claims that the plaintiff failed to provide statutory notice to the tenants and that the plaintiff has no proof of ownership. The plaintiff opposes the motion. The court rules that the motion is untimely and that the defendant failed to prove that the plaintiff did not provide statutory notice. The court also finds that the plaintiff preserved notice objections by stating them and not addressing the merits. Therefore, the court denies the motion.
