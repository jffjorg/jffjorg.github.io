 Case Number:  24SMCV00423    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  I Before the court is one of two motions for sanctions.  This one, brought under California Rule of
Court 2.30, is a live motion.  The other,
brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 128.7, has been withdrawn.  The surviving motion is brought by the defense
and sought against plaintiff and counsel. 
The motion is DENIED.  The
allegation is that plaintiff’s counsel continually files things without serving
them or serving them timely.  Plaintiff
contends that all of the motions that were potentially subject to that
complaint have been withdrawn (or withdrawn and refiled).  At this point, the matter is in arbitration,
so there ought to be no further violations or potential violations.  As to the prior motions, to the extent they
were not served properly, they were withdrawn or denied.
