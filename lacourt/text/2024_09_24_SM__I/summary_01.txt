And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication, as there are disputed issues of material fact. The case involves a property sold at a nonjudicial foreclosure auction, and the plaintiff's bid was accepted, but later disputed by the defendant. The defendant's bid was submitted and accepted, and the trustee issued a Trustee's Deed Upon Sale to the defendant. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's bid was invalid because it was not properly authorized or submitted, and that the Trustee's Deed Upon Sale should be quieted in his favor.

The judge has concluded that the plaintiff's claims are disputed and cannot be resolved through summary adjudication. The issues in dispute include whether the defendant's bid was properly authorized, whether the bid complied with the Civil Code requirements, and whether the defendant intends to live in the property or rent it out as affordable housing. The judge has also noted that the defendant's declaration regarding his intentions is not necessarily honest, and that the trustee may have corruptly encouraged people to submit false declarations.

The case will proceed to trial, where the parties will have the opportunity to present evidence and argue their respective positions.
