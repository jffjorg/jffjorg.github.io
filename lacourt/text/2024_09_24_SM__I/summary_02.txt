And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions brought by the defense against the plaintiff and their counsel. The motion alleges that the plaintiff's counsel has repeatedly filed motions without serving them or serving them in a timely manner. The plaintiff contests this allegation, stating that all motions that could have been affected by this issue have been withdrawn or refiled. The judge has denied the motion for sanctions, citing the fact that the matter is currently in arbitration and therefore no further violations or potential violations are expected.
