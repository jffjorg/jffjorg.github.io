  Case Number:  20STCV04034    Hearing Date:   October 14, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS: Hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion
for Attorney’s Fees
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is granted in the
reduced amount of $77,532.50.
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Gerardo Sanchez
(“Plaintiff”) brought this lemon law action against General Motors, LLC (“Defendant”), alleging breach of express
and implied warranties.  
 
The motion now before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees. Defendant opposes the motion, and Plaintiff filed a reply.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD
A prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter
of right. Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4), (b). Attorney’s fees are also
recoverable as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10). The moving party bears the burden of
establishing entitlement to attorney fees. Christian Research Institute v.
Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1320. 

Courts begin this inquiry “with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there, the “lodestar
figure may then be adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement] based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.” Ibid. Relevant
multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and]
(4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132.
The Court has broad discretion to determine the amount of a
reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be overturned absent a
“manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary
findings not supported by substantial evidence.” Bernardi v. County of
Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
I. Motion for Attorney’s Fees
Under Civ. Code § 1794(d), "[i]f the buyer prevails in
an action under [the Song-Beverly Act], the buyer shall be allowed by the court
to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs
and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action."
In the present case, there is no dispute that Plaintiff is
the prevailing party in this action and is entitled to reasonable attorney fees
and costs. Thus, the only question to be determined by this motion is the award
amount.
 
Reasonableness of Hours Billed
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' Counsel (“Counsel”) billed
unreasonable and unnecessary time for pre-representation work, template-based
work, duplicative work, and unnecessary motions. Additionally, Defendants argue
Counsel inflated time spent on specific tasks.
 
A prevailing party's verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682. "In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the
evidence." Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 240 Cal.App.4th
459, 488 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).
 
The requested hours breakdown as follows:
David N. Barry, Esq.: 40.30[1]
hours at $675.00 per hour = $29,295.00 
Elizabeth Quinn Esq.: 8.0 hours at $600.00 = $4,800.00 
Anna H. Galaviz, Esq.: 6.9 hours at $565.00 = $3,898.50 
Otis R. Hayes III, Esq.: 8.8 hours at $500.00 = $4,400.00 
Andrew P.  Matera, Esq 110.60[2]
hours at $500.00 = $57,500.00 
Debora Rabieian, Esq: 37.9 hours at $500.00 = $18,950.00 
Brian J. Kim, Esq: 10.8 hours at $350.00 = $3,780.00 
Erik Whitman, Esq: 0.9 hours at $425.00 = $382.50
Total Lodestar: $123,006.00 
 
Defendant challenges Counsel’s requested fee, arguing that
the record does not support that the reported hours were actually or reasonably
billed.  Opposition at p. 7:15-18. Defendant
argues that the reported hours are unreasonable, considering Counsel’s heavy
use of templates, that require little revision in preparing motions, discovery
drafts, and meet and confer letters. Id. at p. 7:17-24. 
Defendant argues that attorney Barry should not recover for
the 1.0 hours he billed for reviewing repair orders and researching technical
service bulletins because “time spent evaluating a potential client before engagement
is a business expense routinely treated as overheard.” Opp at. p. 8:5-11. However,
Defendant offers no authority for that proposition and the time spent was
reasonable.   
Defendant objects to the 0.4 hours attorney Barry spent drafting
the Complaint, which was nearly identical to others filed against GM. Opp. at.
p. 8:12-13. The Court finds that this time is reasonable. While templates can
save time, they do not remove the necessity of carefully checking that the work
product is accurate to the case at hand, which takes time.  Under the circumstances, 0.4 hours is a
reasonable time to draft a template complaint. 
Defendant objects to time billed for reviewing court notices.
The Court finds that the time billed for reviewing the Court’s notices and
minute orders was unreasonable.  The
Court deducts 0.3 hours from attorney Barry and 0.6 hours from attorney Matera
for time spent reviewing court notices.
Defendant argues that Counsel billed for redundant and
excessive communication with Plaintiff, arguing that the time entries appear
duplicative and inefficient. However, Defendant does not identify which entries
in particular it objects to. Throughout a multi-year litigation, Counsel’s 19.0
hours of conferences and correspondence with Plaintiff are not outside of the
reasonable range.  
Defendants argue it should not have taken attorney Barry 0.4
hours to draft a Persons Most Knowledgeable deposition notice and cover letter.
The Court agrees that 0.4 hours is excessive for this routine template-based
task and reduces attorney Barry’s hours by 0.2. 

Defendant seeks a reduction for the 0.5 hours attorney Barry
spent reading GM’s deposition objections, arguing that these objections were
the same as GM’s responses in previous cases. The Court finds that 0.5 hours is
a reasonable time to review the deposition objections. While the Defendant may
regularly reuse these objections, Counsel is entitled to thoroughly examine
them to ensure they are indeed the same objections as those seen
previously.  
Defendants likewise challenge the 4.6 hours attorney Barry
took to review Defendant’s discovery requests and prepare templated discovery
responses and deposition objections. Considering his experience with Lemon Law
cases and past litigation against GM specifically, the Court finds that this
time was excessive and reduces it by 2.0 hours. 

Similarly, Defendant objects to attorney Matera’s 4.2 hours
spent drafting meet-and-confer letters that required only moderate changes to existing
templates.  The Court agrees that this
amount of time is unreasonable, and reduces it by 1.8 hours.  
Defendant seeks a 16.6-hour reduction for time spent working
on internal memos for the case file and spent reviewing the file. The Court
agrees that it is not reasonable to bill for the internal memos and reduces attorney
Barry’s hours by 0.2, attorney Matera’s hours by 0.2, Hayes’ hours by 0.5,
Quinn’s hours by 0.8, Galaviz’s hours by 0.5, Kim’s hours by 0.5, and Whitman’s
hours by 0.2.  The Court notes that Counsel
proactively reduced the hours billed for some of the attorneys reviewing the
file to get up to speed. However, the Court additionally finds that the 1.0
hours Hayes and Quinn each spent reviewing before attending hearings are
unreasonable and excludes them. 
Defendant argues that attorney Matera should not have billed
0.5 hours to review Defendant’s stipulated protective order because it has used
this document previously in cases with Counsel. 
However, as explained above, Counsel is entitled to review the documents
to ensure they are, in fact, the same. The amount of time attorney Matera spent
doing so is not unreasonable.  
Defendants contend attorney Matera should not have taken
11.5 hours to draft motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories
and requests for production of documents, review the opposition, and draft
templated replies. The Court agrees that the time spent was unreasonable and
reduces attorney Matera’s hours by 6.5. The Court additionally reduces the time
attorney Matera spent reviewing and drafting an opposition to Defendant’s
motion to compel deposition of Plaintiff by 1.0 hours. Likewise, the 5.1 hours attorney
Matera billed for the motion to exclude Defendant’s expert, including drafting
the motion and reply, and reviewing for the hearing was unreasonable and the
Court reduces it by 2.0 hours.  Additionally,
the Court finds that the 2.6 hours attorney Matera spent reviewing and replying
to Defendant’s Ex Parte Application to Continue Trial were unreasonable and
reduces it by 1 hour.  
The Court reduces the time attorney Matera billed preparing
for expert witness depositions, which was over 6 hours, by 2 hours. Attorney
Matera spent over 30 hours responding to Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment.  The Court finds this
unreasonable and reduces it by 10 hours. 
The Court further reduced the time attorney Matera spent reviewing and
objecting to Defendant’s motion in limine by 2 hours.   
Defendant argues that Counsel should not be permitted to
bill for the 26.2 hours spent traveling to hearings or vehicle inspections.
While it is permissible to bill for time spent traveling, such local travel is
typically charged at a reduced rate. 
Accordingly, the Court will reduce the rate for time spent traveling to
$325 per hour. This reflects a reduction of 5.7 hours for attorney Barry, 4.1
hours for Kim, 10.8 hours for Rabieian, 3.7 hours for Quinn, and 1.9 hours for
Galaviz.  
Finally, Defendant argues that the time Rabieian spent on
the Motion for Attorney’s fees and Reply is excessive. The Court agrees. Rabieian
billed six hours drafting the fee motion, reviewing the opposition, and writing
the reply. Based on the routine nature of these documents, the Court finds that
this was excessive and reduces it by 2 hours. 

 
Multiplier
Despite its length, this case is not unusually complex and
is typical of the cases that Counsel handles. Moreover, the contingent nature
of the work is already reflected in the hourly rate. Therefore, the Court
declines to award a multiplier. 
 
Hourly Rate
Given the routine nature of the tasks performed in this
Lemon Law case, the requested hourly rates are unreasonable.  The Court concludes that an hourly rate of $600
is appropriate for attorney Barry. Likewise, the Court concludes that an hourly
rate of $475 is appropriate for Quinn. A reasonable rate for attorney Galaviz
is $450. The Court concludes a reasonable rate for attorneys Hayes III, Matera,
and Rabieian is $375. As attorney Whitman did not provide a declaration, the
Court concludes a reasonable rate is $350 per hour.   
Accordingly, the Court awards fees as follows 
David N. Barry, Esq.: 31.9 hours at $600.00 per hour = $13,557.50  
Elizabeth Quinn, Esq.: 2.5 hours at $475.00 = $1,187.50
Anna H. Galaviz, Esq.: 4.5 hours at $450 = $2,025.00
Otis R. Hayes III, Esq.: 7.3 hours at $450 = $2,737.50
Andrew P. Matera, Esq 85.6 hours at $375 = $32,100.00
Debora Rabieian, Esq: 25.1 hours at $375= $9,412.50
Brian J. Kim, Esq: 6.2 hours at $350 = $2,170.00 
Erik Whitman, Esq: 0.7 at $350 = $245.00
Travel: 26.2 hours at $325 = $8,515.00
Total Fees: 77,532.50
II. Costs
Because a motion to strike or tax costs in the August 14,
2024, memorandum of costs is set for a hearing on December 16, 2024, the Court
defers a determination on costs to that date, at which time the Court will
consider arguments related to that relief. 
 
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is granted in the
reduced sum of $77,687.50.
