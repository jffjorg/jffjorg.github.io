And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has advanced the hearing date for the plaintiffs' motions to compel responses to requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and requests for admission. The plaintiffs served these requests on the defendants on June 26, 2024, but the defendants have failed to respond or file oppositions to the motions to compel. The court grants the motions, ordering the defendants to serve verified written responses with no objections to the requests for production of documents and special interrogatories, and to produce documents by October 28, 2024. The court also deems the requests for admission admitted and awards sanctions of $710 per motion, totaling $4,260, to be paid jointly and severally by the defendants and their attorney to the plaintiff's counsel by October 28, 2024.
