[1] Nothing herein, however, precludes Plaintiffs from
asserting that Drew was in a car accident, suffered significant injuries or
that he had money to pay medical expenses from a settlement, which money was
invested with Defendants. 


[2] In Defendants’ designation of Nolte, he was to
testify on six subjects:
1.      Standard of care of RH&A and its Enrolled Agents
as tax preparers and related issues 
2.      Whether Robert Hall and RH&A were an “investment
advisor.” 
3.      Whether Enrolled Agents are fiduciaries.
4.      Based on industry standards, the risk level in
2014-2107 for loans with return of 12% and funding fees.
5.      Sophistication level of Plaintiffs as investors.
6.      Plaintiffs’ damages.  


[3]
The Court
denied that motion on the basis that there was a triable issue of fact as to
its validity (in face of a statute of frauds challenge), including as to the
sufficiency of the consideration where Plaintiffs arguably did not forebear
when they did not receive the proceeds from sale of the Evergreen property that
was part of what Defendants promised would be paid to them. 
 


[4] Nothing in Judge Iwasaki’s ruling indicates
otherwise: The Court then merely found a triable issue as concerns the statute
of frauds defense to the asserted agreement. The Court did not find there was
an agreement (or that there was sufficient consideration). 


[5] Whether Defendants did not comply with any discovery
orders or otherwise produce what they should have as part of the discovery
process would ordinarily be addressed through a discovery motion, as opposed to
at trial. The Court has no evidence on this issue at this time but can address
if necessary during trial.
