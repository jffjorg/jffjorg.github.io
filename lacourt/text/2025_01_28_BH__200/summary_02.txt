And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a future court hearing. The ruling addresses several issues, including the validity of a statute of frauds challenge and the sufficiency of consideration. The judge notes that the plaintiffs did not receive proceeds from the sale of the Evergreen property, which was part of what the defendants promised would be paid to them. The judge also rules that the defendants' designation of Nolte as a witness is valid, and that Nolte will testify on six subjects related to RH&A and its Enrolled Agents. The judge denies a motion by the defendants, finding that there is a triable issue of fact regarding the validity of the agreement. The judge also addresses the defendants' potential non-compliance with discovery orders, stating that the issue can be addressed during the trial if necessary.
