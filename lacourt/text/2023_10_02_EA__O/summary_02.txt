Regarding claims of severe emotional distress, the judge emphasizes the need for specific factual allegations about the nature and extent of the distress. The judge cites legal precedent to define "severe emotional distress" and notes that the plaintiffs have not provided sufficient facts to support their claims.


The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the plaintiffs may need to amend their complaint to improve clarity and provide stronger evidence to support their claims.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the upcoming court hearing. The ruling addresses the plaintiffs' claims of habitability violations and severe emotional distress. The judge finds that the defendants have mistakenly labeled the 8th cause of action (COA) as the intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) COA, when in fact it is the 7th COA. The judge also notes that the complaint is uncertain due to improper use of incorporation by reference and failure to comply with pleading standards.

The judge lists the habitability violations alleged by the plaintiffs, including excessive growths of vegetation, lack of maintenance, leaks, mold, moisture damage, structural issues, inoperable windows, gates, and doors, missing window screens, insecure stair railing, inoperable electrical system, rat infestation, ant infestation, and rattlesnake infestation.

The judge also addresses the plaintiffs' claim of severe emotional distress, citing the Restatement Second of Torts, section 46, comment j, which states that complete emotional tranquility is seldom attainable and that some degree of transient and trivial emotional distress is a part of the price of living among people. The judge concludes that the plaintiffs have failed to set forth any facts that indicate the nature or extent of any mental suffering incurred as a result of the defendants' alleged outrageous conduct.

Overall, the judge finds that the plaintiffs' pleadings are uncertain and that they have failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the plaintiffs' case may be dismissed due to their failure to comply with pleading standards and provide sufficient evidence to support their claims.
