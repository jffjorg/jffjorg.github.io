And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the complaint and finds that it is uncertain due to improper use of incorporation by reference. The complaint also fails to comply with pleading standards and is unclear about the inspection of the unit. The judge notes that the complaint cites to Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980), but the plaintiffs have not provided an analysis of how the facts of that case are relevant to the current case.

The judge also finds that the complaint's allegations of emotional distress are unclear and do not provide sufficient evidence of the severity of the distress. The judge notes that emotional distress must be severe to be considered valid and that the plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims.

Finally, the judge notes that the defendants mistakenly labeled the 8th COA as the IIED, but the IIED COA is actually the 7th COA. The judge concludes that the complaint is uncertain and finds the pleadings uncertain due to the improper use of incorporation by reference.
