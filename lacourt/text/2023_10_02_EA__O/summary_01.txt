And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The plaintiffs alleged various causes of action, including violation of Civil Code section 1942.4 and intentional infliction of emotional distress, but the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Judge rules that the complaint is uncertain and fails to plead essential facts, including the specific dates of inspection and notice, and the nature and extent of the emotional distress. The Judge also sustains the demurrer as to the intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action because the complaint does not explain the specific conduct that caused the emotional distress. The Judge grants the defendants' motion to strike punitive damages as moot.
