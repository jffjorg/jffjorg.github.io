And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The plaintiffs alleged various causes of action, including violation of Civil Code section 1942.4 and intentional infliction of emotional distress, but the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Judge rules that the complaint is uncertain and fails to plead essential facts, including the specific dates of inspection and notice, and the nature and extent of the emotional distress. The Judge also sustains the demurrer as to the intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action because the complaint does not explain the specific conduct that caused the emotional distress. The Judge grants the defendants' motion to strike punitive damages as moot.

Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has sustained the demurrer filed by defendants with leave to amend as to the first and seventh causes of action. The first cause of action alleges violation of California Civil Code section 1942.4, and the seventh cause of action alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court found that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and was unclear and uncertain. The court also found that the pleading failed to plead essential facts with the requisite particularity. The court gave plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint to correct these defects. The motion to strike punitive damages is moot as a result of the court's ruling.

Summary:
This is a habitability case filed by Plaintiffs John Hale and Erica Henderson against Defendants KENNETH SHU, TIFFANY SHU, KENNETH SHU as TRUSTEE TO THE SHU KENNETH AND TIFFANY TRUST, and KENNETH SHU as TRUSTEE TO THE SHU TRUST. The case involves multiple causes of action, including violation of California Civil Code section 1942.4, tortious breach of the warranty of habitability, private nuisance, business and professions code section 17200, et seq., negligence, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence per se, violation of consumer legal remedies act, intentional influence to vacate, violation of Los Angeles County Retaliatory Eviction and Anti-Harassment Ordinance, and trespassing. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the 1st COA for violation of Civil Code section 1942.4 and the 7th COA for IIED because Plaintiffs have failed to plead sufficient facts. The court finds the pleadings uncertain and Plaintiffs have not cited to any legal authority to maintain that failure to perform repairs constitutes the requisite conduct to support an IIED COA. The court also finds that emotional damages are conclusively pled but the allegation does not explain the nature nor extent of the emotional distress.
