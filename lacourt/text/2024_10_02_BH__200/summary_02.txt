And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a stay on appeal in a probate case involving the estate of Amy, who passed away. The question is whether the Probate Code or the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) governs the stay. The judge notes that the juvenile proceedings are not relevant to this question. The judge also does not need to consider whether there would be an offset in claims against the estate.

The judge mentions that the stock in question may not be material to the case, as the surviving spouse would still be entitled to a share of the property under the Probate Code, regardless of whether it is separate or community property. The judge is not considering the additional reason mentioned by judgment creditors that there would be no offset because the Special Administrator took significant monies from Amy shortly before and after her death.
