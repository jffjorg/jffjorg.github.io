[1] Melvin A., supra, has no bearing here: Whether
juvenile proceedings are governed by the CCP as opposed to the Welfare &
Institutions Code is not necessarily relevant to whether the Probate Code
governs stays on appeal as opposed to the CCP.   


[2] The Court therefore does not have to also address
whether there may be the additional reason judgment creditors assert there
would be no offset; namely, their claims in the Special Administrator’s separate
petition to recover from MV significant monies he took from Amy shortly before
and after her death.

However, it may not be material whether the stock was her separate property as
opposed to community property. As Amy’s surviving spouse, he would still be
entitled to some share of that property (absent an adverse finding under
Probate Code sec. 259) that would still be far more than the amount of the
order here.
