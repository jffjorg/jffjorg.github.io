And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for an order staying the enforcement of an order awarding attorneys' fees and costs to Michael Velcherean (MV). The motion is based on Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 918.5, which allows a judgment debtor to stay enforcement of a judgment if they are likely to recover a greater sum from judgment creditors.

The judge finds that MV is unlikely to prevail on his First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) in a related civil case, which alleges that judgment creditors wrongfully withheld shares of O'Tasty Foods (OTF) stock from him. The judge also finds that even if MV were to prevail on the FACC, he may be deemed to have predeceased Amy Huang, the owner of the OTF stock, under Probate Code section 259.

The judge denies the motion, finding that there is no likely set-off that would justify a stay. The judge also finds that MV's arguments are based on incomplete and inaccurate information, and that MV has not addressed key issues in the case.
