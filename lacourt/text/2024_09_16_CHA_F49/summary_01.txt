  - "The Court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust."

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to deem admitted requests for admission, set one, and granted the motion in part. The judge has also granted the request for monetary sanctions in part. The judge has determined that the defendant failed to serve timely responses to requests for admission and form interrogatories, but has relieved the defendant from waiving any objections based on excusable neglect. The judge has ordered the defendant to pay $311.65 in attorney's fees and costs to the plaintiff's attorney.
