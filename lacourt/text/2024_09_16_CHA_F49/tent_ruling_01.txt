The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.   BACKGROUND   This action arises from alleged injuries that Plaintiffs  sustained in a vehicle accident on November 8, 2022.   On November 20, 2023, Plaintiffs Pablo Gaspar (“Pablo”) and  Joanna Gaspar (“Joanna”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) initiated this action against  Defendant Cole Baber (“Defendant” or “Baber”) and  Does 1 to 25, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Motor Vehicle  Liability, and (2) General Negligence. Subsequently, Defendant filed his Answer  to the Complaint on March 28, 2024.   On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff Joanna filed the instant Motion to Deem Admitted  Request for Admission, Set One (the “Motion”). Additionally, Joanna requests  monetary sanctions against Defendant and his counsel.     Subsequently, Defendant filed his Opposition on August 28,  2024, and Plaintiff replied on September 4, 2024.   ANALYSIS   “Any party may  obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other party to the action  admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters  of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for  admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”¿  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after service of requests for  admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original  of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on  all other parties who have appeared ....”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.  (a).)¿   If a party to  whom request for admissions is served fails to provide a timely response, the  party to whom the request was directed waives any objections, including based  on privilege or the work product doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.  (a).) The requesting party can move for an order that the genuineness of any  documents and the truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed  admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,  subd. (b).) The court shall issue this order unless the party to whom the  request was made serves a response in substantial compliance prior to the  hearing on the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿   A.     Motion to Deem  Admitted Requests for Admission, Set One   Plaintiff Joanna’s counsel  (“Counsel”) attests that on January 29, 2024, Defendant was served with the  first set of Requests for Admission, to which responses were due on March 4,  2024. (Sadeghian Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. “2.”) Having not received any responses by the  due date, Counsel sent Defendant’s counsel a written meet and confer letter on  April 4, 2024, requesting Defendant to serve responses, without objection, by  April 18, 2024. (Id. ¶ 6, Ex. “3.”) Subsequently, on April 18, 2024,  Counsel sent an email to Defendant, granting an extension to respond by May 2,  2024. (Tiller Decl. ¶ 8.) On May 14, 2024, Defendant emailed Counsel the  discovery responses. (Id. ¶ 12.)    Based on the above records, the  Court determines that Defendant failed to serve a timely response.    Nevertheless, under Code of  Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), the court, on  motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both  of the following conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has  subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections  2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve a  timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.    Here, Defendant’s counsel contends that her  firm received the case file on March 28, 2024, after it was transferred from  the previous attorney. (Tiller Decl. ¶ 3.) A copy of the discovery requests was  subsequently provided to Defendant’s counsel on April 9, 2024. (Id. ¶  4.) Defendant’s counsel prepared the discovery responses and received  verification signed by Defendant on May 2, 2024 (Id. ¶ 9.) However, due  to an oversight, discovery responses were not sent by the paralegal on the due  date. (Id. Ex. “4.”)   First, the Court notes that Joanna’s  Reply does  not contest that Defendant’s subsequent response, albeit untimely, is in  substantial compliance with relevant Code of Civil Procedure sections.   Second,  the Court observes that the provision  in section 2033.300 regarding relief based on mistake, inadvertence and  excusable neglect is identical in most respects to the language and spirit of  section 473, subdivision (b). Both statutes serve similar purposes – to allow  relief where it serves the interests of substantial justice. The Court’s discretion in granting  such relief is not unlimited  and must be exercised in conformity with the spirit of relief intended by the  statute so that substantial justice is served, not defeated. Because the law  favors that cases be tried and decided on their merits, if there are any doubts  whether relief should be granted, they must be resolved in favor of the person  seeking relief. (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168  Cal.App.4th 1403, 1419.)   Based on the declaration submitted by  Defendant’s counsel and the application of relevant legal principles, the Court,  in its discretion, finds that Defendant has sufficiently demonstrated excusable  neglect, thereby justifying relief from the waiver that would preclude him from  asserting any objections to the requests. The Court perceives no prejudice to  Plaintiff resulting from the delay, other than the need to pursue his case on  the merits.   Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion to  Deem Admitted.   A.     Monetary  Sanctions   “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction  under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or  both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission  necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)   Although the Court has relieved  Defendant from waiving any objections as previously addressed, it finds that  the mandatory sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,  subdivision (c) are still applicable in this case.    Given that the  Motion and attached declarations share significant similarities with several  similar motions filed in this case, the Court determines the total and  reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed  in connection with the Motion to be $311.65, calculated based on a reasonable  hourly rate of $250.00 for one hour reasonably spent, in addition to a $61.65  filing fee.    Therefore, the Court GRANTS  IN PART Plaintiff Joanna’s request for monetary sanctions.   CONCLUSION   Plaintiff Joanna Gaspar’s Motion to Deem Admitted Requests for  Admission, Set One, is DENIED.   Plaintiff Joanna Gaspar’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED  IN PART.   Defendant  Cole Baber and his attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally pay  $311.65 to Plaintiff’s attorney of record within 20 days.   Moving  party to give notice.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO
FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE; REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS [1930]



Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 23CHCV03549



 

Motion
filed: 5/13/24

 

MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Joanna Gaspar 

RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Cole Baber 

NOTICE: OK.

 

RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court compelling Defendant to serve verified responses, without
objection, to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and imposing monetary sanctions
against Defendant and his attorney of record, in the amount of $2,436.65.

 

TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is DENIED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.

 

BACKGROUND

 

This action arises from alleged injuries that Plaintiffs
sustained in a vehicle accident on November 8, 2022.

 

On November 20, 2023, Plaintiffs Pablo Gaspar (“Pablo”) and
Joanna Gaspar (“Joanna”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) initiated this action against
Defendant Cole Baber (“Defendant” or “Baber”) and
Does 1 to 25, alleging (1) Motor Vehicle Liability, and (2) General Negligence.
Subsequently, Defendant filed his Answer to the Complaint on March 28, 2024.

 

On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff Joanna filed the instant Motion to Compel Defendant’s
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One (the “Motion”). Additionally, Joanna
requests monetary sanctions against Defendant and his counsel.  

 

Subsequently, Defendant filed his Opposition on August 27,
2024, and Plaintiff replied on September 4, 2024.

 

ANALYSIS

 

If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses and for a monetary sanction.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (b).)  The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel
where no responses have been served. All that needs to be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served.  (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)

 

A.   
Motion to
Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One

 

Plaintiff Joanna’s counsel
(“Counsel”) attests that on January 29, 2024, Defendant was served with the
first set of Form Interrogatories, to which responses were due on March 4,
2024. (Sadeghian Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. “2.”) Having not received any responses by the
due date, Counsel sent Defendant’s counsel a written meet and confer letter on
April 4, 2024, requesting that Defendant serve responses, without objection, by
April 18, 2024. (Id. ¶ 6, Ex. “3.”) Subsequently, on April 18, 2024,
Counsel sent an email to Defendant, granting an extension to respond by May 2,
2024. (Tiller Decl. ¶ 8.) On May 14, 2024, Defendant emailed Counsel the
discovery responses. (Id. ¶ 12.) 

 

Based on the above records, the
Court determines that Defendant failed to serve a timely response.
Nevertheless, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b),
the court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination
that both of the following conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 

 

Firstly, the Court notes that Joanna’s
Reply does
not contest that Defendant’s subsequent response is in substantial compliance
with relevant Code of Civil Procedure sections.

 

Secondly,
the Court observes that the provision
in section 2030.290 regarding relief based on mistake, inadvertence and
excusable neglect is identical in most respects to the language and spirit of
section 473, subdivision (b). Both statutes serve similar purposes – to allow
relief where it serves the interests of substantial justice. The Court’s
discretion in granting such relief is not unlimited and must be exercised in conformity with the spirit of
relief intended by the statute so that substantial justice is served, not
defeated. Because the law favors that cases be tried and decided on their
merits, if there are any doubts whether relief should be granted, they must be
resolved in favor of the person seeking relief. (New Albertsons, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1419.)

 

Based on the declaration submitted by Defendant’s counsel
and the application of relevant legal principles, the Court, in its discretion,
finds that Defendant has sufficiently demonstrated excusable neglect, thereby
justifying relief from the waiver that would preclude him from asserting any
objections to the interrogatories. The Court perceives no prejudice to
Plaintiff resulting from the delay, other than the need to pursue their case on
the merits.

 

Accordingly, the Court
DENIES the Motion.

 

B.    
Monetary
Sanctions

 

Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290, subdivision (c), “[t]he Court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust....” Additionally, California Rules of
Court rule 3.1348(A) further provides, “The Court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)

 

Here, Defendant did not provide
responses to the Form Interrogatories within the timeframe set forth under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.260. Although Defendant has subsequently served
his untimely responses, the Court finds that it is appropriate to impose
monetary sanctions. 

 

Given that the Motion and attached
declarations share significant similarities with several similar motions filed
in this case, the Court determines the total and reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with
the Motion to be $311.65, calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of
$250.00 for one hour reasonably spent, in addition to a $61.65 filing fee.

 

Therefore, the Court GRANTS
IN PART Plaintiff Joanna’s request for monetary sanctions.

 

CONCLUSION

 

Plaintiff Joanna Gaspar’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, is DENIED.

 

Defendant
Cole Baber and his attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally pay
$311.65 to Plaintiff’s attorney of record within 20 days.

 

Moving
party to give notice.
