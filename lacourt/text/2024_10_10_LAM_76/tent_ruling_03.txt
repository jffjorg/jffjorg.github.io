ANALYSIS
Motion For Judgment On The Pleadings
Meet and Confer
            The
Declaration of Kimberly L. Phan reflects that Defendant’s counsel satisfied the
meet and confer requirement set forth in CCP § 439.
Discussion
Defendant JLR Los Angeles, LLC dba
Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles moves for judgment on the pleadings as to the
Complaint.
1.         First
Cause of Action (Fraud and Deceit).
            Defendant
argues that the RISC attached as Exhibit A to the Complaint plainly states that
the cash price of the Vehicle was $134,310.00, not $122,310.00 [Exhibit A to
Complaint]. Furthermore, the RISC plainly states that she is purchasing
optional surface protection products including the Ding Shield for $499.00 and
Xzilon for $890.00 for a total of $1,389.00 in optional products/services.
[Exhibit A to Complaint]. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s reliance on alleged
oral misrepresentations to the contrary was not reasonable once she proceeded
to sign the written contract.
On a motion for judgment on the
pleadings, the same rules applicable on demurrer apply. (County of Orange v. Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs
(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 21, 32-33.) 
“[F]acts appearing
in exhibits attached to the complaint will also be accepted as true and, if
contrary to the allegations in the pleading, will be given precedence.
(Citation omitted.)” (Dodd v. Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1624, 1627.)
            Plaintiff
alleges as follows:
 
23. The Subject Vehicle was advertised
at a price of $122,310.00. However, the Subject Vehicle was sold to Plaintiff
for the cash price of $134,310.00. Consequently, by subtracting the advertised
price of the Subject Vehicle, it becomes evident that the cash price of the
Subject Vehicle exceeded the advertised selling price by $12,000.00.
            . . . 
 
27. Aside from the fact that the
Subject Vehicle was sold to Plaintiff for $12,000.00 above the advertised
price, she was charged $1,389.00 for optional products.  
 
28. Plaintiff was charged for the
optional products which she did not intend to acquire.
 
29. The optional products include but
are not limited to the following: XZILON ($890.00) and DING SHIELD ($499.00)
surface protection products.
     (Complaint, ¶¶ 23, 27 – 29.)
            However,
as reflected in the RISC attached as Exhibit A to the Complaint, the Cash Price
of the vehicle is $134,310.00, the price of the ding shield was $499.00 and the
price of the xzilion is $890. (RISC, ¶ 1.A, ¶ 1.E(1) & (2).) These amounts
constituted portions of the “Total Cash Price” of $148,669.08 for purposes of
the Itemization of the Amount Financed (RISC, ¶ 1.) Because these amounts were
disclosed to Plaintiff in a writing, which she signed, she cannot claim fraud
in the execution, despite Defendant’s prior representations to the contrary,
unless she had no reasonable opportunity to read the contract before signing it:
[A] party claiming fraud in the execution of a contract must prove that
he or she had no reasonable opportunity to learn the character or the essential
terms of the document he or she was signing. (Id. at p. 423.) A party cannot
establish fraud in the execution if he or she failed to read the contract
despite having had a reasonable opportunity to do so. (Ibid.) Rosenthal stated
that statements assuring the plaintiffs that the written agreements were
unimportant, “even if falsely and fraudulently made, do not void a written
contract, because it is generally unreasonable, in reliance on such assurances,
to neglect to read a written agreement before signing it.” (Id. at p. 424.)


(Chapman v. Skype Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th
217, 232-33.) 
            As such, the motion for judgment on
the pleadings as to the first cause of action is GRANTED with leave to amend.
2.         Second
Cause of Action (Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing).
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff signed the written contract attached as Exhibit A, and
Plaintiff does not contend that she has not received the benefits of the
contract under the terms of the RISC.
            The
elements of a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing
sounding in contract are: (1) the existence of a contractual relationship between the
parties (Racine & Laramie, Ltd. v. Department of Parks & Recreation (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1026, 1031); (2)
defendant was not expressly permitted by the contract to engage in the conduct
which constitutes the alleged breach (Wolf
v. Walt Disney Pictures & Television (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1107,
1120-1121); (3) defendant subjectively lacked a good faith belief in the
validity of the act or the act was intended to frustrate the
common purpose of the agreement (Wolf,
supra, 162 Cal.App.4th at
1123) or defendant’s conduct was objectively
unreasonable (Carma Developers, Inc. v.
Marathon Development California, Inc. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 342, 372-73); (4)
the act or conduct was contrary
to the contract’s express purposes or the parties' legitimate expectations as
expressed in a specific contractual obligation (Carma Developers, supra,
2 Cal.4th at 373) or otherwise frustrates the other party’s rights
to express contractual benefits (Racine
& Laramie, Ltd., supra, 11
Cal.App.4th at 1031-32; Pasadena Live v. City of Pasadena (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1089, 1094); and (5)
resulting damages (Thompson Pacific
Construction, Inc. v. City of Sunnyvale (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 525, 541).
            Plaintiff
alleges as follows at ¶¶ 72, 73 of the Complaint:
 
72. Consequently, Defendant
breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in the
offer made to Plaintiff by advertising the Subject Vehicle at a low price,
inducing her to visit Defendant’s place of business, and then upselling without
proper disclosure. 
 
73. Defendant’s conduct prevented
Plaintiff from receiving the benefits under the contract. Since Defendant
breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when
misrepresenting the price of the Subject Vehicle, Plaintiff has never received
the benefit of the bargain. Defendant did not act in good faith because it was
not honest and actively intended to mislead Plaintiff and take unfair advantage
of him.
     (Complaint, ¶¶
72, 73.)
            “[T]he
implied covenant is a supplement to an existing contract, and thus it does not
require parties to negotiate in good faith prior to any agreement.” (McClain
v. Octagon Plaza, LLC (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 784, 799. As discussed above
re: the first cause of action, the true price was disclosed to Plaintiff in the
written RISC she signed, which constituted her manifestation of acceptance of
the offer. Thus, no implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing existed prior
to Plaintiff signing the written contract.
            The motion
for judgment on the pleadings as to the second cause of action is GRANTED with
leave to amend.
            Plaintiff
is given 30 days’ leave to amend.
