"No such consent is asserted herein."
"The doctrine of sovereign immunity prohibits any sort of judicial action against the United States in the absence of its consent, a consent usually manifested by legislation."
"Government contractor immunity is derived from the government's immunity from suit where the performance of a discretionary function is at issue."
"The court does not address the remainder of the EEOC's arguments because the doctrine of sovereign immunity prevents disclosure of the records Plaintiff seeks."

Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the EEOC's motion for a protective order against the subpoena served on PMR by Plaintiff, preventing the disclosure of records to Plaintiff. The motion to quash the deposition subpoena is also granted in its entirety. The Judge finds that the doctrine of sovereign immunity prevents disclosure of the records, citing various court cases and regulations. The Judge also denies the joinder of PMR to the motion to quash deposition subpoena as untimely served.
