And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court grants the motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents numbers 4, 9, and 12 from Plaintiff James Richardson. The responses consist of references to other items, which constitutes an improper, factually incomplete answer. The responding party may not refer to prior discovery. The unopposed motion is granted, and the responding party is ordered to serve responses in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.210-2031.240 within 30 days of this order. The court reserves the right to set an OSC re: Discovery Referee in lieu of a hearing on any given motion, and may take off any and all motions in lieu of the OSC hearing. The court invites the parties to continue meeting and conferring, including the provision of supplemental responses, when possible."
