Here is a summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a case filed by Christopher Brown against the City of Compton, Compton Housing Authority, and Delmonsha Green. The court granted a summary judgment motion (MSJ) filed by the defendants, and judgment was entered in their favor. The plaintiff is now seeking a new trial, arguing that the MSJ was not served on his attorney of record, Darren Richie, and that the court failed to specify the reasons for its determination. The court has denied the motion for a new trial, finding that Dre Law's actions and omissions led the defendants to believe that service was proper at the Beverly Hills office, and therefore, service at that location only does not warrant a new trial. The court notes that the result might be different if a motion were filed under the mandatory provision of Code Civ. Proc. ยง 473(b).
