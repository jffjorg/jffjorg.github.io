And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge is considering terminating sanctions against Plaintiffs Lizbeth Brito and Luis Humberto Lopez, including striking their pleadings with respect to Defendant Rosecrans Avenue Property, LLC. This is because Plaintiffs failed to provide discovery responses despite being ordered to do so by the Court. The Judge is basing its decision on California discovery law, which authorizes a range of penalties for conduct amounting to "misuse of the discovery process." The Judge will not award additional monetary sanctions. The Court's decision is based on the failure of the Plaintiffs to comply with the discovery process and to provide any opposition to the Defendant's motion. The Judge is encouraging counsel to submit on the tentative ruling rather than appearing in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
