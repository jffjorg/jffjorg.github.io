And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in this case, which arises from a fist fight between Randall Kaplan and Gimselstob during Halloween trick-or-treating. The Kaplans are seeking to seal the deposition testimony and accompanying records of Randall's physiatrist, Dr. Winston Alt, which were attached to various discovery briefings. The judge denies the motion to seal, finding that the Kaplans failed to establish an overriding interest that would support sealing. The judge notes that simply because the medical information is private or is subject to a protective order does not mean that a sealing order is justified. The judge also finds that the information is highly relevant and the public should be able to evaluate it in assessing the merit of the Kaplans' claims and defenses. The judge orders the moving party to give notice and encourages counsel to submit on the tentative rather than appearing in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
