And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to quash in part the deposition subpoena issued by the plaintiff to Paul Sullivan and Associates, Inc. The subpoena requests production of business records, including communications with Jake Courtney related to the case of Hatfield v. Renville. The defendant argues that Courtney was retained to assist with mediation and settlement negotiations in the underlying motor vehicle case, and therefore the requested communications fall within the scope of the mediation privilege. The court agrees, finding that the mediation privilege is broadly interpreted and that the requested communications are not discoverable. The motion is granted, and Paul Sullivan and Associates, Inc. need not respond to request number eight.
