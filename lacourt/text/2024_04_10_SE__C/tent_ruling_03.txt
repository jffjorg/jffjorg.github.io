TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant
Cerritos Gardens, LLC’s motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff is GRANTED. No sanctions.
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
The
motion is unopposed as of April 8, 2024. 
 
 
This is a wrongful eviction case. Defendant Cerritos
Gardens, LLC moves
to compel the PMQ deposition of Plaintiff pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450.  
 
Discussion
 
Per
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, if a party to the action fails to
appear for deposition after service of a deposition notice and the party has
not served a valid objection to that deposition notice, the party that noticed
the deposition may move for an order to compel the deponent’s attendance and
testimony.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (a).)  
 
“The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce
the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the
deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).) The
declaration shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) 
 
On October 26,
2023, Defendant noticed the deposition of Plaintiff. (Decl. Mallon, ¶ 2, Ex. A.)
Plaintiff did not object to the notice or appear for the deposition. (Decl.
Mallon, ¶¶ 3,4.) Defendant did not establish that it met and conferred with
Plaintiff regarding Plaintiff’s nonappearance. However, the Court will issue a
ruling because the motion is unopposed.  
 
Defendant’s
motion to compel is GRANTED.  Plaintiff
is compelled to appear for her deposition within 30 days.  Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of
$1,535.00.  Given the lack of a meet and
confer declaration, no sanctions are imposed.
