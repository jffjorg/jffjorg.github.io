This is a
wrongful death action. 
Plaintiffs
David Woolsey and Suzanne Woolsey move Ex Parte for an order compelling the
deposition of Defendants’ Expert Witness.  Trial in this matter is
currently scheduled for April 24, 2024.
A party may
seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex
parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
Defendants
argue that they provided Plaintiffs with available dates and agreed to extend
expert discovery, so the ex parte application is unnecessary.

David Woolsey and Suzanne Woolsey’s Ex Parte Application is DENIED. 
Plaintiffs may seek a trial continuance in Dept.SE- F.
