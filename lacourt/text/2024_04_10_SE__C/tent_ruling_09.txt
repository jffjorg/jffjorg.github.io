TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant Ean Holdings, LLC’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
The motion is unopposed as of April 9, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff
Mari Innabi sues defendants Demis Cobonlopez; Ean Holdings, LLC; and DOES 1 to
50 for a motor vehicle collision that occurred on November 27, 2021, in Santa
Ana, California. Defendant Demis Cobonlopez allegedly operated the motor
vehicle, and Ean Holdings, LLC allegedly owned the motor vehicle. 
 
Defendant
Ean Holdings, LLC demurs to the complaint in its entirety and the first cause
of action because the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction based on
preemption, the complaint fails to state a cause of action, and it is
uncertain. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendant did not satisfy
the meet-and-confer requirements. (Code. Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) Defendant
did not submit a declaration about its meet-and-confer efforts, if any. (Code.
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) However, a determination by the court that
the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule
or sustain a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a) (40.) 
 
Requests for Judicial
Notice
 
Defendant requests
judicial notice of various federal cases and statutes. Based on Evidence Code
section 451, subdivision (a), the Court grants the requests. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant contends it cannot be held liable based on vicarious liability under 49 U.S.C. section 30106(a).  49 U.S.C. section 30106(a) (“Graves Amendment”)
states: 
 
(a)
In general.-- An owner of a motor vehicle that rents or leases the vehicle to a
person (or an affiliate of the owner) shall not be liable under the law of any
State or political subdivision thereof, by reason of being the owner of the
vehicle (or an affiliate of the owner), for harm to persons or property that
results or arises out of the use, operation, or possession of the vehicle
during the period of the rental or lease, if— 
 
(1)
the owner (or an affiliate of the owner) is engaged in the trade or business of
renting or leasing motor vehicles; and 
 
(2)
there is no negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the owner (or an
affiliate of the owner). 
 
(42 U.S.C. § 30106.) 
 
There are
no allegations in the complaint that Defendant is engaged in the business of
renting or leasing motor vehicles.
 
Defendant
makes no further arguments. 
 
Thus, the
Court overrules the demurrer.
