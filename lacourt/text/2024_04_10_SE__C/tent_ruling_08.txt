NO.:  23NWCV01596
HEARING:
 4/10/24 @ 9:30 A.M. 
 
#6
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC’s motion to compel
further responses to Request for Production of Documents (Set One) is CONTINUED
to May 15, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Dept.
SE-C.  
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE. 
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. Plaintiff
Misty Krishelle Banks sues Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC for breach of
express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and violation of Civil Code
section 1793.2, subdivision (b). 
 
Plaintiff Misty Krishelle Blanks moves to
compel further responses to request numbers 1 to 32 served on defendant Jaguar Land
Rover North America, LLC. Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 allows a
party to file a motion compelling further responses to document requests if the
party finds that the response is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an
objection is without merit or too general. 

 
It is apparent
to the Court that neither side has addressed the discovery requests with
sufficient specificity. The parties are ordered to meet and confer again.  The hearing is CONTINUED to May 15, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.  
If court
intervention is still necessary, the parties are ordered to submit a JOINT
STATEMENT in 20 days regarding the specific items of discovery still at issue.
