And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the hearing for the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production, as well as the motion to compel compliance with the defendant's statement of compliance, is cancelled. This is because the court had previously adjudicated both motions on February 14, 2024. As a result, there is no need for a hearing on these matters.
