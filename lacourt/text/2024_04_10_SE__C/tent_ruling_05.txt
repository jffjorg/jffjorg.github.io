Feliciano vs Tina M. Leuth, Case No. 23NWCV00389
This action is
based on a motor vehicle accident.
Plaintiff
Heriberto Feliciano moves Ex Parte to Set Aside an Order for Dismissal. 
A party may
seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex
parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
Plaintiff
contends that he will be denied a trial on the merits if he is not allowed to
set aside the dismissal due to the expired two-year statute of limitations.
 This motion is unopposed. 
Plaintiff
Heriberto Feliciano’s Ex Parte Application is DENIED.  Alternatively, the
Court specially sets a hearing for the Motion to Set Aside Order for Dismissal
on June 11, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  
The ex parte
application is deemed to be the moving papers.  Opposition and Reply
briefs shall be filed within the time period prescribed by CCP § 1005. 
Counsel is advised that the Court typically requires litigants to file noticed
motions after first making a reservation on the Court’s reservation
system.  A party may then seek ex parte relief if necessary.  
Moving party to
give notice.
