The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mari Innabi vs. Demis Cobonlopez, et al. The defendant, Ean Holdings, LLC, filed a demurrer seeking to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction due to preemption, the complaint fails to state a cause of action, and it is uncertain. The court has overruled the demurrer, finding that the defendant is not engaged in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles, which is a requirement under the Graves Amendment. The court has also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of various federal cases and statutes.
