And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for an order establishing admissions by the defendant and sanctions. The plaintiff, Brandon Charif, is seeking an order deeming the matters specified in his Requests for Admissions, Set Two, admitted and sanctions of $1,060 against the defendant, Fuelster Technologies, Inc., and its former counsel, David Martin Gonor. The defendant failed to respond to the requests for admissions, and the plaintiff incurred costs of $500 hourly rate and $60 filing fee.

The judge grants the motion for order establishing admissions, deeming the matters specified in the requests for admissions admitted. The judge also grants the request for sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $560, payable within 20 days of the order. The judge reduces the sanctions awarded due to the plaintiff's counsel duplicating his work on this motion, which is one of a series of motions to compel. The plaintiff shall give notice of the order.
