 Case Number:  21STCV40807    Hearing Date:   October 23, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
November 5, 2021, Plaintiff Allstate Northbrook
Indemnity Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Manuel
C Carrillo (“Carrillo”), Myira Alejandra Figueroa (“Figueroa”), and Does 1-100
for subrogation and indebtedness. The complaint demanded $107,185.39. 
On
December 2, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted
service of the summons, complaint, and other documents on Carrillo on December
2, 2021. 
On
February 23, 2022, the clerk entered Carrillo’s default. 
On
April 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service of
an amended summons, amendment to complaint, complaint, statement of damages,
and other documents on Figueroa on April 23, 2023. 
On
October 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment of $7,716.89
against Carrillo and Figueroa.  The
request was set for hearing on December 4, 2023. 
On
October 9, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
October 23, 2023, the clerk entered Figueroa’s default. 
On
December 4, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s request for default judgment and
entered judgment of $7,716.89 against Carrillo and Figueroa.  The Court observed that while Plaintiff’s
evidence supported a judgment for $107,185.39 – the amount demanded in the
complaint – Plaintiff was asking for judgment of only $7,716.89.  The Court “assume[d]
that Plaintiff intend[ed] to seek a judgment that is $100,000 less than the
amount demanded in the complaint.” 
On
March 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application to amend the judgment nunc pro
tunc under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. 
Plaintiff argued the judgment amount of $7,716.89 was a “typographical
error” and the Court should have entered judgment for $107,185.39.  Plaintiff did not set the application for
hearing and the Court did not rule on it. 
On
August 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the entry of judgment.  The motion was set for hearing on October 23,
2024.  Defendants have not filed an
opposition. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to vacate the judgment of $7,716,89 and enter a new judgment
against Defendants for $107,185.39. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), provides in part: 
“Notwithstanding any other requirements of this
section, the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more
than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied
by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk
against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default
judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or
her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in
fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. . .
.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subdivision (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Citing
the attorney fault provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b), Plaintiff asks the Court to vacate the judgment entered on
December 4, 2023 because it was based on Plaintiff’s erroneous request for $7,716.89
in damages and costs.    Plaintiff’s counsel has submitted a
declaration stating that his mistake and neglect caused the error.  Plaintiff asks
the Court to enter a new judgment for $107,185.39. 
The motion
is untimely.  The Court entered judgment
on December 4, 2023. Plaintiff filed the motion on August 21, 2024, more than
six months after entry of judgment.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subdivision (b).) 
In
addition, the attorney fault provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b), applies only to judgments entered “against” the attorney’s
client.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subdivision (b).)  Here, the Court entered judgment in Plaintiff’s
favor. 
The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Allstate Northbrook Indemnity Company’s motion to vacate
the default judgment entered on December 4, 2023 against Defendants Manuel C Carrillo and Myira Alejandra Figueroa. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
