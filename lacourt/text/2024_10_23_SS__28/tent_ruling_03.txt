considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On July
27, 2022, Plaintiff State Farm General Ins. Co. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Genrik Dzhanikyan aka Genrik Dzanikyan dba Westside LA Apparel
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for subrogation. 
The complaint demanded $34,122.65. 
On
August 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of personal service of the summons,
complaint, and other documents on Defendant on August 3, 2023. 
On
October 20, 2023, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
December 5, 2023, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
August 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for default judgment. 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant and to award
Plaintiff $39,512.10, consisting of $34,122.65 as the demand of the complaint,
$4,839.60 in prejudgment interest, and $549.85 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff has submitted a complete default judgment
application with all required information. 
The Court grants the application and awards Plaintiff $39,512.10. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff State Farm General Ins. Co.’s
application for default judgment against Defendant Genrik Dzhanikyan aka Genrik Dzanikyan dba Westside LA
Apparel filed on August 14, 2024.  The
Court enters judgment for Plaintiff State Farm General Ins. Co. in the amount
of $39,512.10. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
