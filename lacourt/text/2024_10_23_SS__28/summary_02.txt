And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion filed by Allstate Northbrook Indemnity Company (Plaintiff) to vacate the default judgment entered on December 4, 2023 against Manuel C Carrillo and Myira Alejandra Figueroa (Defendants). The Plaintiff is seeking to vacate the judgment and enter a new one for $107,185.39, which is the amount originally demanded in the complaint. The judge has denied the motion, citing that it is untimely and that the attorney fault provision of California Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) only applies to judgments entered against the attorney's client, not in favor of the client.
