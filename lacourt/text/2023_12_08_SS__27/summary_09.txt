```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Plaintiff Saryl Radwin to Defendant City of Los Angeles's Answer and has overruled the demurrer in its entirety. The demurrer was filed because the affirmative defenses in the Answer fail to state facts, but the court finds that the Answer provides sufficient information for Plaintiff to be put on notice of those defenses. The court notes that Plaintiff will be able to obtain additional information through discovery to determine if the actual facts support those defenses. The court cites several cases, including South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen and Goodman v. Kennedy, to support its ruling. The court's tentative ruling will be adopted as the final order unless a party submits an objection or appears at the hearing to argue the matter.
