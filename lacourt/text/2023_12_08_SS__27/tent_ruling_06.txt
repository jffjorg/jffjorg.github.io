      CASE NO.: 22STCV6978
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
 
Dept.

1:30
  p.m.

Plaintiff’s attorney of record, Elina
Shakhbazyan, seeks to be relieved because there has been a breakdown in
communication. Plaintiff’s Counsel has been unable to locate or contact Plaintiff.
For a Motion to Withdraw, California
Rule of Court 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion to be directed
to the client; (2) a declaration stating in general terms the basis for the
withdrawal, without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship; (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on
all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel. Counsel’s Motion complies with Rule 3.1362.  
Absent a showing of resulting
prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
Here, trial is currently set for February 16, 2024, with a final status
conference on February 2, 2024. 
The Court finds that no prejudice will
result to Plaintiff in granting the Motion because the current trial date
provides Plaintiff with sufficient time to engage other counsel to try the case
or prepare for trial as a self-represented litigant.  Further, the trial and final status
conference dates can be changed if necessary to ensure Plaintiff is not
prejudiced by Counsel’s withdrawal.
Thus, the Court GRANTS Counsel’s Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel upon the filing of a proof of service by Counsel
demonstrating that Plaintiff was given notice of this ruling. Such proof of
service and filing of it must be completed within 7 calendar days of this ruling.
