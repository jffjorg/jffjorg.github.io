Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling by Judge Lee S. Arian concerns a case filed more than five years ago by Luisa Leal against various defendants, including Daniel Demoz and Nader Djazayeri, for injuries arising from a motor vehicle collision. Despite default being entered against some defendants, Plaintiff has failed to dismiss the Doe defendants as instructed by the Court. The Court has directed Plaintiff to submit authority on whether it can enter a default judgment in this matter, and Plaintiff has filed a brief addressing the issue. However, the Court has also noted that Plaintiff's application is still deficient and has continued the matter to allow Plaintiff's Counsel to dismiss the Doe defendants. The hearing is set for December 8, 2023, at which time the Court will determine whether it can enter a default judgment despite the five-year deadline.
