Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains David Aguilar's demurrer to Fred Wai Hung Yue's Fourth Cause of Action for Negligence in the Second Amended Complaint. The Court finds that the SAC does not adequately allege a special relationship between Aguilar and Yue, which is required to establish a duty of care. The Court notes that Aguilar's role at PC Palaces is not alleged to be that of a security guard, and the SAC does not contain any allegations that Aguilar had a special relationship with Yue. The Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
