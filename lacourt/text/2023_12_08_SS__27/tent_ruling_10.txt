CONFERENCE RE: WHETHER DEFAULT JUDGMENT CAN BE ENTERED AFTER THE FIVE-YEAR
DEADLINE
 
APPLICATION
FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Luisa Leal
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     N/A
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On September
6, 2017, Luisa Leal (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Daniel Demoz dba
Danny D Transportation (“Demoz”), Nader Djazayeri (“Djazayeri”), Black Tide
MGMT Inc., Black Tide Management Inc., Black Tide Management Inc. dba Got LAX
Limo Inc., and Got LAX Limo and Does 1 to 50 inclusive (collectively,
“Defendants”) for injuries arising from Djazayeri’s a motor vehicle collision
on September 13, 2015. 
 
            On June 11,
2019, default was entered
against Demoz and Djazayeri. 
 
            On November 13, 2020, default was entered against the
remaining Defendants.
            
            Since entry of default against Defendants, Plaintiff
filed, and the Court reviewed and denied, five default judgment
applications.  
 
At an OSC hearing on
September 12, 2023, the Court noted that this case was filed more than five
years ago.  The Court directed Plaintiff’s
Counsel to submit authority addressing if the court can enter a default judgment
given this procedural posture.
 
            On
September 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a brief regarding the Court’s authority to
enter default judgment in this matter.  Plaintiff
also filed another default judgment application.[1]  
 
            On October
24, 2023, the Court continued the matter to allow Plaintiff’s Counsel to
address the relevant issues raised in Hughes and to dismiss the Doe
defendants. The hearing was continued to 12/08/2023 at 1:30. Moreover, Counsel was
required to file a responsive brief at least 7 court days before the hearing.
            
            On November
29, 2023, which was at least 7 court days before the hearing, Plaintiff’s
Counsel filed a responsive brief addressing the relevant issues in Hughes.
Although Plaintiff acknowledged the Court’s requirement to dismiss the Doe
defendants, she failed to dismiss the Doe defendants. 
 
            
II.
       DISCUSSION
            
            Default Judgment should be denied
because Plaintiff’s application is still deficient. Plaintiff included the
relevant case law from Hughes and provided evidence showing the impracticability
in obtaining a default judgment within the five years of commencing this action.
(Hamed Yazdanpanah’s Declartion, ¶¶ 6, 13-17.) For instance, Plaintiff claims that
(1) once the request to enter default is submitted, it is ‘impractical’ to do
anything further to bring the case to trial, and thus the time between entry of
default and rejection of same is excluded from the 5-year period to bring the
case to trial and (2) Plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence in moving this
case toward a default judgment. Although Plaintiff
added relevant case law from Hughes, the Court also instructed Plaintiff
to dismiss the Doe defendants. However, she has failed to do so.
 
III.       CONCLUSION
 
            Because Plaintiff’s Counsel failed
to dismiss Doe defendants, the Court continues the matter to allow Counsel to
dismiss the Doe defendants. The hearing is continued to ________________
at 1:30. At that time, the Court will determine whether,, in fact, it can enter
default judgment despite the fact that it has been more than 5 years since
filing. 
 
            Counsel
to give notice.
