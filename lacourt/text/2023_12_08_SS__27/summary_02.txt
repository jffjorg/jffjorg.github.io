And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is issued by Judge Lee S. Arian in the case of Susanna Ruiz versus Kristine Kelly and The Kris Kelly Foundation. The case is about a dog attack that occurred in 2020, and the defendant is seeking to bifurcate the trial into two separate issues: liability and damages. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that bifurcation will not result in judicial economy and will cause inconvenience to witnesses and increase costs. The defendant replies that the majority of the evidence will be presented to prove liability, not damages. The judge denies the motion without prejudice, allowing the defendant to raise the issue again when the trial judge rules on motions in limine. The case is set to go to trial on February 28, 2024.
