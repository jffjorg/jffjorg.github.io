ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
¿On May 12, 2022, Ricardo Contreras (“Plaintiff”), filed
this premises liability action against El Gallo Market (“El Gallo”), and Does 1
to 50 (collectively, “Defendants.”) The Complaint has inconsistent incident
dates because May 18, 2020 and May 18, 2021 are both stated. Plaintiff alleges
that a sliding refrigerator door on Defendant El Gallo’s premises malfunctioned
and struck Plaintiff’s hand. As a result, Plaintiff served Defendant with the
summons, complaint, and statement of damages on June 3, 2022 by substituted
service. Default was entered against Defendant El Gallo on September 19,
2022. 
 
On October 6, 2023, Defendant El Gallo filed this motion to dismiss
without proof of service. 
 
Plaintiff did not file an opposition. 
 
II.                
Legal Standard & Discussion
 
The Moving Party moves to dismiss
the Complaint for failure to state a claim and argues that the statute of
limitations bars the claim. Plaintiff did not file an opposition. 
 
Under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
583.410, the court may, in its discretion, dismiss an action for delay in
prosecution if it deems such action appropriate under the circumstances. In
considering a motion for discretionary dismissal, the court is guided by the
factors outlined in California Rule of Court 3.1342, as established in Corrinet
v. Bardy, 35 Cal.App.5th 69, 71 (Cal. Ct. App. 2019.) 
 
Rule 3.1342 states that a proper
determination of a motion to dismiss must consider: (1) The court's case file,
declarations, and supporting data from the parties, as well as the availability
of essential parties for service of process; (2) Diligence in seeking to effect
service of process; (3) Engagement in settlement negotiations or discussions;
(4) Diligence in pursuing discovery or other pretrial proceedings, including
extraordinary relief; (5) The nature and complexity of the case; (6) Applicable
laws and related litigation; (7) Extensions of time or delays attributable to
either party; (8) Court calendar conditions and earlier trial date
availability; (9) Whether justice is best served by dismissal or trial; or (10)
Any other relevant fact or circumstance.
 
Personal Injury: Statute of
Limitations 
Two years from the injury. If the
injury was not discovered right away, then it is 1 year from the date the
injury was discovered.
 
Here, Defendant fails to include
any law, declarations, supporting data from the parties, and proof of service
since only a two-page Motion to Dismiss was filed. Moreover, Defendant alleges
that Plaintiff fails to state a claim because it is “unclear how a sliding door
fridge caused serious bodily harm”; however this is a negligence and premises
liability case where Plaintiff could provide contradictory evidence. Although
the Defendant discusses the two-year personal injury statute of limitations,
the Complaint is unclear whether the incident occurred on May 18, 2020 or May
18, 2021. 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that
Defendant has not presented sufficient evidence or arguments showing that the
Court must dismiss the action because of Plaintiff’s failure to state a claim
or based on statutory limitations. 
 
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED
without prejudice. 
 
III.             
Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Motion to Dismiss,
filed by Defendant El Gallo Market, is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Moving party is to give notice.
