The court has reviewed the motion to dismiss filed by Defendant El Gallo Market without prejudice. The motion was filed on October 6, 2023, without proof of service. The Plaintiff, Ricardo Contreras, did not file an opposition. The court has considered the factors outlined in California Rule of Court 3.1342, including the court's case file, declarations, and supporting data from the parties, as well as the availability of essential parties for service of process. The court has also considered the nature and complexity of the case, applicable laws and related litigation, extensions of time or delays attributable to either party, and court calendar conditions and earlier trial date availability.

The court finds that Defendant has not presented sufficient evidence or arguments showing that the court must dismiss the action because of Plaintiff's failure to state a claim or based on statutory limitations. The court denies the motion to dismiss without prejudice. The moving party is to give notice.
