**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has reviewed the motions filed by Defendant Bodega Latina Corporation to compel Plaintiff Marcia Sebastian's responses to discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents. The Defendant filed these motions on October 16, 2023, and no opposition was filed by the Plaintiff.

The Court finds that the Defendant properly served the discovery requests and that the Plaintiff failed to serve responses, waiving any objections to the discovery requests. As a result, the Court grants the motions and orders the Plaintiff to provide verified, objection-free responses to the discovery requests.

The Court also finds that the Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the Request for Admissions admitted against them. Additionally, the Court grants the Defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $885, which is reduced from the original request of $1,545 due to the lack of opposition and the Court's finding that the allocated hours for preparation and attendance at the hearing are excessive.

The Court orders that the Plaintiff must provide discovery responses and pay the sanctions within 30 days of the date of this order.
