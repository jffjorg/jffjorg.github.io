Hussain Siddiqi aka Arif H. Siddiqi aka Arif Siddiqi) (“Defendant Siddiqui”),
Hillcrest Renaissance Associates, LP (“Defendant Hillcrest”), and Alhambra
Renaissance, LLC (“Defendant Alhambra”). Defendant Siddiqui filed an answer on

default. Plaintiff added Aneesa Arif Siddiqi (“Defendant Siddiqi”) to the
Complaint via doe amendment on April 4, 2023. Defendant Siddiqi answered on June

23, 2024. Default judgment was entered against Defendant Alhambra on February

On September 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a writ of execution
with respect to Defendant Alhambra. Defendant Hillcrest filed the instant
Motion to Quash Writ of Execution and Sheriff’s Levy on November 21, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date.
Discussion
Defendant Hillcrest moves to quash the writ
of execution and Sheriff’s levy on the grounds that the real property sought
pursuant to the levy is not owed by Defendant Alhambra, but by Defendant
Hillcrest. The Motion is brought pursuant to case law set forth in Wilkins
v. Wilkins (1950) 95 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611, which holds “While the
creditor is, as a matter of right, entitled to an execution, the affidavit,
order and execution issued thereon are subject to review and the execution is
subject to recall, upon motion, timely made, at which time the trial court may
exercise its judicial discretion in determining whether the facts set forth in
the affidavit are true, and whether there has been a misrepresentation of the
facts or wilful suppression of facts which should have been related to the
court in the first instance . . . .” (Wilkins v. Wilkins (1950) 95
Cal.App.2d 605, 610.) Even earlier cases have held the same of the Court’s
authority: “The right of the court to recall the execution cannot be doubted if
the issuance was improperly or inadvertently made or authority therefore
revoked.” (Creditors' Adjustment Co. v. Newman (1921) 185 Cal. 509, 511.)
Also, any action that follows from a recalled writ is likewise subject to
recall. (Wellborn v. Wellborn (1942) 55 Cal.App.2d 516, 525.)
The Motion attaches evidence showing that the
levy seeks to attach property commonly known as 1 E Main Street, Alhambra,
California, 91801. (Motion, Exh. C, ¶1B.) Defendant Hillcrest submits the
declaration of its managing member, Thomas Slaught, who declares that it owns
the subject property, not Defendant Alhambra. (Motion, Slaught Decl., Exh. D.)
The declaration is supported by a title report showing title to the subject
property is vested in the name of Hillcrest Renaissance Associates, LP. (Ibid.)
Based on this evidence, to which there is no opposition, the Court finds
grounds to quash the writ of execution, and the subsequently issued levy.
Conclusion 
Defendant Hillcrest Renaissance
Associates, LP’s Motion to Quash Writ of Execution and Sheriff’s Levy is
GRANTED. 
Moving party to give
notice.
