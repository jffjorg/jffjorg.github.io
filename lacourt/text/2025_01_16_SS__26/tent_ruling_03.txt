Plaintiff Jose Avilez’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions and
Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED. JUDGMENT IS ENTERED BY DEFAULT AGAINST DEFENDANT
RAYMOND SHARIFPOUR DBA WHITE DIAMOND AUTO SALES. PLAINTIFF IS ALSO AWARDED
SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF $2,860.00. PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT
WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER. 
ANALYSIS:
On October 11,
2023, Plaintiff Jose R. Avilez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendant Raymond Sharifpour dba White Diamond Auto Sales (“Defendant Sharifpour”) and The Guaranty Company
(“Defendant Guaranty”). Defendants filed an answer on December 12, 2023. On
June 26 and 27, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel
Defendant’s Responses to Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One. (Minute Orders
06/26/24, 07/26/24.) Defendant Sharifpour
was ordered to serve verified responses and pay sanctions within 20 days’
service of the order. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff filed the first Motion for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions
against Defendant Sharifpour on August 30, 2024, seeking an order
striking their answer and entering default. Defendant Sharifpour opposed the first Motion, which came for hearing on November 5, 2024.
Following oral argument, the Court denied the first Motion, as follows:
Despite
Defendant’s failure to timely comply with the Court’s orders, verified
discovery responses have now been served. Though Plaintiff did not clearly
indicate in their reply how the responses were inadequate, at the hearing he
claims that witness addresses, presumably known to him, were not. Also,
previous sanctions remain unpaid. The threat of terminating sanctions has been
sufficient to ensure Defendant Sharifpour’s substantial if imperfect
compliance, such that an award of terminating sanctions is not necessary. The
Court agrees that Defendant Sharifpour’s failure to comply with the discovery
orders was not excusable, and will not tolerate further delay in the payment of
sanctions but it exercises its discretion to deny the Motion under these circumstances.
The Court retains jurisdiction to impose evidentiary sanctions, additional
monetary sanctions, or even terminating sanctions should Defendant not
immediately remedy the indicated shortfalls.
(Minute Order, 11/05/24, p. 2.) Plaintiff now brings a second Motion for
Terminating Sanctions. No opposition has been filed to date. 
Legal Standard
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have the discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary
sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative,
Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) The court
should look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether
terminating sanctions are appropriate. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there
is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence
showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery
rules. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A]
penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance
with discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or
bad faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) “The
court may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders:
(1)  
An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
(2)  
An order staying further proceedings by that party
until an order for discovery is obeyed.
(3)  
An order dismissing the action, or any part of the
action, of that party.
(4)  
An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)
Discussion
On June 26 and 27, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s
Motions to Compel Defendant’s Responses to Demand for Production of Documents,
Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One.
(Motion, Sadr Decl., ¶9 and Exh. 6.) Defendant Sharifpour was ordered to serve verified responses and pay
sanctions within 20 days’ service of the order. (Ibid.) Notice of the ruling was mailed to Defendant
Sharifpour on June 28, 2024. (Id. at ¶¶10-11 and Exhs. 7-8.) 
Following the filing of Plaintiff’s first
Motion for Terminating Sanctions, Defendant Sharifpour served an opposition and responses to the discovery that failed
to include the necessary witness information. (Motion, Sadr Decl., ¶¶15-16 and
Exhs. 9-10.) Following review, Plaintiff’s counsel determined that the responses
intentionally withheld material witness information. (Id. at ¶17.) Also,
the responses did not comply with Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.280 because
they failed to identify which document responds to which request. (Id.
at ¶19.) Following the hearing on the first Motion, Plaintiff again sought to
meet and confer to obtain complete responses to the discovery requests and
indicating that another motion for terminating sanctions would be filed. (Id.
at ¶22.) As of the filing of the
instant Motion, Defendant Sharifpour has not served responses with the missing
information nor paid the complete sanctions as ordered. (Id. at ¶¶21-23.)
 
Plaintiff again
moves for terminating sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030
by striking Defendant Sharifpour’s answer and entering default. The
Court finds that terminating sanctions are now warranted for Defendant’s
non-compliance with the discovery orders and in light of the Court’s warning. Plaintiff
has shown that Defendant Sharifpour’s responses were inadequate and that they
have not corrected the inadequacies as ordered by the Court on November 5,
2024. This demonstrates that Defendant Sharifpour’s compliance with the Court’s orders
cannot be achieved through lesser sanctions. Although terminating sanctions are
a harsh penalty, “[t]he court [is] not required to allow a pattern of abuse to
continue ad infinitum.” (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 262, 280.)
Nor will the Court allow Defendant Sharifpour to avoid this
result by now serving further responses. The Court’s initial order
compelling service of code-compliant responses set a deadline six months ago.
The time to comply has long since passed such that corrective action cannot now
be taken.
The Court further grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions in the amount of $2,860.00 based on 4.4 hours or attorney time billed
at $650.00. (Motion, Sadr Decl., ¶¶25-27.) The request for costs of $160.00 is
denied for lack of supporting evidence.
Conclusion
Plaintiff Jose Avilez’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions and
Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED. JUDGMENT IS ENTERED BY DEFAULT AGAINST DEFENDANT
RAYMOND SHARIFPOUR DBA WHITE DIAMOND AUTO SALES. PLAINTIFF IS ALSO AWARDED
SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF $2,860.00. PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT
WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
