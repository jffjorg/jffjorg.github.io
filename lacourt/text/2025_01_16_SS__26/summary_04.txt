And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Alliance United Insurance Company's Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint. The Plaintiff filed the original complaint on January 11, 2024, and the First Amended Complaint on October 4, 2024. However, the First Amended Complaint did not include the required attachments, which the Plaintiff now seeks to add in the Second Amended Complaint. The judge finds that the Plaintiff has satisfied the requirements for leave to amend, including providing a declaration explaining the need for the amendment and the reasons for the delay. The judge also notes that there is no indication of excusable delay or prejudice to the Defendant, who has not been served in the action. The judge orders the Plaintiff to file and serve the Second Amended Complaint within 20 days of the order.
