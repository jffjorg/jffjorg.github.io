 Case Number:  23STLC02269    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  26 TENTATIVE RULING:Defendant Taochih Peng’s Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment is DENIED.ANALYSIS:On April 6, 2023, Plaintiff United Financial Casualty Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for automobile subrogation against Defendant Taochih Peng (“Defendant”). Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive pleading, default was entered on September 30, 2024. The case was then called for trial on October 3, 2024, at which time Plaintiff appeared and represented that a request for default judgment had been filed. (Minute Order, 10/03/24.) The Court set an order to show cause regarding entry of default judgment for March 25, 2024. (Ibid.) Defendant appeared after the case had been called and was informed that notice of the order to show cause would be mailed. (Ibid.) Default judgment was entered against Defendant on October 4, 2024.On December 18, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Set Aside Default and/or Default Judgment (the “Motion”). Plaintiff filed an opposition on December 20, 2024.DiscussionDefendant moves to vacate the entry of default and default judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). An application for discretionary relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) must be made within a reasonable time, no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought, and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the party’s excusable mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the moving defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be corrected if the defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.)The Motion is supported by Defendant’s declaration, which does not provide an explanation as to their failure to file a responsive pleading upon service of the Summons and Complaint. (Motion, Peng Decl.) Instead, Defendant admits that they were served in this action on April 28, 2023. (Id. at ¶8.) The declaration addresses why Defendant was late to appear for the trial date, but this has no bearing on the default entered on September 30, 2024. Also, as Plaintiff points out, the Motion is not accompanied by a copy of Defendant’s proposed responsive pleading, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). Therefore, relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) cannot be granted.ConclusionDefendant Taochih Peng’s Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment is DENIED.Court clerk to give notice.
