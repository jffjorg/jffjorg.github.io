And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the default and default judgment entered against them. The defendant failed to file a responsive pleading to the plaintiff's lawsuit, and default was entered on September 30, 2024. The default judgment was then entered on October 4, 2024. The defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment is based on Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which allows for discretionary relief in certain circumstances. However, the judge found that the defendant's motion was not accompanied by a copy of their proposed responsive pleading, as required by the statute. Additionally, the defendant's declaration did not provide an explanation for their failure to file a responsive pleading. Therefore, the judge denied the motion.
