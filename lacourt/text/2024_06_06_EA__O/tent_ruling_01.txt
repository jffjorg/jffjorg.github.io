  Case Number:  23PSCV01102    Hearing Date:   June 6, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s APPLICATION FOR DEFAULT
JUDGMENT is DENIED without prejudice as 
Plaintiff has submitted no evidence to
support damages. 
 
Background
 
This is a
contracts case. Plaintiff Olidio Lopez alleges the following against Defendants
Leonardo Parra,[1]
Blueprints and Build Construction, Inc. (“Blueprints”), and LP Design
Construction[2]:
In September 2021, Plaintiff entered into a written contract with Blueprints
wherein Blueprints was to, amongst other things, create geological reports, do
structural design and pavement designs, and submit said designs to the city.
The total contract price was $51,250 due in stages wherein Plaintiff paid
$27,250 of that. However, Blueprints did not do the promised work.  
 
On April 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed
suit alleging the following causes of action (COAs):
 
1.     Accounting 
2.     Conversion
3.     Breach of Contract
4.     Intentional Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage
5.     Fraud
6.     Deceit
7.     Negligent Misrepresentation
8.     Violation of Fiduciary Duty 
9.     Declaratory Relief
10.  Violation of Business and Professions
Code section 17200.
 
On June 21,
2023, the court clerk rejected all three requests for entry of default, because
“*Other - Proof of Service of Summons filed 6/14/23 is faulty. Name of
defendant on proof does not match. Item #6 of proof is incomplete. Name of
defendant on request for default must match exactly as they appear on summons and
complaint. Please amend proof and submit new request for default.”
 
On August 18,
2023, the court clerk again rejected Plaintiff’s second request for entry of
default, due to the failure to file and serve a statement of damages.
 
On November
20, 2023, the CIV-100 form indicates that default was entered, but then the
court clerk filed a rejection of the entry of default as to the 11/20/23 filing
because the form “must list the name and address of each defendant separately.”
 
On December
4, 2023, default was entered against all three Defendants.
 
On March 5,
2024, the court held a hearing re: Order to Show Cause Re: Default/Default
Judgment and set an Order to Show Cause Re: Why the Court Should not Dismiss
for Lack of Prosecution is scheduled for 06/06/2024.
 
On May 23,
2024, Plaintiff filed a JUD-100 form. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff has not complied with any requirements
in seeking default judgment. 
 
Though
Plaintiff is pro per, a pro per litigants is held to the same standards as
attorneys. (Kobayashi v. Superior Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 536.) To provide otherwise would be to give pro per
litigants “an unfair advantage.” (Ibid.) Thus, as Plaintiff is seeking
entry of default judgment, she must meet the evidentiary burden for such a
relief as prescribed by statute and case law. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the application for entry of default judgment is denied without
prejudice. Should Plaintiff refile her request for entry of default judgment,
the material must be submitted at least 16 court days before the hearing.
