And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Olidio Lopez, has not provided sufficient evidence to support damages, despite being held to the same standards as attorneys. The court has previously rejected the plaintiff's requests for entry of default due to faulty proof of service and failure to file a statement of damages. The plaintiff must refile their request for entry of default judgment with sufficient evidence at least 16 court days before the hearing.
