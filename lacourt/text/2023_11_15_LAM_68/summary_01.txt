And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to take the hearing scheduled for November 15, 2023, off the calendar. The cross-complainant, Krishna Basnet, filed documents seeking an order for appearance and examination because the cross-defendant, Sukhpreet Singh, has not paid the ordered damages of $28,330.00. However, the judge notes that there is no proof of service filed with the documents. The judge advises Basnet to refer to the Execution of Judgments law and use the proper forms for the application (AT-138/EJ-125). Additionally, Basnet must properly serve Sukhpreet Singh and file a proof of service.
