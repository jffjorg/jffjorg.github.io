 Case Number:  23STCV15039    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  68 Ashley Kim vs. I Park, Inc., et al., 23STCV15039
Demurrer to Cross-Complaint
Moving Party: Cross-Defendant Ashley Kim

Responding Party:
Cross-Complainants I Park, Inc. and James Ha

Demurrer
            Cross-Defendant
Ashley Kim filed her demurrer on October 10, 2023. The hearing is currently set
for November 15, 2023. Any opposition to the demurrer was due on November 1,
2023, which would have been nine court days before the hearing. On November 8,
2023, Cross-Complainants filed an Amended Cross-Complaint.
While the Cross-Complaint was
untimely, the Court more than likely would have granted leave to amend if
Cross-Defendant’s demurrer had been sustained. The Court will accept the filing
of the amended Cross-Complaint this time. In the future the Court expects Cross-Complainants
to comply with the statutory deadlines for filing an opposition. 
Motion taken off calendar.
