            Plaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction as follows: 
 
1.     
Enjoining and
restraining Defendants herein, and each of them, from using, disclosing,
misappropriating, or profiting from Calex’s trade secrets which are in
Defendants’ possession or of which Defendant Beniga had access at any time
during his employment, including without limitation, customer identification information,
bidding opportunities, bidding strategies, bidding information, bid proposals,
project reports, and customer contracts. 
2.     
Enjoining and
restraining Defendants herein, and each of them, from solicitating business
from, or initiating any further communication with any customer of Plaintiff
whom Defendant Beniga submitted bids to or had direct contact with while
employed by Plaintiff, including specifically, Walton Construction, AECOM,
Benchmark Contractors Inc., CIM Group, CW Driver, Del Amo Const., Fassberg
Construction, Frymer, Icon West, Krismar Construction, Level 3 Construction, LT
Building, Matt Construction, Milender White Inc., Suffolk Construction,

containing Plaintiff’s confidential information that Defendants currently
possess or have in their custody or control, including without limitation,
customer identification information, bidding opportunities, bidding strategies,
bidding information, project reports, and customer contracts.
 
Legal Standard
 
The
purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a
decision on the merits.  (Major v. Miraverde Homeowners Ass’n.
(1992) 7 Cal. App. 4th 618, 623.)  In deciding whether or not to grant a
preliminary injunction, the court looks to two factors, including “(1) the
likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits, and (2) the relative
balance of harms that is likely to result from the granting or denial of
interim injunctive relief.”  (White v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528,
553-54.) The factors are interrelated, with a greater showing on one permitting
a lesser showing on the other.  (Dodge, Warren & Peters Ins. Services,
Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1414, 1420.)  However, the party
seeking an injunction must demonstrate at least a reasonable probability of
success on the merits.  (IT Corp. v. County of Imperial (1983) 35
Cal.3d 63, 73-74.)  The party seeking the injunction bears the burden of
demonstrating both a likelihood of success on the merits and the occurrence of
irreparable harm.  (Savage v. Trammell Crow Co. (1990) 223
Cal.App.3d 1562, 1571.) Irreparable harm may exist if the plaintiff can show an
inadequate remedy at law.  (CCP § 526(a).)   
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
            Plaintiff’s Evidentiary Objections:
                        SUSTAINED: none
                        OVERRULED: 1-14
 
            Defendants’ Evidentiary Objections:
                        SUSTAINED: None
                        OVERRULED: 1-7, 1-4, 1-15
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff states that despite the Court’s order to meet
and confer to narrow the scope of the injunction, the parties could not agree
to narrow the scope. 
 
Plaintiff
seeks an injunction against Defendants for allegedly stealing Plaintiff’s trade
secrets and confidential information, such as customer details and bidding
strategies, and using them to solicit Plaintiff’s clients. While employees may
leave to join competitors, they may not use confidential information from a
previous employer to gain a competitive advantage. Plaintiff argues that Beniga
misused client information to divert business to Ironmark and requests the
court to prevent further solicitation of its clients and any use of its trade
secrets. 
 
Probability of Prevailing
 
Plaintiff
argues that the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) supports injunctive relief, as
Plaintiff’s customer information and bidding strategies are trade secrets.
Under Civil Code § 3426.2(a), an injunction is proper when a trade secret is
misappropriated or there is a threat of misappropriation. Plaintiff claims
these trade secrets have independent economic value and are confidential,
satisfying the Act’s two-prong test for trade secret status. (Civil Code §
3426.1(d)(1).) The confidential information, including client data and bidding
strategies, is entitled to trade secret protection, as demonstrated in Courtesy
Temporary Service, Inc. v. Camacho (1990) 222 Cal. App. 3d 1278, 1288,
where the court found customer information like key contacts and specialized
requirements satisfies trade secret definition. Similarly, in American
Credit Indemnity Co. v. Sacks (1989) 213 Cal. App. 3d 622, 630-631, the
court held that a customer list allowing a competitor to target specific
clients qualifies as a trade secret. Plaintiff states that the UTSA’s
protection extends to Plaintiff’s confidential bidding data, including pricing
and profit margins, per Whyte v. Schlage Lock Co. (2002) 101 Cal. App.
4th 1443, 1455 (noting independent economic value of confidential pricing data
for competitive positioning). Plaintiff alleges Defendant Beniga shared
confidential pricing and bid information with Ironmark, enabling Ironmark to
undercut Plaintiff’s pricing. (Seitz Decl. ¶ 10, Ex. B.)
 
Plaintiff
states its efforts to maintain secrecy meet UTSA requirements, including
confidentiality agreements and password protections, are supported by Morlife,
Inc. v. Perry (1997) 56 Cal. App. 4th 1514; American Credit Indemnity
Co. v. Sacks (1989) 213 Cal. App. 3d 622; and Mai Systems Corp. v. Peak
Computer (9th Cir. 1993) 991 F.2d 511. 
Plaintiff asserts Defendants’ unauthorized solicitation of customers and
use of Plaintiff’s bidding information constitutes misappropriation under Civil
Code § 3426.1(b) (disclosure or use without consent under duty of
confidentiality). Greenly v. Cooper (1978) 77 Cal. App. 3d 382, 392
further confirms an employee's duty to maintain confidentiality, even without
an explicit agreement.
 
Regarding
unfair competition, Plaintiff argues injunctive relief is also proper under
Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 and 17203, which allow actions against
unfair or unlawful business practices. The California Supreme Court in Aetna
Building Maintenance Co. v. West (1952) 39 Cal. 2d 198, 205 emphasized that
solicitation of former clients using confidential customer preferences
constitutes unfair competition. Even without trade secret status, Plaintiff’s
client data warrants protection under unfair competition law, as recognized in Whitted
v. Williams (1964) 226 Cal. App. 2d 52, 57 and Courtesy Temporary
Services, Inc. v. Camacho (1990) 222 Cal. App. 3d 1278, 1292.
 
Plaintiff
argues that Defendant Beniga breached his duty of loyalty by using confidential
information and soliciting Plaintiff’s clients for a competitor, Ironmark. An
employee’s duty of loyalty requires “undivided loyalty” during employment. (Fowler
v. Varian Assoc., Inc. (1988) 193 Cal.App.3d 34, 41, obligating them not to
harm their employer’s interests (Bancroft-Whitney Co. v. Glen (1966) 64
Cal.2d 327, 345-354. Beniga allegedly breached this duty by retaining
confidential information and using it for Ironmark’s benefit. 
 
In opposition,
Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on
the merits for its claims and therefore does not meet the standard required for
injunctive relief. Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s claims, including
misappropriation of trade secrets, rely on speculative and conclusory
allegations rather than substantive evidence. 
 
Regarding
the misappropriation of trade secrets, Defendants assert that Plaintiff has
failed to specifically identify any trade secrets, which is necessary under
cases like Altavion, Inc. v. Konica Minolta Systems Laboratory, Inc. (2014)
226 Cal.App.4th 26, 43 and Diodes, Inc. v. Franzen (1968) 260 Cal.
App.2d 244, 253. They argue that general contractor information and client
identities are public knowledge and therefore not protected as trade secrets. (American
Paper & Packaging Products, Inc. v. Kirgan (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1318,
1325.) Further, Defendants claim there is no evidence of improper use of any
trade secrets or confidential information, with declarations from Beniga and
Boyer specifically refuting Plaintiff’s assertions of solicitation of
Plaintiff’s clients, including Walton.
 
Defendants
also argue that Plaintiff’s additional claims, such as those for unfair
competition and breach of duty of loyalty, are preempted by the California
Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA) because they stem from the same alleged facts
underlying the trade secret claim. (Cal. Civ. Code § 3426.7(b)(2); K.C.
Multimedia, Inc. v. Bank of America Technology & Operations, Inc.
(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 939, 954-955.) According to Defendants, CUTSA’s
preemption provision displaces these additional theories of liability,
rendering them inapplicable. Thus, Defendants conclude that Plaintiff has not
sufficiently shown a likelihood of success, lacks specific evidence of
misappropriation or harm, and that any additional claims are preempted by CUTSA.
 
In
reply, Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ declarations fail to directly deny the
misappropriation or use of its trade secrets and confidential information, and
instead contain evasive language. Plaintiff highlights inconsistencies in
Defendants’ claims, noting that while Defendants assert Ironmark does not
directly compete with Calex, they admit to bidding on overlapping projects,
undermining their claim. Plaintiff further argues that Defendants do not
categorically deny accessing and downloading trade secret files, such as those
related to the Fairfield apartments project. Plaintiff also contends that it
has adequately identified its trade secrets, including its bidding strategies,
customer lists, and client preferences. Defendants’ reliance on outdated case
law to argue otherwise is flawed, as recent cases and the California Uniform
Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) protect such proprietary information. Plaintiff
asserts that Calex’s investment in developing customer relations and pricing
strategies justifies trade secret protection and that confidentiality
agreements and security measures were in place to safeguard this information. Plaintiff
further argues that its claims are not preempted by CUTSA, as they are based on
Defendants’ actions beyond trade secret misappropriation, including breaches of
fiduciary duty, contractual obligations, and unfair competition. Plaintiff
claims that Defendants diverted Calex’s business opportunities to Ironmark,
violating California’s unfair competition laws. Even if no protectable trade
secrets are found, Plaintiff asserts it is still entitled to injunctive relief
under the unfair competition claim, as case law supports injunctions against
former employees using confidential information to solicit former clients.
 
Balance of Harms
 
Plaintiff
claims irreparable harm from Defendants’ potential continued use of trade
secrets, citing Campbell Soup Co. v. ConAgra, Inc. (3d Cir. 1992) 977
F.2d 86, 92-93, which holds that trade secret misappropriation threatens
irreparable harm, especially for customer lists. Courts need not wait for
actual loss to grant an injunction (Cal. Civ. Code § 3426.2.) Plaintiff also
states the balance of hardships favors Plaintiff, as the injunction only
restricts Defendants from soliciting Plaintiff’s customers and using
confidential information, obligations they already agreed to fulfill. Failure
to grant the injunction would allow Defendants to use Plaintiff’s trade secrets
unfairly, potentially leading to irreparable harm. Plaintiff also argues that
an injunction supports public interest by protecting trade secrets, critical
for a competitive market (Morlife, Inc. v. Perry (2014) 56 Cal.App.4th
1514, 1520; Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp. (1974) 416 U.S. 470.) Finally,
Plaintiff requests that any bond required should be minimal, given Plaintiff’s
strong likelihood of success and the limited burden on Defendants, who are only
required to refrain from misappropriation already prohibited by law.
 
            In opposition, Defendants argue that the balance of
equities favors them and that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that denial of the
injunction would cause more harm than its issuance. They assert that without
proof of irreparable harm or inadequacy of legal remedies, an injunction should
not be granted. Defendants highlight that Plaintiff lacks evidence of
threatened or lost clients or business, whereas the injunction would prevent
Ironmark from pursuing projects with any general contractor associated with
Calex, resulting in substantial harm to Defendants. Additionally, Defendants
contend that Plaintiff’s proposed injunction is overbroad and lacks
specificity, violating requirements for clear conduct standards in injunctions.
(People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v. Maldonado (2001) 86
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1234; Pitchess v. Superior Court (1969) 2 Cal.App.3d
644, 651.) They argue that the injunction would restrict Defendants from
engaging in business without any clear boundaries on affected clients or trade
secrets, which would violate public policy favoring free competition. (Aetna
Bldg. Maint. Co. v. West (1952) 39 Cal.2d 198, 204.) Defendants further
assert that Plaintiff has not shown why monetary damages would be insufficient,
arguing that if any part of the injunction is granted, Plaintiff should be required
to post a substantial bond to cover potential damages if the injunction is
later deemed wrongful. (Code. Civ. Proc. § 529.) 
 
            In reply, Plaintiff argues that the harm it faces from
the denial of an injunction far outweighs any harm Defendants might suffer if
it is granted. Plaintiff cites evidence suggesting irreparable harm, including
potential loss of customers and confidential information misappropriated by
Defendant Beniga, who downloaded sensitive data just before resigning and has
since bid on the same projects as Plaintiff. Plaintiff asserts that an
injunction is necessary to prevent both current and future misuse of this
information, as authorized by the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA),
which allows injunctive relief for both actual and threatened misappropriation.
(Civ. Code § 3426.2.) 
 
Plaintiff
also contends that the proposed injunction is not overly broad, as it merely
aims to protect Calex’s existing customer base that Beniga became familiar with
during his employment. Plaintiff references Morlife, Inc. v. Perry
(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1519, where a similar injunction was upheld, restricting
former employees from soliciting clients they had serviced while at their
previous employer. The proposed order here, Plaintiff argues, is focused solely
on preventing Defendants from using or soliciting customers they became
familiar with during Beniga’s tenure with Calex, and thus is reasonable and
enforceable.
 
Regarding
the bond, Plaintiff argues that any bond requirement should be minimal, as
Defendants have not identified any specific costs or damages that would result
from the injunction. Plaintiff emphasizes that the injunction simply requires
Defendants to refrain from using Calex’s confidential information, which they
are not entitled to use. Plaintiff notes that courts have previously waived
bond requirements in cases involving similar restrictions on confidential
information. (Extreme Reach, Inc. v. Spotgenie Partners, LLC, 2013 WL
12081182.)
 
Supplemental Arguments
 
In
Plaintiff’s supplemental brief, filed on October 17, 2024, Plaintiff asserts
that Defendant Beniga engaged in further wrongful conduct by taking
confidential information during his last days at Calex, with evidence showing
he downloaded over 35 files, including trade secrets, onto his computer and
used multiple USB devices to transfer data. Plaintiff argues that Beniga and
Ironmark have already used Calex’s confidential information, as shown by the
similar bid proposal submitted to Walton Construction and other clients.
Plaintiff claims that Beniga retained documents with confidential details,
including pricing and key contacts, which qualify as trade secrets under
California law. Plaintiff seeks an injunction to prevent Defendants from
soliciting or conducting business with specific clients Beniga engaged with
while at Calex, including Walton Construction, CW Driver, and others. Plaintiff
contends that similar injunctions have been upheld in cases where misuse of
trade secrets created a risk of losing established customers. (Stuhlbarg
Int’l Sales Co. v. John D. Brush & Co. (9th Cir. 2001) 240 F.3d 832,
841.)
 
Plaintiff
argues that the proposed injunction is narrowly tailored, targeting only
clients Beniga worked with and protecting Calex’s confidential information
without being overbroad. Plaintiff asserts that such relief is reasonable, as
it prevents Defendants from benefitting from misappropriated information while
preserving Calex’s customer relationships. Plaintiff believes this injunction
is essential to avoid further harm and protect its trade secrets.
 
In
supplemental opposition, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s request for a
preliminary injunction is overly broad, as it would prevent Defendants from
accepting business from clients with whom Ironmark had established independent
relationships, without any involvement from Beniga. Defendants claim that
equity does not support enjoining a former employee from receiving business
that is fairly and legally obtained. They contend that Ironmark’s revenue from
several clients, including AECOM, CW Driver, and Turner Construction, stems
from pre-existing relationships and should not be restricted. Defendants
emphasize that Beniga’s role at Calex was limited to technical tasks, with no
client-facing or decision-making responsibilities. They assert that his duties
at Ironmark similarly do not involve client interactions or business
solicitation, and they deny misappropriation of trade secrets, arguing that the
evidence Plaintiff provides, such as the Walton Construction bid proposal, does
not substantiate this claim.
 
Additionally,
Defendants highlight distinctions between this case and those cited by
Plaintiff, noting that in Morlife Inc. v. Perry, Peerless Oakland
Laundry Co. v. Hickman, and similar cases, the defendants had direct
customer relationships and founded competing businesses, unlike Beniga, who
merely joined another company without client-related duties. Defendants argue
that Plaintiff’s proposed injunction would create an impractical restriction,
barring them from receiving unsolicited business from clients who independently
choose to work with Ironmark. Finally, Defendants note that Ironmark and Calex
operate in different markets, as Ironmark does not provide shoring services,
further weakening Plaintiff’s claim of competitive overlap.
 
In
supplemental reply, Plaintiff argues that an injunction is necessary to prevent
ongoing harm from Defendant Beniga’s misappropriation of its confidential
information and trade secrets. Plaintiff attempted to meet with Defendants to
narrow the scope of the injunction as per the Court’s request, but claims
Defendants were unwilling to negotiate, refusing any form of injunction.
Plaintiff asserts that Defendants’ allegations regarding the client list’s
validity are baseless, as the list includes past and current clients compiled
from Calex’s records and verified by Calex’s COO. Plaintiff highlights that
Defendants do not dispute that Beniga downloaded confidential Calex documents
and communicated with overlapping clients like CW Driver and Walton
Construction after joining Ironmark. Plaintiff argues that this confirms the
need for an injunction covering at least these clients to prevent further
misuse of confidential information. Plaintiff further contends that the fact
Ironmark had pre-existing relationships with some of these clients does not
justify denying an injunction, as Beniga’s access to confidential client
information creates a competitive threat. Plaintiff dismisses Defendants’
argument that an injunction should only cover clients Ironmark has not
previously worked with, asserting this would inadequately protect Calex from
unfair competition.
 
In
response to Defendants’ downplaying Beniga’s role at Calex and Ironmark,
Plaintiff maintains that Beniga’s duties gave him access to valuable
proprietary information that could harm Calex’s competitive position if
misused. Plaintiff notes that courts have granted similar injunctions in cases
where former employees took confidential information to benefit new employers,
regardless of whether the new position directly involved client contact. Plaintiff
emphasizes that further discovery has uncovered additional confidential
documents on Beniga’s USB drives, showing that Defendants possess sensitive
bid, budget, and labor proposals. Given this evidence, Plaintiff requests a
narrowly tailored injunction to prevent Beniga and Ironmark from exploiting
Calex’s confidential information with overlapping clients. Plaintiff reserves
the right to seek additional relief if further discovery reveals more
misconduct.
 
Analysis
 
The
Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of prevailing on the
merits of its claims, particularly regarding the misappropriation of trade
secrets and confidential information. Plaintiff has provided sufficient
evidence through declarations that Defendant Beniga accessed and downloaded
sensitive information shortly before his departure from Calex. Specifically, in
the Declaration of Matthew Gallegos, it is noted that on May 22, 2024, two days
prior to his resignation, Beniga downloaded over 35 files, including confidential
bid proposals and client-specific strategies. (Gallegos Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. A at
rows 19-43.) Additionally, the Declaration of David Rossi confirms that these
files contained proprietary details such as pricing information, client
contacts, and detailed project information, which are important to Calex’s
competitive positioning. (Rossi Decl. ¶¶ 4-6.) Furthermore, the evidence
indicates that Beniga used multiple USB drives to transfer these confidential
files, one of which he has allegedly lost or destroyed. (Braun Decl. ¶ 16.) The
remaining USB drives, produced in discovery, reveal files pertaining to clients
such as CW Driver, Walton Construction, and CIM Group, whom Beniga has since
communicated with while at Ironmark. (Rossi Decl. Exs. 2-10; Shackelford Decl.
¶ 5, Ex. B. [SROG 1].) This conduct suggests improper use of confidential
information, further supported by Beniga’s own admissions in his supplemental
declaration that he engaged with some of these clients in his new role at
Ironmark. (Supp. Beniga Decl. ¶ 6.)
 
The
balance of hardships also weighs in Plaintiff's favor. Plaintiff is at
significant risk of irreparable harm if an injunction is not granted, as the
continued unauthorized use of its proprietary information could lead to the
loss of established clients and a weakened competitive position. This harm is
particularly acute given that trade secrets and client relationships are
critical to Plaintiff’s business success and cannot easily be restored through
monetary damages alone. In contrast, Defendants’ hardship is minimal; the
injunction merely prevents them from utilizing information that does not
rightfully belong to them. Any legitimate business activities by Defendants,
independent of Plaintiff’s trade secrets, remain unaffected by the scope of
this injunction. 
 
Thus,
the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction.
