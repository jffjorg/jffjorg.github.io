And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the second and third causes of action in a medical malpractice case. The plaintiff, Ramon Arias Moreno, alleges that the defendants, including Dr. Hamideh Moayedpardazi and several medical organizations, committed medical battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges medical battery, because the complaint fails to allege that the defendants' actions exceeded the scope of the plaintiff's consent. The judge also sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress, because the complaint fails to allege extreme and outrageous conduct.

The judge orders the plaintiff to amend the complaint to state a cause of action for medical battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The motion to strike punitive damages is moot because the demurrer was sustained.

The judge notes that the parties failed to meet and confer as required by statute, but exercises its discretion to consider the merits of the demurrer. However, the judge warns that future failures to comply with statutory obligations may result in a continuance of the hearing on the subject motion.
