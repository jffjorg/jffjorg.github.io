 Case Number:  24LBCV01728    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundOn August 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant Tesla Motors Inc. and Does 1 to 10, alleging violations of the Song-Beverely Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”). Plaintiff alleges that on or about April 21, 2023, he purchased a new 2023 Tesla Model S (“Subject Vehicle” or “the Vehicle”), manufactured by Defendant, from Defendant. (Compl., ¶¶ I-II.) Plaintiff further asserts that the Vehicle exhibited serious defects and nonconformities that could not be fixed after a reasonable number of attempts, and Defendants failed to replace the Vehicle or make restitution. (Compl., ¶¶ IV-V.)On September 20, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to compel arbitration. As of November 21, 2024, no opposition has been filed.Request for Judicial NoticeDefendant’s Request for Judicial Notice of the Complaint is granted pursuant to Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).Legal StandardUnder California and federal law, public policy favors arbitration as an efficient and less expensive means of resolving private disputes. (Moncharsh v. Heily & Blasé (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 8-9 (Moncharsh); AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion (2011) 563 U.S. 333, 339.) Accordingly, whether an agreement is governed by the California Arbitration Act or the Federal Arbitration Act, courts resolve doubt about an arbitration agreement’s scope in favor of arbitration. (Moncharsh, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 9; Comedy Club, Inc. v. Improv West Associates (9th Cir. 2009) 553 F.3d 1277, 1284; see also Engalla v. Permanente Med. Grp., Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 971-972 [“California law incorporates many of the basic policy objectives contained in the Federal Arbitration Act, including a presumption in favor of arbitrability [citation] and a requirement that an arbitration agreement must be enforced on the basis of state law standards that apply to contracts in general [citation].”].) “[U]nder both the FAA and California law, ‘arbitration agreements are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.’” (Higgins v. Superior Court (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1247.)The party seeking to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by the preponderance of the evidence. (Engalla, supra, 15 Cal.4th 951, 972.) A petition to compel arbitration must allege both a “written agreement to arbitrate” the controversy, and that a party to that agreement “refuses to arbitrate” the controversy. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.) It then becomes plaintiff’s burden, in opposing the motion, to prove by a preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to her opposition. (Ibid.)“Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 requires a trial court to grant a petition to compel arbitration ‘if the court determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists.’” (Avery v. Integrated Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 50, 59 (Avery), quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2).) Accordingly, “when presented with a petition to compel arbitration, the court’s first task is to determine whether the parties have in fact agreed to arbitrate the dispute.” (Id., at p. 59.) Generally, on a petition to compel arbitration, the court must grant the petition unless it finds either (1) no written agreement to arbitrate exists; (2) the right to compel arbitration has been waived; (3) grounds exist for revocation of the agreement; or (4) litigation is pending that may render the arbitration unnecessary or create conflicting rulings on common issues. (Ibid.; see also Condee v. Longwood Management Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 218-219.) “In these summary proceedings the trial court sits as a trier of fact, weighing all the affidavits, declarations, and other documentary evidence, as well as oral testimony received at the court’s discretion, to reach a final determination.” (Avery, supra, 218 Cal.App.4th at p. 59; accord Rosenthal v. Great Western Financial Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413.)DiscussionIn order to carry its threshold burden under Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2, Defendant must demonstrate the parties have a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy in question and that Plaintiff refuses to do so.Defendant demonstrates Plaintiff signed an arbitration agreementDefendant offers both the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement (“MVOA”) and Retail Installment Sales Contract (“RISC”) that Plaintiff executed during the course of their purchase of the Vehicle. (Kim Decl., Ex. 1 [MVOA] and Ex. 2 [RISC].) Both contain arbitration clauses. (Kim Decl., ¶¶ 6, 12, Exs. 1-2.) Defendant claims it made the MVOA available to Plaintiff via hyperlink during the sales process, and Plaintiff was required to attest they agreed to its terms before placing their order. (Kim Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) The RISC carries Plaintiff’s electronic signature, and Defendant attests Plaintiff signed it as a condition to the Vehicle’s purchase. (Kim Decl., ¶¶ 3, 13 and Ex. 2.) The RISC is counter-signed by Defendant as seller of the Vehicle. (Kim Decl., Ex. 2, pp. 1, 6.) Defendant has carried its threshold burden to show an arbitration agreement exists.The RISC covers the dispute in questionThe RISC states, in relevant part:“Any claim or dispute, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise (including the interpretation and scope of this Arbitration Provision, any allegation of waiver of rights under this Arbitration Provision, and the arbitrability of the claim or dispute), between you and us or our employees, agents, successors or assigns, which arises out of or relates to your credit application, purchase or condition of this Vehicle, this contract or any resulting transaction or relationship (including any such relationship with third parties who do not sign this contract) shall, at your or our election, be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration and not by a court action.” (Kim Decl., Ex. 2, p. 5.)This is a statutory claim between Plaintiff and Defendant (“you and us”), which arises out of the purchase or condition of the Vehicle. The dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement.Plaintiff refuses to arbitrateDefendant’s counsel attests, uncontradicted, that Plaintiff refused the request to stipulate to arbitration. (Ameripuour Decl., ¶ 3.) The final element of section 1281.2 is satisfied.Because Defendant carried its threshold burden, Plaintiff must show why the agreement should not be enforced. The Court notes that as of November 21, 2024, Plaintiff has failed to file an opposition. Accordingly, the Court grants the instant motion to compel arbitration due to Plaintiff’s failure to carry his burden in opposition.Tentative RulingThe instant motion is GRANTED. The parties are ordered to submit their dispute to binding arbitration according to the terms of the RISC. The Court stays this action in its entirety pending completion, or until further order of the Court. Post Arbitration Status Conference set for 11/29/2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Dept. 25.
