  - "Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and 'all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence' and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."
  - "The Court agrees with Defendant. Plaintiff's evidence does not show an issue of material triable fact. All the elements necessary for a defamation claim have not been established. Thus, Defendant's instant motion is GRANTED as to the 1st cause of action â€“ Defamation."
```

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Ybarra, dismissing the plaintiff, Moreno's, claim for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court found that Moreno failed to present evidence that Ybarra's statements were defamatory and that Moreno suffered emotional distress as a result of Ybarra's actions. The court also found that Ybarra's statements were privileged under Civil Code section 47, which protects communications made to law enforcement agencies. The court granted Ybarra's motion for summary judgment, dismissing the lawsuit and entering judgment in favor of Ybarra.
