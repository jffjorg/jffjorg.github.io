And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Tesla Motors Inc., and has granted its motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff, who purchased a 2023 Tesla Model S from the defendant, alleges violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and that the vehicle exhibited serious defects and nonconformities. The defendant has presented evidence that the plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement, known as the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC), which contains an arbitration clause. The judge has found that the RISC covers the dispute in question and that the plaintiff refused the request to stipulate to arbitration. As a result, the judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration and has stayed the action pending completion of the arbitration process.
