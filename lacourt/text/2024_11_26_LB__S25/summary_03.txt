And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion filed by the plaintiff to compel the defendant to provide further responses to a set of form interrogatories. The judge has denied the motion, stating that the defendant has already provided a sufficient response to one of the interrogatories. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not provided any legal authority to support their argument that the "Preliminary Statement and General Objections" section of the defendant's response is unauthorized. Additionally, the judge declines to award monetary sanctions to either party.
