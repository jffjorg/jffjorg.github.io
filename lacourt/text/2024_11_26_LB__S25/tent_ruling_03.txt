 Case Number:  24LBCV00711    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  S25 Tentative RulingThe Court is unaware of any legal authority that states a “Preliminary Statement and General Objections” section is unauthorized; Plaintiff has not provided any such legal authority supporting this assertion. Defendant has sufficiently responded to Form Interrogatory No. 4.1 by referencing the insurance policy document produced pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230. Even if the Court accepts the argument that Defendant had an affirmative duty to state no other insurance policies existed, Defendant provided a sufficient answer in its response to Special interrogatory No. 1, thereby making the instant motion unnecessary. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, No. 4.1 is DENIED.The Court declines to award monetary sanctions to either party.
