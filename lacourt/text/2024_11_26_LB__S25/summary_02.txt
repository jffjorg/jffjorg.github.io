And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case regarding a defendant's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The plaintiff failed to provide a separate statement, as required by court rules, but the judge did not grant the motion solely on this basis. The judge advises the parties to comply fully with statutory requirements and court rules. The defendant's motion is granted for certain special interrogatories, requiring the plaintiff to provide further responses within 20 days. The motion is denied for other interrogatories. No monetary sanctions are imposed, as the defendant did not seek them.
