Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by Defendant American Modern Home Insurance Company, Inc. and Defendant LDE, Inc. dba Ehrmann Insurance Agency to the First Amended Complaint. The court sustains the demurrer to the First Cause of Action asserted by the Trust, as well as the Second, Third, and Fourth Causes of Action. The court also sustains the demurrer to the Fifth Cause of Action for Intentional Interference with Expected Inheritance.

The court finds that the First through Fourth Causes of Action are barred by the two-year statute of limitations of CCP § 339(1). Additionally, the Fifth Cause of Action fails because Plaintiffs have not alleged interference directed at the testator.

The court orders Defendant American Modern to file an Answer to the FAC within 21 days. The court also sustains the motion to strike, as the demurrer is sustained in its entirety.

The court notes that leave to amend may be allowed if Plaintiffs can demonstrate a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. However, Plaintiffs did not address this possibility in their opposition pleadings, and therefore, leave to amend will be denied unless they can demonstrate such a possibility at the hearing.
