SUMMARY OF ACTION & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises from an alleged slip and fall incident
that occurred on 8/31/22 on the sales floor at the Costco Warehouse in
Northridge, California.  On 9/11/23,
Plaintiff Maria Pina (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendant Costco
Wholesale Corporation (Defendant) for 
 premises liability
based on negligence.  On 9/21/23,
Defendant answered the complaint and propounded Form Interrogatories (General),
Set 1; Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1; and Special
Interrogatories, Set 1, on Plaintiff.  (See
Bell Decls.).  
 
After Plaintiff failed to serve responses to the
discovery by the statutory deadline, on 10/31/23, Defendant sent meet and
confer correspondence to Plaintiff’s counsel requesting responses by
11/7/23.  (Bell Decl.).  Plaintiff did not serve responses or request
an extension of time to respond.  (Bell
Decl.).
 
Therefore, on 11/29/23, Defendant filed and served the
subject motions seeking:

responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set 1 (General) served by mail
on 9/21/23, without objection, within 10 days

and her attorneys of record in the amount of $511.50;

imposed against Plaintiff and her attorneys of record in the amount of $511.50.

ANALYSIS
 
Due to Plaintiff’s failure to provide timely responses to
the subject Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories and Requests for

amount of $408.50 for each motion (1.2 hours to prepare each motion + .25 hour
to prepare each notice of non-opposition +.25 hour to appear on each motion multiplied
by $205/hour = $348.50 + $60.00 filing fee for each motion) for a total

attorney, Jesse L. Halpern.
