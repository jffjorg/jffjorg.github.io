And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Aileen Leitjen's motion to continue trial and all trial-related dates. The motion was filed due to Plaintiff Maeve Crommie's alleged lack of cooperation in the discovery process and destruction of evidence, including the garage that is the subject of the complaint. The Court found that these issues could be addressed through other means, such as a motion to compel or a motion for terminating or issue sanctions, and that the current trial date of November 25, 2024, does not preclude Defendant from filing these motions. The Court also noted that Defendant's claim that the only redress she has is a trial continuance is wrong. Therefore, the Court denied the motion for continuance.
