And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denies the Plaintiff's motion for relief under Code of Civil Procedure §473(b) for excusable neglect to file a motion for leave to amend the complaint. The Plaintiff, who is representing himself, claims that his neglect in failing to submit a code-compliant declaration in support of his motion to amend was excusable due to his ignorance of the law. However, the Court holds that ignorance of the law is not a valid excuse for neglect, and that litigants who choose to represent themselves must follow the same rules of procedure as represented parties. The Court cites several cases to support its decision, including Rappleyea v. Campbell, which holds that the rules of civil procedure must apply equally to parties represented by counsel and those who forgo attorney representation. The Court concludes that the Plaintiff's failure to understand the procedural rules is not an excusable ground for relief, and denies the motion.
