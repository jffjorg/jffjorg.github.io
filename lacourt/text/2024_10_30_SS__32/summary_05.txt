And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition for a minors' compromise filed by Joanna Navarro on behalf of Claimant Jennifer Llerenas, who is 4 years old. The judge denies the petition without prejudice due to several issues with the petition. These issues include:

* The petition lacks the correct address for the Spring Street Courthouse
* Certain items on the petition are not marked correctly
* The petition does not provide sufficient information about Claimant's current condition
* The petition does not clearly state the terms of the settlement
* The petition does not accurately reflect the Medi-Cal lien
* The petition does not provide sufficient information about the medical expenses

The judge requires the petitioner to complete these items and provide additional information before the petition can be considered further. The judge also finds the amount of attorney fees requested to be reasonable.
