BACKGROUND
 
            On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff Brett
Baker (“Plaintiff” or “Baker”) filed an action against Defendants Express
Delivery Service LLC[1]
(“Express”), Rubnell Gaitan (“Gaitan”), and Does 1 through 25 (collectively,
“Defendants”) for motor vehicle and general negligence, arising out of an

LEGAL
STANDARD
 

Requests for Admission

 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section 2033.280, subdivision (b),
failure to respond to requests for admission in a timely manner allows the
requesting party to “move for an order that…the truth of any matters specified
in the requests be deemed admitted” by the party that failed to respond.  The requesting party’s motion must be granted
by the court, “unless [the court] finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Since
such motion is in response to failure to respond, there is no requirement to
meet and confer prior to moving to deem the requests for admission
admitted.  (See Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007), 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.)  By failing to timely respond,
the party to whom the requests are directed waives any objection to the
requests, including one based on privilege or work product.  (Code Civ. Pro. § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
 

Interrogatories

 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after
service.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd. (a).)  If a party
to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the
discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).)  Once
compelled to respond, the party waives the right to make any objections,
including ones based on privilege or work-product protection.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.
(a).)  There is no time limit for a
motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than the cut-off on hearing
discovery motions 15 days before trial. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290.)  No meet and confer efforts are required
before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
 

Requests for Production

 
A party must respond to requests for production of documents within 30
days after service. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.260, subd. (a).)  If a party to whom requests for production of
documents is directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party
may move for an order compelling response to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  The party also waives the right to make any
objections, including ones based on privilege or work-product protection.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd.
(a).)  There is no time limit for a
motion to compel responses to production of documents other than the cut-off on
hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. 
(Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2031.300.)  No meet and confer efforts are required
before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
 

Monetary Sanctions

 
Code of Civil Procedure, section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides,
in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone because of that conduct.  Misuse of discovery includes “failing to
respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010, subd. (d)).
 
Courts are obligated to impose monetary sanctions in cases where a
“failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280,
subd. (d).)  Sanctions are calculated
based on “reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as
a result of that conduct.”  (Ibid.
§ 2023.030, subd. (a)).
 
Furthermore, sections 2030.290 and 2031.300 authorize the Court to
impose monetary sanctions “against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel” interrogatories or requests
for production “unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff’s counsel Shantel
Yaghoobian declares that on July 17, 2024, she sent an email to Defendant
Express’s counsel with the following discovery requests: Form Interrogatories
(Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), Request for Production of
Documents and Things (Set One), and Request for Admissions (Set One).  (MTD - Yaghoobian Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. A; MTC RFP – Yaghoobian Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. A; MTCI – Yaghoobian Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. A.)  Defendant Express failed to provide responses
by the August 16, 2024, deadline.  (MTD -
Yaghoobian Decl. ¶ 5; MTC RFP – Yaghoobian
Decl. ¶ 5; MTCI – Yaghoobian Decl. ¶ 5.)  Defendant also
failed to provide responses or objections after Plaintiff extended the
deadline.  (MTD - Yaghoobian Decl.
¶¶ 6-7; MTC RFP – Yaghoobian Decl. ¶¶ 6-7; MTCI – Yaghoobian Decl. ¶¶ 6-7.)  Counsel Yaghoobian
attempted to meet and confer with defense counsel by sending a letter regarding
Defendant’s failure to respond to the discovery requests; however, she did not
receive a response.  (MTD -
Yaghoobian Decl. ¶¶ 9-12; MTC RFP – Yaghoobian
Decl. ¶¶ 9-12; MTCI – Yaghoobian Decl. ¶¶ 9-12.)  Counsel Yaghoobian’s hourly rate is $550 per
hour and Plaintiff requests $500 in monetary sanctions for filing each
motion.  (MTD - Yaghoobian Decl. ¶¶ 14-15; MTC RFP – Yaghoobian Decl. ¶¶ 14-15; MTCI – Yaghoobian Decl. ¶¶ 14-15.)
 
            In their oppositions, Defendants
state that they have prepared responses to the discovery requests; however,
verification is pending, and the responses have not been served.  Defendant Express will provide verified
responses to the Requests for Admission (Set One), Request for Production (Set
One), Form Interrogatories (Set One), and Special Interrogatories (Set One) prior
to the hearings.  
 
            In his replies to the oppositions,
Plaintiff argues that Defendants have impermissibly combined the oppositions to
the separate motions.  Moreover, Defendants
concede that they have failed to provide discovery responses and claim that
responses will be provided before the hearings. 
As of October 22, 2024, Defendant Gaitan has served unverified responses
to the discovery requests, but Defendant Express has not served any responses
to the discovery requests.  Plaintiff
also argues that sanctions are warranted as there is no justification for
Defendants’ failure to provide verified responses to the outstanding discovery
requests.
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated that he has propounded
discovery requests on Defendants.  No
verified responses have been provided to the Court for review. Accordingly, the
Court grants Plaintiff’s motions.
 
The Court further finds that monetary sanctions are warranted for the
discovery abuse, and awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $500 for each
motion. The Court notes that although the declaration of counsel requests an
hourly rate of $550 for three hours of time, this amount was not requested in
the notice of motion. Accordingly, the amount awarded is limited to $500, which
was sought in the notice.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
            Plaintiff Brett Baker’s Motion to
Deem All Request for Admissions Admitted is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses
and Documents to Request for Production of Documents and Things (Set One) is
GRANTED.  Defendant Express Delivery
Service LLC is ordered to provide verified responses, without objections, to
Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents and Things (Set One) within 10
days of the Court’s order.
 
            Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Interrogatories is GRANTED. 
Defendant Express Delivery Service LLC is ordered to provide verified
responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories (Set One)
and Special Interrogatories (Set One) within 10 days of the Court’s order.
 
            Furthermore, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $500 as to each
motion, for a total of $1,500 in sanctions. 
Defendant Express Delivery Service LLC and its counsel are ordered to
pay monetary sanctions, jointly and severally, within 30 days of the Court’s
order.
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
