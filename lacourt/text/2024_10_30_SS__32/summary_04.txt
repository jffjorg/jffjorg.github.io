Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Dermatology & Laser Medical Center, Inc., moves to continue the trial and all related dates for six months. The court notes that there has been no opposition filed by the plaintiff. The defendant argues that Dr. Khadavi, a named party, passed away in November 2023 and that the complaint should be amended before proceeding to trial. The defendant also claims that it is prevented from completing discovery until the initial responses are served, and that its lead trial counsel has a pre-paid vacation from January 18, 2025 to February 17, 2025.

The court finds that the defendant has not shown sufficient good cause to warrant a six-month continuance, given the previous five-month continuance that was granted. However, the court grants a short continuance due to the defendant's trial counsel's pre-paid vacation and the lack of opposition from the plaintiff. The court orders that the final status conference be continued to February 25, 2025, and that the trial be continued to March 11, 2025.
