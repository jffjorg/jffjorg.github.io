And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Oak River Insurance Company to intervene in the lawsuit brought by Vanessa Mesia-Ullrich against The Arden, LLC and Does 1 to 10. Oak River Insurance Company seeks to intervene because it is the workers' compensation benefits provider for St. James' Episcopal School, where Vanessa Mesia-Ullrich was injured while working. The judge found that Oak River Insurance Company has a direct and immediate interest in the action and that its intervention will not enlarge the issues in the litigation. The judge also noted that Labor Code sections 3852 and 3853 provide that an employer can join in an action against a third party arising out of the incident for which workers' compensation payment was made, and that an employer includes the employer's insurer. The judge ordered Oak River Insurance Company to file and serve its complaint-in-intervention within 10 days and to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
