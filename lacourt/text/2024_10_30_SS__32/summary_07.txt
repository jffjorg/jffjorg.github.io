And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to deem admitted the defendant's request for admissions, set one, served on the plaintiff. The motion was unopposed, and the plaintiff failed to respond to the request for admissions. The judge has also awarded the defendant $457.50 in monetary sanctions against the plaintiff, representing 1.5 hours of attorney time and the filing fee. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond was not justified and that the defendant is entitled to the requested sanctions. The order requires the plaintiff to pay the sanctions within 30 days and to provide notice of the court's order.
