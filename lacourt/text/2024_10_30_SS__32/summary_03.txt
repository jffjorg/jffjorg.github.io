And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

Judge's Tentative Ruling on Petition for Minors Compromise

The court has reviewed the petition filed by Petitioner Monica Jeannettee Vasquez on behalf of Claimant James Roman Arevalo, age 5, and has denied it without prejudice. The denial is based on several issues, including the lack of medical records showing that Claimant is fully recovered from the motor vehicle collision that caused his injuries. The court also notes that the petition incorrectly includes Claimant's settlement in a section that should only reflect settlements to "persons other than claimant." Additionally, the court requests that Petitioner provide a detailed explanation of the reasons for apportioning the settlement between Claimant and the Estate of Erika Dominguez.

The court also denies Petitioner's request for $5,000 in attorney fees, as the declaration submitted by Counsel does not adequately explain the factors set forth in California Rule of Court 7.955. The court orders Petitioner to provide notice and file proof of service of the denial.

The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to determine if a resolution can be reached. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit, along with the case number, date and time of the hearing, counsel's contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.
