And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by defendant PV Holding Corp. to specially set its summary judgment motion hearing or, alternatively, to continue trial. The motion was unopposed, but the judge has denied it on procedural grounds due to the defendant's failure to serve notice of the motion on non-moving party Arthur Randolph McDonald. The judge notes that this failure violates the principles of procedural due process, which require notice and an opportunity to be heard. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice. The defendant is ordered to give notice of this order and file a proof of service.
