And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a summary judgment motion brought by the defendant. The defendant argues that it had no duty to inspect the unit where the plaintiff's decedent died from injuries sustained from a slip and fall accident. The judge disagrees, finding that the defendant bears the initial burden to show that it had no duty to inspect the unit. The judge also finds that the defendant failed to meet this burden, as it did not inspect the unit during the lease period and did not provide sufficient evidence to support its argument that it had no constructive notice of the alleged defects. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's responses to written discovery requests are devoid of factual evidence to support their causes of action. Finally, the judge limits the scope of the motion to the named plaintiffs, Edelmira Vega Rios and Janel Blanco, as they are the only ones who have asserted a negligence cause of action.
