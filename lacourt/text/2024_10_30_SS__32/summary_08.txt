And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Los Angeles moves to compel the Riverside County Sheriff's Office (RCSO) to produce video footage and policy documents related to high-risk traffic stops. The RCSO opposes the motion, arguing that the documents are not relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Court grants the motion in part, ordering the City to provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service. The Court also orders the City and RSD to be prepared to discuss at the hearing why the Los Angeles Superior Court's form protective order is insufficient.
