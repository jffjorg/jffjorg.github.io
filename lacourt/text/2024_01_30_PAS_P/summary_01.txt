And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff Bryce Harris' motion for trial preference, citing his age (82 years old) and health concerns. The judge finds that Harris has a substantial interest in the litigation, and his health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing his interest in the litigation. The judge rejects Defendant Ralph's arguments that Harris did not make a sufficient showing of his health condition and that granting the motion would result in prejudice to Ralph's due to discovery deadlines and the need for additional discovery.
