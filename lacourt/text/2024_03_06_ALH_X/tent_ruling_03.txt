BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff Lee Wax’s
(“Plaintiff”) claim that he was unlawfully discriminated against and harassed
while employed by the Los Angeles County Chicano Employees Association
(“LACCEA” or “Defendant”). Plaintiff filed this complaint on December 28, 2022,
alleging give causes of action for (1) discrimination, (2) harassment, (3)
failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, (4) wrongful termination in
violation of public policy, and (5) breach of contract. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion for trial
preference is GRATNED.
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff
moves for trial preference pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 36,
subdivisions (a) and (d). 
 
            “A party to a civil action who is
over 70 years of age may petition the court for a preference, which the court
shall grant if the court makes both of the following findings: [¶] (1) The party has a
substantial interest in the action as a whole. [¶]  (2) The
health of the party is such that a preference is necessary to prevent
prejudicing the party’s interest in the litigation.” (Code Civ Proc. § 36,
subd. (a).)
 
            “In its
discretion, the court may also grant a motion for preference that is accompanied by clear and convincing
medical documentation that concludes
that one of the parties suffers from an illness or condition raising
substantial medical doubt of survival of that party beyond six months,
and that satisfies the court that
the interests of justice will be served by granting the preference.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 36, subdivision (d).) 
 
            Plaintiff
provides that he is 85 years old and in declining health. (Wax Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff provides that he has been diagnosed with
Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak, which causes the possibility of death or severe
injury at any moment. (Id. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff also provides that his only
treatment option is surgery and that his symptoms have been worsening. (Wax
Reply Decl. ¶¶ 5-7.) In opposition, Defendant contends that Plaintiff should be
required to submit additional evidence detailing the severity of his condition
and the need for trial preference. 
 
            In
Fox v. Superior Court (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 529, the Court of Appeals
clarified some of the differences between subdivisions (a) and (d) of Code of
Civil Procedure section 36. The court noted that a “clear and convincing”
standard applies to discretionary grants under subdivision (d) but do not apply
under mandatory grants pursuant to subdivision (a). (Id. at p. 533.)
Further, the Court stated that “a motion under subdivision (a) may be supported by
nothing more than an attorney's declaration ‘based upon information and belief
as to the medical diagnosis and prognosis of any party.’ ” (Id. at p.
534.) “Provided there is evidence that the party involved is over 70, all
subdivision (a) requires is a showing that that party's ‘health... is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing [his] interest in the litigation.’
” (Ibid.)

Plaintiff’s motion for trial
preference is GRANTED.
 
Court will discuss new trial dates (within
120s days) at the hearing.
