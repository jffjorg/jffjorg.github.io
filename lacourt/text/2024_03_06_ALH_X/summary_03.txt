[¶] (2) The health of the party is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party's interest in the litigation."
  - "In its discretion, the court may also grant a motion for preference that is accompanied by clear and convincing medical documentation that concludes that one of the parties suffers from an illness or condition raising substantial medical doubt of survival of that party beyond six months, and that satisfies the court that the interests of justice will be served by granting the preference."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for trial preference, citing the plaintiff's age (85 years old) and health issues, including a diagnosis of Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak. The judge notes that the plaintiff's health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing his interest in the litigation. The judge also refers to the Court of Appeals' decision in Fox v. Superior Court (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 529, which clarified the requirements for granting a motion for trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36. The judge will discuss new trial dates at the hearing.
