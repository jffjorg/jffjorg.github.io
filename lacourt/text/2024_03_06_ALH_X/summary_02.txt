Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which involves a dispute over medical services provided to Ratavous Shahverdi, who passed away. The judge has dismissed certain claims and granted or denied certain motions.

The judge sustained without leave to amend defendants' demurrer to plaintiffs' sixth and eighth causes of action, which were claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress and fraud. The judge also granted defendants' motion to strike plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages, finding that the prayer was improper because plaintiffs did not establish a substantial probability of prevailing on the claim.

The judge denied defendants' motion to compel discovery responses, finding that the motion was moot because plaintiff Nora Shahverdi had passed away. The judge also denied defendants' motion to compel discovery responses, finding that the motion was moot because plaintiff Nora Shahverdi had passed away.

The judge's ruling is subject to change if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling and notifies the court of their intention to do so.
