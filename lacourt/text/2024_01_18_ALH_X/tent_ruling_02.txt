RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Defendant moves for an order
compelling a response to his requests for the production of documents. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Marco Lopez (“Plaintiff”)
claims that Defendants Paul Argueta (“Argueta”), Cesar Haro (“Haro”), Robert
Silva (“Silva”), and Josh Chairez (“Chairez”) induced him to make a payment of
over $159,000 under the pretense that the money would be used to fund
investments for Plaintiff’s retirement. Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants
personally retained the funds. Plaintiff further asserts that the Defendants
prepared Plaintiff with a written statement titled “Personal Guarantee” that
states Defendants would repay Plaintiff a total of $175,000 by June 31, 2020, a
date that does not exist. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants have failed to pay
back the money. 
 
Plaintiff filed a second amended
complaint (“SAC”) on July 18, 2022, alleging nine causes of action for (1)
breach of contract – written contract (personal guarantee), (2) fraud, (3)
negligent misrepresentation, and (4) promissory estoppel. 
             
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Defendant’s motion for an order compelling a response to
his requests for production of documents is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff is ordered to produce code-compliant responses
without objections within 20 days of the date of this order.
 
            Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling a response to the interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc. section
2030.290, subd. (b).) The same applies to a party that fails to respond to a
request for document production. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.300, subd. (b).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant moves for an order compelling a
response to his requests for the production of documents. Defendant provides that he served requests for the production of
documents on Plaintiff on August 29, 2023. (Rosenthal Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant provides that Plaintiff has failed to
respond despite being given several extensions. (Id. ¶¶ 4-5.) Defendant
has demonstrated that he served discovery requests, but that Plaintiff failed
to respond.
 
            Defendant’s motion for an order compelling a response is
granted.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Defendant’s motion for an order compelling a response to
his requests for production of documents is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff is ordered to produce code-compliant responses
without objections within 20 days of the date of this order.
 
            Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount
of $460.
