English-text summary:

Judge Joel L. Lofton has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash subpoenas filed by Cross-Defendants (MIDWICK COLLECTION HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, Jung Hoon Han, and Daniel Brackins) in a case involving a dispute over improper modifications to a property. The Judge granted the motion to quash the subpoenas for Naofumi Kudo and Joy (Jiayi) Yang, finding that the service of the subpoenas was improper. The Judge noted that the subpoenas did not have proof of service establishing compliance with the statutory requirements, and that the service of the subpoenas electronically did not comply with the applicable statutes. The Judge cited California Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.1, subdivision (a), and Meza v. Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC (2019) 6 Cal.5th 844, 855, in support of the ruling.
