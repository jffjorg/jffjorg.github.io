And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., moves to bifurcate the trial of the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The judge grants the motion, in part, and orders that evidence of the defendant's profit and financial condition be excluded until the appropriate time. The judge cites Civil Code section 3295, subdivision (d), which allows a defendant to bifurcate the trial and exclude evidence of their wealth and profits until the issues of liability, compensatory damages, and malice, oppression, or fraud have been resolved against the defendant. The judge also notes that the defendant's request to exclude all arguments related to punitive damages is broader than the protections provided by statute and is therefore denied.
