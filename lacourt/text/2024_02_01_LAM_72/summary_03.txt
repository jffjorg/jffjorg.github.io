```

Summary:

The court denies State Farm's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication on all causes of action. The court finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding the damage to the wood living room floor and the payment for the damaged painting. The court concludes that State Farm's decision to pay for the painting at auction value rather than fair market value may have been based on malice, oppression, or fraud, and therefore denies summary adjudication on the cause of action for punitive damages.
