And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Foster Washington v. Daniel Sturridge, granting Defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered in favor of Plaintiff on December 21, 2021. The Court finds that the proof of service on which the default judgment is based is defective on its face and does not comply with California Civil Procedure Code section 415.20, which requires substituted service to be allowed only if the summons and complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the person to be served. Additionally, the evidence in the court record does not support Plaintiff's contention that Defendant was personally served. The Court grants Defendant's motion for two separate and independent reasons: (1) the proof of service fails to establish substituted service, and (2) the evidence in the court record does not support Plaintiff's contention that Defendant was personally served.
