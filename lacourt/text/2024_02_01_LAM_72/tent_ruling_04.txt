Cross-Defendants Heartlung Corporation (“Heartlung”),
American Heart Technologies, LLC (“AHT”), Morteza Naghavi, and Naveen Madala
(collectively, “Cross-Defendants”) move to strike the seventh, eighth, ninth,
tenth, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth causes of action (the
“Disputed Counts”) of the First Amended Complaint (“FACC”) filed by Defendants
and Cross-Complainants BDI, Inc. (“BDI”) and Matthew Budoff (collectively,
“Cross-Complainants”).
 
The Court GRANTS Cross-Defendants’ motion.
 
Background
 
Defendant BDI developed intellectual property protected by
multiple patents for the purpose of measuring bone density. The patents were
originally owned by the Lundquist Institute at Harbor-UCLA, which sublicensed
them to BDI. BDI and Budoff, who worked for BDI, were unable to build an
automated bone density measurement software that could be commercialized as it
wished.
 
On May 14, 2021, Heartlung and BDI executed a patent license
agreement (the “License Agreement”) which granted Heartlung a worldwide
exclusive license to US Patent No. US9119590 and US Patent No.10695022.
Heartlung contends that BDI retained the rights to use the patent for clinical
and research purposes. Cross-Complainants contend that BDI retained the right
to use the licenses for commercial purposes as well. Cross-Complainants contend
that Naghavi further promised that Heartlung would develop for BDI an AI
product implementing the patents. Cross-Complainants further contend that the
parties negotiated a non-exclusive license, but that Cross-Defendants
nevertheless drafted a contract stating that the license would be exclusive to
undermine that agreement.
 
On June 15, 2021, Heartlung and Budoff executed a scientific
advisory agreement (the “Advisory Agreement”) under which Budoff became a
shareholder and advisor of Heartlung. The Advisory Agreement provided for the
protection and nondisclosure of confidential and proprietary information.
 
From July 28, 2021 through February 27, 2023, Budoff worked
for Heartlung and received trade secret information regarding Heartlung’s
development and commercialization of automated bone density measurement
technology.
 
Around January, 2023, Cross-Complainants allege that the FBI
contacted BDI and informed it that Heartlung had misappropriated data in
violation of HIPAA.
 
On January 17, 2023, Budoff sent Heartlung a proposed
amendment to the License Agreement that would have allowed BDI to use
Heartlung’s bone density measurement technology without paying any fees.
Heartlung rejected these changes. On January 24, 2023, Budoff emailed Heartlung
stating that the provision in the License Agreement allowing clinical use also
covered commercial use. 
 
Around this period of time, Nagavi and Madala sent a number
of letters and emails alleging that BDI was in violation of the sublicense and
threatening to instigate litigation against BDI.
 
On March 21, 2023, Budoff resigned from Heartlung’s advisory
board. 
 
By April 5, 2023, Heartlung alleges it received reports that
BDI was advertising and negotiating the commercial use of bone density
measurement technology covered by the License Agreement.
 
Heartlung filed this action against Defendants on August 28,
2023, alleging (1) specific performance of exclusive licensing agreement; (2)
breach of licensing agreement and damages; and (3) misappropriation of trade
secrets.
 
Cross-Complainants filed a cross-complaint. The operative
cross-complaint is now the FACC, which raises claims for (1) breach of
contract; (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3)
breach of implied in fact contract; (4) fraudulent inducement of contract; (5)
fraud; (6) breach of implied duty to perform with reasonable care; (7)
attempted extortion; (8) business and trade libel; (9) libel; (10) slander;
(11) conversion; (12) tortious interference with business relations; (13)
negligent interference with business relations; (14) unfair competition in
violation of Business & Professions Code, section 17200; (15) common law
unfair competition; (16) violation of the Defend Trade Secrets Act; and (17)
misappropriation of trade secrets [emphasis added to the Disputed Counts].
 
Cross-Defendants filed this motion on January 9, 2024.
Cross-Complainants filed an opposition and Cross-Defendants filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 requires the court to
strike causes of action arising from an act in furtherance of the defendant’s
right of free speech or petition unless the plaintiff establishes that there is
a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim. 
 
In assessing a defendant’s Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16 special motion to strike, the court must engage in a two-step process. (Shekhter
v. Financial Indem. Co. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 141, 150.) First, the court
must decide whether the defendant has met the threshold burden of showing that
the plaintiff’s cause of action arises from the defendant’s constitutional
rights of free speech or petition for redress of grievances. (Ibid.)
This burden may be met by showing the act which forms the basis for the
plaintiff’s cause of action was an act that falls within one of the four
categories of conduct set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16,
subdivision (e). 
 
Once a defendant has met its initial burden and established
that the anti-SLAPP statute applies, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to
demonstrate a “probability” of success on the merits. (Code Civ. Proc., §
425.16, subd. (b); Equilon Enters. LLC v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29
Cal.4th 53, 67.) “[T]he plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both
legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts
to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is
credited.” (Matson v. Dvorak (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 539, 548, internal
quotations omitted.) 
 
Discussion
 
Protected Activity
 
To determine the gravamen of an alleged SLAPP, courts look
to the factual basis for liability. (Wallace v. McCubbin (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1169, 1190, as modified on denial of reh'g (July 26, 2011)
disapproved of on other grounds by Baral v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th
376.) 
 
          The
anti-SLAPP statute applies to a “cause of action again a person arising from
any act of that person in furtherance of the person’s right of petition or free
speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in
connection with a public issue.”  (Civ.
Proc. Code § 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) The statute defines such acts to include
the following:
 
(1)
any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive,
or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, 
(2)
any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under
consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any
other official proceeding authorized by law, 
(3)
any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or
a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or 
(4)
any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of
petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public
issue or an issue of public interest. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §425.16, subd. (e).) 
 
The Anti-SLAPP statute protects statements and writings made
before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., §425.16,
subd. (e)(1).) “The constitutional right to petition ... includes the basic act
of filing litigation....” (Birkner v. Lam (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 275,
281.) “It is beyond question that the initiation and prosecution of [... a
lawsuit is] protected under the anti-SLAPP statute.” (Paiva v. Nichols
(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1007, 1017-1018).
 
All communicative acts performed by attorneys as part of
their representation of a client in a judicial proceeding or other petitioning
context are per se protected as petitioning activity by the Anti-SLAPP statute.
(Cabral v. Martins (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 471; Rusheen v. Cohen
(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1048, 1056.) Further, 
“communications preparatory to or in anticipation of the bringing of an
action or other official proceeding … are equally entitled to the benefits of
section 425.16.” (Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope & Opportunity
(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1115.) California courts have held that pre-litigation
communications such as letters threatening to sue are protected activity. (Neville
v. Chudacoff (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1266 [letter to employer's
customers accusing ex-employee of misappropriation of trade secrets and
threatening to file litigation was protected]; CKE Restaurants, Inc. v.
Moore (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 262, 271 [statements made in 60–day notice of
intent to sue required by Prop. 65]; Digerati Holdings, LLC v. Young Money
Entertainment LLC (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 873, 887–888 [letter to film
distributors asserting that film was not authorized and threatening to sue].)
“Counseling others in anticipation of litigation or encouraging others to sue
is considered protected prelitigation activity.” (Pech v. Doniger (2022)
75 Cal.App.5th 443, 462.)
 
“[A] statement is ‘in connection with’ litigation under
section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2) if it relates to the substantive issues in
the litigation and is directed to persons having some interest in the
litigation.” (Neville v. Chudacoff, supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at p.
1266; see also Fremont Reorganizing Corp. v. Faigin (2011) 198
Cal.App.4th 1153, 1167 [statements made by the defendant, who was a
court-appointed liquidator in an insolvency proceeding, to the Insurance
Commissioner concerning the assets of the insolvent company were protected].
The audience to the statements need not be a party to the proceeding, or even a
potential party, but the audience must have some level of specific interest in
the litigation. (Contemporary Services Corp. v. Staff Pro Inc. (2007)
152 CA4th 1043, 1055 [email to customers accusing competitor of
litigation-related misconduct was protected].)
 
In each of the Disputed Counts, the culpable conduct alleged
is the same. Cross-Complainants allege that:
 
92.
Cross-Defendants overtly made wrongful threats of civil prosecution and
tortious interference (and of inflicting on Cross-Claimants resulting attorney
and other legal costs) if [Cross-Complainants] did not submit to
Cross-Defendants’ demands. Those threats included making untrue allegations and
threats to Dr. Budoff’s partners and superiors at his place of employment, and
threats to BDI’s customers, when Cross-Defendants knew (1) that these threatened
individuals and entities were not, and are not parties, to Cross-Defendants’
allegations (they were threatened by Cross-Defendants only to coerce [Cross-Complainants]),
and (2) that Cross-Defendants’ allegations were untrue and Cross-Defendants’
demands were unfounded or Cross-Defendants should have known that such
allegations were untrue and their demands were unfounded.
 
93.
When Cross-Claimants refused to submit to Cross-Defendants’ wrongful demands
and unlawful coercion, Cross-Defendants did, in fact, carry through with their
threatened acts, which damaged the business and personal reputations of
Cross-Claimants.
 
(FACC ¶¶ 92-93; compare FACC ¶¶ 96-97,
100-101, 104-105, 117-118, 121-122, 125-126, 129-130.)
 
          Cross-Defendants’
statements to Cross-Complainants threatening litigation are facially protected
as statements contemplating litigation. Truth of the statements is not an
element of protected activity – it is only necessary that litigation be
contemplated in good faith. Here, Cross-Defendants filed the instant action a
few months later, over the exact subject matter at issue – the intellectual
property dispute. 
 
          Further,
statements to Harbor-UCLA and the Lundquist Institute also fall within the
ambit of statements in contemplation of litigation. As discussed above, a
statement need not be to a party or potential party to the potential litigation
to count as a statement in connection with litigation. Harbor-UCLA and the
Lundquist Institute are the original owners of the patents at issue here, which
were sublicensed to BDI and then further sublicensed to Heartlung. Thus, Harbor-UCLA
and the Lundquist Institute have a sufficient involvement in the litigation for
the communications to be in connection with litigation. (Contemporary
Services Corp. v. Staff Pro Inc., supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1055 [email to customers accusing competitor of litigation-related
misconduct was protected because they have “some involvement” in the litigation];
Neville v. Chudacoff, supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at p. 1266 [letter
to employer's customers accusing ex-employee of misappropriation of trade
secrets and threatening to file litigation was protected].)
 
          Thus,
the Court concludes that Cross-Defendants’ statements that form the basis of
the Disputed Counts are protected.
 
Probability of Success
 
California law does not permit liability for filing
lawsuits, except in the case of malicious prosecution. (See Civ. Code, § 47.)
This “litigation privilege[ ] has been referred to as ‘the backbone to an
effective and smoothly operating judicial system.’ [Citation.]” (Silberg v.
Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 214-215.) “The litigation privilege is
absolute… . [Citation.]” (Kashian v. Harriman (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th
892.) 
 
The litigation privilege applies to contemplated litigation;
however, it “applies only when the communication has some relation to a
proceeding that is contemplated in good faith and under serious
consideration. The bare possibility that the proceeding might be
instituted is not to be used as a cloak to provide immunity for defamation when
the possibility is not seriously considered.” (Edwards v. Centex Real Estate
Corp. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15, 32 [internal citation and quotation marks
omitted; emphasis in original].)
 
As discussed above, Cross-Defendants seriously considered
the possibility of litigation, as best evidenced by the fact that they filed
the exact litigation that was threatened. Although Cross-Complainants argue
that Cross-Defendants’ causes of action are not true, that is not the
issue. In Anti-SLAPP analysis, the probability of success prong looks to the
probability of success of the challenged claims – in this case,
Cross-Complainants’. Here, Cross-Complainants have failed to meet their burden
to show that such a probability exists.
 
The Court therefore grants the Anti-SLAPP motion.
