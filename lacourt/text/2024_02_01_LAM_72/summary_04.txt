Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Cross-Defendants' motion to strike the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth causes of action in the cross-complaint. The judge finds that the statements made by Cross-Defendants are protected under the anti-SLAPP statute because they were made in furtherance of their right of petition or free speech. The judge also finds that the litigation privilege applies to the contemplated litigation and that Cross-Complainants have failed to meet their burden to show that there is a probability of success on the merits. The judge concludes that Cross-Complainants' causes of action are not true and that Cross-Defendants' statements were made in good faith and under serious consideration.
