And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to strike the fourth cause of action of the First Amended Complaint, which alleges that the defendants engaged in unfair business practices by soliciting donations for Luna's vet bills while claiming that the money was needed for her care. The defendants, Brittany Littleton and Little Love Rescue, argued that their statements were protected by the anti-SLAPP statue because they were made in connection with the police investigation into the plaintiff's claim that they stole Luna. However, the judge found that the defendants' statements were not directed at persons having some interest in the litigation, but rather at the general public, and therefore did not qualify as protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statue. The judge also found that the defendants failed to provide any legal or logical basis for their argument, and that their unsupported assertions did not provide a basis for the anti-SLAPP motion.
