And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on a petition for approval of a compromise of a disputed claim of a person with a disability. The claimant, Edwin Nolasco, was a victim of sexual assault and has reached a settlement with the defendant, Doe 1, and the Los Angeles Unified School District. The court has granted the claimant's motion to seal certain records to protect his privacy and identity.

The court has also approved the compromise of the disputed claim, which involves transferring a portion of the settlement funds to a special needs trust (SNT). The court has reviewed the terms of the SNT and has made findings that the SNT beneficiary has a disability that substantially impairs their ability to provide for their own care and that the SNT is necessary to meet their special needs.

The court has ordered the proposed trustee of the trust to submit a $26,000 bond and has set a due date for the trustee to file the first accounting. The court has also set a hearing date for December 23, 2024, to review the trust's compliance with the court's orders.
