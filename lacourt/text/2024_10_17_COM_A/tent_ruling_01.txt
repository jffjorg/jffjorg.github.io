[TENTATIVE] ORDER 
GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT 
 
      This
action arises from Defendant’s alleged failure to pay insurance premiums totaling
$273,421.15 to Plaintiff’s assignor, State Compensation Insurance Fund. The
complaint alleges a claim for open book account. 
      Plaintiff
agreed to settle with Defendant for $150,000. Defendant failed to make any
payments. The agreement provides that in the event of a default and Defendant’s
failure to cure, Plaintiff is entitled to entry of judgment as alleged in the
complaint plus court costs of $728.87. (Mot. Ex., A, ¶ 4.)
      Defendant
timely served the motion on Defendant’s counsel, who did not file an
opposition. 
      A party
can move for entry of judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)
The court’s power is limited to determining the existence of the agreement and
to enforce its settlement. (Corkland v. Boscoe (1984)
156 Cal.App.3d 989, 994.) The court may receive oral testimony or
may determine the motion upon declarations alone. (Id.) 
      The
court applies general contract principles when interpreting a settlement
agreement. 
(Leeman v. Adams
Extract & Spice, LLC (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1374.)The
mutual intent of the parties and interpretation of the contract are based on
the language of the agreement alone. (Id.)
In construing a contract, "it is not a court's prerogative to alter it, to
rewrite its clear terms, or to make a new contract for the parties."(Moss Dev. Co. v. Geary (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 1, 9.)

      Plaintiff
has established that it is entitled to judgment according to the terms of the
parties’ settlement agreement. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.
