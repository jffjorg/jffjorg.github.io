[TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S VERIFIED RESPONSES TO REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS
 
 
      This action
arises from injuries Plaintiff sustained in an auto accident with Defendant,
Ricardo Buenrostro, who allegedly collided with Plaintiff due to defective
brakes. Plaintiff alleges claims for negligence for Defendants’ failure to
maintain the vehicle and for products liability for a defective brake light, switch
clip. 
      Defendant, Ricardo
Buenrostro, served Plaintiff with written discovery on April 1, 2024. Plaintiff
did not serve responses despite extended deadlines to respond that Defendant
granted upon request. 
      Plaintiff was
timely served with the motions and did not file an opposition. 
      Where a party
fails to timely respond to interrogatories and a document request, the court
has authority to compel a response. (Code Civ. Proc., §2030.290(b),
§2031.300(b).) Untimely responses result in a waiver of objections. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290(a), § 2031.300(a).) 
      Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s three motions are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve
within 30 days, verified, code-compliant responses without objection to form and
special interrogatories, set one, and request for production of documents, set
one. 
      Sanctions are
imposed for Plaintiff’s failure to provide substantial justification for the
failure to respond to discovery, calculated as follows:  



$210/hour x 2 hours for each of
  three motions


$420.00




x 3 motions


1,260.00




1 hour to appear


210.00




Filing fees ($60 x 3)


180.00




TOTAL SANCTIONS for all three
  motions


$2,070.00



 
      Sanctions
of $2,070 are payable to Defendant’s counsel within 30 days.
