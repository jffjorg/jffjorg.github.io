MOTION:                  Motion
to Seal Documents

Legal
Standard
 
The sealing of trial court records is governed by California
Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551. (Mercury Interactive Corp. v. Klein
(2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 60, 68.) Pleadings, motions, discovery documents, and
other papers may not be filed under seal merely by stipulation of the parties—a
prior court order must be obtained. (CRC, Rule 2.551(a); see H.B. Fuller Co.
v. Doe (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 888.)
 
To seal a record, the following
requirements are imposed: (1) the party must file a motion or
application for an order sealing the record, which must be accompanied by a
memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing; (2) the
party must serve a copy of the motion on all parties who have appeared in the
case; and (3) the party requesting that a record be filed under seal
must lodge it with the court when the motion or application is made unless the
record has previously been lodged. (CRC, Rule 2.551(b).)  
 
The Court must make the following express factual
findings in order to seal records: (1) an overriding interest exists
that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) the overriding
interest supports sealing the records; (3) a substantial probability exists
that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed;
(4) the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) no less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest. (CRC, Rule 2.550(d).) These findings embody constitutional requirements
for a request to seal court records, protecting the First Amendment right of
public access to civil trials. (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior
Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1217-1218.)
 
An order sealing
the record must specifically state the facts that support the findings and
direct the sealing of only those pages and documents or, if reasonably
practicable, portions of those documents and pages, that contain the material
that needs to be placed under seal, and all other portions must be included in
the public file. (CRC, rule 2.550(e).) 
 
Once sealed, a record can only be unsealed by order
of court. (CRC, Rule 2.551(h)(1).) So long as it remains under seal, all
parties must refrain from filing anything not under seal that would disclose
the sealed matter. (Id., Rule 2.551(c).) If a party files a new document
referring to sealed matter, it must submit an unredacted version of the
document under seal and a redacted one for the public record. (Id., Rule
2.551(b)(5).)
 
Analysis
 
Defendants UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company (“UHIC”)
and UnitedHealthcare Benefits Plan of California (“UHCBPC”) moves under
California Rule of Court, rule 2.550 for an order sealing documents filed in
support of Plaintiff’s opposition
to defendants’ motion for summary adjudication as follows:
1. Exhibit A: UnitedHealthcare’s Coverage Letter
regarding Patient 1
2. Exhibit B: UnitedHealthcare’s Second Coverage Letter
regarding Patient 1
3. Exhibit C: Patient 2’s Medical Record
4. Exhibit D: Patient 1’s Medical Record
5. Exhibit E: Patient 1’s Medical Record
6. Exhibit F: UnitedHealthcare’s Claim Receipt Letter
regarding Patient 1
7. Exhibit G: UnitedHealthcare’s Request for Information
regarding Patient 2
8. Exhibit H: UnitedHealthcare’s Follow-up Request for
Information regarding Patient 2
9. Exhibit I: Patient 2’s Appeal Request
10. Exhibit J: UnitedHealthcare’s Response to Patient 2’s
Appeal Request
(collectively,
the “Sealed Documents;” See Rutschman Decl.)
 
A person has a constitutional right
of privacy to his or her medical records. (John B. v. Sup.Ct. (2006)
38 Cal.4th 1177, 1198.) “A person’s medical profile is an area of privacy
infinitely more intimate, more personal in quality and nature than many areas
already judicially recognized and protected.” (Hill v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletics Ass’n (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1,
41, quoting Bd. of Med. Quality
Asssurance v. Gherardini (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 669, 679; see also
Civ. Code § 56.10; 42 USC § 1320d et seq. [under Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), health care providers generally may not
disclose medical information without patient's authorization or court order].) 
 
Defendants demonstrate that these
exhibits consist of confidential protected health information (“PHI”) and
personal identifying information (“PII”) of nonparty patients whose claims are
the subject of Plaintiff’s causes of action. (See Santos Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) The
Sealed Documents are replete with sensitive health information protected under HIPPA
including, but not limited to, the names, addresses, telephone numbers, ages,
dates of admission and/or discharge of patients, diagnosis codes, procedure
codes, account numbers, medical records, and other sensitive medical
information of the nonparty patients, all of which is generally protected from
disclosure. Therefore, there is an overriding interest in protecting the Sealed
Documents from disclosure. 
 
Defendants’ request is narrowly
tailored and there is no less restrictive means to protect its overriding
interest. Furthermore, the required extensive redactions would impose an undue
burden on Defendants, and the non-PII/PHI information would provide a limited
value to the public.  
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
