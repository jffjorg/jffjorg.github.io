And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion to compel initial discovery responses filed by Plaintiff Andrew Cox against Defendant Brown Label. The motion is deemed moot due to the facially compliant responses from Defendant on April 9, 2024. However, the court must still consider the merits of the motion to determine appropriate sanctions. The court finds that Defendant failed to respond to the Requests for Admissions (RFA) and that the service of the RFA was ineffective. Despite this, the service of the RFA on February 21, 2024, was valid. As a result, the motion was properly brought, and sanctions are mandatory against Defendant Brown Label. The court imposes sanctions in the total sum of $1,090.00, inclusive of costs, to be paid to Plaintiff's counsel within 30 days.
