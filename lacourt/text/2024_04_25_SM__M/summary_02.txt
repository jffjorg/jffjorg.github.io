Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to seal documents in a lawsuit between Ecure CA, LLC (plaintiff) and UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company, et al. (defendants). The defendants have requested that certain documents be sealed to protect the privacy of non-party patients whose medical information is contained in the documents. The court has granted the motion, finding that there is an overriding interest in protecting patient privacy and that the requested sealing is narrowly tailored and there is no less restrictive means to achieve the overriding interest.
