  CASE NO.: 23STCV19637
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 7, 2025



 
Kevin
A. Lipeles and Thomas H. Schelly of Lipeles Law Group (counsel of record for Plaintiff
Ana Regente Vega) seek to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that the
attorney-client relationship has deteriorated to the extent that counsel can no
longer represent the client in this matter.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Trial has not been set in
this matter, and there is no prejudice to Plaintiff.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved as counsel is GRANTED and effective upon filing
a proof of service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order
on Ana Regente Vega and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
       
 Dated this 7th day of January 2025
