  CASE NO.: 23STCV12469
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 7, 2025



 
Dariush
G. Adli, Vernon A. Nelson, and ADLI Law Group P.C. (counsel of record for Defendants
I Bahoo, LLC and AZT, LLC) seek to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that the relationship
of trust and confidence has ceased to exist, and irreconcilable differences have
arisen between Defendants and counsel that make it unreasonably difficult to carry
out the representation effectively.  No party
opposed the motions.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until February 18, 2025, and there
is no prejudice to Defendants.
The
unopposed motions to be relieved are GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on I Bahoo,
LLC, AZT, LLC, and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  AZT, LLC filed a Substitution of Attorney on
December 20, 2024, demonstrating that it has retained new counsel.  No Substitution of Attorney has been filed
for I Bahoo, LLC.  Therefore, an Order to
Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel for I Bahoo, LLC is scheduled for _____________,
at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
I
Bahoo, LLC must retain new counsel by that date or the Court will strike its answer
and place it in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
       
 Dated this 7th day of January 2025
