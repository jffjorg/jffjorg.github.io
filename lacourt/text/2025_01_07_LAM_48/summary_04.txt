And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion brought by Kevin A. Lipeles and Thomas H. Schelly of Lipeles Law Group, who are seeking to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Ana Regente Vega. The motion is unopposed, and the judge finds that the attorney-client relationship has deteriorated to the extent that counsel can no longer represent the client. The judge cites California law that an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted absent a showing of resulting prejudice. Since the trial has not been set and there is no prejudice to the plaintiff, the judge grants the motion. The order will take effect once a proof of service is filed showing service of the order on the parties.
