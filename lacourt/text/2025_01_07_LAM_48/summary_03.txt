And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motions filed by Dariush G. Adli, Vernon A. Nelson, and ADLI Law Group P.C. to be relieved as counsel for I Bahoo, LLC and AZT, LLC. The attorneys' relationship with the defendants has ceased to exist and irreconcilable differences have arisen, making it unreasonably difficult for them to effectively represent the defendants. The court has also ordered I Bahoo, LLC to retain new counsel by a certain date or risk having its answer struck and being placed in default. AZT, LLC has already retained new counsel, but I Bahoo, LLC has not. The court has scheduled an Order to Show Cause hearing for I Bahoo, LLC to demonstrate that it has retained new counsel.
