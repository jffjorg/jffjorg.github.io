And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The court has sustained the demurrer in part and denied it in part. The demurrer was sustained as to the two fraud causes of action, the claim for unpaid wages, and the claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy. The court denied the motion to strike, finding that the allegations at issue were pertinent and supported by the claims made in the complaint. The court also denied the request to strike the allegations regarding aiding and abetting and conspiring. The court granted the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint within 30 days.
