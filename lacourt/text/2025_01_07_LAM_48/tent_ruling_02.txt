  CASE NO.: 22STCV34239
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST
  FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 7, 2025



 
On October 24, 2022, Plaintiff Auto Soss Inc. filed this
action against Defendant Raysean Smith.  The
Court entered default against Defendant on October 23, 2023.  On the same day, Plaintiff filed this request
for entry of default judgment.
Plaintiff seeks a judgment of $352,859.84, consisting
of $300,000.00 in damages, $49,000.00 in prejudgment interest, and $3,859.84 in
costs.
“‘Plaintiffs in a default judgment proceeding must prove
they are entitled to the damages claimed.’ 
[Citation].”  (Kim v. Westmoore
Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 288.)  “[T]he plaintiff must affirmatively establish
his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.” (Id. at p. 287.)
Plaintiff’s Founder and CEO declares, “Based on [his]
experience with the YouTube Partner Program and the income derived therefrom, as
well as the frequency by which Plaintiff posted videos and viewer engagement with
Plaintiff’s videos, Plaintiff would have earned $200,000.00 from monetizing its
videos on Plaintiff’s YouTube Channel had Plaintiff been able to continue monetizing
its videos . . . [and] the views, likes, comments, and watch hour statistics from
the Videos which Defendant permanently deleted, were worth $100,000.00.”  (Reyes Decl. ¶ 15.)  This is speculative and does not establish any
basis for the requested damages.  Plaintiff
does not provide, for example, evidence of prior earnings from which future losses
could be calculated, or evidence of the values of “views, likes, comments, and watch
hour statistics.”
The $3,859.84 in costs includes $2,860.10 in service
of process fees, $435.00 in court fees, $107.67 in filing fees, $90.80 in printing/scanning
costs, $46.75 in postage and overnight service costs, $167.52 in messenger/e-service
costs, and $152.00 in miscellaneous other costs.  (Kashfian Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. 7.)  Postage, photocopying, printing, fax fees, and
exhibit tabs are not recoverable costs.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b).)  The messenger
fees for delivering courtesy copies to the Court are also not recoverable, especially
because this Court does not accept paper courtesy copies.
Additionally, although “[a]
‘verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of the propriety’ of the items
listed on it” (Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486),
Plaintiff’s $2,860.10 for process server
fees is contradicted by the evidence.  The
proofs of service filed with the Court show a total of $947.37 in process server
fees: $146.92 for substituted service on October 31, 2022 (filed December 19, 2022)
and $800.45 for personal service on September 20, 2023 (filed October 4 and 23,
2023).  (See also Kashfian Decl. ¶¶ 3-5 &
Exs. 1-2.)
The request for entry of default judgment is DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
