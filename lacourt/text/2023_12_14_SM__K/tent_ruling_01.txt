TENTATIVE RULING
                                             
MOTION: 
    Defendants JMM’s and Dakovic’s Motions
To Tax Costs 
HELD:           GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART
 
 
I.               
Background
 
      This
is an asbestos case wherein Plaintiff’s (“P”) won multi-million dollar verdicts
against Defendant JMM (“JMM”) and Defendant George Dakovic and Sons
(“Dakovic”).  P has filed a cost
memorandum seeking $1,242,105.31 in costs. 
Both Defendants now move to tax those costs.  
 
 
II.            
THRESHOLD
PROCEDURAL ISSUES
 
A.    Dakovic Objection to Length of P
Opposition Brief
 
      Dakovic
objects to P’s 23 page Opposition Brief under CRC 3.1113(b) [opposing briefs cannot
exceed 15 pages].  Dakovic is correct,
but rather than striking P’s Opposition Brief in total, instead this Court strikes
pages 16-23 of their Opposition Brief.
 
B.    P Objection to Timeliness of Dakovic
Opening and Reply Briefs
 
      P
argues that Dakovic’s Opening Brief was late and should be stricken.  Both parties agree that Dakovic’s Motion to
Tax Costs was due by November 3, 2023.  According
to this Court’s records, Dakovic’s Motion to Tax Costs was indeed filed on
11/9/23, which would make it late. 
However, Dakovic submits proof of its good faith attempts to file their
motion timely on 11/3/23 and that the Clerk’s Office rejected the filing due to
a mix-up regarding which courthouse the Opening Brief should have been e-filed
in (downtown where the case emanated from, or Santa Monica where the case was
tried).  This Court accepts Dakovic’s
efforts to timely file their Opening Brief and deems the ultimate 11/9/23
filing date to be timely.  
 
      With
respect to Dakovic’s Reply Brief, P argues that under CCP §1105(b), Reply
briefs are due “at least 5 court days before the hearing.”  Since the hearing was initially set for
12/1/23, 5 court days before that hearing would have been 11/22/23.  Dakovic did not file his Reply Brief until
11/27/23, which is only 3 days before the original 12/1/23 hearing date.  Dakovic counters that 5 court days before the
12/1/23 hearing was 11/24/23, which was a court holiday (day after
Thanksgiving).  Dakovic then reasons that
per CCP § 12a, his Reply Brief was not due until the next non-holiday day,
which was 11/27/23.  Dakovic’s analysis is
rejected as erroneous: five “court days” prior to 12/1/23 was 11/22/23, not as
Dakovic contends, 11/24/23 as that date was an official court holiday and
therefore not a “court day.”  As such, Dakovic’s
Reply Brief was late filed and is hereby stricken.  Moreover, from a policy perspective Dakovic
position is nonsensical:  the whole point
of giving both the court and opposing counsel a minimum of 5 court days to read
a Reply brief would be stood on its head if this Court were to accept Dakovic’s
argument that a minimum 5 days before the hearing can actually mean 3.
 
[Note:  This Court is well aware that these procedural
objections and remedies are for all practical purposes, academic.  In spite of the rules violations, this Court
has in fact read all the briefs several times and, in any event, the struck
portions may simply be re-raised by counsel orally, as in any hearing.  Rather than go through the pointless exercise
of rendering a tentative opinion that would have been written without consideration
of the struck arguments only to have to revise the opinion after such struck portions
are orally raised at the hearing, this tentative takes into consideration all
the points and arguments raised by the parties.]
 
 
III.          
JMM’s
MOTION TO TAX COSTS 
 
A.   
Item
1: Filing and Motion Fees:  ($2,357.80) 
 
JMM argues that filing fees should
be taxed in the amount sought because those filing 
fees
related to other defendants.  In essence,
JMM argues that costs must be apportioned amongst defendants such that each
defendant is only responsible for the litigation costs expended against
them.  While this theory has some logical
appeal, there simply is no basis in law for this apportionment theory.  Perhaps the legislature decided as a
practical matter that apportionment would be too difficult to accomplish and
therefore mandated that all reasonable and necessary costs to the litigation
are to be jointly and severally liable amongst the non-prevailing parties.  
 
            This item of taxation sought is DENIED.  
 
 
B.   
Item
4: Deposition Costs ($49,123.34) 
 
JMM attacks various witness
deposition costs as unnecessary.  This
Court agrees with P 
that
these disputed deposition costs were, when looked upon from their pre-trial
vantage point,  reasonable and necessary for
P to undertake.  However, P’s admit that
their $80,268.28 sought under this category include improper cancellation
fees.  Thus, this Court will GRANT JMM’s
motion to tax this category by $850, thereby leaving a net deposition cost of $79,418.28
to be levied on defendants.
 
 
C.   
Item
5:  Service of Process ($403.65)
 
P seeks to tax this Item on the
previously rejected theory of apportionment amongst 
defendants.  As there is no apportionment under the law,
this proposed taxation is DENIED.
 
 
 
 
D.   
Item
8:  Expert Fees ($111,762.29)
 
As P points out, they do not seek these
expert fees against JMM as there was no CCP § 
998
offer justifying the award of these fees. 
They are being sought against D Dakovic as there was a CCP § 998 offer to
Dakovic which it rejected and failed to achieve a better result at trial.    Since
these costs are not being sought against JMM, there is no need to tax these
costs for JMM.  DENIED.
 
 
E.    
Item
16: Other:  (Trial Tech Support of $8,162.50;
Prejudgment Interest of  $993,815.93)
 
In a complicated trial such as this
one that lasts over 5 weeks and included testimony of 
over
20 witnesses, including the critical video testimony of decedent John Metzger, P’s
use of Threadeo to present and sync such testimony was reasonable and necessary
for this trial.  Taxation of Threadeo is DENIED.
 
            JMM’s motion to tax prejudgment interest is also DENIED
as moot since P is not seeking this cost against JMM.  
 
 
 
 
IV.         
DEFENDANT
DAKOVIC MOTION TO TAKE COSTS
 
            Unlike JMM, there was a § 988 offer
to compromise issued to defendant Dakovic which was declined.  P received a judgment in excess of the §998
offer and therefore are entitled to the 
§
998 costs of prejudgment interest and expert fees.
 
A.   
Validity
of P’s § 998 Offers
 
1.    
2/25/20
First Offer
 
            P served 2 separate § 998 offers to
compromise, the first being on 2/25/20 for $499,999 which was rejected by
Dakovic.  Dakovic argues that this offer
is not valid because (i) it had been superseded by P’s second § 998 offer on
11/23/21; (ii) the original offeror, John Metzger passed away prior to trial; and
(iii) the offer was premature as it was made only 4 months after Dakovic
answered and done so without providing information regarding offsets from other
settling parties.  
 
            This Court agrees that the second 2021
offer superseded the initial 2020 offer. 
Moreover, John Metzger’s death, and more importantly the subsequent filing
of an amended complaint, both served to invalidate the initial offer.  However, this Court rejects the argument that
2020 initial offer was premature; the information regarding exposure was within
the possession of Dakovic and its employees prior to the deposition and a party
does not need to know the amount of offsets to be able to evaluate a settlement
offer.  
 
2.    
11/23/21
Offer
 
Dakovic attacks the 2nd
§ 998 offer (also for $499,999) as being invalid because it was a 
“joint”
offer, meaning that this offer was made on behalf of all 3 plaintiffs without
allocating how much each plaintiff was to get from the offer amount.  Dakovic relies upon Gilman v. Beverly
California Corp. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 121, and Hurlbut v. Sonora
Community Hospital (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 388, both of which hold that such
joint offers are void ab initio because it does not allow the offeree to individually
weigh the offer as to each plaintiff.
 
            P instead cites to Stallman v.
Bell (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 740 and Gonzalez v. Lew (2018) 20
Cal.App.5th 155, both of which upheld joint settlement offers as
valid.  After having reviewed the authority
cited by the parties, this Court concludes that the analysis under Gonzales
is the better one, not only because it is the most recent, but because that
opinion carefully analyzed the caselaw history on this issue (including Gilman
and Hurlbut).  Gonzales,
20 Cal.App.5th 161-172.  For
sure, Gonzales does not hold that joint plaintiff offers are always
valid; it only holds that they are not always invalid, as Dakovic now urges
this Court.  Gonzales stands for
the proposition that if the facts of a particular joint offer can readily show
whether the plaintiffs recovered more from the jury than their joint offer, the
joint offer should be recognized.  In Gonzales,
the heirs of the decedent jointly offered that defendant to settle for $1.5M
and the jury awarded a judgment for those joint plaintiffs of more than
$2.6M.  Id. at 170.  Here, the joint offer by all 3 plaintiffs was
for $499,999 and the jury awarded those plaintiffs collectively the net amount
of $2.9M, plainly proving that plaintiffs obtained a more favorable verdict at
trial than the joint settlement offer.  In
finding the validity of this joint offer, this Court agrees with Gonzales’
final analysis that “[i]f plaintiffs with disparate claims want to make a
global settlement offer which would put an end to the litigation at hand (and
work out the details among themselves), they should be encouraged to do
so.”  Id. at 172.
 
 
B.   
Specific
Cost Items
 
1.     Item 1: Filing and Motion Fees ($3,577.73)
 
            For the same reasons this Court
rejected JMM’s argument that costs should be apportioned amongst defendants,
this Court also rejects this same argument from Dakovic. Motion DENIED.
 
2.     Item 4: Deposition Costs ($56,007.41)
 
            Again, Dakovic’s argument that it
should not be responsible for deposition costs incurred that did not relate to
P’s prosecution of their action against Dakovic is rejected.  Costs are mandated to be awarded to a
prevailing plaintiff against all losing defendants no matter which defendant was
prejudiced by which particular cost.  However,
Dakovic is only responsible for the deposition costs incurred after it rejected
P’s 11/23/21 offer (with the exception of prejudgment interest which is
discussed below).  To the extent Dakovic
can prove to this Court at the hearing which of the deposition costs sought by
P’s pre-dated their 11/23/21 § 998 offer, those costs will be taxed.  Otherwise, their Motion to Tax will be DENIED
as to this item.    
 
3.     Item 5: Service of Process ($232.90)
 
            See above re: apportionment of costs.  Motion DENIED.
 
4.     Item 8: Expert Witness Fees ($114,354.79)
 
            As the § 998 offer was found valid,
expert witness fees are awardable so long as they were incurred after 11/23/21.
 Motion DENIED.
 
5.     Item 16: Other [prejudgment interest & Threadeo
AV services] ($1,001,978.43)
 
            Prejudgment interest will be awarded
starting after 2/25/20, the date of the first 
§
998 offer, per Ray v. Goodman (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 83, 91 (when
P awarded more than both prior § 998 offers to defendant, prejudgment interest
begins to run from the “first offer”).
 
            As set forth above, P’s Threadeo
costs were reasonable and necessary.  DENIED.
 
 
 
 
V.  
CONCLUSION
 
            Defendant JMM Motion to Tax P’s
Costs is GRANTED in the amount of $850, resulting in a net cost award
against JMM as follows:  (rounded off to
the nearest dollar)  
 
Item
1:             $7,280
Item
2:             $4,873
Item
4:           $79,418
Item
5:             $   637
Item
11:         $29,144
Item
14:          $3,570
Item
16:          $8,163
__________________
TOTAL       $133,085
 
 
            For Defendant Dakovic, its
motion to tax costs is GRANTED in the amount of $850 for including
improper deposition cancellation fees, but DENIED as to all other items.  Thus, in addition to the costs owed by JMM
($133,085), Dakovic will also be liable for additional § 998 costs as
follows: (rounded off to the nearest dollar)
 
Item
8:            $114,355
Item
16:          $ 993,816
 
Resulting
in a net cost judgment against Dakovic in the amount of $1,241,256.
 
The Court Clerk is to add
these amounts of costs levied against each respective Defendant to the final
judgment.
