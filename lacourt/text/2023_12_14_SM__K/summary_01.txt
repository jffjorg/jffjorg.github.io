And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion to tax costs filed by defendants JMM and Dakovic. The Plaintiff, Metzger, had sought to tax costs in the amount of $1,242,105.31. The Judge has granted the motion in part, denying the motion to tax certain cost items, and has denied the motion to tax other cost items.

The Judge has also ruled that the Plaintiff's § 998 offers were valid, and has awarded prejudgment interest and expert witness fees to the Plaintiff. The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to apportion costs among defendants, and has ruled that the costs are to be jointly and severally liable among the non-prevailing parties.

The Judge has also ruled that the Plaintiff's use of Threadeo was reasonable and necessary, and has denied the Defendant's motion to tax those costs. The Judge has awarded prejudgment interest starting from the date of the first § 998 offer, and has denied the Defendant's motion to tax the costs of service of process.

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion to tax costs in the amount of $133,085 against JMM, and has granted the Plaintiff's motion to tax costs in the amount of $1,241,256 against Dakovic. The Court Clerk is to add these amounts to the final judgment.
