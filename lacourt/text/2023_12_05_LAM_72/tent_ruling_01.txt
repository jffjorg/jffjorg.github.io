 Hearing Date:  December 5, 2023
 Calendar Number:  1



 
 
 
Plaintiff Global Financial Partners, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
moves for terminating sanctions against Defendants Brent Paysinger and Craig
Chisvin (collectively, the “Individual Defendants”). Plaintiff additionally
requests attorney’s fees in the amount of $4,522.50 and the re-imposition of monetary
sanctions previously imposed by the Court.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED IN PART as follows:
 
The Court ORDERS Brent Paysinger to pay previously imposed
sanctions in the amount of $1,391.25 no later than December 15, 2023.  
 
The Court ORDERS Craig Chisvin to pay previously imposed
sanctions in the amount of $1,496.25 no later than December 15, 2023.  
 
The Court SANCTIONS Brent Paysinger in the further amount of
$1,338.75.  Brent Paysinger shall pay
that additional amount to Plaintiff no later than December 15, 2023.  
 
The Court SANCTIONS Craig Chisvin in the further amount of $1,338.75.  Craig Chisvin shall pay that amount to
Plaintiff no later than December 15, 2023. 

 
Moreover, the Court admonishes and warns Defendants that if
they do not comply  with all outstanding
discovery orders and comply with the orders above, they may face terminating
sanctions.   
 
The Court continues this hearing to December 18, 2023 at
9:30 a.m. to review compliance with the Court’s outstanding orders.  If Defendants have not complied with the
Court Orders, the Court may issue terminating sanctions.
 
Plaintiff will give notice.
 
Background
 
This lawsuit arises from a cash advance agreement under
which Plaintiff advanced costs of litigation to Paysinger to pay for costs
associated with a personal injury action in which Paysinger was represented by
Chisvin and Chisvin, PLC (the “Law Firm”). Plaintiff alleges that Paysinger
failed to pay the funds owed as required by the agreement and that the Law Firm
and Chisvin has not fulfilled its obligation under a signed attorney
acknowledgment to promptly pay Plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff filed this action against the Chisvin, Paysinger,
and the Law Firm on January 12, 2021.
 
During the pendency of this action, Plaintiff has
successfully litigated a number of discovery motions and obtained sanctions
where the Individual Defendants.
 
On September 27, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion
to compel further discovery responses to requests for admissions and form
interrogatories served on both Chisvin and Paysinger. The Court sanctioned the
Chisvin and Paysinger each in the amount of $645.00 (the Court notes that
Plaintiff incorrectly calculated the award as $750 total, divided between the
Individual Defendants for $375 each).
 
On December 13, 2022, the Court sanctioned Chisvin and
Paysinger each in the amount of $423.75 for failing to comply with the
September 27, 2022 order to respond to the requests for admission. The Court
denied Plaintiff’s requests for an order compelling compliance and an order for
terminating sanctions because those types of relief are not available with
respect to requests for admission and because the Individual Defendants had
only violated one discovery order.
 
On December 15, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion
to compel Chisvin to respond to its requests for production and sanctioned
Chisvin in the amount of $427.50.
 
On December 20, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion
to compel Paysinger to respond to its requests for production and sanctioned
Paysinger in the amount of $322.50.
 
On October 5, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to
compel the depositions of Chisvin and Paysinger and did not award sanctions.
 
In total, the Court sanctioned Chisvin for $1,496.25 and
Paysinger for $1,391.25 in connection with these motions. The Individual
Defendants have still have not paid these sanctions.  (Evans Decl. ¶ 13.) Following these orders,
the Individual Defendants failed to provide responses to Plaintiff’s requests
for production and failed to appear for depositions. (Evans Decl. ¶ 13.)
 
Plaintiff filed this motion on November 1, 2023. On October
26, the Court advanced the hearing for the motion from December 19, 2023 to
December 5, 2023. Defendants did not file an opposition.  
 
Legal Standard
 
Where a party misuses the discovery process, courts have
discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions. (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 2023.010(g), 2030.290(c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative
Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) Misuse of the discovery
process includes failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or
disobeying a court order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.010(d), (g).)       
 
Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a
willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as
severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with
discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad
faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) Further, preventing
parties from presenting their cases on the merits is a drastic measure;
terminating sanctions should only be ordered when there has been previous
noncompliance with a rule or order and it appears a less severe sanction would
not be effective. (Link v. Cater (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1315,
1326.) 
 
Before any sanctions may be imposed the court must make an
express finding that there has been a willful failure of the party to serve the
required answers. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County
(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack of diligence may be deemed willful where
the party understood its obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to
comply. (Deyo v. Killbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 787.) The party
who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that
the failure was not willful. (Id. at 788.)  
 
Discussion
 
As discussed above, terminating sanctions are an exceptional
and severe remedy intended to punish the most egregious conduct. Here, there is
a definite pattern of discovery abuse by the individual defendants, including
noncompliance with multiple discovery orders. However, this behavior is not so
extreme as to warrant terminating sanctions outright; rather, the case law such
as Van Sickle appears to contemplate a steady increase in pressure on a
party to comply.
 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s request for terminating
sanctions at this time, but grants Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees as
set forth below. Furthermore, the Court admonishes Chisvin and Paysinger to
comply with the existing discovery orders and sanctions, and further admonishes
them that continued noncompliance may warrant terminating sanctions.  Finally, the Court continues this matter to December
18, 2023 at 9:30 a.m. (the start of trial) and may issue terminating sanctions
at that time if Defendants do not comply with court orders.
 
          Plaintiff
has not provided evidence as to the hourly rate of its attorney Ryan Evans. The
Court will therefore use the hourly rate of $525.00, which it held reasonable
for Evans in the December, 2022 minute orders, to calculate fees.
 
The Court awards fees for 5.1 hours in total on this matter:
.2 hours meeting and conferring with Defendants at the Final Status Conference
on October 26, 4.8 hours researching and drafting the Motion and supporting
papers, exhibits, and declarations, and .1 hours attending the hearing (reduced
from 3.5 hours claimed for reviewing any opposition, drafting a reply brief,
and preparing for and attending the hearing).
 
The total fee award is $2,677.5. Chisvin and Paysinger are
each to pay $1,338.75 of this amount.
