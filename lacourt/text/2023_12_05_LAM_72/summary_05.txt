And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between David Truong (the plaintiff) and Minh Hang Thi Nguyen (the defendant). The plaintiff is seeking an order compelling the defendant to serve supplemental responses to Form Interrogatories and to identify and produce documents responsive to those interrogatories.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion, ordering the defendant to provide complete responses to Form Interrogatory 17.1 within 30 days. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $2,640.00, which the defendant must pay to the plaintiff's counsel.

The judge notes that the defendant's responses to the Form Interrogatories were inadequate and that the parties had met and conferred over the issue but were unable to agree on the sufficiency of the responses. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not made a case for why the defendant is required to produce the documents identified by the plaintiff.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2017.010, 2031.220, 2031.230, and 2031.310, as well as Evidence Code section 210. The judge has broad discretion in determining the relevance of evidence and has applied that discretion in this case.
