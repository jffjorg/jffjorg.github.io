 Hearing Date:  December 5, 2023
 Calendar Number:  4



 
 
 
Defendant Coast National Insurance Company (“Defendant”)
moves for an order for terminating sanctions against Plaintiffs Melita Suazo
and Pearl Campos (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).
 
The Court DENIES Defendants’ motion at the present
time.   However, the Court continues this
hearing to February 15, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. 
The Court orders Plaintiffs to appear at the hearing either personally
or through LA CourtConnect.
 
The Court admonishes Plaintiffs to comply with all
outstanding Court orders, including the orders to appear for deposition.  Defendant cannot prepare for trial if
Plaintiffs do not sit for deposition.  
If Plaintiffs fail to appear for deposition and comply with other Court
orders by February 15, 2024, the Court may issue terminating sanctions.
 
Defendant shall give notice. 


 
 
 
 
Background
 
Plaintiffs filed this action on April 1, 2021, stating claims
for (1) personal injury and property damages, (2) reformation or revision of a
written instrument; (3) specific performance of a written instrument; (4)
breach of contract; (5) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing; and (6) negligent performance of a contract.
 
This action arises out of a vehicular collision where Suazo
was operating the vehicle of Campos, the latter of whom was the named insured
on a policy with Coast National. Plaintiffs allege that the subject insurance
contract fails to reflect the true intent of the parties and should instead
provide uninsured motorist coverage for bodily injuries.
 
Plaintiffs Suazo and Campos were both served with notices of
depositions on March 2, 2023, with the depositions to take place on March 21,
2023. Both parties met and conferred, resulting in Coast National serving Suazo
and Campos on March 17, 2023 with amended notices of deposition for April 20
and 21, 2023 respectively.
 
Plaintiffs did not appear for their depositions. Defendant
filed a motion to compel, which the Court granted on September 7, 2023.
Plaintiffs were ordered to appear for their depositions and to pay monetary sanctions
within 20 days of the hearing. Plaintiffs have not paid the ordered monetary
sanctions.
 
On September 11, Plaintiffs were served with second amended
notices of deposition for September 27, 2023. Counsel for Coast National
included a letter alongside the notices indicating that Plaintiffs could
provide any earlier dates upon which Plaintiffs would be available if the
noticed date did not work. Plaintiffs never provided alternate dates.
 
Neither Plaintiff appeared for their deposition on September
27, 2023, and certificates of non-appearance were taken.
 
Coast National filed this motion on October 10, 2023. No
opposition was filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
Where a party misuses the discovery process, courts have
discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions. (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 2023.010(g), 2030.290(c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative
Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) Misuse of the discovery
process includes failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or
disobeying a court order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.010(d), (g).)       
 
Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a
willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as
severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with
discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad
faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) Further, preventing
parties from presenting their cases on the merits is a drastic measure;
terminating sanctions should only be ordered when there has been previous
noncompliance with a rule or order and it appears a less severe sanction would
not be effective. (Link v. Cater (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1315,
1326.) 
 
Before any sanctions may be imposed the court must make an
express finding that there has been a willful failure of the party to serve the
required answers. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County
(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack of diligence may be deemed willful where
the party understood its obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to
comply. (Deyo v. Killbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 787.) The party
who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that
the failure was not willful. Id. at 788.)  
 
 
Discussion
 
As discussed above, terminating sanctions are an exceptional
and severe remedy intended to punish the most egregious conduct. Here, each
Plaintiff has only violated one discovery order. This behavior, while clearly
abuse of the discovery process, standing alone is not yet grounds for
terminating sanctions.  Case law such as Van
Sickle appears to contemplate a steady increase in pressure on a party to
comply.
 
But Defendants cannot prepare for trial, which is rapidly
approaching, unless Plaintiffs comply with the Court orders, including the one
that requires them to sit for deposition. 
Instead of issuing sanctions, the Court admonishes the Plaintiffs to
comply with prior orders.
 
The Court continues this matter to February 15, 2024 at 8:30
a.m.  Failure to comply with prior court
orders by that time may lead to the imposition of terminating sanctions.  
 
The Court orders both Plaintiffs to appear at the February
15, 2024 hearing either in person or by LA CourtConnect.  
 
The Court denies Coast National’s request for terminating
sanctions. The Court, however, continues this matter to February 15, 2023 at
8:30 a.m.
