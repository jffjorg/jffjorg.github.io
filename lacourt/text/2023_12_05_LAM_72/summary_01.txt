And here is the English summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants in part plaintiff Global Financial Partners, Inc.'s motion for terminating sanctions against defendants Brent Paysinger and Craig Chisvin. The Court orders the Individual Defendants to pay previously imposed sanctions and sanctions them further in the amount of $1,338.75 each. The Court admonishes the defendants to comply with outstanding discovery orders and warns that continued noncompliance may warrant terminating sanctions. The Court also grants plaintiff's request for attorney's fees in the amount of $2,677.50, to be split equally between the Individual Defendants. The hearing is continued to December 18, 2023, at which time the Court may issue terminating sanctions if the defendants do not comply with court orders.
