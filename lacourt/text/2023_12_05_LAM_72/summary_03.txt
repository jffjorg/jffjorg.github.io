Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for terminating sanctions brought by Defendant Coast National Insurance Company against Plaintiffs Melita Suazo and Pearl Campos is denied. However, the Judge continues the hearing to February 15, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Judge orders the Plaintiffs to appear at the hearing either in person or through LA CourtConnect and admonishes them to comply with all outstanding Court orders, including the orders to appear for deposition. If the Plaintiffs fail to comply with these orders, the Court may issue terminating sanctions. The Judge notes that terminating sanctions are a severe remedy intended to punish egregious conduct, but in this case, the Plaintiffs have only violated one discovery order, and the Court will not impose sanctions at this time.
