And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to interrogatories and to deem requests for admission admitted. The defendant, Jennifer Vasquez, is ordered to serve verified responses to the interrogatories without objection within 20 days of the order. Additionally, the defendant is ordered to pay sanctions of $795.00 to the plaintiff's counsel. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to serve responses constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and is subject to sanctions.
