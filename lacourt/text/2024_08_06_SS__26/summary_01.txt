And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the default and default judgment. The defendant had filed the motion on July 2, 2024, after the default was entered on January 24, 2024, and the default judgment was entered on February 14, 2024. The judge found that the motion was not timely, as it was filed more than five months after the default was entered, and did not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that the defendant was not served with the summons and complaint. The judge also found that the motion did not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, which requires an affidavit showing that the party's lack of actual notice was not caused by their own avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. Finally, the judge noted that the motion did not demonstrate that the entry of default or default judgment was void or due to a clerical error.
