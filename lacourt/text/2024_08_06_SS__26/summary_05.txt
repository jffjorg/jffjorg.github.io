And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the petition to confirm arbitration award to November 5, 2024, at 8:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The petitioner, Daniel Vergara, must file and serve proof of service of the petition and notice of the new hearing date by October 8, 2024. If this requirement is not met, the petition may be dismissed. The court is continuing the petition due to the lack of proof of service of the petition and notice of hearing, which is required by statute.
