Exchange v. Ortega, et al.MOTION
TO QUASH SERVICE(CCP § 418.10)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Sebastian Ortega’s
Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint is GRANTED.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 

On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff Interinsurance
Exchange of the Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this
action against Defendant Sebastian Ortega (“Defendant”). Plaintiff filed proof
of substitute service on March 12, 2024. On May 9, 2024, the Court granted
Defendant’s first Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint. (Minute
Order, 05/09/24.)
 
Plaintiff filed a proof of service
by substitute service on June 11, 2024. Defendant now brings another Motion to
Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint, filed on July 10, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to quash service
of the Summons and Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff did not
sub-serve him. The Motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 418.10, which states: “A defendant, on or
before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that
the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for
one or more of the following purposes: To quash service of summons on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1),
emphasis added.) The Motion is timely brought within 30 days of the purported
service. 
 
Where service is challenged, the
burden is on the plaintiff to prove the facts requisite to an effective
service. “When a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the
ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove
the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,
413; see also Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160.) However,
a proof of service containing a declaration from a registered process server
invokes a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of
the facts stated in the return. (Cal. Evid. Code, § 647; see American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.)
 
The proof of substitute service is
attested to by a registered process server, thereby placing the burden on
Defendant to overcome the presumption of truth in the return of service. (Proof
of Service, filed 03/12/24, ¶7.) The proof of service states that Defendant was
served by leaving the papers at 20117 Bedford Canyon Rd., Corona, CA on May
31, 2024 with ALFONSO “John Doe” (Refused Last Name), Co-Occupant Description:
Hispanic, MaIe, 50+ yrs oId, 5’ 7” tall, 200+ lbs., black hair.” (Id. at
¶5.) Defendant submits a declaration stating that he
did not receive any court papers at his residence (the service address) on May
30, 2024 or any date thereafter. (Motion, Ortega Decl., ¶3.) Nor does Plaintiff
know anyone named “Alfonso” or anyone fitting the description in the proof of
service who was at his residence or had permission to be there. (Id. at
¶¶4-5.) 
 
As with Defendant’s first Motion
to Quash Service, this declaration is sufficient to overcome the presumption of
truth in the proof of service and place the burden on Plaintiff to demonstrate
that service occurred as stated. However, no opposition has been filed.
Therefore, Defendant has demonstrated grounds to quash service of the Summons
and Complaint as attempted on May 31, 2024.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Sebastian Ortega’s Motion
to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint is GRANTED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
