ANALYSIS: 
            
Plaintiff American Contractors Indemnity Company (“Plaintiff”) brought this action for breach of an indemnity
agreement against Defendant Jeffrey
Irvine Wiscomb (“Defendant”) on March 1,
2023. Defendant filed an answer in properia persona on March 27, 2023. On
May 14, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and
entered judgment in Plaintiff’s favor on the same date. (Minute Order, 05/14/24;
Judgment, 05/14/24.) Notice of Entry of Judgment was served on Defendant on May
21, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees and
Costs on June 4, 2024. To date, no opposition has been filed.
 
Discussion
 
A prevailing party is entitled to recover
costs, including attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1032, subd. (a)(4); § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(A).) Similarly, Code of Civil
Procedure section 1717 provides that attorneys’ fees and costs shall be awarded
to the prevailing party in an action on a contract, where the contract
specifically provides for attorneys’ fees and costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1717,
subd. (a).) 
 
A motion for attorney’s fees must be filed
and served with the time for filing a notice of appeal under Cal. Rules of
Court Rule 8.822. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1702(a).) Cal. Rules of Court
Rule 8.822 states that an attorneys’ fees motion must be filed within either
(1) 30 days after the trial court clerk served the party filing the motion with
notice of entry of judgment; or (2) 90 days after entry of judgment. (Cal.
Rules of Court 8.822(1).) The instant motion was timely filed on June 4, 2024. 
 
It is undisputed that Plaintiff is the
prevailing party in this action, as the party in whose favor the summary
judgment was granted and judgment has been entered. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
1032, subd. (a)(4).) Accordingly, it is entitled to recover its costs under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a). It is also entitled to
recovery its attorneys’ fees if such recovery is provided for in the contract
at issue. The parties’ contract provides for recovery of attorney’s fees by the
prevailing party in the event of any litigation arising out of or relating to
the indemnity agreement. (Motion, Kim Decl., Exh. 1, ¶2.) Therefore, Plaintiff
is entitled to recover its attorney’s fees as the prevailing party.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel billed its attorneys’
work between $275.00 and $375.00 per hour, and paralegals’ time at $125.00 to
$205.00 per hour. (Id. at ¶¶12-13 and Exh. 3.) Plaintiff has incurred
attorneys’ fees of $3,564.50. (Id.
at ¶13 and Exh. 3.) Although the supporting declaration and billing ledgers do
not indicate exactly how many hours of time Plaintiff’s counsel billed on this
action, at an average billing rate of $325.00, Plaintiff’s counsel billed
approximately 10.9 hours on this matter. (Id. at Exh. 3.) This is a
reasonable number of hours to spend on a straightforward case in which
Plaintiff prevailed on an unopposed motion for summary judgment. In failing to
oppose the instant motion, Defendant offers no reason to find this amount of
time was excessive or unreasonable. The request for an additional $487.50
in fees to review the opposition and
prepare a reply, however, should be denied as no opposition or reply were
filed. (See id. at ¶14.) 
 
Plaintiff also requests costs of $970.86 for its filing and service fees in this action. (Memorandum of Costs,
filed 05/21/24.) To recover a cost, it must be reasonably necessary to
the litigation and reasonable in amount. (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.) If the items appearing in a
cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to
tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v.
California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.) The filing and service fees appear reasonable
and are not challenged by a motion to tax costs. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff American Contractors Indemnity Company’s Motion to
be Deemed Prevailing and for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT
OF $3,564.50 ATTORNEY’S FEES AND
$970.86 COSTS.
