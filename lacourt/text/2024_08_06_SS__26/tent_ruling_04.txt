ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Fred Loya Insurance Company (“Defendant”)
propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Admission, Set One,
on Defendant Jennifer Vasquez (“Defendant”) on February 14, 2024. (Motions,
Mendelson Decl., Exh. 1.) Despite a meet and confer effort, Defendant has not
served responses as of the filing of the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses
to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; (2) Motion to Deem
Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and Request for Sanctions, on May
21, 2024. (Id. at ¶¶4-5 and Exh. B.) As of the filing of these Motions,
no responses have been served. (Id. ¶5.) 
 
Based on Defendant’s failure to serve initial responses to
the discovery, the Motions to compel responses to interrogatories, and to deem
admissions admitted, are granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.)
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to
compel initial responses or deem admissions admitted can be filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought any time
after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290; 2033.280.) Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling
Defendant to serve verified responses to the interrogatories without
objections. The Court also deems the requests for admission admitted against
Defendant.
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for
these straightforward and unopposed motions. Sanctions are awarded against
Defendant in the amount of $795.00 based on 1.5 hours of attorney time billed
at $450.00 per hour, plus $60.00 in filing fees per motion. (Motions, Mendelson Decl.,
¶5.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Fred Loya Insurance Company’s (1) Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2)
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and Request for
Sanctions, are GRANTED. DEFENDANT JENNIFER VASQUEZ IS TO SERVE VERIFIED
RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE INTERROGATORIES WITHIN 20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF
THIS ORDER. ALSO WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER, DEFENDANT JENNIFER VASQUEZ IS
PAY SANCTIONS OF $795.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL.
