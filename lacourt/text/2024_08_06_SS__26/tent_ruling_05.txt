ANALYSIS:
 
On April 2, 2024, Petitioner Daniel Vergara (“Petitioner”)
filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (the “Petition”)
against Respondent Garbiel Olin (“Respondent”). No proof of service of, nor
opposition to, the Petition has been filed to date.
 
 
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects
the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be
served on Respondents “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for
the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
No proof of service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing
has been filed as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4. The
arbitration agreement does not provide for the manner of service of the
Petition and Notice of Hearing, which therefore must be served in the manner of
service for a summons. (Pet., Attachment 4(b).) Accordingly, the Court finds that the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 1290.4 are not satisfied.
