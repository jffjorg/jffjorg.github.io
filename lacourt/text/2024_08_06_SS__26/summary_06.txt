And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant Sebastian Ortega's Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint. The motion is timely and brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10, which allows a defendant to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over the defendant. The burden is on the plaintiff to prove the facts requisite to an effective service, and a proof of service containing a declaration from a registered process server invokes a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of the facts stated in the return. In this case, the proof of substitute service was attested to by a registered process server, but Defendant's declaration stating that he did not receive any court papers at his residence is sufficient to overcome the presumption of truth in the proof of service and place the burden on the plaintiff to demonstrate that service occurred as stated. Since no opposition has been filed, Defendant has demonstrated grounds to quash service of the Summons and Complaint as attempted on May 31, 2024.
