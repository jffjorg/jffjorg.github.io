The judge notes that the agreement's language is unclear and does not explicitly mention Langley Productions. The judge also points out that there is no evidence that Morgan Langley was president at the time he executed the agreement. As a result, the judge denies the motion for summary adjudication for COPS Racing, but the analysis applies equally to Langley Productions.
