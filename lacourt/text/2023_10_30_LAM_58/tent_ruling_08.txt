[1]           Because the delayed
discovery doctrine effectively applies to either statute of limitation, the reliance
on either three-year statute has the same result. 


[2]           Only in its Reply, Defendant GM argues the TAC
fails to allege compliance with the notice requirements of Civil Code section
1782.
 
If a
plaintiff sues for damages under the CLRA, she must send a written notice of
the claim to the defendant thirty days before filing suit “by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, to the place where the transaction
occurred or to the person's principal place of business within California.”
(Civ. Code, § 1782, subd. (a).) However, a claim for injunctive relief brought
under Section 1770 “may be commenced without compliance with subdivision (a).”
(Civ. Code, § 1782, subd. (d).) That is, the notice requirement applies only
to claims for damages. (Civ. Code, § 1782, subd. (d), [“An action for
injunctive relief brough under the specific provisions of Section 1770 may be
commenced without compliance with subdivision (a).”].) Furthermore, “[n]ot less
than 30 days after the commencement of an action for injunctive relief,” a
plaintiff may amend their complaint to include a request for damages “after
compliance with subdivision (a).” (Id.)


Here, Plaintiff’s CLRA claim does
not seek damages. (TAC ¶ 95 [“Plaintiff is entitled to equitable and injunctive
relief under the CLRA.”].) As the CLRA claim does not seek relief besides
equitable and injunctive relief, Plaintiff is not required to allege compliance
with Section 1782, subdivision (a).
