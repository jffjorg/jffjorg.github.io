Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication and has made a tentative ruling. The motion for summary judgment is denied, but the motion for summary adjudication is granted in part and denied in part.

Morgan Langley, one of the defendants, executed a General Waiver, Release, Consent, and Indemnification Agreement, which requires him to defend and indemnify Promote Mexico, LLC, the race organizer, against any claims related to the 2018 Baja 1000 Race. The judge has determined that this agreement applies to third-party claims, including the plaintiff's claims against Promote Mexico.

The judge has also ruled on the scope of the Inbursa Policy, an insurance policy that covers certain damages related to the race. The policy excludes damages incurred when the event vehicle is outside of the official course of the event. The judge has determined that the staging area where the accident occurred is a triable issue of material fact, and therefore, the summary adjudication motion is denied on issues 5-7.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after further argument and evidence is presented.
