Case
Name:                Anderson Real Estate Group v. Ticehurst
Case
No.:                    22STCV41082
Matter:                        Motion for Leave to File
Second Amended Complaint
Moving
Party:             Plaintiff Anderson Real
Estate Group
Opposing
Party:          Defendants Coralyn
Wahlberg, Claudia Pardon, and Think Re Management, Inc.

Tentative Ruling:      The Motion
for Leave to File the Second Amended Complaint is granted. 

 
            This is an action for breach of contract arising
from real estate commissions. In the Complaint, Plaintiffs Jeffrey H.
Anderson and Anderson Real Estate Group (Plaintiffs) allege that Defendant KJ
Ticehurst owes Plaintiffs $67,729.75 in commission arising from her Team Member
Agreement – Buyer Specialist (Agreement) with Plaintiffs; Plaintiffs further
allege Defendants Coralyn Wahlberg, Claudia Pardon, and Think Re Management,
Inc. (collectively, Defendants Think) engaged in fraudulent actions to prevent
Plaintiffs’ collection of these real
estate commissions. 
 
The Complaint was
filed by Plaintiffs Jeffrey H. Anderson and Anderson
Real Estate Group on December 30, 2022. On June 12, 2023, Defendants
Coralyn Wahlberg, Claudia Pardon, and Think Re Management, Inc. (Defendants)
demurred to the Complaint. Plaintiffs opposed the demurrer. The Court sustained
with leave to amend the Demurrer to the Complaint.
 
On August 18,
2018, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint alleging causes of action for (1.)
breach of contract, (2.) breach of contract, (3.) fraud (concealment), (4.)
tortious interference with contract, (5.) misappropriation of trade secrets,
and (6.) tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. 
 
On September 13, Defendants
filed a demurrer and motion to strike portions of the FAC. 
 
Before the
opposition to the demurrer was due, on September 28, 203, Plaintiff Jeffrey H.
Anderson filed a motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. Defendants
oppose the motion for leave to amend. The motion for leave to file a Second
Amended Complaint is granted. 
 
Legal Standard
            The court may, in furtherance of justice,
allow a party to amend any pleading upon any terms as may be proper. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 473, subd. (a), 576.) Courts liberally grant leave to amend based on
a strong policy favoring resolution of all disputes between parties in the same
case. (Nestle v. Santa Monica (1972)
6 Cal.3d 920, 939; Morgan v. Superior
Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Thus, requests for leave to amend
generally will be granted unless the party seeking to amend has been dilatory
in bringing the proposed amendment, and the delay will cause prejudice to the
opposing party if leave to amend is permitted. (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490; see also Armenta
ex rel. City of Burbank (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 636, 642 [“instances
justifying the court’s denial of leave to amend are rare.”].)  Absent prejudice, delay alone is insufficient
to deny leave to amend. (Higgins v. Del
Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565.)
A party requesting leave to amend must
state what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted and
added, as well as specify where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
changes are located. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a)(1)-(3).) The moving
party must also attach the proposed amended pleading with a declaration by
counsel, describing (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is
necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations
were discovered; and (4) why the request was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(b)(1)-(4).)  
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
Anderson Real Estate Group moves for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. Plaintiff
does not seek to add any causes of action to the amended pleading; instead, the
SAC removes the second cause of action for breach of contract, removes
Plaintiff Jeffery H. Anderson as a plaintiff, and seeks to clarify existing
causes of action – including which causes of action are alleged as to which
Defendants and by adding alter ego allegations concerning Defendants. 
 
            Further,
the moving papers contend that Plaintiff only recently discovered the facts prompting
this amendment. (Coleman Decl., ¶¶ 6-9.) Plaintiff also submits a redlined copy
of the proposed SAC, in compliance with CRC, Rule 3.1324, subdivision (a).
(Coleman Decl., ¶¶ 12-13, Exs. A-B.)
 
            In
opposition, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not complied with California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, explaining that Plaintiff’s evidence is inadequate
to demonstrate newly discovered facts to support an amendment or why this
amendment was not made earlier . 
 
            Plaintiff’s
explanation regarding when and how purportedly new facts were discovered are vague.
Nonetheless, a court’s discretion must be exercised liberally to permit
amendment of the pleadings. (Mabie v.
Hyatt (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 581, 596.) The policy favoring amendment is so
strong that it is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be
justified: “If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the
motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission
to amend; and, where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the
right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is
not only error but an abuse of discretion.” (Morgan v. Sup. Ct. (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530; Mabie, supra, 61 Cal.App.4th at 596.)
 
Even assuming some
delay by Plaintiff in amending, the delay here is insignificant where the
Complaint was filed in December 2022 and trial is not set until April 2025. Moreover, Defendants have not demonstrated any
prejudice will result from these minor amendments. (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [“Even if
[there was unreasonable delay], it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave to
amend where the opposing party was not misled or prejudiced by the amendment.”].)
Leave to amend should be denied when the proposed amendment will
unfairly prejudice the defendant.(Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996)
48 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) There is prejudice if the amendment results in the
loss of critical evidence, adds costs of preparation, and increases the burden
of discovery.  (Id. at pp.
486-488.) Thus, denial of leave to amend is appropriate if the additional
causes of action would change the “tenor and complexity of the complaint from
its original focus.” (Id. at p. 487.)
 
For example, courts have found prejudice
where an amendment proposed days before trial would significantly change the
nature of the case, as explained in Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1024. (47 Cal.App.4th  at pp. 487-488 [explaining that “adding the new cause of action would have
changed the tenor and complexity of the complaint from its original focus”
shortly before trial, “and the only way to avoid prejudice to the opposing
party is to continue the trial date to allow further discovery, refusal of
leave to amend cannot be an abuse of discretion”]; see also Associated Tel.
Co. v. Greenman (1952) 111 Cal.App.2d 193, 196-197 [trial court acted
within its discretion to deny leave to amend by considering potential prejudice
to the defendant resulting from the plaintiff's attempt to add a new theory a
few days before trial].) Such circumstances are not present here. 
 
            Finally, Defendants argue
that, even with these amendments, the SAC fails to state a claim. A motion for
leave to amend is not the appropriate vehicle for determining the sufficiency
of the pleadings. (See e.g., California
Casualty General Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274,
280-81 [disapproved on other grounds].) Defendants may bring a separate motion
by which to challenge the newly amended pleading.
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
the Court grants leave to Plaintiff to file the Second Amended Complaint. Plaintiff
is ordered to file the Second Amended Complaint on or before November 6, 2023.
