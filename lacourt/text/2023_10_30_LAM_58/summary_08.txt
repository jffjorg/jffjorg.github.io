And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the application of the delayed discovery doctrine to the plaintiff's claim, which seeks only equitable and injunctive relief under the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA). The defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to allege compliance with the notice requirements of Civil Code section 1782, which requires a written notice of the claim to be sent to the defendant 30 days before filing suit. However, the judge finds that this section only applies to claims for damages, and since the plaintiff's claim does not seek damages, the notice requirement does not apply. The judge is therefore inclined to rule that the plaintiff's failure to allege compliance with Section 1782, subdivision (a) is not a fatal flaw in the complaint.
