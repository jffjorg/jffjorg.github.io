[1]            It is
unclear whether COPS Defendants are arguing that COPS Racing and Langley Productions
were both not a party to the Agreement or only Langley Productions was not a
party. (Reply 3:6-17.) The Opposition refers only to Langley Productions but
the Responsive Separate Statement refers to both Langley Productions and Cops Racing.
However, either way, the analysis for COPS Racing applies for the same reasons as
Langley Productions.


[2]            The Agreement
purports to bind Morgan Langley’s “assigns, spouse, heirs, beneficiaries,
agents, guardians, legal representatives, team members, staff, family and
individuals affiliated with my race efforts . . ..” Promote Mexico does not
argue this language would encompass Langley Production.
  


[3]            There
is no evidence that Morgan Langley was president at the time he executed the
Agreement. 


[4]            These
claims are also brought by COPS Racing as well but the motion for summary
adjudication is denied as to COPS Racing for the reasons discussed above.
