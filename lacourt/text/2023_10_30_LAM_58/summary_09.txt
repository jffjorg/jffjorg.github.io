And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Bruce G. Iwasaki, granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Anderson Real Estate Group, seeks to amend its original complaint by removing the second cause of action for breach of contract, removing Jeffrey H. Anderson as a plaintiff, and clarifying existing causes of action. The defendants, Ticehurst, Wahlberg, Pardon, and Think Re Management, Inc., oppose the motion, arguing that the plaintiff has not complied with the California Rules of Court and that the amendment would unfairly prejudice the defendants. However, the court finds that the delay in amending the complaint is insignificant and that the defendants have not demonstrated any prejudice. The court grants leave to the plaintiff to file the Second Amended Complaint and orders the plaintiff to file it by November 6, 2023.
