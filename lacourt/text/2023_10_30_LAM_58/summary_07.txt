**Tentative Ruling**

* The demurrer to the fifth cause of action (violation of the CLRA) is sustained without leave to amend.
* The motion to strike the request for punitive damages is moot.

**Reasoning**

* The Court finds that the statute of limitations has expired for the CLRA claim, and the allegations are insufficient to state a claim.
* The Court also finds that the allegations are insufficient to demonstrate a duty to disclose by GM.
* The motion to strike the request for punitive damages is moot because there is no underlying claim to support the request.
