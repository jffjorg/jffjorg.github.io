Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Elliot Minge Brown and Deborah Ali Kelson v. General Motors LLC, Keyes Chevrolet, and Does 1-10. The plaintiffs purchased a 2022 Chevrolet Bolt from Keyes Chevrolet and filed a Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act lawsuit against General Motors LLC. General Motors LLC filed a demurrer and a motion to strike the prayer for exemplary or punitive damages.

The court has overruled General Motors LLC's demurrer and denied its motion to strike. The court found that the plaintiffs' allegations of fraud and breach of warranty were sufficient to state a cause of action. The court also found that the plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages was supported by the allegations of fraud.

The court has ordered General Motors LLC to file and serve its answer to the First Amended Complaint within 20 days.
