MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION
ATTENDANCE AND PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS BY DEFENDANT SANTA MONICA BMW’S PERSON
MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE, AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS

Los Angeles Superior
Court Case # 23CHCV00711

 
Motion
filed: 11/13/23
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Sorush Sharif (“Plaintiff”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Santa Monica BMW
(“Defendant”)
NOTICE: OK¿¿ 
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court to compel the attendance of Defendant’s Person Most
Knowledgeable and production of documents, and to impose monetary sanctions
against Defendant and its attorney of record in the amount of $3,554.01. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED IN PART. The Request for Monetary Sanctions is DENIED. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Sorush Sharif (“Plaintiff”) filed this
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act lawsuit over alleged defects in his 2021 BMW
430i Coupe (the “Vehicle”), which was manufactured by Defendant BMW of North
America, LLC (“BMW NA”). Plaintiff leased the Vehicle in new condition on March
6, 2021, from Crevier BMW Santa Ana, with manufacturer’s express warranty.  Defendant Santa Monica BMW (“SM BMW”) is an
authorized service and repair facility of BMW NA.
 
On June 12, 2023, Plaintiff initiated the action against
Defendants BMW NA, SM BMW, (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 50.
The Complaint alleges four causes of action: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act
– Breach of Express Warranty, (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of
Implied Warranty; (3) Violation of the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2(b), and
(4) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Section 1796.5. Subsequently, Defendants
filed their Answer to the Complaint on September 20, 2023.
 
On November 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Compel Deposition Attendance and Production of Documents
by Defendant SM BMW’s person most knowledgeable (“PMK”).
 
On April 9, 2024, SM BMW filed its
Objection. Subsequently, Plaintiff filed their Reply on April 18, 2024. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
To compel the deposition of a
party to an action or its officer, director, managing agent, or employee, the
deposing party need only serve a notice in compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.240. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) Nothing
further is needed. If, after service of the deposition notice, the deponent
fails to appear “without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410
. . .” the deposing party may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony. (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
 
An
objection under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410 is one that is
written, made “at least three calendar days prior to the date for which the
deposition is scheduled,” and pertains to an “error or irregularity” with the
notice itself. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a).) The procedure for a
deponent who seeks to narrow the scope of a discovery request is to move for a
protective order. (Id., § 2025.420, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Procedural
Requirements
 
1.     
Meet and Confer
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.450 subdivision (b)(2) provides, in part, that “[t]he motion shall
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration ... or, when the deponent fails
to attend the deposition and produce the documents ... by declaration stating
that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.” 
 
“A meet and confer
declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)
 
Here, Plaintiff served his
first deposition notice for the deposition of SM BMW’s PMK on September 13,
2023, for a deposition date of October 23, 2023. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. “1.”)
Defendant SM BMW served its objection to the noticed deposition on October 18,
2023, making objections to each of the 26 categories of subject matter which
the PMK was to be examined on. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. “3.”) Additionally,
Plaintiff’s counsel Michael Saeedian attests that Defendant SM BMW did not
provide alternative dates. (Ibid.)
 
Following this, Plaintiff’s
counsel requested an alternative deposition date by October 27, 2023. (Saeedian
Decl., ¶ 6.) On November 8, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent an email follow-up
to Defendants’ counsel, seeking to obtain alternate dates for deposition. (Id.,
¶ 7.) Despite this effort, Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr. Saeedian, states in his
declaration that “[t]o date, the defendant has provided no good cause for its
refusal to produce a witness for deposition as requested by the plaintiff.” (Id.,
¶¶ 5, 7.) 
 
Here, the meet and confer is
required to address two issues: scheduling and SM BMW’s objections. Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040, “[the] meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”
However, the declaration is only evident about the Plaintiff’s attempt to
resolve the scheduling issue by requesting the Defendant to provide two
alternative deposition dates. (Saeedian Decl., ¶¶ 4, 6, 7, Ex.”4,” “5.”)
 
The absence of a
code-compliant declaration detailing Plaintiff meet and confer with Defendant
to resolve the dispute over Defendant’s written objections to the notice of
deposition is evident that the meet and confer requirements are not fully
satisfied.
 
2.     
Separate
Statement
 
“Any motion involving the
content of a discovery request or the responses to such a request must be
accompanied by a separate statement. The motions that require a separate
statement include a motion: ... (5) To compel or to quash the production of
documents or tangible things at a deposition[.]” (Cal. Rules of Court rule
3.1345 (a)(5).) (Underlines added.) 
 
Here, the motion seeks to compel
the attendance of Defendant’s Person Most Knowledgeable and production of
documents at the deposition, mandating a separate
statement. However, the case files reflect no separate statement filed with
regard to the instant Motion. Consequently, the moving papers are incomplete. 
 
Accordingly, the Court notes
that the moving party has not complied with required procedural requirements,
as discussed above. 
 
B.    
Motion to
Compel Deposition Attendance 
 
SM BMW states, in its
Opposition, that “[it] has agreed to offer a proposed a date to set the PMK
deposition” and that “Santa Monica BMW will agree to produce its Person Most
Knowledgeable for deposition.” (Opp’n., at 2, Don Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
Based on this record, the
Motion on this issue is GRANTED. 
 
C.   
Production
of Documents
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.450 subdivision (b)(1) provides that “[t]he motion [submitted
under subdivision (a)] shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”
 
Plaintiff submits the Motion
under the authority of Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 subdivision (a),
which premised that the responding did not serve valid responses. (Ibid.) Here,
SM BMW served an objection to the notice deposition on October 18, 2023.
(Saeedian Decl., ¶ 5.) Consequently, Plaintiff must meet the threshold burden to
demonstrate that SM BMW’s objections are invalid. 
 
As previously discussed,
Plaintiff’s moving papers are incomplete due to the absence of a separate
statement for the Court’s consideration in resolving the discovery disputes. A
statement must be “full and complete so that no person is required to review
any other document in order to determine the full request and full response”,
and a statement of “the factual and legal reasons” for compelling the
production. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345 (c).)
 
Therefore, Plaintiff has not
fulfilled his burden to present statements of factual and legal arguments as to
each of SM BMW’s objections served on October 18, 2023. 
 
Accordingly, the Court
DENIES the Motion to compel the production of documents at the deposition.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS
IN PART the Motion.
 
D.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests the Court to impose monetary
sanctions under the authority of Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480,
subdivision (j), and section 2025.450, subdivision (g)(1). 
 
“[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel an answer or production,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (j).)
 
Here, the authority under Code of City Procedure, section
2025.480, subdivision (j) is inapplicable as the Court has previously concluded
that the Motion is GRANTED IN PART, and DENIED IN PART.
 
Furthermore, the Court has analyzed the procedural
deficiencies, including insufficient meet and confer and absence of a separate
statement. Consequently, in view of the totality of the circumstances, the
Court refrains from imposing monetary sanctions.
 
Therefore, the Request for
Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Attendance of Defendant Santa Monica BMW’s Person Most Knowledgeable is GRANTED.
 
Santa Monica BMW is ordered to produce its Person Most
Knowledgeable at a deposition to be scheduled by Plaintiff. Plaintiff must
provide at least ten days’ notice of the deposition, with extended notice as
applicable under Code of Civil Procedure.
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Production of Documents at deposition is DENIED.
 
Plaintiff’s
Request for Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.

No opposing papers have been received
by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
To compel the deposition of a
party to an action or its officer, director, managing agent, or employee, the
deposing party need only serve a notice in compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.240. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) Nothing
further is needed. If, after service of the deposition notice, the deponent
fails to appear “without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410
. . .” the deposing party may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony. (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
 
An
objection under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410 is one that is
written, made “at least three calendar days prior to the date for which the
deposition is scheduled,” and pertains to an “error or irregularity” with the
notice itself. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a).) The procedure for a
deponent who seeks to narrow the scope of a discovery request is to move for a
protective order. (Id., § 2025.420, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Procedural
Requirements
 
1.     
Meet and Confer
 
No meet and confer is required to
compel initial deposition attendance. Instead, there must be a declaration
showing that moving party inquired about the nonappearance.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§2025.450, subd., (b)(2).)¿¿"Implicit in the requirement that counsel
contact the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance is a requirement that
counsel listen to the reasons offered and make a good faith attempt to resolve
the issue," including by rescheduling.¿(Leko v. Cornerstone Bldg.
Inspection Serv. (2001) 86 Cal. App. 4th 1109, 1124.)
 
Here, Plaintiff served his
first deposition notice for the deposition of BMW NA’s PMK on September 13,
2023, for a deposition date of October 20, 2023. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. “1.”)
Defendant BMW NA did not serve any objections nor did it produce its PMK.
(Saeedian Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. “4.”) Following this, Plaintiff’s counsel requested
an alternative deposition date on November 8, 2023. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 5.) On
November 28, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent an email follow-up to BMW NA’s
counsel, seeking to obtain alternate dates for deposition. (Id., ¶ 6.)
Despite this effort, Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr. Saeedian, states in his
declaration that “[t]o this date, the defendant [BMW NA] still refuse to
produce a witness[.]” (Id., ¶ 9.)
 
 
 
Based on the above records,
the Court concludes that Plaintiff has made good faith attempts to
rescheduling. However, Plaint does not present a declaration showing his
inquiry about the nonappearance at the deposition on October 20, 2023, which is
a deficiency, under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 subdivision (2).
 
2.     
Separate
Statement
 
The California Rules of Court rule
3.1345 (b)(5) explicitly states that “A separate statement is not required under the
following circumstances: (1) When no response has been provided to the request
for discovery[.]”
It is uncontested that BMW
NA did not serve any objections or produce the PMK’s attendance, hence no
sperate statement is required.
 
B.    
Motion to
Compel Deposition Attendance 
 
Plaintiff’s first deposition
notice was served on BMW NA for the deposition of BMW NA’s PMK on September 13,
2023, for a deposition date of October 20, 2023. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. “1,”
Proof of Service.)
 
Here, there is no evidence that BMW NA objected to the
deposition. Since BMW NA does not oppose or bring forth evidence explaining the
nonappearance, Defendant’s motion to compel is GRANTED. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (a).)¿  
 
C.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Additionally, Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions against BMW
NA and its attorney of record. Code of Civil Procedure, section 2025.450
subdivision (g)(1) requires the Court to impose sanctions unless it finds the
deponent acted with substantial justification or there are circumstances that
render imposition of sanctions unjust.  
 
Utilizing
a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the
Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work in preparing the Motion is $816.75, calculated at a
reasonable hourly rate of $500 for 1.5 hours reasonably spent plus $66.75 for
filing fees.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Attendance of Defendant BMW NA’s Person
Most Knowledgeable and Production of Documents is GRANTED.
 
BMW of North
America, LLC is ordered to produce its Peron Most Knowledge and the requested documents
at a deposition to be scheduled by Plaintiff.
Plaintiff must give at least ten days’ notice of the deposition, with extended notice
as applicable under Code of Civil Procedure.
 
Plaintiff’s
Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BMW of
North America, LLC and its attorney(s) of record are ordered to jointly and
severely pay $816.75 to Plaintiff.
