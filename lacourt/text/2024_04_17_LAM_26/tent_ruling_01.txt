  Case No.:  21STCV44716
 
  Hearing Date:  April 17, 2024
 
[TENTATIVE] order RE:
defendants content partners, llc, cp ieg
  holdings, lp, and gfk distribution, llc’s motion for ISSUANCE OF LETTER OF
  REQUEST FOR DEPOSITION OF GERMAN RESIDENT



 
Procedural Background
On December
7, 2021, Plaintiff Library Rights Company (UK) LTD. (“Plaintiff”) filed the
instant action against Defendants Initial Entertainment Group, Inc., GK Films,
LLC, GKF Distribution, LLC, Graham King, Content
Partners, LLC and CP IEG Holdings LP for breach of contract and accounting
of gross proceeds from the films “Ali,” “Gangs of New York,” and “Traffic.”  On August 11, 2022, Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against all of the defendants.[1]  The FAC asserts three causes of action for
(1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing, and (3) Common Count.
On
February 27, 2024, Defendants Content Partners, LLC, CP IEG Holdings LP, and
GKF Distribution, LLC (“Moving Defendants”) filed the instant motion for the
issuance of a Hague Convention Letter of Request for the testimony of Yu-Jin
Embacher, a resident of Germany. Plaintiff opposes.
 
Discussion
As an initial matter, it appears that discovery has closed in this case
as the trial was previously set for April 29, 2024, thus making the April 17,
2024 hearing date well after the cut-off date for discovery and discovery
motions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) While trial was recently
continued to July 15, 2024, the order does not indicate that the discovery
deadlines were also extended in accordance with the new trial date. (See 4/8/24
Minute Order.) Thus, Moving Defendants must first bring a motion to reopen
discovery before the Court can hear the instant discovery motion.
 
Conclusion and ORDER
Based on the foregoing, Defendants Content
Partners, LLC, CP IEG Holdings LP, and GKF Distribution, LLC Motion for
Issuance of Letter of Request for Deposition of German Resident is DENIED without
prejudice.
Moving Party to give notice within seven
(7) days.
