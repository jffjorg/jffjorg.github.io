[TENTATIVE] order RE:
DEFENDANT LES COHEN’S special motion to
  strike the complaint



 
Procedural Background 
On August 31, 2023, Plaintiff Stephen
Snyder (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Les Cohen, individually
and as a Trustee of The Cohen Living Trust dated January 17, 2018 (“Cohen”);
David Daneshrad, Esq.; Assaf Cohen, Esq., aka Jay Cohen; and Cohen and
Daneshrad, LLP.  The complaint asserts nine causes of action, five of
which are alleged against Cohen: (a) the first cause of action for “fraud,
deceit and concealment”; (b) the second cause of action for “fraud and
deceit-for rescission and restitution damages;” (c) the third cause of action
for conspiracy; (d) the eighth cause of action for “tortious interference with
contractual rights”; and (e) the ninth cause of action for “fraudulent /
intentional misrepresentation.”
On November 29, 2023, Cohen filed the
instant special motion to strike the complaint.  
On March 19, 2024, the Court granted the special
motion to strike the complaint filed by Defendants David Daneshrad, Esq.; Assaf
Cohen, Esq., aka Jay Cohen; and Cohen and Daneshrad, LLP (collectively
“Attorney Defendants”). 
On April 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition to Cohen’s motion.  On April 10, 2024, Cohen filed a
reply.  
Allegations of the Operative Complaint 
The Complaint alleges the following: 
Between March 2018 and August 2020,
Plaintiff and Cohen were involved in various business dealings. 
(Complaint ¶ 15.)  Between January 2020 and May 2020, Plaintiff and
Cohen’s business relationship devolved, and disputes arose between the two
parties.  (Id. ¶¶ 16-32.)   
On May 17, 2020, Plaintiff and Cohen
entered into a Settlement Agreement to resolve these issues.  (Id.
¶ 33.)  The Settlement Agreement included a general release of all known
and unknown claims between Plaintiff and Cohen.  (Id. ¶ 37.) 
After executing the agreement, Cohen breached the non-circumvention clause in
the settlement agreement by contacting an associate of Plaintiff.  (Id.
¶¶ 40-55, 57.)   
On August 20, 2020, Plaintiff moved to
Miami, Florida for a consulting position.  (Id. ¶ 56.)  At
some point between June 2020 and August 2020, Cohen hired Attorney Defendants
to file a lawsuit against Plaintiff.  (Id. ¶ 58.) 
Despite knowing that the Settlement
Agreement released the claims being asserted by Cohen against Plaintiff, on
September 1, 2020, Cohen and Attorney Defendants filed Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 20STCV33348 (“Underlying Action”) against Plaintiff.  (Id.
¶¶ 59-60.)  The Underlying Action failed to disclose the existence of the Settlement
Agreement between Plaintiff and Cohen.  (Id. ¶¶ 61-67.) 
On September 26, 2020, Cohen and Attorney
Defendants falsely claimed and filed a proof of service claiming to have served
Plaintiff by personal service through a registered process server, but this was
impossible as Plaintiff was in Miami at the time of service.  (Id.
¶¶ 72, 75-76.)  Plaintiff has never been properly served in the Underlying
Action.  (Id. ¶ 73.) 
Upon discovering the Underlying Action on
July 31, 2022, Plaintiff reviewed the court documents and discovered the
fraudulent proof of service and found proof that the registered process server
was committing perjury.  (Id. ¶¶ 74-78.)  “None of this
evidence was reviewed or considered by the court which ultimately resulted in
an order for a default judgement against the PLAINTIFF.”  (Id. ¶
79.)    
Evidence Objections 
In conjunction with the reply, Cohen
objects to portions of Plaintiffs’ declaration filed in support of the
opposition.  The Court rules as follows: 
1.              
Sustained – Legal Conclusion 
2.

·      
Exhibit 9 –
Default Judgment entered on August 7, 2023 in Los Angeles County Superior Court
Case No. 20STCV33348.
As the court may
take judicial notice of court records and government records, (See Evid.
Code, § 452(c),(d)), Cohen’s requests for judicial notice are granted. However,
the Court will not take judicial notice of the truth of assertions within those
court records. (See Herrera v. Deutsche
Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.)   
Plaintiff requests that the Court take judicial notice of:
·      
Exhibit 1 – Settlement
Agreement and Mutual Release, Dated for May 17th, 2020, filed on August 30,
2022, on Snyder’s Motion to Quash, in LASC Case No. 20STCV33348;
·      
Exhibit 2 –

·      
Exhibit 3 –
Declaration of Anthony Thorne, filed on December 16,
2022, on Snyder’s Motion for Reconsideration, in LASC Case No. 20STCV33348.
Plaintiff requests their judicial notice on the
ground that they are records of a court of this state. Cohen opposes judicial
notice of these documents because there is no court file-stamp or any other
indication suggesting that they are court records. The Court agrees with Cohen
and denies Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice.
 
Legal Standard 
“If a defendant brings a special motion
under the anti-SLAPP statute [CCP § 425.16] to strike a cause of action, the
trial court evaluates that motion using a two-step process: The first examines
the nature of the conduct that underlies the plaintiff's allegations to
determine whether the conduct is protected by section 425.16; the second
assesses the merits of the plaintiff’s claim. [Citation]” (Laker v. Board of
Trustees of California State University (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 745,
759.) 
“The defendant’s first-step burden is to
identify the activity each challenged claim rests on and demonstrate that that
activity is protected by the anti-SLAPP statute. A ‘claim may be struck only if
the speech or petitioning activity¿itself¿is the wrong complained of,
and not just evidence of liability or a step leading to some different act for
which liability is asserted.’ [Citation.]  To determine whether a claim
arises from protected activity, courts must ‘consider the elements of the
challenged claim and what actions by the defendant supply those elements and
consequently form the basis for liability.’ [Citation.]  Courts then must
evaluate whether the defendant has shown any of these actions fall within one
or more of the four categories of ‘act[s]’ protected by the anti-SLAPP statute.
[Citations.]”  (Wilson v. Cable News Network, Inc.¿(2019) 7 Cal.5th
871, 884 [italics in original].) 
“In the first step of the analysis, the
trial court determines whether the cause of action ‘arises from’ an ‘‘‘act in
furtherance of a person's right of petition or free speech under the United
States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue.’’’
[Citation] The first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis ‘turns on two subsidiary
questions: (1) What conduct does the challenged cause of action ‘arise[] from’;
and (2) is that conduct ‘protected activity’ under the anti-SLAPP statute?’
[Citation]” (Laker, supra, 32 Cal.App.5th. at p.760.)  
“The Supreme Court has clarified that
‘arising from’ means ‘based on.’ [Citation] This element of the first step of
the anti-SLAPP analysis is sometimes referred to as the ‘nexus’ requirement.
[Citation] Conduct constitutes ‘protected activity,’ if it falls within one of
the categories set out in section 425.16, subdivision (e). Section 425.16,
subdivision (e), in turn, applies to (1) ‘any written or oral statement or
writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any
other official proceeding authorized by law’; (2) ‘in connection with an issue
under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or
any other official proceeding authorized by law’; (3) ‘in a place open to the
public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest’; or
(4) ‘any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional
right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with
a public issue or an issue of public interest.’ [Citation] The defendant
bringing the anti-SLAPP motion to strike must make a prima facie showing that
the allegations that form the basis of the plaintiff's claims arise from
conduct that falls under one of these categories. [Citation]” (Ibid.) 
“If the defendant prevails in this step of
the analysis, the trial court must then assess the merits of the plaintiff's
claim. The Supreme Court has described this second step of the SLAPP analysis
as a ‘summary-judgment-like procedure.’ [Citation.]  The plaintiff carries
the burden of demonstrating that its claim has ‘at least ‘minimal merit.’’
[Citation.] If the plaintiff is unable to demonstrate that his or her claim has
at least minimal merit, then the trial court should deem the cause of action a
SLAPP and should strike it. [Citation.]” (Ibid.)   
At this “second stage of an anti-SLAPP
hearing, the court may consider affidavits, declarations, and their equivalents
if it is reasonably possible the proffered evidence set out in those statements
will be admissible at trial. Conversely, if the evidence relied upon cannot be
admitted at trial, because it is categorically barred or undisputed factual
circumstances show inadmissibility, the court may not consider it in the face
of an objection. If an evidentiary objection is made, the plaintiff may attempt
to cure the asserted defect or demonstrate the defect is curable.” (Sweetwater
Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019) 6 Cal.5th 931,
949.) 
The trial court properly considers the
evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant, but it may not
weigh the credibility or comparative strength of the evidence and must instead
simply determine whether the plaintiff’s evidence would, if believed by the
trier of fact, be sufficient to result in a judgment for plaintiff. (McGarry
v. Univ. of San Diego (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 97, 108-09.) The court
“accept[s] as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff [citation] and
evaluate[s] the defendant’s evidence only to determine if it has defeated that
submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.’ [Citations.]” (Flatley v.
Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 326.) Further, whether or not the evidence is
in conflict, in the context of a motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute,
if the plaintiff has presented a sufficient pleading and has presented evidence
showing that a prima facie case will be established at trial, the plaintiff is
entitled to proceed. (Moore v. Shaw (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 182, 193.)
Only a minimal showing of merit is required. (Robinzine v. Vicory (2006)
143 Cal.App.4th 1416, 1421.) 
 
Discussion 
First Prong: Protected Activity 
“To prevail on an anti-SLAPP motion, the movant must first make ‘a
threshold showing the challenged cause of action’ arises from an act in
furtherance of the right of petition or free speech in connection with a public
issue.” (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180,
192.)  “[T]he focus is on determining what ‘the defendant’s activity [is]
that gives rise to his or her asserted liability—and whether that activity
constitutes protected speech or petitioning.’ [Citation.]”  (Park v.
Board of Trustees of California State University (2017) 2 Cal.5th 1057,
1063.)  “‘The only means specified in section 425.16 by which a moving
defendant can satisfy that [‘arising from’] requirement is to demonstrate that
the defendant’s conduct by which plaintiff claims to have been injured falls
within one of the four categories described in subdivision (e) . . . .’
[Citation.]” (Ibid.)   
Pursuant
to Baral v. Schnitt¿(2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 396, “[a]t the first step, the
moving defendant bears the burden of identifying all allegations of protected
activity, and the claims for relief supported by them.”  (See Wilson v.
Cable News Network, Inc.¿(2019) 7 Cal.5th 871, 884 [“The defendant's
first-step burden is to identify the activity each challenged claim rests on
and demonstrate that that activity is protected by the anti-SLAPP
statute.”].)    
Statements and Actions Made in Connection with Litigation 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 425.16(e) protects “(1) any written or oral
statement or writing made before a … judicial proceeding, … [and] (2) any
written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under
consideration or review by a … judicial body”. (CCP § 425.16(e)(1)-(2).) 
Filing documents in a court proceeding is unquestionably petitioning activity
under these clauses.  (Ludwig v. Superior Court (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 8, 19, [“The constitutional right to petition ... includes the basic
act of filing litigation or otherwise seeking administrative action.”].) 
“[P]lainly read,¿section 425.16 encompasses any cause of action against a
person arising from any statement or writing made in, or in connection with an
issue under consideration or review by, an official proceeding or body.” 
(Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope & Opportunity¿(1999) 19 Cal.4th
1106, 1113.)  “[T]hese clauses safeguard free speech and petition conduct
aimed at advancing self government, as well as conduct aimed at more mundane
pursuits. Under the plain terms of the statute it is the context or setting
itself that makes the issue a public issue: all that matters is that the First
Amendment activity take place in an official proceeding or be made in
connection with an issue being reviewed by an official proceeding.”  (Id.
at p.1116.)  Thus, protected conduct includes such actions as “the filing,
funding, and prosecution of a civil action.”  (Rusheen v. Cohen¿(2006)
37 Cal.4th 1048, 1056.)   
Here,
Plaintiff’s claims against Cohen are in direct response to the Underlying
Action. Plaintiff summed up the basis of his claims in a single paragraph in
the Complaint: “Due to the fact that SNYDER has been unable to properly defend
himself against the FRAUDULENT COMPLAINT due to the improper service, the court
ordered a default judgment against SNYDER on August 8, 2023.  Thus, this lawsuit is necessary in order to
undo the injustice that has been perpetrated against him.”  (Complaint, p. 5, lines 4-6.) 
Moreover,
all of Plaintiff’s claims against Cohen arise from this protected
activity.  The first cause of action for
fraud is predicated on the allegation that Cohen withheld the existence of a
settlement agreement in the Underlying Action which resulted in a judgment that
Plaintiff claims is unjust.  (Id.,
¶¶ 87-91.)  The second cause of action
for fraud seeks damages in this action for the amount of the judgment against Plaintiff
in the Underlying Action.  (Id., ¶
95.)  The third cause of action for
conspiracy is based on allegations that Cohen engaged in actions in the Underlying
Action “in order to unjustly enrich [himself].”  (Id., ¶ 97.)  The eighth cause of action for tortious
interference is based on the assertion that Cohen interfered with his own contracts
with Snyder by filing the Underlying Complaint.  (Id., ¶ 114-118.)  The ninth cause of action for
misrepresentation is based on the assertion that Cohen’s allegations in the Underlying
Complaint were false.  (Id., ¶
122.)
In
sum, the entire complaint arises from Cohen’s protected acts of petitioning in
the Underlying Action.    
Plaintiff’s
Failure to Show Criminal Illegality 
In
opposition, Plaintiff contends that Cohen does not satisfy the first prong of
anti-SLAPP analysis because their alleged conduct was unlawful.  The Court
disagrees. 
In
Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, the Supreme Court held that
“section 425.16 cannot be invoked by a defendant whose assertedly protected
activity is illegal as a matter of law and, for that reason, not protected by
constitutional guarantees of free speech and petition.”  (Id. at p.
317.)  This is because “section 425.16 was expressly intended to protect valid
speech and petitioning activity.”  (City of Montebello v. Vasquez
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 409, 423.)  However, the Supreme Court made “clear in Flatley
that conduct must be illegal as a matter of law to defeat a defendant's
showing of protected activity.  The
defendant must concede the point, or the evidence conclusively demonstrate it,
for a claim of illegality to defeat an anti-SLAPP motion at the first
step.”  (Id. at p.424.)    
Moreover,
“the Flatley rule applies only to criminal conduct, not to conduct that
is illegal because it is in violation of statute or common law.”  (Bergstein
v. Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 793,
806.)  To defeat a showing of protected activity at the first prong, the
conduct must be criminal because “‘a plaintiff's complaint always
alleges a defendant engaged in illegal conduct in that it violated some common
law standard of conduct or statutory prohibition, giving rise to liability, and
we decline to give plaintiffs a tool for avoiding the application of the
anti-SLAPP statute merely by showing any statutory violation.’
[Citation.]”  (Cross v. Cooper (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 357,
390.) 
Here
– unlike in Flatley – Cohen did not concede that his alleged acts were
illegal. Moreover, Plaintiff fails to point to any evidence that conclusively
demonstrates that Cohen’s alleged conduct in filing a civil action pursuing
claims that had been released and in failing to disclose the Settlement
Agreement was illegal as a matter of law.  Plaintiff does not provide any evidence that
the allegations Cohen made in the Underlying Action were false.  Rather,
Plaintiff merely contends that in filing the complaint in the Underlying
Action, Cohen omitted the existence of the Settlement Agreement. 
(Complaint ¶ 61.)  Even presuming that the Settlement Agreement released
Cohen’s claims against Plaintiff, Plaintiff fails to show that Cohen’s omission
of the Settlement Agreement from the complaint in the Underlying Action rises
to the level of a crime.    
As
to the claim that Cohen filed a false proof of service in the Underlying
Action, Plaintiff again fails to point to any statute criminalizing such
alleged conduct.  Nor does Plaintiff provide any evidence to support his
claim that the proof of service Cohen filed was false.  Therefore,
Plaintiff fails to show that Cohen’s conduct was illegal as a matter of
law.  The Flatley rule does not apply.   
Accordingly, the Court turns to the second prong of minimal
merit.  
Second
Prong: Plaintiff’s Showing of Minimal Merit 
For the second prong of the anti-SLAPP
analysis, Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing a probability of
succeeding on the merits. (See Kyle v. Carmon (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 901,
907.)  However, Plaintiff is “not required ‘to prove the specified claim
to the trial court;’ rather, so as to not deprive the plaintiff of a jury
trial, the appropriate inquiry is whether the plaintiff has stated and substantiated
a legally sufficient claim.”  (Whitehall v. County of San Bernardino
(2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 352, 364.) 
At the second stage “‘[t]he court does not
weigh¿evidence or resolve conflicting factual claims. Its inquiry is limited to
whether the plaintiff has stated a legally sufficient claim and made a prima
facie factual showing sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment. It accepts
the plaintiff's evidence as true, and evaluates the defendant's showing only
to determine if it defeats the plaintiff's claim as a matter of law.’
[Citation.]”  (Wilson v. Cable News Network, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th
871, 891, [italics added].)  
Litigation Privilege 
The litigation privilege is “relevant to
the second step in the anti-SLAPP analysis in that it may present a substantive
defense a plaintiff must overcome to demonstrate a probability of prevailing.”  (Flatley v. Mauro¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th
299, 323.)   
“‘The usual formulation is
that the [litigation] privilege applies to any communication (1) made in
judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants
authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that
[has] some connection or logical relation to the action.’¿[Citation.]  The
privilege “is not limited to statements made during a trial or other
proceedings, but may extend to steps taken prior thereto, or afterwards.’
[Citation.]”  (Action Apartment Assn., Inc. v. City of Santa Monica¿(2007)
41 Cal.4th 1232, 1241.)  “[T]he litigation privilege was founded on
defamation actions, and has been applied primarily to provide absolute immunity
from tort liability for communications with ‘some relation’ to judicial
proceedings.”  (Feldman v. 1100 Park Lane Associates (2008) 160
Cal.App.4th 1467, 1494.)  The Supreme Court has noted that it has
previously “directed that¿section 47(b) be applied broadly to bar tort actions
based on privileged communications, excepting only the tort of malicious
prosecution.” (Hagberg v. California Fed. Bank (2004) 32 Cal. 4th 350,
358.) “The privilege
applies to communications relative to the defense of an action as well as those
relative to its filing and prosecution.”  (Cabral v. Martins¿(2009)
177 Cal.App.4th 471, 485.)  “The privilege is ‘absolute in nature,
applying “to all publications, irrespective of their maliciousness.” ’
[Citation.]”  (Optional Capital, Inc. v. Akin Gump Strauss, Hauer &
Feld LLP (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 95, 116.)  “ ‘The principal purpose of
[the litigation privilege] is to afford litigants and witnesses [citation] the
utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed
subsequently¿by derivative tort actions.’ ” (Action Apartment, supra,
41 Cal.4th at p.1241, [italics added].)   
Here, Plaintiff has summarized
his claims and allegations as follows: “[t]he claims and causes of action
brought forth in this instant action solely have to do with fraud, concealment,
conspiracy, deceit, fraudulent misrepresentation of material facts and other
acts of moral turpitude that were perpetrated against [Plaintiff], the court,
and other parties in [the Underlying Action].”  (Snyder Decl. ¶ 6.) 
The acts of filing the Underlying Action (even if it included only released
claims) and filing a false proof of service in the Underlying Action are
plainly communications in a judicial proceeding and therefore protected by the
litigation privilege.  (Civ. Code, §
47(b).)  Any tort claims arising out of these communications would be
barred by the litigation privilege.  Thus, the fraud claims (i.e., the
first, second, and ninth causes of action), the tortious interference claim
(i.e., the eighth cause of action), and the civil conspiracy claim (i.e., the
third cause of action) are all clearly barred by the litigation
privilege. The first, second, third, eighth and ninth causes of action are
the only ones that Plaintiff asserted against Cohen. 
In opposition, Plaintiff
contends that the litigation privilege does not apply to Plaintiff’s claims
because the language of Business and Professions Code section 6128 “is more
specific than the litigation privilege and would be significantly or wholly inoperable
if its enforcement were barred when in conflict with the privilege.”  (Action
Apartment Assn., Inc., supra, 41 Cal.4th at p.1246.)  Business and
Professions Code section 6128 provides that “[e]very attorney is guilty of a
misdemeanor who either: (a) Is guilty of any deceit or collusion, or consents
to any deceit or collusion, with intent to deceive the court or any
party.”  (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6128(a).)  Cohen is not an attorney and the attorneys who
represented Cohen in filing the Underlying Action have already been absolved of
wrongdoing in this case.  Thus, Plaintiff’s
claims against Cohen– i.e., the first, second, third, eighth, and ninth causes
of action – are barred by the litigation privilege. 
Plaintiff fails to show
minimal merit because his claims are barred by the litigation privilege, and he
fails to present evidence of a prima facie case for his claims.  As
Plaintiff fails to show minimal merit, the Court declines to address Cohen’s
additional arguments based on res judicata or collateral estoppel.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
Based on the foregoing,
Defendant Les Cohen’s special motion to strike is GRANTED. 
As no claim remains, Les Cohen
is to file a proposed judgment of dismissal within ten (10) days of notice of
this order. 
Moving party shall give notice.
