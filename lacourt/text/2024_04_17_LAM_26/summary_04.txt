The judge's tentative ruling granted Defendant Les Cohen's special motion to strike Plaintiff Stephen Snyder's complaint, finding that the Plaintiff failed to show minimal merit and that his claims were barred by the litigation privilege. The judge concluded that the Plaintiff's claims were solely based on the litigation privilege and did not present evidence of a prima facie case for his claims.
