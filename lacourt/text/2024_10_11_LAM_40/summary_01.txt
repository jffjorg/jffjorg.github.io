The judge has granted So Cal Development Group LLC's motion for entry of judgment for attorney fees and costs in the amount of $7,567.27.

The Petitioner is the prevailing party and is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs under Civil Code section 8488. The judge found that the Petitioner's counsel, Weisberg, has sufficient experience and expertise to justify the requested hourly rate of $500.00 per hour. The judge also found that the requested hours and costs were reasonable and did not duplicate any efforts or spend an excessive amount of time on any task.
