 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Motion for Entry of Judgment for Attorney Fees and Costs 



 
I. Background
    Petitioner So Cal
Development Group filed a Petition for Release of Mechanic’s Lien against
Respondent California Realty & Investment Group Inc. on July 15, 2024. The
Court granted the Petition on August 21, 2024. (Minute Order, 08/21/24.) Notice
of Entry of Judgment or Order was filed on August 21, 2024.
     On August 21,
2024, Petitioner filed the instant motion for Entry of Judgment for Attorney
Fees and Costs. 
     No opposition has
been filed. 
 
II. Motion
A.   
Legal Standard
The Court’s objective is to award
attorney fees at the fair market value based on the particular action.  (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily begins with the 'lodestar,' i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum
v. Moses¿(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.) “The reasonable hourly rate is that
prevailing in the community for similar work.”¿¿(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) 
Regarding the number of hours
expended, the lodestar method looks to factors relevant to the particular case:
“(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill
displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.”  (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at
1132.) “The ‘‘experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of
professional services rendered in his court, and while his judgment is of
course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court
is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’’” (Ibid.)

Analysis 

Petitioner moves for an award of
attorney’s fees and costs in the total amount of $7,567.27 pursuant to Civil
Code section 8488. As the prevailing party on the Petition to Release
Mechanic’s Lien, Petitioner is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney’s
fees. (Civ. Code, § 8488, subd. (c).)  
Petitioner’s counsel has been
practicing law for 20 years and bills at a rate of $500.00 per hour. (Weisberg
Decl., ¶¶ 4,7.) The declaration adequately supports the requested rate based on
counsel’s experience and years of practice.  
Petitioner requests attorney’s
fees and costs in the total amount of $7,567.27 based upon counsel’s rate of $500/hour
for: (1) 12.9 hours of work on the Petition to Release Mechanic’s Lien and (2)
1.0 hour for hearing on the motion for attorney’s fees, and (3) $617.27 in
costs. (Weisberg Decl., ¶¶ 4-6, Ex. 1; Memorandum of Costs).
Details regarding this work
demonstrate that counsel did not duplicate any efforts or spend an excessive
amount of time on any task. (Weisberg Decl., Ex. 1.)
Thus, Petitioner’s motion for
attorney’s fees and costs in the total amount of $7,567.27 is GRANTED.
III. Conclusion
So Cal Development Group’s Motion for Entry of Judgment for Attorney
Fees and Costs is GRANTED in the amount of $7,567.27. The Proposed
Judgment lodged on August 21, 2024, will be signed.
