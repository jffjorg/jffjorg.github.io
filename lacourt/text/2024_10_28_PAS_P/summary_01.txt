And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Hartstein's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, allowing him to bring claims against Hire Counsel. Hartstein's claims relate to unlawful non-compete agreements, failure to pay earned wages, and other issues tied to his employment with Hire Counsel. Hire Counsel had opposed the motion, arguing that it was procedurally defective and that Hartstein had engaged in bad faith tactics. However, the judge found no evidence of bad faith and denied Hire Counsel's request for fees and costs. The judge ordered Hartstein to file his cross-complaint within 10 days.
