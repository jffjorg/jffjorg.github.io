  Case Number:  22BBCV00516    Hearing Date:   October 28, 2024    Dept:  P ORDER
GRANTING HARTSTEIN’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE CROSS-COMPLAINTI.        INTRODUCTION

This is a breach of contract action commenced on
July 15, 2022 by Plaintiff and HCMC Legal Inc. ("Hire Counsel")
against Defendants Brian Hartstein (“Hartstein”) and Epiq Systems Inc., Epiq
Systems Solutions Inc., and Epiq Systems Acquisition Inc. (collectively,
“Epiq”). Hire Counsel alleges that Hartstein violated his employment agreement
and fiduciary duties by resigning without notice and subsequently joining Epiq,
a direct competitor, where he allegedly solicited Hire Counsel’s clients and
former employees, causing significant harm to Hire Counsel’s business
operations.
On October 3, 2024, Hartstein filed a Motion for
Leave to File a Cross-Complaint. On October 15, 2024, Hire Counsel filed an
Opposition to the motion. On October 18, 2024, Hartstein filed a Reply.
Before the Court is Hartstein’s Motion for Leave to
File a Cross-Complaint.
 
Moving
Party’s Position
Hartstein makes this motion under Code of Civil
Procedure § 426.50 and § 428.50, asserting that there is good cause to bring
various causes of action against Hire Counsel. He seeks to assert compulsory
claims arising from the same transactions and events already at issue in the
case. Specifically, Hartstein's claims relate to unlawful non-compete
agreements, failure to pay earned wages, and other issues tied to his
employment with Hire Counsel. Hartstein emphasizes that the motion is brought
in good faith and contends it is in the interest of justice for the court to
permit the filing of the cross-complaint.
 
Opposition
Hire Counsel opposes Hartstein’s motion, arguing
that it is procedurally defective. They point out that Hartstein failed to
timely serve the motion and neglected to attach the proposed cross-complaint in
his moving papers. Furthermore, Hire Counsel contends that Hartstein’s actions
throughout the litigation show a lack of good faith. Hire Counsel alleges that
Hartstein has employed delay tactics, including filing a futile motion to
compel arbitration, a motion for a temporary restraining order, and a meritless
appeal, which he later abandoned. Hire Counsel asserts that these tactics are
part of a broader strategy to delay proceedings and avoid addressing the
substantive claims. As a result, they request that the court deny the motion
and require Hartstein to pay fees and costs associated with the delay.
 
Reply
In response to the opposition, Hartstein asserts
that Hire Counsel has not provided any evidence of bad faith. He further
contends that Hire Counsel's claims of prejudice due to the timing of the
motion are unfounded. Hartstein emphasizes that Hire Counsel has known about
his intent to file a cross-complaint for three months. Additionally, Hartstein
challenges Hire Counsel’s request for fees and costs, arguing that their
opposition to the cross-complaint has unnecessarily increased litigation costs.
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
Code Civ. Proc. §428.50
(a) A party shall file a cross-complaint against any
of the parties who filed the complaint or cross-complaint against him or her
before or at the same time as the answer to the complaint or cross-complaint.
(b) Any other cross-complaint may be filed at any
time before the court has set a date for trial.
(c) A party shall obtain leave of court to file any
cross-complaint except one filed within the time specified in subdivision (a)
or (b). Leave may be granted in the interest of justice at any time during the
course of the action.
“A motion to file a cross-complaint at any time
during the course of the action must be granted unless bad faith of the moving
party is demonstrated where forfeiture would otherwise result.” Silver
Organization, Ltd. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 99.
 
III.     DISCUSSION
Procedural
Issues
Hire Counsel raises two procedural defects in
opposition to Hartstein’s motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. First,
Hire Counsel argues that Hartstein’s motion was served one day late, as it was
e-served on October 3, 2024, rather than October 2, 2024, as required under
California law. However, Hartstein counters that this minor delay does not
warrant denial of the motion, citing California Rule of Court 3.1300(d), which
grants courts discretion to accept late filings if no prejudice is shown. Hartstein
asserts that Hire Counsel has not suffered any prejudice from the late service,
particularly since the issue has been briefed since July.
Second, Hire Counsel contends that Hartstein failed
to include a copy of the proposed cross-complaint with his moving papers. In
response, Hartstein notes that Hire Counsel had already received the proposed
cross-complaint months earlier and was able to file a substantive opposition.
The omission has since been corrected through a Notice of Erratum filed on
October 16, 2024, which attached the proposed cross-complaint.
The Court acknowledges that Hartstein’s filing was
one day late but finds no evidence that the delay was deliberate or for any
improper purpose. As such, the Court exercises its discretion to consider the
motion despite the procedural issues raised.
 
Bad
Faith
“[A] party who fails to plead a cause of action . .
. whether through oversight, inadvertence, mistake, neglect, or other cause,
may apply to the court for leave to . . .  file a cross-complaint, to
assert such cause at any time during the course of the action.  The court,
after notice to the adverse party, shall grant, upon such terms as may be just
to the parties, leave . . . .to file the cross-complaint, to assert such cause
if the party who failed to plead the cause acted in good faith. This
subdivision shall be liberally construed to avoid forfeiture of causes of
action.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 426.50.)  Substantial evidence of bad
faith must be shown in order for leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint to
be denied.  (Silver Organizations Ltd. v. Frank (1990) 217
Cal.App.3d 94, 97.) 
Substantial evidence is that “of ponderable legal
significance . . . reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value.”  (Id.
at 99.)  “Bad faith is defined as the opposite of good faith,
generally implying or involving actual or constructive fraud, or a design to
mislead or deceive another, or a neglect or refusal to fulfill some duty or
some contractual obligation, not prompted by an honest mistake . . . but, by
some interested or sinister motive . .  . not simply bad judgment or
negligence, but rather . . . furtive design or ill will.”  (Id. at
100.)   
Here, Hire Counsel argues that Defendant Hartstein’s
two-year delay in bringing his cross-complaint is evidence of bad faith.
(Opposition pg. 7) They assert that Hartstein's failure to timely bring his
cross-complaint was a deliberate and informed decision made with his multiple
sets of attorneys. (Opposition pg. 5) According to Hire Counsel, Hartstein’s
current motion for leave to file the cross-complaint, just four months before
trial, is an apparent tactic to delay proceedings. (Opposition pg. 5)
However, the Court finds that there is no
substantial evidence of bad faith in Hartstein’s delay in filing the
cross-complaint. The mere fact that Hartstein waited to file the
cross-complaint, even with multiple changes in legal representation, does not
amount to bad faith.  There is no indication that Hartstein engaged in any
actual or constructive fraud, or that his delay was part of a "furtive
design or ill will." Instead, Hartstein’s counsel has declared that the
motion is brought in good faith. (Quinto Decl. ¶ 7) 
Thus, without credible and solid evidence of a
deceitful motive, Hartstein’s actions, though delayed, do not rise to the level
of bad faith. Accordingly, the Court does not find substantial evidence of bad
faith on Hartstein’s part. 
 
Attorney’s
Fees and Costs
Hire
Counsel asserts that if Hartstein’s motion for leave to file a compulsory
cross-complaint is granted, the Court should order payment of fees and costs to
offset the purported surprise and burden associated with investigating five new
causes of action. Hire Counsel argues that this would necessitate significantly
more discovery, all of which must be completed within the four months remaining
before trial.
The
Court finds this argument unsupported. Hire Counsel has not provided any
specific estimates regarding the additional costs or fees associated with the
new work that might arise from granting the cross-complaint. In the absence of
such evidence, the Court denies the request for an award of attorneys' fees and
costs.
Where
a party’s motion for leave to file a cross-complaint is granted, the Court may
impose conditions that are just to the parties, including ordering costs or
fees, under Code of Civil Procedure § 426.50. However, the Court must be
presented with evidence or estimates of the costs at issue before making such
an award.
Further,
Hartstein’s counsel declares that granting leave to file the cross-complaint
would not prejudice Hire Counsel. Counsel emphasizes that Hire Counsel has two
hours of deposition time remaining and has already scheduled Hartstein’s
follow-up deposition for October 8, 2024. Additionally, counsel asserts that
nearly all the issues raised by the proposed cross-complaint are already
present in the case, as they are included in Hartstein’s affirmative defenses
(Quinto Decl., ¶¶ 4, 7). Given these circumstances, counsel declares that the
proposed cross-complaint should not require much additional discovery or
preparation, thereby minimizing any potential burden on Hire Counsel. (Id.)
As
such, the Court concludes that no fees or costs are warranted.
 
          IV. CONCLUSION AND ORDER

Court GRANTS Hartstein’s motion for leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint.

Hartstein
is ordered to separately file the cross-complaint within 10 days.
The
Court DENIES Hire Counsel’s request for fees.

is to give notice.
