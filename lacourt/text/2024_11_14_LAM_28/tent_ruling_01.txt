BACKGROUND
 
On September 27, 2023, Plaintiff The Gray
Casualty & Surety Company (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Auto
Parts and Services LLC, Alexey Chsherbakov, and Does 1 through 10. Plaintiff
alleged a cause of action for breach of contract.
 
Plaintiff alleges Defendants failed to make
payments as agreed to pursuant to the Application for Freight Broker Bond, an
application on which both defendants jointly and severally agreed to indemnify
all losses and damages on the contract.
 
Plaintiff personally served Auto Parts and
Services LLC on October 3, 2023. The Clerk entered default against Auto Parts
and Services LLC on June 3, 2024. This is Plaintiff’s second request for entry
of default judgment.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) Section 585
permits entry of a judgment after a defendant’s default has been entered.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of
the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the
judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of
costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought; (7) a dismissal of all parties
against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
under CCP Section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8)
exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties. 
CRC 3.1800. 
 
JC Form CIV-100 must be used to request court
judgment.  Item number 2 must be
completed.  Item number 8 must be
completed if the Defendant is an individual. 
Plaintiff must submit a proposed form of judgment.  
 
Here, Plaintiff has submitted a proposed form
of judgment, filed CIV-100 Forms for Auto Parts and Services LLC, completed
item 2 and 8 on CIV-100, and dismissed Alexey Chsherbakov and all Doe
defendants. 
 
By defaulting, a defendant is deemed to admit
all material allegations of the complaint that are well pleaded.  Molen v. Friedman (1998) 64
Cal.App.4th 1149, 1156.  The complaint
need only alleged facts sufficient to apprise a defendant of the nature of the
plaintiff’s demand, and it is immaterial that the complaint might have been
subject to a demurrer for failure to make an allegation necessary to state a
cause of action.  Id. at
1157.  See also CCP
§ 431.20; Bristol Convalescent Hospital v. Stone (1968) 258
Cal.App.2d 848, 859 (stating that defaulting defendant admits absolute verity
of all allegations of complaint giving rise to liability). 
 
The plaintiff must prove the amount of
damages before an actual entry of default judgment.  See Ostling v. Loring (1994)
27 Cal.App.4th 1731, 1745.  In
determining whether the plaintiff is entitled to an award of damages after the
defendant has defaulted, the plaintiff is only required to present evidence
establishing a prima facie case for damages. 
Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361-362.  The trial court must hear the
evidence offered by the plaintiff and render judgment “‘in [its] favor for such
sum, not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint, or for such relief, not
exceeding that demanded in the complaint, as appears from the evidence to be
just.  [Citations.]’”  Id. at 362.
 
A.           General Damages
 
The demand of the Complaint is $50,450.76. Plaintiff
and Auto Parts and Services LLC entered into a Freight Broker Bond Agreement,
whereby Alexey Chsherbakov signed as an indemnitor. Leigh Decl., Ex. A. Auto
Parts and Services LLC and Alexey Chsherbakov breached this agreement by
failing to repay $50,450.76 pursuant to the terms of the agreement. Leigh
Decl., ¶¶ 4-5; Ex. B. Defendants have failed to repay the amount owing on the
agreement.
  
Thus, Plaintiff has sufficiently proven its
causes of action in the amount of $50,450.76. 
 
B.           Costs
 
Plaintiff requests recovery of costs in the
amount of $520.00.  The memorandum of
costs states that the request is based on (a) $435.00 in clerk’s filing fees
and (b) $85.00 in process server’s fees. CIV-100, ln. 7.
  
Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to costs
in the amount of $520.00.
 
 
 
 
C.          Interest
 
Plaintiff seeks to recover interest in the
amount of $6,067.91. Plaintiff seeks at a rate of 10% per annum, beginning from
March 8, 2023, the day of the filing of the complaint through May 20, 2024, the
day Plaintiff requested entry of default judgment. Schlick Decl., ¶ 4. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to
interest in the amount of $6,067.91.


D.          Attorney
Fees
 
Plaintiff seeks to recover $1,899.02 in
attorney fees pursuant to Civil Code Section 1717.5. LASC local rules 3.207 and
3.214 govern this case. These rules provide that in cases where a statute
provides for attorney fees, if the Defendant is in default, and the total
damages sought are between $50,000.01 and $100,000.00, the plaintiff can
recover $1,890.00 plus 2% of the excess over $50,000.00 in attorney fees. The
applicable statute, Civil Code Section 1717.5, entitles Plaintiff to recover
attorney fees because Plaintiff brings a contract action based on a book
account. Moreover, Plaintiff seeks to recover $50,450.76, and Defendant has
defaulted as to this amount. Therefore, Plaintiff may recover $1,890.00 plus 2%
of $450.76, which is the excess over $50,000.00. This total amount is $1,899.02
($1,890.00 + $9.02). Schlick Decl., ¶ 3.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to
attorney fees in the amount of $1,899.02.
