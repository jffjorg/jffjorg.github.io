Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and costs, but reduced the requested amount to $14,509. The court found that the plaintiff is a prevailing party under the Song Beverly Act and is entitled to an award of fees and costs. However, the court reduced the requested amount due to excessive and improper time entries by the plaintiff's counsel. The court also denied the request for court costs without prejudice to further proceedings. The judge's ruling is based on the evidence presented, including the lodestar calculation and the factors considered in determining a reasonable hourly rate for the attorneys. The court's decision is final unless a party files a written objection within five days.
