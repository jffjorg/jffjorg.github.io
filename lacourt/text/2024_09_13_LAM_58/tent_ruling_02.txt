Case Name:                Pugh
v. Ford Motor Company
Case No.:                    23STCV10288
Matter:                        Motion
for attorneys’ fees and costs
Moving Party:             Plaintiff
Nicholas Pugh                       
Responding Party:      Defendant
Ford Motor Company 
 

Tentative Ruling:      The motion
for attorneys’ fees is granted. Plaintiff is awarded $14,509. The request for
court costs is denied without prejudice.

 
            This is a
motion for attorneys’ fees and costs under the Song Beverly Act.  Plaintiff Nicholas Pugh seeks an award of $31,852.02
in attorneys’ fees and costs.  The Court
grants the motion for attorneys’ fees subject to adjustments in the hourly rate
and reduction in unnecessary hours.  The
Court awards Plaintiff fees in the amount of $14,509.  The Court denies without prejudice the
request for court costs.
 
Legal Standard 
 
            A prevailing buyer in an action under Song-Beverly
“shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal
to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based
on actual time expended, determined by the Court to have been reasonably
incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of
such action.”¿¿(Civ. Code, § 1794,¿subd. (d).) 
 
            The prevailing party has the burden of showing that the
requested attorney fees were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation, and were reasonable in amount.” (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel
Trailers of California Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.) The party
seeking attorney fees “ ‘is not necessarily entitled to compensation for the
value of attorney services according to [his] own notion or to the full extent
claimed by [him].’ ” (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc.¿(1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 807, 816.)¿¿Therefore, if the “time expended or the monetary charge
being made for the time expended are not reasonable under all the circumstances,
then the court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser
amount.” (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America¿(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99,
104.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            A court may
“reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a routine,
noncomplex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and
inflated fees resulted.”¿¿(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America¿(2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)¿¿It is also appropriate to reduce an award based on
inefficient or duplicative efforts. (Id.¿at p. 38.) However, the
analysis must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions of
fairness. (Kerkeles¿v. City of San Jose¿(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th
88,¿102.)¿¿Moreover, in conducting the analysis, courts are not permitted to
tie any reductions in the fee award to some proportion of the buyer’s damages
recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc.¿(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
39.)
 
Discussion
 
            This case
settled when Plaintiff accepted Defendant Ford’s offer under Code of Civil
Procedure section 998.  It appears no
discovery was done. Defendant removed the case to federal court, from whence,
on Plaintiff’s motion, it was promptly remanded. Plaintiff accepted an offer by
which he kept the vehicle and accepted $5,000.
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion states that attorney Isaac Kohen worked 50 hours and is entitled to a
rate of $525 per hour for a total of $26,250. 
Additionally, the motion states that attorney Tamara Imber worked 5.5
hours at $295 per hour, totaling $1,622.50, for a total lodestar of $27,872.50.
 The motion also seeks a 1.1 multiplier,
adding $2,787.25.  Plaintiff claims costs
of $1,192.27.  Plaintiff seeks a total
award of fees and costs of $31,852.02.
 
            Ford’s 998
offer included a provision that Plaintiff may request an award of fees and
costs recoverable under Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d).  The Court finds, and Defendant does not
dispute, that Plaintiff is a prevailing party for purposes of the Song Beverly
Act.
 
            Plaintiff argues that the attorneys’
hourly rates are reasonable, based on what has been awarded in other
cases.  He also summarizes the work done
and includes a table of time and services. 
 
            Defendant Ford states that before the
suit was filed, it offered Plaintiff $5,000, which was not accepted.  After suit was filed, Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s
998 offer of $5,000 which, as noted, also included a right to seek fees. Ford
argues that much of the fee request was for work unreasonably incurred.
Defendant also argues against a multiplier, as well as fees for bringing this
motion.
 
A
calculation of attorneys’ fees for a Song-Beverly action¿begins with the
“lodestar” approach, under which the Court fixes the lodestar¿at¿“the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”¿ (Margolin
v. Regional Planning Com.¿(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004-1005.)¿
“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ “ ‘The reasonable hourly
rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.’ ”¿ (Id.¿at p.
1004.)¿ The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services¿provided.¿ (Serrano v. Priest¿(1977) 20 Cal.3d
25, 49;¿PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler¿(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) 
 
            “[T]rial courts need not, and indeed
should not, become green-eyeshade accountants. The essential goal in shifting
fees (to either party) is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing
perfection. So trial courts may take into account their overall sense of a
suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an attorney's time.”
(Fox v. Vice (2011) 563 U.S. 826, 838.)
 
Hourly rate
 
The hourly rates to be used in computing the lodestar must be
“within the range of reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded
comparable attorneys for comparable work.” 
(Children's Hospital & Medical Center v. Bonta´ (2002) 97
Cal.App.4th 740, 783; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095  (“The reasonable hourly rate
is that prevailing in the community for similar work”).  Particularly where it is difficult to obtain
evidence of market based rates for the same type of work, the courts look at
fees charged for cases requiring similar skills.  (The Utility Reform Network v. Public
Utilities Com. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 522, 536–537; Prison Legal News v.
Schwarzenegger (9th Cir.2010) 608 F.3d 446, 454–455 (“all attorneys in the
community engaged in ‘equally complex Federal litigation,’ no matter the
subject matter”).  
 
            In determining the reasonable rate
and reasonable hours, the Court looks to that “prevailing in the community for
similar work.”  (PLCM Group, Inc.,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at 1095; Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at 1132
(“the lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the
community”).  “A reasonable trial court
might determine that the ‘similar work’ or ‘comparable legal services’ related
to insurance defense litigation, rather than to civil litigation in general.
Were the court to so conclude, it could view the relevant ‘market’ to be that
of insurance defense litigation and litigators, rather than general civil
litigation. The “market rate” for such services might be limited accordingly.
Again, we emphasize that such determinations lie within the broad discretion of
the trial court.”  (Syers Properties
III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 702–703.)
 
            The burden is on the fee applicant
to produce evidence that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing
in the community for similar work.  (ComputerXpress,
Inc. v. Jackson (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1019.)  “Affidavits of the plaintiffs' attorney and
other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community, and rate
determinations in other cases, particularly those setting a rate for the
plaintiffs' attorney, are satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market
rate.”  (Heritage Pacific Financial,
LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.)
 
            The trial court is not required to
adopt counsel’s opinion as to the “market rate” for services of the type
performed.  (Syers Properties III,
supra, 226 Cal.App.4th at 702.) 
The trial court may accept the actual rate charged as the reasonable
rate.  (Id.) 
 
            Attorney
Kohen attended University of La Verne and North Western California University
Schools of Law. He was admitted to practice in 2012 and has focused on lemon
law litigation.  The Court finds that the
reasonable hourly rate for Mr. Kohen is $475. 
Tamara Imber has been practicing lemon law litigation since 2021. The
Court finds that the reasonable hourly rate for Ms. Imber is $295.  
 
Excessive and improper time entries
 
            The Court
has examined in detail Plaintiff’s counsel’s time records.  The Court finds that many of the entries in
the time records Plaintiff submits were inadequately described, unnecessary, or
excessive.  The Court eliminated all
entries regarding client communications that did not disclose the general
subject matter of the communication. In the Court’s view, a general description
fulfills the moving party’s burden of demonstrating that the time is for legal
services that are reasonable and necessary while not disclosing attorney-client
communications.  Therefore, entries on
12/23/22, 1/10/23, 3/8/23, 3/20/23, 6/9/23, and 6/30/23, were discounted in
whole or in part.
 
            The Court
reduced or eliminated all entries for work that was generic or clerical.  The Court reduced the entry on 3/15/23 to 1.5
hours.  The Court reduced the complaint
drafting to .5 hours, because beyond pasting in a summary of repair notes, and altering
the paragraphs that describe the subject vehicle, it is a form pleading.  
 
            The Court
eliminated clerical functions, such as email with Legal Courier, reviewing a
proof of service, and drafting the summons and civil cover sheet. The Court
also reduced or eliminated entries such as reviewing notices and messages from
the federal court clerk and drafting and reviewing case management
statements.  The nine hours claimed for
drafting the fee motion is reduced to five hours.
 
            Mr. Kohen’s
reasonable hours are 29.8.
 
            Ms. Imber’s
hours are similarly reduced to 1.2.  
 
            The Court
concludes that the lodestar amount that is appropriate here is as follows:
 



Attorney


Hourly rate


Reasonable Hours


Total




Kohen


$475


29.8


$14,155




Imber


$295


1.2


354




Lodestar


 


 


$14,509




 


 


 


 



 
 
Multiplier
 
            Relevant
factors to determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  
 
            “The
purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the
particular action. In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether
the litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill
justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the
fair market rate for such services.”  (Santana
v. FCA US, LLC (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 334, 351.)
 
            “Perhaps
the most common multiplier applied, at least where a plaintiff prevails, is a
modifier for the contingent nature of the representation.”  (Id.) 
The court may not consider the contingent nature of the representation
in both setting the lodestar and applying a modifier.  (Id.) 
 
            Another
factor considered by a court in applying a multiplier is the “result
obtained.”  
“The ‘results obtained’ factor can properly be used to
enhance a lodestar calculation where an exceptional effort produced an
exceptional benefit.”  (Graham v.
DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 582.)  “The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a
fee at the fair market value for the particular action. In effect, the court
determines, retrospectively, whether the litigation involved a contingent risk
or required extraordinary legal skill justifying augmentation of the unadorned
lodestar in order to approximate the fair market rate for such services.”  (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819, 833.)   
 
            Plaintiff
fails to present any facts that would require a multiplier to compensate
counsel for their services at fair market value. The lodestar presented by
counsel, as adjusted by the Court, fixes the fee at fair market value.  The cases did not involve any novel legal
issues.  The amount the client obtained
was offered before litigation. There is no justification to apply a
multiplier.  
 
Costs
 
            Plaintiff
seeks court costs of $1,192.27.  This
amount was tallied in exhibit 2 to Mr. Kohen’s declaration filed as part of the
fee motion.  It does not appear, however,
that Plaintiff has filed and served a memorandum of costs. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1700.)  Defendant did not
contest the amount of costs Plaintiff seeks. 
Still, absent a memorandum of costs, the award of court costs is not
properly before the Court.  In reviewing
exhibit 2, it appears that most of the costs – for filing fees, service fees,
etc. – are appropriate.  Some others are
doubtful, such as postage and photocopying expenses. (Code. Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (b)(3).) There are two ways this gets resolved: (1) Plaintiff files the
cost memorandum and Defendant files a motion to tax costs, which is then
opposed and heard by the Court with an adjustment of a few hundred dollars, but
with the expenditure of perhaps several thousand dollars in fees by each side.  (2) The parties can confer and reach agreement
on costs. The Court is confident the parties will take the approach that is in
their mutual interests, because they settled the merits of this case.
 
Accordingly, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s request for court costs without prejudice to further proceedings under
the Code of Civil Procedure and the Rules of Court, or voluntary resolution by
the parties.
 
Conclusion
 
            The Court
awards Plaintiff attorney’s fees in the sum of $14,509.  Defendant shall pay to Plaintiff’s counsel
this sum on or before November 12, 2024.
