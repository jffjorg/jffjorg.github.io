Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED in its entirety. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has demonstrated compliance with the Tort Claims Act with respect to the eighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has presented a sufficient claim under the Fair Employment and Housing Act, and that the Defendant's demurrer to the ninth cause of action is OVERRULED. The Judge also finds that the Defendant's demurrer to the tenth cause of action is OVERRULED, as the principal thrust of this cause of action is injunctive relief for which presentation of a claim is not required. The Judge denies the Defendant's Motion to Strike, as it is integrated with the demurrer to the Complaint.
