  - A party seeking to seal a court record or seeking to file a record under seal must do so by motion or application supported by a declaration showing facts justifying the record's sealing.
  - The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored to shield only the materials which should be protected from disclosure, and that there is no less restrictive means to achieve the interest in protecting these materials from disclosure under that section.

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by Tristar Claims Management Services, Inc. (Plaintiff) to file Exhibit B of the Kunkel Declaration Under Seal. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant's principal misappropriated confidential and sensitive personal information belonging to Plaintiff's claimants. The Court finds that the materials to be sealed contain confidential personal information involving claimants, and thus there is an overriding constitutional privacy interest that overcomes the right of public access to these records. The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion and orders the sealing of the exhibit.
