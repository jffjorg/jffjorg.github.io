Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's decision on the motions to compel arbitration and consolidate actions in a wage-and-hour proposed class action case. The judge grants the motions to compel arbitration, ordering the individual claims to be arbitrated, and denies the motion to consolidate the actions. The judge also dismisses the class claims and stays the non-individual PAGA claims. The arbitrations of both claims are consolidated pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.3.
