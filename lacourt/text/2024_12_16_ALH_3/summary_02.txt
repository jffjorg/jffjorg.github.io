And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for a protective order filed by Frunzik Sargsyan, a defendant in a civil action, to stay the proceedings until the conclusion of his criminal and immigration proceedings. Sargsyan is charged with two felonies and is detained by ICE. The judge notes that Sargsyan's counsel reports that he is caught in an administrative impasse because the criminal proceedings cannot go forward while he is detained and removal proceedings in immigration court cannot commence until he has been convicted of a crime.

The judge grants the motion and stays the case only as to Sargsyan for six months, or until his criminal proceedings have concluded, whichever occurs first. The judge also sets a status conference for May 16, 2025, for the parties to provide an update regarding Sargsyan's criminal proceedings.
