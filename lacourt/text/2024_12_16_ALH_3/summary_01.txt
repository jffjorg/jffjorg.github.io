And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to reopen discovery, which was filed on October 21, 2024. The defendant had argued that discovery should be reopened to obtain information allegedly hidden by the plaintiff, including allegedly illegal evidence used to evade paying alimony and child support. The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the defendant had made no effort to conduct discovery over the past two years and that the discovery sought relates to alimony and child support issues, not the partition action.

The judge considered the relevant factors, including the necessity and reasons for the discovery, the diligence or lack of diligence of the parties, and the likelihood that permitting the discovery would prevent the case from going to trial on the scheduled date. The judge noted that the defendant failed to file a reply brief and did not address the plaintiff's claims regarding the defendant's lack of diligence or improper reasons for reopening discovery.

The judge ultimately denied the motion to reopen discovery, citing the defendant's lack of diligence and the failure to demonstrate a good faith effort at informal resolution. The judge ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
