And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for relief from waiver of objections to demand for inspection and form interrogatories. The defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, failed to serve responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests in a timely manner due to a mistake of counsel caused by health problems. The defendant's responses, which were served on September 10, 2024, appear to be complete and substantially code compliant. Since the plaintiff did not oppose the motion, the judge has granted the defendant relief from its waiver of objections. The defendant is hereby relieved from its waiver of objections in the responses to the plaintiff's form interrogatories and request for production of documents.
