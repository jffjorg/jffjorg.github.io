And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service of summons filed by the defendants. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff failed to properly serve them with the summons and complaint, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30. The plaintiff had attempted to serve the defendants via mail, but failed to include the required notice and acknowledgement forms or a return envelope. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to satisfy the burden to demonstrate jurisdiction and effective service of the summons and complaint. The motion to quash service of summons is granted, and the defendants are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
