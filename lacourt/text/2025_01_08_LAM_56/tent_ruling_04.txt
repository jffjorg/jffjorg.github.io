BACKGROUND
            On January 19, 2024, John Doe (“Plaintiff”)
filed the operative complaint (“Complaint”) against LAUSD, Gabriela Cortez
(Cortez) and Does 1 through 50 alleging causes of action for: (1) Sexual Abuse
of a Minor (against Cortez); (2) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
(against Cortez); (3) Sexual Assault and Battery (against Cortez); (4) Sexual
Harassment (against Cortez); (5) Negligent Hiring, Supervision, & Retention
of an Unfit Employee (against LAUSD): (6) Breach of Mandatory Duty: Failure to
Report Suspected Child Abuse [Gov. Code §815.6] (against LAUSD); (7) Negligent
Supervision of a Minor (against LAUSD); and (8) Negligence (as against Does 41
through 50). The Complaint alleges that Cortez, a teacher at Plaintiff’s
high-school, sexually abused Plaintiff while Plaintiff was a high-school
student. (Compl., ¶ 10.) 
 
            On October 2, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant motion for relief from waiver of objections to demand for
inspection and form interrogatories (the “Motion”). The Motion is unopposed.     
 
DISCUSSION
The trial court has broad discretion to
grant relief from waiver of objections on a noticed motion upon determining
that: (a) the moving party subsequently served discovery responses which are
substantially code compliant; and (b) the moving party’s failure to timely
serve responses “was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.”  (Code Civil Procedure (“CCP”), §§ 2030.290 subd. (a), 2031.300
subd. (a), and 2033.280 (a).) 
 
            Plaintiff
issued form interrogatories and requests for production to Defendant on May 16,
2024. (Mot., Ex. 1.) The parties agreed upon a response date of August 16,
2024. (Miller Decl., ¶ 4.) Counsel for Defendant states that he was suffering
from a medical condition at the time which prevented him from timely serving
responses. (Miller Decl., ¶ 5.) Defendant states that it served code-compliant
responses to the requested discovery on September 10, 2024, including a
privilege log. (Miller Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. 4.)
 
            Defendant’s
responses to the discovery appear to be complete and substantially code
compliant.  (Miller Decl., Ex. 4.) Defendant’s failure to serve the
responses in a timely manner appears to be due to a mistake of counsel caused
by health problems. (Miller Decl., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff has not opposed the
Motion. Thus, an order granting Defendant relief from its waiver of objections
is appropriate. 
 
 
            The Motion is GRANTED.  Defendant LAUSD is hereby RELIEVED from
its waiver of objections in the responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set
One and Request for Production of Documents, Set One. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
