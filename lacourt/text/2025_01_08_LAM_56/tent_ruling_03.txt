MOVING PARTY:  Plaintiffs Miguel Pascual, et al.
(collectively “Plaintiffs”)
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendants Shahco, Inc., Shahram Saba and Bahram “Bob” Saba
(collectively “Defendants”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving
and opposition papers.  
 
BACKGROUND
             This action arises out of a tenant-landlord
relationship. On October 19, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the operative complaint
(the “Complaint”) against Defendants and Does 1 through 10 alleging causes of
action for: (1) battery; (2) violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act; (3)
violation of the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act; (4) violation of Civil Code section
789.3; (5) forcible entry and detainer; (6) wrongful eviction; (7) violation of
the tenant anti-harassment ordinance; (8) conversion; (9) violation of Civil
Code section 1942.4; (10) breach of the implied warranty of habitability; and
(11) negligence. 
 
            On
November 18, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to deem the truth of the
matters stated in requests for admissions, set one (“RFAs”) to Shahco, Inc., admitted
(the “Motion.”) On December 23, 2024, Defendants filed an opposition to the
Motion (the “Opposition”). 
 
DISCUSSION
            A discovering party can make a
motion to deem as admitted any unanswered requests for admission or any
requests answered in a late or unverified response. (Code Civil Procedure
(“CCP”), § 2033.280, subd. (b); CCP, § 2033.240, subd. (a) [RFA responses must
be signed by responding party under oath]; Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no
response].) These requests are not automatically deemed admitted; the
discovering party must make the motion. (CCP, § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
To establish this ground, a movant must
show: (1) Proper service (CCP, § 2033.070); (2) Expiration of the deadline for
the initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties
(CCP, § 2033.250, subds. (a), (b)); and (3) That (a) the responding party
served no response (CCP, § 2033.280, subd. (b)), (b) the propounding party
served a late response (CCP, § 2033.280, subd. (b)); or (3) the responding
party served an unsworn response. (Appleton, supra, 206
Cal.App.3d at 636).
 
Plaintiff served RFAs upon Defendants on
August 22, 2024. (Belisle Decl., Exs. A-B.) As of the filing of the Motion,
Defendants had not provided any responses to the discovery. (Belisle Decl., ¶¶
10-11.) On December 23, 2024, Defendants served verified responses to the RFAs.
(Opp., Harvey Decl., Ex. A.) 
 
Thus, as Defendant has since provided the
requested discovery responses, the Motion is DENIED as MOOT. 
 
Request for Sanctions
The Court must award sanctions when a
party’s response to request for admissions is untimely, and the discovering
party makes a motion to deem the requests admitted. (CCP, § 2033.280, subd.
(c); Appleton, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at 635-636 [sanctions are
mandatory].)
 
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
 
Even after a party provides discovery
responses, a party can keep its motion on calendar and the court has authority
to grant sanctions, even if it denies the motion to compel responses “as
essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 409.) 
 
While verified discovery responses have
now been provided, sanctions are justified because Defendants’ initial failure
to respond compelled Plaintiffs to file this Motion. Plaintiffs request
sanctions against Defendants and their counsel of record in the amount of $1,727.57
based upon counsel’s rate of $550/hour for: (1) 1.0 hour drafting the Motion
and supporting papers; (2) 1.0 hour reviewing an opposition and preparing a reply;
(3) 1.0 hour to attend the hearing on this matter; and (4) $77.57 in filing
fees. The Court only awards filing fees in the amount charged by the Court,
which is $60.00. In addition, no reply has been filed and attending the hearing
will likely not take more than .5 hours. Thus, the request for sanctions is
GRANTED in the reduced amount of $1,160.00 
 
            Plaintiffs’ Motion is DENIED as
MOOT. The request for sanctions is
GRANTED. Defendants and their counsel of record are ordered to remit sanctions
to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,160.00 within 20 days of this order. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
