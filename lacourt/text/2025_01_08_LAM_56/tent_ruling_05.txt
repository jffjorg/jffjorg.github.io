MOVING PARTY:  Plaintiff Michaela Watkins (“Plaintiff”) 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants
JLR Newport Beach LLC and US Auto CA, LLC (“Defendants”) \
 
            The Court has considered the moving
and opposition papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             This is an employment action. On June 4, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the operative complaint (“Complaint”) against Defendants and
Does 1 to 50 alleging causes of action for: (1) wrongful termination in
violation of fundamental public policy; (2) retaliation; (3) discrimination in
violation of FEHA; (4) unpaid wages; (5) failure to pay all wages at time of
separation; and (6) Equal Pay Act violations. 
On July 30, 2024, the Court entered the
Joint Stipulation to Arbitrate Plaintiff’s Claims. On December 12, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion for an order to lift stay and request for sanctions
(the “Motion”). On December 20, 2027, Defendants filed an opposition (the
“Opposition”).      
 
TIMELINESS
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP)
section 1005 subdivision (b), “all moving and supporting papers shall be served
and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing” plus two calendar days for
service electronic service. Accordingly, Plaintiff was to serve the instant
Motion by December 9, 2024. Plaintiff served the Motion on Defendant on
December 12, 2024, which is untimely. The Court admonishes Plaintiff but will
exercise its discretion to consider the Motion on the merits. 
 
DISCUSSION
             “In an employment or consumer arbitration that
requires, either expressly or through application of state or federal law or
the rules of the arbitration provider, the drafting party to pay certain fees
and costs before the arbitration can proceed, if the fees or costs to initiate
an arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due date the
drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is in
default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel arbitration under
Section 1281.2.”  (CCP § 1281.97 subd. (a)(1).) 
 
“(b)If the drafting party materially
breaches the arbitration agreement and is in default under subdivision (a), the
employee or consumer may … [¶] (1) Withdraw the claim from arbitration and
proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.”  (CCP § 1281.97 subd. (b)(1).)   
“If
the employee or consumer proceeds with an action in a court of appropriate
jurisdiction, the court shall impose sanctions on the drafting party in
accordance with Section 1281.99.”  (CCP § 1281.97 subd. (d).) 
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.98, “[i]n an employment or consumer arbitration that requires,
either expressly or through application of state or federal law or the rules of
the arbitration provider, that the drafting party pay certain fees and costs
during the pendency of an arbitration proceeding, if the fees or costs required
to continue the arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the
due date, the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration
agreement, is in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel the
employee or consumer to proceed with that arbitration as a result of the
material breach.”  (CCP § 1281.98.)   
 
“(b) If the drafting party materially
breaches the arbitration agreement and is in default under subdivision (a), the
employee or consumer may unilaterally elect to … [¶] (1) Withdraw the claim
from arbitration and proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.” 
(CCP § 1281.98 subd. (b)(1).) 
 
“(c) If the employee or consumer withdraws
the claim from arbitration and proceeds in a court of appropriate jurisdiction
pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), both of the following apply: [¶]
(1) The employee or consumer may bring a motion, or a separate action, to
recover all attorney’s fees and all costs associated with the abandoned
arbitration proceeding. The recovery of arbitration fees, interest, and related
attorney’s fees shall be without regard to any findings on the merits in the
underlying action or arbitration. [¶] (2) The court shall impose sanctions on
the drafting party in accordance with Section 1281.99.”  (CCP § 1281.98
subd. (c).) 
Plaintiff seeks
to withdraw from arbitration and moves for an order vacating the stay of this
action pending arbitration on the grounds that Defendants have materially
breached the subject arbitration agreement and waived their right to
arbitration pursuant to CCP section 1281.97 et seq. 
 
The parties
filed a joint stipulation for binding arbitration and staying the instant
action pursuant to an arbitration agreement between Plaintiff and Defendants,
which the Court ordered on July 30, 2024. (Martinez Decl., ¶¶ 3, 5, Exs. A-B) On
September 11, 2024, Plaintiff submitted the matter to JAMS. (Martinez Decl., ¶
6.) On November 6, 2024, JAMS issued an invoice for $16,000.000 to Defendants,
with payment due upon receipt. (Levine Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 2) On November 21, 2024
and again on December 5, 2024, JAMS followed up with Defendant regarding the outstanding
amount due to them. (Levine Decl. ¶¶ 6-7, Exs. 3-5). On December 11, 2024 JAMS
confirmed that they received the payment from Defendants. (Martinez Decl., ¶¶
13-16, Exs. J-K.)
 
            Plaintiff argues that Defendants are in material breach of the
arbitration agreement under CCP section 1281.97 because Defendants failed to
pay the arbitration retainer within 30 days of the due date and have thus
waived any right to compel arbitration. Plaintiff contends that the Court
should vacate its prior order staying this action pending arbitration and
should award monetary sanctions in the amount of $5,087.50. 
 
            Defendants
argue in opposition that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) preempts the
application of CCP section 1281.97 (see Hernandez v. Sohnen Enterprises,
Inc. (2024) 102 Cal.App.5th 222.) Defendants also argue that JAMS has not
terminated arbitration for nonpayment and that a late payment alone is not
sufficient to constitute a material breach. 
 
In Hernandez, an employer did not
pay arbitration costs within 30 days of the due date and the employee filed a
motion to withdraw from arbitration and litigate in state court as permitted
under section 1281.97. The Court held that the arbitration agreement is governed
by the FAA, both substantively and procedurally, rather than California’s
arbitration laws. Further, the Court held that when an agreement falls within
the scope of the FAA and does not expressly adopt California arbitration laws,
the FAA preempts the provisions of section 1281.97 that mandate findings of
breach and waiver. As the Court reasoned, because the arbitration agreement
states, “this agreement is governed by the FAA,” the statement is broad and
encompasses both the procedural and substantive provisions of the FAA. (Id.
at 241.) Further, there was no provision explicitly referring to California law
in the agreement. (Id. at 242.) The parties selected the procedural
provisions of the FAA, and therefore, the procedures of the California Arbitration
Act (“CAA”), including section 1281.97, do not apply. (Id.)  
 
Here, however, the arbitration agreement
between the parties is governed by both the FAA and the CAA. The agreement explicitly
states that “the arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
and in conformity with the procedures of the California Arbitration Act
(California Code of Civil Procedure § 1286 et seq.).” (Levine Decl., Ex. A, § 3)

 
Hernandez explicitly held
that “[e]ven if [the Court] were to conclude that section 1281.97 applies,
however, [the Court] would still reverse, because when an agreement falls
within the scope of the FAA and does not expressly adopt California arbitration
laws, the FAA preempts the provisions of section 1281.97 that mandate findings
of breach and waiver.” (Hernandez, supra, 102 Cal.App.5th, 296.)
In other words, since the parties here explicitly adopted Sections 1286, et
seq., the FAA cannot preempt the provisions of section 1281.97 that mandate
findings of breach and waiver.  
 
As such, Defendants waived their right to
arbitrate by failing to pay arbitration fees in a timely manner because Section
1281.97 is explicitly applicable to this arbitration agreement sought to be
enforced.¿ 
            
            Thus, Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED.
 
Request
for Sanctions
 “The
court shall impose a monetary sanction against a drafting party that materially
breaches an arbitration agreement pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section
1281.97 or subdivision (a) of Section 1281.98, by ordering the drafting party
to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred
by the employee or consumer as a result of the material breach.” (CCP, § 1281.99
subd. (a).) 
 
            Plaintiff seeks $5,087.50 in
sanctions based upon counsel’s rate of $625/hour for: (1) 5.5 hours preparing
the arbitration demand. conferring
over arbitrator selection, interacting with JAMS, and drafting the Motion; (2)
2.0 hours considering the Opposition and preparing for and attending the
hearing on this matter; and (3) $400 in filing fees in connection with the
arbitration demand. 
 
            Because Defendants materially
breached the arbitration agreement pursuant to CCP section 1281.97 subdivision
(a)(1) by not paying the costs to initiate the arbitration proceeding within 30
days after the due date, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED. 
 
            The Motion is GRANTED. The stay is
lifted and Defendants are ordered to file an answer to the Complaint within 30
days of this order. 
 
            Defendants are ordered to pay
sanctions in the amount of $5,087.50 to Plaintiff within 30 days of this order.

 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
