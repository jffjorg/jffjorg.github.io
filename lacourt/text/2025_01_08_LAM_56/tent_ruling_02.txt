MOVING
PARTY:  Defendants Khaula Azher, aka
Khaula Mehmoud and Nadia Mufti (collectively “Defendants”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Anes Mufti
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This is a defamation action. On
September 5, 2024, Plaintiff, in pro per, filed a complaint (“Complaint”)
against Defendants alleging causes of action for: (1) conspiracy; (2) slander
per se; (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (4) gross negligence;
(5) negligence; (6) negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
 
            On
October 11, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion to quash service of
summons (the “Motion”). On October 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition (the
“Opposition”). On January 2, 2025, Defendants filed a reply (the “Reply”).           
 
DISCUSSION
            A defendant may move “[t]o quash service
of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her”
on or before the last day they may plead. (Code Civil Procedure (“CCP”), §
418.10, subd. (a)(1).) “When a defendant challenges the court's personal
jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the
facts requisite to an effective service.’ ” (Summers v. McClanahan
(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413 quoting Dill v. Berquist Construction Co.¿(1994)
24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439–1440.) 
 
The defendant should attach evidence to
support its motion. (See School Dist. of Okaloosa Cty. v. Superior Court
(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1126, 1131 [defendant must present some admissible
evidence in form of affidavits or declarations to place issue of lack of
jurisdiction before court]; see, e.g., Aquila, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 563 [defendant supported motion to quash with
declarations]; cf. Floveyor Int’l v. Superior Court (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 789, 793-794 [“‘A defendant who takes the position that the service
of summons as made upon him did not bring him within the jurisdiction of the
court’[] may serve and file a notice of motion to quash the service,’” where
“‘the effect of such a notice is to place upon the plaintiff the burden of
proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction … [or] the facts
requisite to a[] [showing of] effective service’” (citations omitted].)
 
            Defendants assert that on October 11, 2024,
Plaintiff improperly served a summons and complaint via priority mail rather
than first-class mail as required by CCP section 415.30 and Plaintiff failed to
include the notice and acknowledgement forms or a return envelope (Mot. p. 5:13-21).
Defendants further assert that Plaintiff did not file a proof of service with
the Court. (Mot. p. 7:7-10) 
            
            In opposition, Plaintiff asserts
that Defendants were properly served via mail on September 10 and 11, 2024 and
that proof of service was filed with the Court on September 19, 2024. (Opp. ¶ 2)
Plaintiff also asserts that this Motion violates CCP section 418.10 subdivision
(b) because the hearing was set more than thirty days after filing of the
notice and that he was not served with notice of the instant Motion. (Opp. ¶¶ 1,
3) 
 
            In reply, Defendants assert that although
Plaintiff’s process server states that he made multiple attempts to serve the
Defendants personally and left the documents at the front door on September 8,
2024, they only received the documents via mail on September 11, 2024. (Reply ¶¶
3-4) Defendants also assert that the first available date to schedule this
hearing was at the end of December 2024, and that January 8, 2025 was the first
date Defendants were available. (Reply ¶ 12)   
 
            The proofs of service filed with the
Court on September 19, 2024, state that service was accomplished via United
States mail and by overnight delivery. (9/19/24 Proof of Service as to Khaula
Azher; 9/19/24 Proof of Service as to Nadia Mufti.) The proofs of service do
not, however, demonstrate compliance with CCP section 415.30, subdivision (a),
that two copies of the Notice of Acknowledgement of Receipt and a postage-paid
return envelope were included in the service. (Id.) Copies of the served
documents and a completed Notice and Acknowledgment of Receipt are not attached
to the proofs of service. “Service of a summons pursuant to this section is
deemed complete on the date a written acknowledgment of receipt of summons is
executed, if such acknowledgment thereafter is returned to the sender.” (CCP, §
415.30, subd. (c).) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff failed to satisfy the
burden to demonstrate facts requisite to effective service of the summons and
complaint. 
 
            The Motion to Quash Service of
Summons is GRANTED. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 8th day of January 2025
