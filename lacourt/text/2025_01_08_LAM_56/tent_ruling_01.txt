            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             This is a habitability action. On November 28,
2022, Plaintiffs filed the operative complaint (“Complaint”) against defendants
Hwang, Guochang
International, Inc. and Does 1 through 10 (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging
causes of action for: (1) recission; (2) negligence – premises liability; (3)
breach of implied warranty of habitability/tenantability; (4) breach of implied
covenant of quiet enjoyment; (5) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair
dealing; (6) violation of Civil Code § 1942.4; (7) unfair business practices § 17200;
and (8) Rosenthal Act Violation – Civil Code § 1788 et seq.
 
            On October 21, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed the instant motion for summary adjudication (the “Motion”). On December
23, 2024, Hwang opposed the Motion (the “Opposition”). On December 31, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a reply (the “Reply”).    
 
JUDICIAL NOTICE 
Pursuant to
Evidence Code section 452, subdivisions (d) and (h), the Court may take
judicial notice of “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court
of record of the United States or of any state of the United States” and “facts
and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy” (Evid. Code, § 452 subds (d), (h).) 
 
The court,
however, may not take judicial notice of the truth of the contents of the
documents. (Herrera v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.) Documents are only judicially noticeable to show their
existence and what orders were made such that the truth of the facts and
findings within the documents are not judicially noticeable. (Lockley v. Law
Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th
875, 885.)     
 
            Pursuant
to Plaintiff’s request, the Court takes judicial notice of the following: (1) Plaintiffs’
Complaint; (2) Defendant Dolly Hwang’s Answer; (3) Defendant Guochang
International, Inc.’s Answer; (4) Hwang v. Demarest: Unlawful Detainer
Complaint (2022) –

Assessor Property Information. 
 
DISCUSSION
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section
437c subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all
the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)¿¿¿ 
 
As to each cause of action as framed by
the complaint, the party moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication
must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one
or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that
there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (CCP § 437c subd. (p)(2); Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party
opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor
of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384,
389.)¿¿¿ 

 
Once the moving party has met that burden,
the burden shifts to the opposing party to show that a triable issue of one or
more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)¿¿¿ 
 
            Plaintiffs move for summary
adjudication of their third cause of action for breach of the implied warranty
of habitability, sixth cause of action for violation of section 1942.4 of the
Civil Code, and eighth cause of action for violation of the Rosenthal Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act (“Rosenthal Act”). 
 
            As an initial matter, the Court
emphasizes that CCP section 437c does not permit piecemeal adjudication of
facts. CCP § 437c(f)(1) provides, in pertinent part, “[a] motion for summary
adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of
action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.” “The
purpose of the enactment of¿Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision
(f)¿was to stop the practice of piecemeal adjudication of facts that did not
completely dispose of a substantive area.” (Catalano v. Superior Court
(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 91, 97.) Summary adjudication of an issue may be
appropriate when a defendant is the moving party because a defendant need only
disprove one element of a cause of action. (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) By contrast,
when the moving party is the plaintiff, the plaintiff must prove each element.
(CCP § 437c(p)(1).)
 
Third Cause of
Action, Breach of the Implied Warranty of Habitability 
“[T]here is a warranty of habitability
implied in residential leases in California.” (Erlach v. Sierra Asset Servicing,
LLC (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1296.) The elements of a claim for breach
of the warranty of habitability are “the existence of a material defective
condition affecting the premises’ habitability, notice to the landlord of the
condition within a reasonable time after the tenant’s discovery of the
condition, the landlord was given a¿reasonable time to correct the deficiency,
and resulting damages.” (Id. at p. 1297.)  
 
Plaintiffs argue that they have
established their cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of
habitability because multiple defective conditions existed at the property.
(Motion, pp. 11-15) Plaintiffs attach evidence of various substandard living
conditions found at the subject property (Separate Statement, Nos. 7-28) Plaintiffs
do not otherwise substantively address the other elements of a habitability
cause of action, i.e. whether notice was given within a reasonable time
after the tenants discovered the issues, whether the landlord was given a reasonable
time to correct the deficiencies, or the amount of damages. Plaintiffs merely conclusorily
state that “City of Arcadia housing officials repeatedly notified Defendants of
the same illegal and uninhabitable conditions which persisted unaddressed over
the course of years.” (Mot. p. 7:20-22.) To obtain a judgment, the Plaintiffs
must establish each element necessary to prove a breach of the implied warranty
of habitability. (CCP § 437c(p)(1).) Plaintiffs have not established a prima
facie showing that no triable issue of material fact exists because Plaintiffs do
not prove each element of a breach of the implied warranty of habitability
cause of action. 
 
The Court further notes that, even if
Plaintiffs had met their burden to establish a prima facie case, Hwang presents
sufficient evidence of triable issues of material fact. Hwang argues in
opposition that whether there has been a breach of warranty of habitability and
the amount of alleged damages are questions of fact. (Opp. p. 6:10-16.) In her
declaration, Hwang also presents evidence showing that upon receiving the
various notices of violations, the cited conditions were corrected, except for
those issues where Plaintiffs denied access to the property for repairs (Hwang
Decl. ¶¶ 6-12, 16, Exs. B-C) Hwang also asserts that mold remediation was
completed and contends that the other habitability issues addressed by Plaintiffs
were caused by Plaintiffs’ own actions or negligence. (Hwang Decl. ¶¶ 13-14, 18,
Exs. C-D) 
 
Thus, because triable issues of material
fact exist as to the breach of warranty of habitability cause of action, the
Motion is DENIED as to the third cause of action. 
 
Sixth Cause of
Action, Violation of Civil Code § 1942.4
Civil Code section 1942.4 forbids a
landlord to collect rent if all the following conditions exist: first, the
landlord has failed to maintain the property in a habitable state; second, a
public officer has notified the landlord of the need to correct the
uninhabitable conditions; third, the conditions persist at least thirty-five
(35) days after the notice was served; and fourth, the conditions were not
caused by an act or omission of the tenant. (Civ. Code § 1942.4, subd. (a).)
 
Plaintiffs present evidence that Defendants
attempted to or did collect rent amidst the ongoing habitability concerns (Sep.
Statement, Nos. 29-43.) In opposition, Hwang asserts Plaintiffs did not pay
rent for two and a half years while occupying the premises. (Hwang Decl., ¶
18.) In addition, as discussed above, there are triable issues of material fact
regarding whether the property was maintained in a habitable state, whether the
proper notification and time to repair processes were followed, and whether the
conditions were caused by acts or omissions of the tenants. 
 
Thus, the Motion is DENIED as to the sixth
cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 1942.4. 
 
Eighth Cause of
Action, Rosenthal Act Violation [Civil Code § 1788 et seq.] 
The purpose of the Rosenthal Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act (“Rosenthal Act”) is to “prohibit debt collectors from
engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the collection of consumer
debts and to require debtors to act fairly in entering into and honoring such
debts, as specified in this title.” (Civ. Code, § 1788.1.) A “debt collector”
under the Rosenthal Act is “any person who, in the ordinary course of business,
regularly, on behalf of himself or herself or others, engages in debt
collection.” (Civ. Code, § 1788.2 subd. (c).) A “debt collection” is “any act
or practice in connection with the collection of consumer debts.” (Civ. Code, §
1788.2 subd. (b).) A “consumer debt” is “money, property or their equivalent,
due or owing or alleged to be due or owing from a natural person by reason of a
consumer credit transaction.” (Civ. Code, § 1788.2 subd. (f).) A “consumer
credit transaction” is a “transaction between a natural person and another
person in which property, services or money is acquired on credit by that
natural person from such other person primarily for personal, family, or
household purposes.” (Civ. Code, § 1788.2(e).) 

 
Plaintiffs assert that Defendants violated
the Rosenthal Act because they collected or attempted to collect rent in
violation of Civil Code section 1942.4 and alternatively because the subject
property qualifies as an illegal boarding house and thus the leases are void
and unenforceable. Plaintiff presents evidence that the subject property is
zoned single family residential (Separate Statement No. 6; RJN Exs. 1K, 1M) but
that there are at least four separate rental agreements for the premises (Separate
Statement No. 6; RJN Exs. 1G-J). Thus, Plaintiffs have provided evidence that Defendants
violated the Rosenthal Act by collecting rent on illegal and unenforceable
leases. The burden thus shifts to Defendants to show that triable issues of
material fact exist.
 
In opposition, Hwang asserts that the
property is not an illegal boarding house. In her sworn declaration, Hwang states
that the “property contains four separate, legally permitted dwelling units as
confirmed by the City of Arcadia’s official records, including: One unit on the
ground floor of the primary building; Two units upstairs in the primary
building, one of which is the Premises; One detached unit in the rear of the
property. The upstairs unit in question is legally permitted and has been
leased as a standalone unit since its approval.” (Hwang Decl., ¶ 5; Response to
Separate Statement No. 6.) The Court notes that Hwang does not otherwise
present the referenced city records or other evidence that the property is
zoned for separate units. Because the Court is required to “liberally construe
the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve
doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party” (Dore v. Arnold
Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389), the Court tenuously accepts, for
purposes of this Motion, that a triable issue of fact exists as to whether the
property is legally zoned for its current use. 

 
Thus, the Motion is DENIED as to the
eighth cause of action for violation of the Rosenthal Act. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion for Summary
Adjudication is DENIED. 
 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
