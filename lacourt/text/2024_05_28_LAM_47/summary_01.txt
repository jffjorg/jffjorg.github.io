And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"In this tentative ruling, the court denies the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The court finds that the plaintiff's motion does not comply with California Rule of Court 3.1324, which requires that a motion to amend a pleading include a copy of the proposed amendment, state which allegations are proposed to be deleted or added, and provide a supporting declaration. The court also finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate why an amendment is necessary and proper. The court exercises its discretion liberally in favor of amendments, but finds that the plaintiff's showing is meager and does not demonstrate that leave to amend is proper at this time."
