STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a wage and hour action. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants never
paid him for work performed during his employment with Defendants. 
 
Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees
following entry of default judgment. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees
following entry of default judgment. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment filed March 5, 2024 sought only money damages and PAGA penalties, not
attorney fees, whether by specified amount or by subsequent motion. (March 5,
2024 Judgment.) Thus, to obtain an award of attorney’s fees, amendment of the
judgment is required, which may only be done in accordance with statutory
procedures. (APRI Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 176,
182.) Here, though, Plaintiff’s papers do not request amendment of the
judgment, nor do they disclose, on their face, a clerical error that would
require amendment of the judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
473(d), nor do they demonstrate that amendment is appropriate under the
catch-all provision of section 187. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 187; 473(d).) The Court
therefore finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated entitlement to an award of
attorney’s fees at this juncture. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Attorney’s Fees is DENIED, without prejudice. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
