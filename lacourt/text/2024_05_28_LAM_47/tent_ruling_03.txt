TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Robert D. Finkle moves to
be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Herbert Capital, LLC
 
Moving Counsel filed two of the
three required forms (MC-051 and -052) and included a proof of service as
required by California Rules of Court rule 3.1362(d). Moving Counsel’s
declaration states that he served Plaintiff by mail and electronic service
using the electronic address with which he has communicated with the client
within the last thirty days. (MC-052 ¶ 3.) The record shows, however, that
Moving Counsel has not served or filed the requisite proposed order. (MC-053.)
Accordingly, the Court directs Moving Counsel to file and serve the required
form forthwith on his client and all parties to the action and file proof of
service with the Court. 
 
            Attorney
Robert D. Finkle’s Motion to be Relived as Counsel is CONTINUED to Friday, June
28, 2024, at 9:00 AM. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
