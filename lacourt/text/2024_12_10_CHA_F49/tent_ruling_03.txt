MOVING PARTY: Defendant Chad M. Schott
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs Richard Jones and
Olivia Chan-Jones
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order sustaining Defendant Chad M. Schott’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The Demurrer
is OVERRULED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an alleged breach of an oral
agreement between the parties regarding the sale of the property located at
24400 Cavaliani Place, Valencia, CA 91355-6054 (the “Subject Property”). (Comp.
¶ 1.)
 
On August 23, 2024, Plaintiffs Richard Jones and Olivia
Chan-Jones (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed the Complaint against Defendants
Chad M. Schott (“Chad”), Brooke K. Schott (“Brooke”) (collectively,
“Defendants”), alleging the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract,
(2) Fraud, and (3) Declaratory Relief.
 
On October 23, 2024, Defendant Chad filed the instant
Demurrer to the Complaint. Subsequently, Plaintiffs filed their Opposition on
November 25, 2024, and Defendant Chad filed a Reply on November 27, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds
for which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of
which the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of
a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions
of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) 
 
At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege
ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the
claim against them. (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 714, 721.) “In the
construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its
allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice
between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “treat[s] the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law[.]” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007)
152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525 (Berkley).) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated. (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
A.    Meet
and Confer
 
A party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in person
or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) A failure to meet and confer does not constitute
grounds to sustain or overrule a demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41,
subd. (a)(4).)
 
Here, Defendants’ counsel, Christina Hahn (“Hahn”), declares
on September 13, 2024, she telephoned Plaintiffs’ counsel of record, Howard S.
Rosen (“Rosen”) to meet and confer, discussing Defendants’ intention to file
the Demurrer and the supporting legal grounds. (Hahn Decl. ¶ 2.) Following the
call, Hahn sent an email confirming the phone conversation. (Ibid.) On
September 18, 2024, Rosen responded by email, indicating that Plaintiffs would
not amend the Complaint. (Hahn Decl. ¶ 3.) Subsequently, on September 23, 2024,
Defendants filed a Declaration of Demurring or Moving Party in support of Automatic
Extension, extending the deadline to file a responsive pleading to November 6,
2024, from the initial deadline of October 7, 2024. (Id. ¶ 4.) 
 
Based on the above records, the Court finds that Defendant
Chad’s meet and confer efforts satisfy the requirements for an in-person or
telephonic meet and confer, as mandated by the Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41, subdivision (a).
 
B.     First Cause of Action – Breach of Contract
 
A plaintiff must plead the following
elements for a breach of contract cause of action: (1) the existence of
contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the
defendant’s’ breach (or anticipatory breach), and (4) resulting damage to
plaintiff. (Reichert v. General Ins. Co. (1968) 68 Cal.2d 822, 830.) 
 
“A written
contract may be pleaded either by its terms – set out verbatim in the complaint
or a copy of the contract attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by
reference – or by its legal effect. [Citations.] In order to plead a contract
by its legal effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the substance of its relevant
terms. This is more difficult, for it requires a careful analysis of the
instrument, comprehensiveness in statement, and avoidance of legal
conclusions.’ [Citation.]” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013)
215 Cal.App.4th 972, 993.)
 
“An oral contract may be pleaded generally as to its effect ... because
it is rarely possible to allege the exact words. Further, a demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where the complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.)
 
Defendant Chad contends that the
first cause of action for Breach of Contract fails to allege facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action, arguing that the Complaint is vague, ambiguous
and uncertain regarding the terms of the contract. (Dem. at p. 2.)
Specifically, Chad asserts that specific terms of the alleged contract – such
as duties of the parties, conditions and expiration of the agreement, and which
defendant spoke to which plaintiff – were not made known to the Defendants. (Ibid.)
Additionally, Chad claims that the Complaint suffers from uncertainty due to
the significant time gap between 2010 to 2024, with insufficient information
provided to address this period. (Ibid.)
 
The Court notes that the
Complaint alleges that “PLAINTIFFS and SCHOTTS entered into an oral
agreement for the sale of the property to PLAINTIFFS for a maximum of $270,000,
minus a reduction in the principal of the mortgage from the amount of the
inflated monthly mortgage Payments PLAINTIFFS were making, at a time when PLAINTIFFS
could qualify for a mortgage in their own names. In the interim PLAINTIFFS
agreed to occupy the PROPERTY, and make the inflated mortgage payments to SCHOTTS
to keep the existing mortgage current, prevent foreclosure and reduce the
principal owed on the mortgage loan for the benefit of PLAINTIFFS.” (Compl. ¶ 4.)
 
The Court finds that the above allegations set forth with specificity
the legal effect of the alleged oral agreement, including its essential terms
and each party’s respective duties. 
 
Additionally, the Court finds that the timeline as alleged in the
Complaint is clear and specific. The Complaint states: “Plaintiffs moved into
the PROPERTY in 2010 and began making mortgage payments directly to SCHOTT ....
On or about June 5, 2024, PLAINTIFFS notified SCHOTTS that PLAINTIFFS were then
prepared to obtain their own mortgage and have the PROPERTY placed in their
names. SCHOTTS refused to abide by the terms of the oral agreement...” (Compl. ¶ 6.) 
 
Defendant Chad fails to cite any legal authorities supporting his argument
that the alleged 14-year period of continued performance by Plaintiffs is unfairly
uncertain or negates any required elements of the cause of action. (See Khoury,
supra, 14 Cal.App.4th at p. 616 [“Although appellant alleged no specific
duration of the agreement, the law implies a reasonable term and, even assuming
the contract to be terminable at will, requires the giving of reasonable notice
prior to termination.”])
 
Therefore, the Court finds Chad’s argument as to the sufficiency and
uncertainties for the first cause of action to be unpersuasive. 
 
Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES the Demurrer as to the first cause of
action.
 
C.    Second Cause of Action – Fraud
 
To state a claim for fraud, a
plaintiff must plead all of the following elements: (1) misrepresentation;
(2)¿knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to induce reliance; (4) justifiable
reliance; and (5) resulting damage. (Odorizzi v. Bloomfield School Dist.
(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 123, 128; Wilhelm v. Pray, Price, Williams &
Russell (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1324, 1332.) Fraud actions are subject to
strict requirements of particularity in pleading. (Committee on Children’s
Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216.)
Particularity requires facts that show how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were tendered. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996)
12¿Cal.4th 631, 645 (Lazar).)
 
Defendant Chad asserts that
Plaintiffs do not provide the information of the names of the persons who made
the representations, to whom they spoke, what they said and wrote, or when it
was said or written, failing to meet the strict requirements of particularity
in pleading. (Dem. at p. 3.)
 
Plaintiffs contend that the factual
allegations satisfy the requirements of particularity. Specifically, the
Complaint alleges that Defendants made misrepresented that they would sell the
Subject Property to Plaintiffs for a maximum of $270,000 minus a reduction in
the principal of the mortgage from the amount of the inflated monthly mortgage
payments Plaintiffs were making. (Compl. ¶¶ 4, 11(a), (b), (f), and (g), and 16.) “At the time
SCHOTTS made the above representations, SCHOTTS knew the statements were false
and SCHOTTS made the statements knowing that PLAINTIFFS would, and did in fact,
reasonably rely on them.” (Id. ¶
17.) Plaintiffs allege that, in reasonable reliance on SCHOTTS’s
representations: they “... lived in the PROPERTY since 2010, made mortgage over
and above the real mortgage payment amount, made numerous expensive upgrades
and repairs to the PROPERTY and refrained from entering into the residential
real estate market other than in the transaction with SCHOTTS.” (Id. ¶ 19.) Additionally, Plaintiffs
claim to have sustained damages “in an amount to be proven at trial but at a
minimum in the sum of $789,600.00.” (Id. ¶ 20.) The Court may also reasonably infer that the
misrepresentation occurred “in or about January 2010,” as alleged in the same
paragraph where the representation is alleged. (Compl. ¶ 4.)
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that
the Complaint’s factual allegations, on their face, satisfy the requirements of
particularity and adequately plead all required elements for a fraud cause of
action.
 
Therefore, the Court OVERRULES the
Demurrer as to the second cause of action.
 
D.   
Third Cause of Action – Declaratory
Relief
 
“To qualify for declaratory relief, a
party would have to demonstrate its action presented two essential elements:
(1) a proper subject of declaratory relief, and (2) an actual controversy
involving justiciable questions relating to the party’s rights or obligations.”
(Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909.) A
complaint for declaratory relief is legally sufficient if it sets forth facts
showing the existence of an actual controversy relating to the legal rights and
duties of the respective parties under a contract and requests that these
rights and duties be adjudged by the court. Maguire v. Hibernia Savings
& Loan Soc. (1945) 23 Cal.2d 719.)
 
The Complaint alleges that
“PLAINTIFFS repeat and re-allege Paragraph 1 through 7 ... and Paragraph 9
through 13 inclusive of the First Cause of Action and Paragraph 16 through 19
of the Second Cause of Action ...” (Compl. ¶ 23.) Furthermore, Plaintiff asserts that “[a]n
actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the parties as to the
right to own the PROPERTY.” (Id. ¶
24.)
 
The allegations here leave no doubt
of the asserted existence of actual controversies between the parties,
including disputes regarding the validity of the 2010 oral agreement, the respective
rights and duties of the parties, and Plaintiff’s right to own the Subject
Property.
 
Based on the above, the Court
OVERRULES the Demurrer as to the third cause of action.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Chad M.
Schott’s Demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED.
 
Defendant Chad M.
Schott is ordered to serve and file an Answer to the
Complaint within 30 days.
