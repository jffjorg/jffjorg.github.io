REQUESTED: An

TENTATIVE
RULING: The

BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from damages that Plaintiffs sustained as
a result of Defendant’s alleged breach of the lease contract.
 
On February 3, 2023, Plaintiffs Michele Temm (“Michele”) and
Peyton Temm (“Peyton”), through her Guardian ad Litem Michele (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”), initiated this action. 
 
On July 18, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants Andriy Ishuninov (“Ishuninov” or
“Defendant”), and Does 1 through 20, rending moot a demurrer filed by Defendant
on May 29, 2024. The FAC alleges five causes of action: (1) Breach of
Contract/Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment/Warranty of Habitability, (2) Tortious
Breach of the Implied Warranty of Habitability, (3) Negligence, (4) Private
Nuisance, and (5) Violation of Unfair Business Practices. Subsequently,
Plaintiffs named and served Defendants The Madison at Town Center, and Baljit
Grewal, on November 26, and 27, 2024, respectively.
 
On July 24, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel Daniel J. Lavi (“Counsel”)
filed the instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel as to Peyton (the “Motion”).
 
            No Opposition papers have been
received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
The court may
order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after
judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and
after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.) An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)
            In
addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subsection (d) requires that
the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on
the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal
service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must
be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either:
            (A) The service address is the current residence or
business address of the client; or
(B)
The service address is the last known residence or business address of the
client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after
making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the
motion to be relieved.
 
            (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(1)(A) & (2).)
 
Here, Counsel has filed Judicial Council Forms MC-051 and
MC-052. Counsel has also lodged Judicial Council Form MC-053 with the Court. 
 
Counsel has provided a
declaration stating that the Motion is necessitated by “breakdown in the
working relationship with the client.” (MC-025, ¶ 2.) Additionally, Counsel states
that “The specific facts which give rise to this motion are confidential and
required to be kept confidential pursuant to Business and Professions Code § 6068(e).
In the event that
this Court desires further information to ascertain the good faith basis for
this motion and for withdrawal, it is respectfully requested that the court
have an in camera hearing outside of the presence of all other parties so that
the specific facts demonstrating good cause for this withdrawal may be
demonstrated to the court. See, e.g., Manfredi & Levine v Superior
Court, 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1136-1137, 3-700(B) or (C).” (Ibid.) 
 
The Court finds Counsel’s reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory.
Counsel states in his declaration that the Motion was served by mail at Peyton’s
last known address. (MC-052, ¶ 3(a)(2).) Additionally, Counsel has confirmed
that this address is current by verifying the current address on the form
submitted to his firm by Peyton’s Guardian ad Litem. (Ibid.) Proof of
Service has been attached to the Motion papers, demonstrating proper service on
Peyton and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
 
Counsel indicates on the MC-053 form that the next hearing
scheduled for this action is Hearing on Demurrer, set for July 31, 2024, at
8:30 a.m. in Department F49 at 9425 Penfield Ave., Chatsworth, CA 91311.
(MC-052, ¶ 4.) A jury trial is not yet set. (Id. ¶ 6.)) Since this date has passed, the information needs to be
updated to reflect all future hearing dates and places.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel, subject to the condition that Counsel submits an updated
MC-053 form, reflecting all future hearing dates and places, within 5 days of
this order.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Peyton Temm’s Counsel Daniel J. Lavi’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED, subject to the condition that Counsel submits an updated
MC-053 form, reflecting all future hearing dates and places, within 5 days of
this order.
 
Moving counsel to give notice.
