The judge has granted the motion of Counsel Daniel J. Lavi to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Peyton Temm, subject to the condition that Counsel submits an updated MC-053 form reflecting all future hearing dates and places within 5 days of this order. The judge finds that Counsel's reasons for seeking relief, including a breakdown in the working relationship with the client, are satisfactory. The judge also notes that Counsel has properly served the motion on the client and all other parties. The next hearing scheduled for this action is Hearing on Demurrer, which has already passed, and the judge requires Counsel to update the MC-053 form to reflect all future hearing dates and places.
