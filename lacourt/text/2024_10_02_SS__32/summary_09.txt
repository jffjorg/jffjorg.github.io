And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Tara Hargrove's application for Adam J. Kress to appear as counsel pro hac vice. The application was incomplete, as Kress failed to list the courts to which he has been admitted, failed to state that he is not a resident of California, and failed to provide proof of service by mail on all parties and the State Bar of California. Despite Kress having filed the verified application and paying the $500 filing fee, the application was denied due to these deficiencies. The judge has ordered Plaintiff to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service.
