And here is a summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Sandi Korsen's motion for summary adjudication on the issue of punitive damages. The court has found that there is a dispute of fact as to whether Defendant provided her contact information to Plaintiff after the accident. However, the court has also found that there is no evidence that Defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of her conduct and that she willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences. As a result, the court has granted the motion for summary adjudication, finding that the punitive damages claim cannot be proven by clear and convincing evidence.
