And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Rouzbeh Zarrinbakhsh's motion for relief from potential waiver of trial by jury. Plaintiff failed to pay a jury fee of $150 within 365 days of filing the complaint, which resulted in the waiver of his right to a jury trial. However, Plaintiff's counsel claims that they did not learn of the failure until a review of the Court's register of actions in July 2024, and that the Defendants will not be prejudiced if the waiver is granted. The Court finds that no prejudice has been identified, and in line with the public policy favoring jury trials, grants the motion.
