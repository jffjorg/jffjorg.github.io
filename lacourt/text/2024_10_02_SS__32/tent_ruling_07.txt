[1] Although
Defendant argues that Defendant performed the work according to the proposals
submitted and did not contract to grade or level the road (UMF 15, 16), there
remains a triable issue of fact regarding whether the work according to the
proposals submitted was properly performed. Defendant’s arguments that the
paving is not the cause of Plaintiff’s damages is a new argument not raised by
this motion. (Reply at p. 5.)
