HEARING DATE:

  2, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV01867




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Order Granting Relief from Potential Waiver of Trial by Jury




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Rouzbeh Zarrinbakhsh 




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Rouzbeh Zarrinbakhsh (“Plaintiff”) now moves for relief from
the potential waiver of trial by jury after he failed to post jury fees in
time. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A party can secure their right to a jury trial by timely
demanding a jury trial and posting jury fees. (See Code. Civ. Proc. § 631 (b),
(f)(4).) Code of Civil Procedure section 631 provides that “[a]t least one
party demanding a jury on each side of a civil case shall pay a nonrefundable
fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150), unless the fee has been paid by
another party on the same side of the case.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 631(b).) The
fee must be paid before the date scheduled for the initial case management
conference in the action. (Id., § 631(c).) If no case management
conference is scheduled in a civil action, the fee shall be due no later than
365 calendar days after the filing of the initial complaint. (Id., §
631(c)(2).) A party waives jury trial by failing to timely pay the fee, unless
another party on the same side of the case has paid that fee.  (Id.,
§ 631(f)(5).)  
 
“The court may, in its discretion upon just terms, allow a
trial by jury although there may have been a waiver of a trial by jury.” (Id.,
§ 631(g).)  “A trial court abuses its discretion as a matter of law when
relief has been denied where there has been no prejudice¿to the other party or
to the court from an inadvertent waiver.”¿ (Tesoro del Valle Master
Homeowners Assn. v. Griffin¿(2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 619, 638.) Policy favors
the court using its discretion to proceed with a jury trial.¿ (Bishop v.
Anderson¿(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 821, 823.)¿  
 
“Where the right to jury is threatened, the crucial focus
is whether any prejudice will be suffered by any party or the court if¿a motion
for relief from waiver is granted…relief has been denied where there has been
no prejudice to the other party or to the court from an inadvertent
waiver.’”  (Wharton v. Superior Court¿(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 100,
104.)¿¿“The mere fact that trial will be by jury is not prejudice per se.”¿¿(Johnson-Stovall
v. Superior Court¿(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th¿808, 811 [prejudice not shown by
need to prepare motions¿in limine, enlarged exhibits, and jury instructions unless
inadequate time also shown].)¿¿Rather, the prejudice that must be shown is
“prejudice from the granting of relief from waiver not prejudice from the jury
trial.”¿¿(Winston v. Superior Court¿(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 600, 602, 603
[fact that it takes longer to try a jury case is not prejudice from granting
relief from waiver].)
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter, the Court, on its own, takes judicial notice of
Plaintiff’s complaint and the docket in this case under Evidence Code section
452(d). Here, Plaintiff filed the complaint on January 15, 2021, and demanded a
jury trial therein. However, Plaintiff did not pay a jury fee of $150 within
365 days of filing the complaint; instead, it was paid on February 14, 2024. As
a result, Plaintiff’s right to a jury trial was waived. (Code Civ. Proc. §
631(f)(5).)[1]
 
Plaintiff’s counsel contends that during a late-July 2024 review of
the Court’s register of actions, she learned for the first time that Plaintiff
had inadvertently failed to timely post jury fees. (Hernandez Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff
argues Defendants will suffer no prejudice if relief from the waiver is granted
as both sides have been preparing this case for a jury trial. No opposition has
been filed for this motion. 
 
Because no prejudice has been identified by the parties, and in line
with the public policy favoring jury trials, Plaintiff’s motion is granted.  
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion for Order Granting Relief from Potential
Waiver of Trial by Jury is GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
