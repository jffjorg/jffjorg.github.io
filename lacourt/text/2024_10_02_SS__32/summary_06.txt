And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied defendant Ray's Paving Solutions, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Bryan Hutchinson, had sued the defendant for negligence, alleging that the defendant's work on Corvo Way, a private road behind his property, caused water to flow onto his property and damage it.

The defendant had argued that the completed and accepted doctrine applied, as the neighbors who hired the defendant had accepted the work. However, the court found that there was a triable issue of fact regarding whether the alleged defect was latent. The court also found that the defendant did not establish that an average person could detect the alleged defect by reasonable inspection.

As a result, the court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and ordered the defendant to give notice of this ruling and file a proof of service of such.
