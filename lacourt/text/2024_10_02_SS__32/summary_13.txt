Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents, set one, numbers 1 and 15, filed by Plaintiff Hee Jung Kim against Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The motion was filed on August 27, 2024, and seeks to compel Defendant to produce documents related to Plaintiff's vehicle accident.

The Court found that Defendant's objections to the request were without merit and granted the motion. Specifically, the Court found that Defendant failed to show how the information requested was protected by the official information privilege or the right to privacy. The Court also found that Defendant failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in protecting the information and that a protective order could have been used to address any privacy concerns.

The Court awarded monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,500.00 against Defendant and its counsel, jointly and severally, due to their failure to comply with the request for production of documents. The Court also ordered Defendant to serve further responses to the request within 10 days.

The Court's ruling is subject to change after the parties have an opportunity to review and respond to the tentative ruling.
