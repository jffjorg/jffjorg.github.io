```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to contest the good faith settlement determination and has denied the motion. The Gruens and Plaintiffs reached a settlement for $1,300,000, and the court finds that the settlement is reasonable and in good faith. HOA's arguments that the settlement amount is disproportionate to the Gruens' liability and that the allocation to Plaintiffs Poppy Webster and Michael Pietroiacovo is unreasonable are not supported by evidence. The court notes that the Gruens' financial condition has not been discovered, and even if they had additional assets, HOA has not shown that this would make the settlement amount unreasonable. The court finds that HOA has not met its burden to show that the settlement is so far out of the ballpark as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives of section 877.6. Therefore, the motion is denied.
