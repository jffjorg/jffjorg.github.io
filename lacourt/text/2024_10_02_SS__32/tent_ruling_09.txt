OPPOSING PARTY:


None
  



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Tara Hargrove (“Plaintiff”) applies for an order permitting
Adam J. Kress (“Kress”) to appear as counsel pro hac vice. No opposition has
been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
California Rules of Court, Rule
9.40 provides that an attorney in good standing in another jurisdiction may
apply to appear as counsel pro hac vice in the State of California by filing a
verified application together with proof of service by mail of a copy of the
application and notice of hearing on all parties who have appeared in the case
and on the State Bar of California at its San Francisco office, with payment of
a $500.00 fee, so long as that attorney is not a resident of the State of
California, and is not employed or regularly engaged in substantial business,
professional, or other activities, in the State of California. An active licensee of the State Bar
of California must also be associated as attorney of record. 
 
“A person desiring to appear as counsel pro
hac vice in a superior court must file with the court a verified application
together with proof of service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 1013a of a copy of the application and of the notice of
hearing of the application on all parties who have appeared in the cause and on
the State Bar of California at its San Francisco office. The notice of hearing
must be given at the time prescribed in Code of Civil Procedure section 1005
unless the court has prescribed a shorter period.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
9.40(c).) 
 
The application must state: (1) the applicant’s residence
and office addresses; (2) the courts to which the applicant has been admitted
to practice and the dates of admission; (3) that the applicant is a member in
good standing in those courts; (4) that the applicant is not currently
suspended or disbarred in any court; (5) the title of each court and cause in
which the applicant has filed an application to appear as counsel pro hac vice
in this state in the preceding two years, the date of each application, and
whether or not it was granted; and (6) the name, address, and telephone number
of the active member of the State Bar of California who is attorney of record
in the local action.  
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40(d).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Applications
to appear as counsel pro hac vice must contain the facts specified in California
Rules of Court, rule 9.40(d). Kress’ verified application contains the
following information: 
 

Office and residence address
     (Kress Decl., 2:7-8.) 


Evidence that he is a member
     in good standing in the courts to which he has been admitted. (Id.
     ¶ 2.) 


Evidence he is not suspended
     or disbarred in any state (Id. ¶ 3.) 


Kress declares he has filed
     one pro hac vice application in the preceding two years for the
     case Melissa McAllister v. Mealthy, Inc. (CIVSB2220914). (Id.
     ¶ 5.) 
Name, address, and phone number of Jordan
     Harlan, the California attorney representing Plaintiff in this action. (Id.
     ¶ 7.) 

 
However, Mr. Kress has not listed the courts to which he has been
admitted. (See Kress Decl. ¶ 1.) Additionally, Kress has not stated in his
verified application that he is not a resident of California and is not
employed in California, or regularly
engaged in substantial business, professional, or other activities, in the
State of California. 
 
A copy of the Application
was uploaded to the State Bar of California on August 30, 2024 and the $500
filing fee was paid. (Kress Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. 2.) 
 
However,
according to the proof of service, all parties have not been served by mail as
required in California Rules of Court, rule 9.40(c)(1). Additionally, there is
no proof of service by mail of the application on the State Bar of California
at its San Francisco office.  
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s application for Adam J. Kress to appear as
counsel pro hac vice is denied. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
