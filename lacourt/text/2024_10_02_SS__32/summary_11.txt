And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Defendant Target Corporation to reopen fact discovery for the limited purpose of conducting independent medical examinations (IMEs) of Plaintiffs Brayden Medina Molina, Joo Hye Song, and Teresa Molina Gallegos. The motion is granted, but only to the extent that Target can complete the discovery by the current trial date, including completing the medical examinations and deposing the experts.

The judge found that the necessity of the IMEs is high, and that Target did not act diligently in seeking them earlier. However, the judge also found that Target represents that it has experts who can complete the medical examinations and make themselves available for deposition in time for trial.

The judge declined to award sanctions against Plaintiffs, finding that they acted with substantial justification. The motion to reopen fact discovery is granted, and Defendant Target Corporation is ordered to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
