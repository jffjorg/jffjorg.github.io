Lisa Carson (“Plaintiff”) filed this case under the Song-Beverly Consumer

Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents,
and the Requests for Admission.  The
Court rules as follows:

compel further responses to the Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories,
and Requests for Production of Documents. 
Verified code-compliant responses, without objections, are due within
thirty (30) days. 
 
            2.         The Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further responses to the Requests for Admission.  The appropriate remedy is to move to deem the
matters specified in the requests to have been admitted.

notice and file proof of such with the Court.
