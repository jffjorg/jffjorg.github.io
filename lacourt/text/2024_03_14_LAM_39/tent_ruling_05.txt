 Case Number:  23STCV18304    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  39 Dominick Martin v. Ohana Brewing Company
Case No. 23STCV18304
Demurrer and Motion to Strike
 
            Dominick Martin (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action against the Ohana Brewing Company (“Defendant”) asserting a single
cause of action for violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Civil
Code section 51, based upon violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act
(the “ADA”).  Plaintiff alleges that he
is “permanently blind and uses screen readers in order to access the internet
and read website content.”  (Complaint, ¶
7.)  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s
website is not accessible.  (Complaint,
¶¶ 4, 7.)  Now, Defendant demurs to the
complaint and moves to strike the prayer for injunctive relief and allegations
concerning “tester standing.” 
 
“It is black letter
law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  In ruling on a demurrer, the court must “liberally construe[]” the
allegations of the complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)  “This rule of liberal construction means that
the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)
 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a
pleading, may serve and file a motion to strike the whole pleading or any part
thereof.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd.
(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (b).)  On a motion to strike, the court may: (1)
strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading;
or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the
court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd.
(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782.)
 
Defendant argues that its website does not fall within the
scope of the ADA.  A blind user of a website that screen reader
software cannot read has standing to sue under the ADA if the website has a
sufficient nexus to a physical place of public accommodation.  (See Martinez v. San Diego County Credit
Union (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1069.) 
In this case, Plaintiff alleges that screen reading software cannot read
Defendant’s website, and that Plaintiff’s inability to use a screen reader to
read Defendant’s website deterred Plaintiff from visiting Defendant’s tasting
room.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 4, 7.)  Specifically, Plaintiff alleges: “The access
barriers on the Website have caused a denial of Plaintiff’s full and equal
access multiple times in the past, and deterred Plaintiff on a regular basis
from accessing Defendant’s Website. 
Similarly, at all relevant times the access barriers on the Website deterred
Plaintiff from visiting Defendant’s California tasting room locations.”  (Id., ¶ 7.) 
This is sufficient for pleading purposes.
  
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot seek relief that would require
Defendant to alter its website.  Defendant
argues that Civil Code section 52(c)(3) does not permit a mandatory
injunction.  Section 52 prohibits a
mandatory injunction requiring “construction, alteration, repair, structural or
otherwise, or modification of any sort whatsoever” of a facility or building,
not websites.  (See Civ. Code, § 52(g).)  In fact, injunctive relief is available in
these types of cases.  (See, e.g.,
Thurston v. Midvale Corp. (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 634.)
 
Defendant also seeks to strike allegations relating to Plaintiff having
standing as a “tester.”  Plaintiff is
entitled to allege facts to demonstrate standing.  Moreover, the trier of fact will not consider
the allegations in ruling on the case. 
Therefore, the motion is denied.
 
Based upon the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
1.         Defendant’s demurrer is
overruled and motion to strike is denied.
 
2.         The Court orders
Defendant to file an answer within thirty (30) days.
 
3.         This case shall proceed
as a bench trial.  The Court sets the
following dates:
 
Final
Status
Conference:           
January 31, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.
 
Trial:                                         
February 11, 2025, at 9:30 a.m.
 
4.         The parties shall comply with all pretrial procedures for
Department #39.  
 
5.         Defendant’s counsel shall provide notice and file proof of
such with the Court.
