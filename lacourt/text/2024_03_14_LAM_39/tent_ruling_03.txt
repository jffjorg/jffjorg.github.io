Order re:
Interplead Funds
 
            Petitioner
Martin Jerisat, Esq. represented Zhongmin Guo in a personal injury case
stemming from a motor vehicle collision. 
Guo sought medical treatment from Dr. George Rappard and his practice,
as well as the Los Angeles Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, LLC (the “doctors”).  The doctors agreed to provide this treatment
on a medical lien basis, and the underlying personal injury case settled.  The doctors placed a lien on the case for
$39,734.  Petitioner then interplead the
funds with the Court.  Now, Guo—who is
represented by Petitioner—and the doctors ask the Court to distribute the
funds.
 
            The Court
has no tentative order.
