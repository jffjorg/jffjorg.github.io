 Case Number:  22STCV21799    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  39 3800 West Sixth Street,
LLC v. Steven C. Kim
Case No.
22STCV21799
 
Order #1 of 3
Motion for
Protective Order
 
            Plaintiffs seek
a protective order excusing them from responding to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set Three (“RPDs”), Requests for Admission, Set Three (“RFAs”), and
Form Interrogatories, Set Four (“FROGs”).  Defendants served 117 special interrogatories,
279 requests for admission, 178 requests for production of documents, and four
sets of form interrogatories. 
 
            The Court
grants the motion with respect to the RFAs. 
A party is permitted 35 requests for admission (not relating to the
genuineness of documents) unless the complexity of the case or quantity of issues
justifies additional requests.  Under
this standard, Defendants are not entitled to more than 127 requests.  
 
            The Court
grants the motion with respect to the RPDs. 
These RPDs request documents relating to the RFAs.  Because the Court grants the motion with
respect to the RFAs, the RPDs now are moot. 

 
            The Court
grants the motion with respect to the FROGs. 
The FROGs request responses to Request Number 17.1, which relates to the
RFAs.  Because the Court grants the
motion with respect to the RFAs, the FROGs are now are moot.  
 
            Based upon the
foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion for
a protective order.
 
            2.         Plaintiffs’ counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
 
 
Order #2 of 3
Plaintiffs’
Motions to Compel Further Responses
 
            Plaintiffs
move to compel further responses  from
Defendant Steven C. Kim to Requests for Admission, Set One (“RFAs”) and Form
Interrogatory, Number 17.1 (the “FROG”). 
The Court rules as follows:
 
            RFA #9 – GRANTED.  This RFA asks Defendant to admit that he
advised Susan Ahn in connection with her negotiations with 3800 West Sixth
Street, LLC to purchase the property.  Defendant
objects on grounds of privilege.  The
objection is overruled.  This RFA merely
asks if Defendant represented Susan Ahn and the nature and scope of that
representation.  The RFA does not ask for
the content of any communication.  Therefore,
the motion is granted.  
 
RFA #10 – GRANTED.  See above.
 
            RFA #14 – GRANTED.  Defendant objects on the ground that “conflict
waiver language” is ambiguous.  The Court
is skeptical of this argument. 
Regardless, it is not a basis to object. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220(b)(3) and (c) are clear.   
 
            RFA #15 –
GRANTED.  See above.
 
            FROG #17.1 –
GRANTED.  See above. 
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motions to compel further responses
to the RFAs and the FROG.  Defendant shall
provide code-compliant responses, without objections, within thirty (30)
days.  Plaintiffs’ shall provide
notice.  
 
 
Order #3 of 3
Scheduling Order
 
            Defendant
moves to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One.  The motion is set for hearing on March 29,
2024.  The Court will be unexpectedly
dark on that date.  Therefore, the Court
advances and continues the hearing from March 29, 2024, to April 26, 2024, at
8:30 a.m.  However, the opposition and
reply briefs shall be due based upon the statutory deadlines associated with
the former hearing date (March 29, 2024). 

 
            Defendant
has reserved a hearing date of May 13, 2024, for a motion for summary
judgment.  The Court advances and
continues that hearing date to August 26, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The briefing schedule shall be based upon the
statutory deadlines associated with the new hearing date (May 13, 2024).
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
