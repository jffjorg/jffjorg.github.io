And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has not yet made a tentative ruling on the distribution of the interpleaded funds. Martin Jerisat, Esq. represented Zhongmin Guo in a personal injury case stemming from a motor vehicle collision. Guo sought medical treatment from Dr. George Rappard and his practice, as well as the Los Angeles Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, LLC (the "doctors"). The doctors agreed to provide this treatment on a medical lien basis, and the underlying personal injury case settled. The doctors placed a lien on the case for $39,734. Petitioner then interpleaded the funds with the Court. Now, Guo and the doctors are asking the Court to distribute the funds. The Court will consider the parties' arguments and make a ruling at a later date.
