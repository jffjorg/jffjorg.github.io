And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Roshmore Development Inc. to set aside a default entered against it on March 7, 2023. The Judge denied the motion without prejudice. The default was entered after Roshmore failed to file a responsive pleading to the Second Amended Complaint, which was served on November 29, 2022. Roshmore claimed that its counsel made a mistake and that it is entitled to relief under CCP 473(b). However, the Judge held that the motion was not accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed, as required by CCP 473(b). The Judge also noted that Roshmore's proposed cross-complaint was not properly filed and that the parties must comply with CRC 3.1110(f)(4) by electronically bookmarking exhibits.
