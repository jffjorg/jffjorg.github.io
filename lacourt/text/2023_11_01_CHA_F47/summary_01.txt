And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses and/or compliance from Roshmore Development Inc. The motion was filed by Mark A. Liker, the plaintiff, on August 25, 2023. Roshmore Development Inc. is the defendant and cross-complainant, along with Cochran Inc.

The case arises from a dispute over real property, specifically medical office suites located at 28212 Kelly Johnson Parkway #215 and #225. The plaintiff filed a complaint on October 15, 2020, and subsequently served a Lis Pendens on October 20, 2020. The parties have been involved in discovery, with the plaintiff serving requests for production on April 11, 2023. Roshmore Development Inc. served responses on May 31, 2023, and a supplemental response on June 8, 2023, but failed to provide any responsive documents.

The court finds that the plaintiff has met the meet and confer requirements and that Roshmore Development Inc. has failed to justify its objections. The court orders Roshmore Development Inc. to provide further responses to the plaintiff's requests for production and awards the plaintiff $2,760.00 in sanctions for Roshmore's failure to comply with its discovery obligations.
