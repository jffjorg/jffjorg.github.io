SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a dispute
regarding real property commonly known as 28212 Kelly Johnson Parkway #215 and
#225 which are medical office suites.  On
10/15/20, Plaintiff Mark A. Liker (Plaintiff) filed the underlying complaint in
this action for Breach of Contract.  On
10/20/20, Plaintiff served a Lis Pendens on Defendants/Cross-Complainants
Roshmore Development, Inc. (Roshmore) and Cochran, Inc. (Cochran) which he
recorded on 1/26/21.  Plaintiff
voluntarily withdrew the Lis Pendens.  On
4/2/21, Cross-Complainants filed their Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants
Mark A. Liker and Lucy Holdings, LLC (Cross-Defendants) for: (1) Imposition of
a Constructive Trust, (2) Fraudulent Transfers, (3) Declaratory Relief/Quiet
Title, (4) Fraud, (5) Slander of Title, (6) Intentional Interference With
Cochran’s Contractual Relations and (7) Interference With Roshmore’s
Prospective Economic Advantage.
 
After rulings a Cross-Defendants’
Special Motion to Strike the entire Cross-Complaint and a Motion for
Reconsideration regarding such ruling, the causes of action which remained in
the Cross-Complaint were the 2nd cause of action for Fraudulent
Transfers, the 3rd cause of action for Declaratory Relief/Quiet
Title and the 4th cause of action for Fraud.  (See 11/18/21 Minute Order).  On 6/20/23, this Court granted Roshmore and
Cochran’s motion for leave to amend cross-complaint.  (See 6/20/23 Minute Order).  Roshmore and Cochran’s operative First
Amended Cross-Complaint contains causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract,
(2) Breach of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Indemnity, (4)
Declaratory Relief and (5) Negligence.  
 
On 4/11/23, Plaintiff served Roshmore
with Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1, Nos.1-18.  (Arnold Decl., Ex.A).  On 5/31/23, Roshmore served responses to the
Requests.  (Id., Ex.B).  On 6/8/23, Roshmore served a supplemental
response to the Request 4.  (Id.,
Ex.C).  No responsive documents were
served.  (Arnold Decl.).  From 6/22/23 through 7/19/23, the parties met
and conferred regarding the discovery responses and lack of production.  (Arnold Decl., Ex.D).  The parties agreed to extend the time to file
a motion to compel further responses for 30 days.  (Arnold Decl., Ex.E, F).  Thereafter, the parties further met and
conferred.  (Arnold Decl., Ex.E).  Although Roshmore’s counsel promised to serve
further responses and produce responsive documents, no further responses or
documents were served.  (Arnold Decl.,
Ex.E, F).  
 
On 8/25/23, Plaintiff filed and served
the instant motion seeking an order compelling Roshmore  to comply and provide further supplemental
responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set 1 (Requests
1-18) propounded on 4/11/23.  Additionally,
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions be imposed on Roshmore in the amount of
$4,470.00.  On 10/23/23, Roshmore filed
and served a late opposition to the motion. 
See CCP 1005(b).  On
10/27/23, Plaintiff filed and served a late reply to the late opposition.  Id. 
Both the opposition and reply were considered in ruling on the merits of
the motion.  CRC 3.1300(d).
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 2031.310(a) provides: 
 
“On
receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further response
to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply:
(1)
A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete.
(2)
A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3)
An objection in the response is without merit or too general.”
 
CCP 2031.320(a) provides:
 
“If
a party filing a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280 thereafter fails to permit the
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in
accordance with that party's statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
compliance.”
 
Discovery is to be liberally permitted
with any information, unless privileged, being  discoverable if it might reasonably lead to
any admissible evidence.  See CCP
2017.010; Lopez (2016) 246 CA4th 566, 591; Garamendi (2004) 116
CA4th 694, 741; Stewart (2001) 87 CA4th 1006, 1013; Williams
(2017) 3 C5th 531, 541; Mercury Interactive Corp. (2007) 158 CA4th 60,
98.
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff met the
meet and confer requirements before filing the instant motion.  CCP 2031.310(b); (Arnold Decl., Ex.D-F).
 
When a timely motion to compel further
responses is filed, the responding party has the burden of justifying any
objection.  Fairmont Insurance Co.
(2000) 22 C4th 245, 255; Coy (1962) 58 C2d 210, 220-221.  In its opposition, Roshmore has failed to
justify its objections.  
 
In addition to objecting to the
requests, Roshmore’s responses indicated that it would produce unprivileged documents
subject to the objections.  The
opposition indicates that Roshmore produced all of the requested documents or
responsive documents may be in the possession of a third-party from whom Roshmore
has unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the documents.  (See Martz Decl.).  If Roshmore is now claiming inability to
comply with the requests, it must serve a further response which complies with
CCP 2031.230 which provides: 
 
“A
representation of inability to comply with the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall
affirm that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an
effort to comply with that demand. This statement shall also specify whether
the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never
existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never
been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding
party. The statement shall set forth the name and address of any natural person
or organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or
control of that item or category of item.”
 
It also appears that Roshmore’s claim
that it cannot obtain certain responsive documents because they are in the
possession of a third-party, at least to an extent, is without merit.  Even if hard copies of certain documents were
kept in an office to which Roshmore no longer has access, Roshmore would
seemingly have the ability (control) to obtain copies of responsive documents
from its bank and/or other entities which keep such records.
 
To the extent that Roshmore is refusing
to produce documents based on privilege, it must provide a privilege log.  CCP 2031.240.
 
Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions
against Roshmore for its failure to comply with its discovery obligations.  CCP 2023.010(d), (e), (f); CCP 2023.030(a)CCP
2031.310(h); CCP 2031.320(b).  However,
the Court finds the $4,470.00 requested to be excessive.  The Court awards Plaintiff $2,760.00 in
sanctions against Roshmore (4 hours to prepare the motion + 2 hours to prepare
the reply appear at the hearing multiplied by $450/hour = $2,700 + $60 filing
fee = $2,760.00).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.  Further responses are due and sanctions, in
the reduced amount of $2,760.00, are payable within 30 days.
