Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions in limine filed by the defendant and has made the following tentative rulings:

* Motion to exclude evidence of concerns with the vehicle that were never presented to an authorized Honda dealership or were presented only once or twice: Denied.
* Motion to exclude recalls, technical service bulletins, and service news articles: Denied.
* Motion to exclude consumer complaints: Denied.
* Motion to exclude evidence of an alleged design defect: Denied.
* Motion to exclude testimony by Plaintiffs' duplicative expert witnesses and limiting expert testimony to deposition opinions: Denied without prejudice.
* Motion to preclude any Golden Rule theory or Reptile strategy arguments: Granted in part and denied in part.
* Motion to preclude any use of the terms "lemon law" or "lemons" in referring to the Song-Beverly Act or vehicles with substantial nonconformities: Granted.
* Motion to preclude any argument about the alleged failure of Defendant or its dealers to communicate with Plaintiffs in a language other than English: Granted.

The court notes that some of these motions were filed without identifying specific evidence or opinions that would be excluded, and therefore, the court cannot make a meaningful ruling on these motions. The court also notes that some of these motions are based on a misunderstanding of the law or the facts, and therefore, the court must correct these misconceptions in order to ensure a fair trial.
