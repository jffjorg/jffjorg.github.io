ANALYSIS:
 
On July 21,
2022, Plaintiff Totum Corporation (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for breach of
contract and common counts against Defendant New Management, LLC (“Defendant”). Following entry of default against
Defendant, the parties stipulated the vacate the default and allow Defendant to
file an answer. (Stip and Order, filed 01/25/23.) Defendant filed the Answer on
February 28, 2023. 
 
On August 30,
2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Order Compelling Further Responses
to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions against Defendant.
Defendant filed an opposition on October 12, 2023 and Plaintiff replied on
October 18, 2023. Also on October 12, 2023, Defendant filed a Motion for Relief
from Waiver of Objections, which is set for hearing on January 2, 2024. The
Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Order Compelling Further Responses to
Requests for Admission, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on October 19,
2023. (Minute Order, 10/19/23.)
 
Discussion
 
Notice of the
motion to compel further must be given “within 45 days of service of the
verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or any specific later
date to which the requesting party and the responding party have agreed in
writing,” otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) Defendant’s discovery
responses were served electronically on July 14, 2023. (Motion, Liberatore
Decl., ¶7.) The Motion was timely filed and served on August 30, 2023. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(4)(B).) 

 
Also, the Motion must
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (b)(2).) The supporting declaration demonstrates an effort by Plaintiff’s
counsel to obtain further responses from Defendant after service of the
original responses. (Motion, Liberatore Decl., Exh. B.) The meet and confer
requirement, therefore, is satisfied. 
 
Finally, Cal. Rules
of Court Rule 3.1345 requires all motions or responses involving further
discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the
response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further
responses. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a).) Alternatively, “the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b)(2).) The
Motion is accompanied by a separate statement. (Separate Statement, filed
08/30/23.) 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to Form
Interrogatories, No. 15.1 because Defendant’s responses to the interrogatory
included objections, despite being served late. Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.290 states in relevant part: 
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:
 
(a) The party to whom the
interrogatories are directed waives any objection to the requests, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010).
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.200, subd. (a).) Following service
of the Form Interrogatories on May 23, 2023, the parties agreed to allow
Defendant to serve responses by July 11, 2023. (Motion Liberatore Decl., ¶¶3-5
and Exh. B.) Defendant did not serve responses until July 14, 2023. (Id.
at ¶7 and Exh. B.) However, Defendant’s response to Form Interrogatories, No.
15.1, included objections. (Motion, Separate Statement, p. 2:12-21.) 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion, therefore, demonstrates that Defendant’s
objections to the Form Interrogatories were waived and should have not been
asserted in Response No. 15.1. Furthermore, under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, the propounding party may move for further responses if it
deems that an objection to a particular request is without merit. The Court
finds that Defendant’s objection to Form Interrogatories, No. 15.1, was without
merit and Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling a further response
without objections.
 
Sanctions are appropriate and have been properly noticed.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).) Defendant’s contention that
sanctions should be declined because its conduct was substantially justified is
at odds with the Discovery Code, which expressly deems objections waived when
responses are untimely. Plaintiff is entitled to recover its expenses in
bringing this Motion and Reply. Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is
granted in the amount of $560.00 based on one hour of attorney time billed at
$500.00, plus the $60.00 filing fee. (Motion, Liberatore Decl., ¶¶10-15.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Totum Corporation’s Motion for Order Compelling
Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanction is
GRANTED. DEFENDANT NEW MANAGEMENT, LLC IS TO SERVE FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM
INTERROGATORIES, NO. 15.1, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER. DEFENDANT NEW MANAGEMENT, LLC IS ALSO ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $560.00
TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.

asserted in Response No. 2. Furthermore, under Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.310, the propounding party may move for further responses if it deems that
an objection to a particular request is without merit. The Court finds that
Defendant’s objection to Request for Production, No. 2, was without merit and
Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling a further response without
