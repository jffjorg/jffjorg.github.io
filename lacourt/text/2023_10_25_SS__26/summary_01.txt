```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories and requests for production, and orders the defendant to pay sanctions of $560.00 to the plaintiff's counsel. The defendant's responses to the interrogatories and requests for production were served late and included objections, which were waived. The judge finds that the defendant's objections were without merit and that the plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling further responses without objections. The judge also finds that the defendant's conduct was not substantially justified, and therefore, sanctions are appropriate.
