On 9/30/24, Defendant,
T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile) filed a notice of demurrer, memorandum,
declaration, and proposed order. T-Mobile demurred to all causes of action
asserted against T-Mobile.
On 10/11/2024, Plaintiffs’
counsel, John D. Rowell, filed and signed a Request for Dismissal to dismiss
the action without prejudice as to the Complaint as to Defendant T-Mobile,
USA., Inc. In this Request for Dismissal, it appears that the Court entered

Therefore, in light of
Defendant T-Mobile being dismissed, it appears as if T-Mobile’s demurrer is
MOOT.
