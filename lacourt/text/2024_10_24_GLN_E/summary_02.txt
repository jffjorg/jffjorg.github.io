And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production from the Plaintiff, Katelyn Perez. The Plaintiff failed to provide timely responses to the discovery requests, which waived any objections they may have had. The judge is inclined to compel further, verified responses without objections to the special interrogatories, but is concerned about the Plaintiff's failure to provide substantive responses.

The judge is also considering sanctions against the Plaintiff in the amount of $1,656.00, which was requested by the Cross-Defendant, BC Rentals LLC. The judge will hear argument on the service issue and the filing fee issue, as well as on the RFPs and SROGs at issue.

In her tentative ruling, the judge notes that the Plaintiff failed to provide responses within 30 days of service of the discovery requests, which waived any objections they may have had. The judge also notes that the Plaintiff improperly asserted objections for their responses, and that the Cross-Defendant (Movant) did not provide a fact-specific showing of relevance for each RFP at issue.

The judge is ordering the Plaintiff to provide further responses without objections to the special interrogatories, and will hear argument on the RFPs and SROGs at issue. The judge will also consider sanctions against the Plaintiff in the amount of $1,656.00.
