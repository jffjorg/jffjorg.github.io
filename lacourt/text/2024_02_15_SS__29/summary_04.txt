And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by defendant Abel Reyna without prejudice. The judge notes that Reyna has only served the plaintiff with notice of the motion, and not any non-settling joint tortfeasors. As a result, the order that Reyna seeks would bind no one and would be an improper advisory, abstract opinion. The judge also notes that the burden on the moving parties to show that the settlement was made in good faith is slight, but that Reyna must provide more evidence to support its claim. The judge ultimately concludes that the motion is denied without prejudice, and that Reyna must serve at least one non-settling joint tortfeasor if it seeks a good faith settlement determination in the future.
