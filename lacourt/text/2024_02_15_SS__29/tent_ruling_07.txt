 Case Number:  22STCV28758    Hearing Date:   February 15, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Special Interrogatories
(Set 1) filed by Defendants CJ Logistics America, LLC, and Won Keun Park.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
The request for sanctions is granted in part.
Background
This case arises out of a vehicle
accident on September 8, 2020, near the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and
South Hoover Street in Los Angeles.  On
September 2, 2022, Plaintiff James Shaff (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Defendants CJ Logistics USA Corporation, Won Keun Park, and Does 1 to
10, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence.
On January 5, 2023, Defendants CJ Logistics America, LLC (erroneously sued as CJ
Logistics USA Corporation) and Won Keun Park (collectively, “Defendants”) filed
their answer.
 
On January 13, 2023, Defendants
served Plaintiff with discovery, including Special Interrogatories (Set 1).
(Anvari Decl., ¶ 4.)  After Plaintiff
requested, and was granted, two extensions of time, Plaintiff did not respond to
the discovery.  (Id., ¶¶ 6-8.)
 
On April 10, 2023, Defendants filed
this motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Special Interrogatories (Set 1).
Defendants also requested sanctions.
 
Plaintiff has not filed any opposition.

 
Legal Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7
of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the
trial court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.) 
Even if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and]
substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses …
the trial court retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important incentive for parties to
respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,”
the trial court may “deny the motion to compel responses as essentially
unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)  
Discussion
On January 13, 2023, Defendants
served Plaintiff with Special Interrogatories (Set 1). (Anvari Decl., ¶
4.)  Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id., ¶ 8.)   
 
Defendants need not show anything more.  Their motion to compel is GRANTED.
Defendants’ request for sanctions is GRANTED in part.  Given the relatively straightforward nature
of a motion to compel initial responses, and the economies of scale associated
with filing multiple discovery motions, the Court sets sanctions on this motion
in the amount of $429.15, calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney work,
multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of $245 per hour, plus a $61.65 filing
fee.  (See Anvari Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.)
Conclusion
Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to
Defendants’ Special Interrogatories (Set 1) is
GRANTED.  
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant
written responses, without objection, to Defendants’ Special Interrogatories (Set 1) within 30 days of
notice of this order.
Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in part.  
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff and counsel of record Jason M.
Glantz, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to Defendants under
the Civil Discovery Act in the total amount of $429.15 within 30 days of notice of this order.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
