Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to special interrogatories (Set 1) and also grants the request for sanctions in part. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, and as a result, the defendants filed a motion to compel and request for sanctions. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery warrants the imposition of sanctions. The amount of sanctions is set at $429.15, which is calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney work and a filing fee. The judge orders the plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant written responses to the special interrogatories within 30 days of notice of this order. Additionally, the judge orders the plaintiff and his counsel, Jason M. Glantz, to pay the sanctions amount within 30 days of notice of this order.
