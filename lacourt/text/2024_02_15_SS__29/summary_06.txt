Some medical records regarding her right knee, both after the incident and before it (particularly in light of the fact that Plaintiff had surgery to the same knee in 2017 and then a total knee replacement in 2018) is directly relevant to Plaintiff’s claims."
  - "On balance, and after considering all of the evidence in the record and the arguments of both sides, the Court finds that Defendant’s legitimate interest in obtaining the subpoenaed records, as limited in two respects – (1) pertaining to injuries to or treatment of Plaintiff’s right knee only and (2) for the time period of January 1, 2010 to the present – outweighs Plaintiff’s substantial privacy interest."
  - "With these modifications made, the Court DENIES the motion to quash the subpoenas as modified."

English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash 27 subpoenas issued by the defendants to medical providers. The subpoenas seek all medical and billing records pertaining to the plaintiff, Robin Ryan, without limitation as to time or scope. The plaintiff argues that these subpoenas violate her right to privacy. The judge has granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The judge has modified the subpoenas to limit them to records relating to injuries to or treatments for the plaintiff's right knee, and to the period of January 1, 2010 to the present. The judge has also denied both parties' requests for sanctions. The judge notes that the defendants have a legitimate interest in obtaining the subpoenaed records, and that the plaintiff's verified discovery responses describe the injury as limited to her right knee.
