And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for leave to file a supplemental complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Joedamian Franco, Jr., Monica Alvarado, and Jenitcy Franco, a minor who has since reached the age of majority. The supplemental complaint is necessary to correct a typographical error in the naming of Plaintiff Monica Alvarado and to remove the allegations of minority of Plaintiff Jenitcy Franco. The motion was unopposed as the defendant has not yet appeared in the matter. The judge has granted the motion and allowed the plaintiffs to file the supplemental complaint within 10 days.
