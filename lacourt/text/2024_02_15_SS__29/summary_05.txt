And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Albertsons LLC's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint for indemnity against Source Refrigeration and HVAC, Inc., Coolsys, Inc., and Roes 1 to 10. The cross-complaint arises out of the same occurrence or series of occurrences as the original complaint, and the delay in seeking leave to file was due to attempts to resolve the indemnity issue without litigation. The plaintiff does not oppose the motion, and the court finds that granting the motion is in the interests of justice. The court grants leave to the defendant to file the cross-complaint within 10 days.
