  - "The trial court should not consolidate actions where prejudice would result any party, e.g., when consolidation would cause a litigant to need to adopt adverse litigations positions in a single trial."
  - "Cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department."

And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to consolidate the Ornelaz Action (Case No. 22STCV33027) and the Talamantes Action (Case No. 23BBCV00602) without prejudice. The motion was filed by Pibe's Auto LLC, which seeks to consolidate the two cases for all purposes. The cases arise out of the same vehicle accident on May 16, 2022, and there is a considerable overlap in the defendants and the claims asserted against them. The court finds that the motion to consolidate is defective due to a procedural error, as the notice of motion was not filed in the Talamantes Action and service was not made on counsel for the Talamantes Plaintiffs. As a result, the court is unable to consider the merits of the motion and must deny it without prejudice. The moving party is ordered to give notice of the court's decision.
