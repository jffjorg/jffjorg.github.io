And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions filed by Total Airport Services, LLC, seeking contempt, terminating, evidentiary, and/or monetary sanctions against Maria Lizarraga, the plaintiff, due to her failure to comply with discovery orders. The court has previously granted the defendant's motions to compel further responses from the plaintiff. The plaintiff's responses were deemed inadequate, and she did not produce any documents or serve verifications. The defendant seeks to hold the plaintiff accountable for her non-compliance and to compel further responses to the discovery requests.

The court finds that the plaintiff's conduct constitutes a misuse of the discovery process, as defined by California discovery law. The court will impose reduced monetary sanctions of $1,500 against the plaintiff and her counsel. The court will also compel further substantive responses and production of documents within 20 days for all deficient responses at issue.

The defendant has also requested to continue the trial date by eight months to properly complete discovery. This will be discussed at the hearing on January 18, 2024.
