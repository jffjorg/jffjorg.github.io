And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Donald Cunningham's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The plaintiff, Jennita Foster dba Guest House Management, filed an unlawful detainer action against the defendant on May 8, 2024, alleging that the defendant failed to pay rent for the premises located at 1628 West Blvd., #3, Los Angeles, California. The defendant filed an answer on the same date and then moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that possession of the premises was no longer at issue and that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer.

The judge agrees with the defendant's argument, finding that the complaint does not allege a cause of action for unlawful detainer because the notice to quit issued by the plaintiff did not strictly comply with the statutory requirements. The notice did not give the defendant the option to sign a written lease renewal or extension as a means to cure and did not identify a witness concerning the reason for eviction. The judge also finds that the complaint does not state a cause of action for damages because the plaintiff has not filed an amended complaint to convert the action to one for damages.

As a result, the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted, and the case is dismissed.
