```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against Defendant Sharifpour. The Plaintiff had requested that the Defendant's answer be struck and a default judgment be entered against him due to his failure to serve verified responses and pay sanctions as ordered by the Court. The Court found that although the Defendant failed to comply with the discovery order, he ultimately served the required responses, and the threat of terminating sanctions was sufficient to ensure compliance. Therefore, the Court denied the motion and did not impose terminating sanctions.
