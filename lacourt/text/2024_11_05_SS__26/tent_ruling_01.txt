Rodriguez
v. Narvaez, et al.MOTION TO
VACATE DISMISSAL
(CCP § 473(b))
 

 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiffs Jose David Minero
Rodriguez and Juan Ronaldo Cartagena’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On September 16, 2022, Plaintiffs Jose
David Minero Rodriguez and Juan Ronaldo Cartagena (“Plaintiff”) filed the
instant action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendant Alex Narvaez
(“Defendant”). On March 15, 20242, the action came for trial, but Plaintiffs
failed to appear. (Minute Order, 03/15/24.) The Court dismissed the action
without prejudice. (Ibid.) 
 
Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on September
16, 2024. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute, an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving
party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,
143.) When based on attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default
judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be
granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the
provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have
been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
The Motion was not timely filed
within six months of dismissal of the action. Six months is defined as half a
year, or 182 days. (Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 903 [“We
therefore conclude that as employed in section 473 of the Code of Civil
Procedure six months is the equivalent of half a year and, under section 6803
of the Government Code, is the equivalent of 182 days.”].) 182 days after March
15, 2024 was Friday, September 13, 2024. The instant Motion, however, was not
filed until Monday, September 16, 2024. The six-month deadline is
jurisdictional and not subject to tolling. (Manson, Iver & York v. Black
(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42.)  Therefore,
relief from the dismissal is not available under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b). 

 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiffs Jose David Minero
Rodriguez and Juan Ronaldo Cartagena’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal is DENIED.
 
 
Moving party to give
notice.
