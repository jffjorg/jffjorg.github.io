2023, Plaintiff Jose R. Avilez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendant Raymond Sharifpour dba White Diamond Auto Sales (“Defendant Sharifpour”) and The Guaranty Company.
Defendants filed an answer on December 12, 2023. On June 26 and 27, 2024, the
Court granted Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel Defendant’s Responses to Demand for
Production of Documents, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special
Interrogatories, Set One. (Minute Orders 06/26/24, 07/26/24.) Defendant Sharifpour was ordered to serve verified
responses and pay sanctions within 20 days’ service of the order. (Ibid.)

 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions
against Defendant Sharifpour on August 30, 2024, which seeks an order
striking Defendant’s answer and entering default. Defendant Sharifpour filed an opposition on October 23, 2024 and Plaintiff replied on October
31, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have the discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary
sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative,
Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) The court
should look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether
terminating sanctions are appropriate. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there
is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence
showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery
rules. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A]
penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance
with discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or
bad faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) “The
court may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 
(1)  
An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
(2)  
An order staying further proceedings by that party
until an order for discovery is obeyed.
(3)  
An order dismissing the action, or any part of the
action, of that party.
(4)  
An order rendering a judgment by default against that
party.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)
 
Discussion
 
On June 26 and 27, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s
Motions to Compel Defendant’s Responses to Demand for Production of Documents,
Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One.
(Motion, Sadr Decl., ¶9 and Exh. 6.) Defendant Sharifpour was ordered to serve verified responses and pay
sanctions within 20 days’ service of the order. (Ibid.) Notice of the ruling was mailed to Defendant
Sharifpour on June 28, 2024. (Id. at ¶¶10-11 and Exhs. 7-8.) As of the
filing of this motion, Defendant Sharifpour had not served responses or paid sanctions as
ordered. (Id. at ¶13.) Plaintiff now moves for terminating sanctions under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 by striking Defendant Sharifpour’s answer and entering default. In opposition, Defendant Sharifpour argues that verified responses have now
been served as ordered such that terminating sanctions are not warranted.
Plaintiff replies that Defendant Sharifpour’s failure to provide timely
responses, and to comply with the Court’s orders, have been willful and
unjustified.
 
The Court finds that terminating sanctions are not warranted
for Defendant’s non-compliance with the discovery order at this time. Despite Defendant’s
failure to timely comply with the Court’s orders, verified discovery responses
have now been served. Plaintiff has not indicated in their reply that the
responses are inadequate in any way. The threat of terminating sanctions has
been sufficient to ensure Defendant Sharifpour’s
compliance, such that an award of terminating sanctions is not necessary. While
the Court agrees that Defendant Sharifpour’s failure to comply with the
discovery orders was not excusable, it exercises its discretion to deny the
Motion now that responses have been served. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Jose Avilez’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions is
DENIED. 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
