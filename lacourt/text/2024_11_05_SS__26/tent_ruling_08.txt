ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff
Jennita Foster dba Guest House Management (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for unlawful detainer against Defendant Donald Cunningham (“Defendant”)
on May 8, 2024. Defendant filed an answer on the same date. This action was
deemed related to Foster v. Cunningham, LASC Case No. 24STUD01960 on May
16, 2024. On July 16, 2024, the unlawful detainer court determined that
possession was no longer at issue and put the case out for reassignment.
(Minute Order, 07/16/24.) Following assignment of the case to Department 26 in
the Spring Street Courthouse, Defendant filed the instant Motion for Judgment
on the Pleadings on September 30, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Allegations in the Complaint
 
Plaintiff brought this action for
unlawful detainer against Defendant with respect to the premises located at
1628 West Blvd., #3, Los Angeles, California (“the Premises”). (Compl., ¶¶2-3.)
On February 11, 2023, Defendant agreed to rent the premises for $2,190.00 per
month, pursuant to a written agreement. (Id. at ¶6.) Defendant was
served with a 3-day notice to perform covenants or quit on May 2, 2024, which
expired on May 7, 2024. (Id. at ¶¶8-9.) Plaintiff demands possession due
to the expiration of a fix-term lease; the amount owing is $3,577.76 from the
date of service of the 3-day notice. (Id. at ¶¶11-12.) The fair rental
value of the Premises is $80.00 per day and Plaintiff is also entitled to
statutory damages. (Id. at ¶¶13-14.) 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant ask the Court to take
judicial notice of the trial order dated June 21, 2024 in LASC Case No.
24STUD05853 that possession of the Premises is no longer at issue. The request
is granted pursuant to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d).
 
Judgment on the Pleadings
 
Defendant moves for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that (1)
possession of the Premises is no longer at issue but Plaintiff has not filed an
amended Complaint; and (2) the Complaint fails to state a cause of
action for unlawful detainer because the Notice to Vacate is defective. A claim
for unlawful detainer under Civil Code section 1161, Plaintiff’s moving
statute, exists when the tenant continues in possession of the property. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1161.) Once possession is no longer at issue, the plaintiff must
convert the action to one for damages by filing an amended complaint. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1952.3, subd. (a)(1).) Here, despite possession of the Premises
no longer being at issue, Plaintiff has not filed an amended complaint. 
 
Next, Defendant argues that the
Notice to Quit issued by Plaintiff did not strictly comply with the statutory
requirements. The statutory requirements in unlawful detainer proceedings “must
be followed strictly, otherwise a landlord's remedy is an ordinary suit for
breach of contract with all the delays that remedy normally involves and
without restitution of the demised property.” (WDT-Winchester v. Nilsson
(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 516, 526.) The Notice (1) did not give Defendant the
option to sign any written lease renewal or extension as a means to cure; and
(2) did not identify a witness concerning the reason for eviction. (Compl.,
Exh. 2.) These defects are in violation of the Los Angeles Municipal Code and
state law. (See LAMC, § 151.09(C)(1); Delta Imports, Inc v. Municipal Court
(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1033, 1036 [citing Hinman v. Wagnon (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 24, 27] [“Where the condition or covenant allegedly violated is
capable of being performed, the notice must give the tenant the alternative of
performing or quitting possession.”].) Due to the defective Notice to Quit
issued by Plaintiff, the Complaint also did not state a cause of action for
unlawful detainer when possession of the Premises was at issue. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the
Complaint does not allege either a cause of action for unlawful detainer, nor a
cause of action for damages. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Donald
Cunningham’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED. 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
