And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing on the disbursement of surplus proceeds to February 5, 2025. Before then, Claimant Richard M. Lester must file and serve supplemental papers demonstrating their entitlement to the surplus funds. This decision comes after the Claimant requested an award of $4,000.00 from the surplus funds, claiming they are contractually entitled to attorney's fees based on their work on an uninsured motorist action settled in favor of Defendant Conde. However, the Claimant failed to provide evidence to support their claim, so the judge has not granted the requested award.
