ANALYSIS:  
 
On October
28, 2022, Plaintiff Qualitas Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) initiated this interpleader action against Defendants Julli A. Conde (“Defendant Conde”) and Richard M. Lester, a
law corporation (“Defendant Lester”). Defendant Lester answered on December 9,
2022. The Court entered default against Defendant Conde on April 21, 2023.  
 

On June 25, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s
Motion to Deposit Funds and for Discharge of Liability and set a hearing
on the disbursement of the funds for November 5, 2024. (Minute Order, 06/25/24.)
In accordance with the order, Plaintiff deposited funds in the amount of $4,537.70 with the Court on August 15, 2024.
On October 7, 2024, Claimant Richard M.
Lester, a law corporation (“Claimant”) filed a claim to the funds. 
 
Discussion
 
Claimant requests
an award of $4,000.00 from the surplus funds based on attorney’s fees incurred
in connection with an uninsured motorist action settled in favor of Defendant
Conde in the amount of $10,000.00. Specifically,
Claimant argues they are contractually entitled to a 40 percent contingency fee
for their work on the uninsured motorist action, and in fact, performed
work in the amount to warrant an attorney’s fees award of $4,000.00. The claim,
however, is not supported by any evidence, such as a supporting affidavit or
exhibits. 
 
Therefore, Claimant has not demonstrated they
are entitled to attorney’s fees of $4,000.00 from the surplus funds. 
 
Conclusion
 
The
Hearing on Disbursement of Surplus Proceeds is CONTINUED TO FEBRUARY 5, 2025 AT
8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY JANUARY 7, 2025,
CLAIMANT RICHARD M. LESTER IS TO FILE AND SERVE SUPPLEMENTAL PAPERS EVIDENCING
THEIR ENTITLEMENT TO THE SURPLUS FUNDS.
