Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Donald Cunningham's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is granted. The case involves an unlawful detainer action brought by Plaintiff Jennita Foster dba Guest House Management against Defendant Cunningham with respect to a premises located at 1628 West Blvd., #3, Los Angeles, California. The Plaintiff brought the action for unlawful detainer against the Defendant with respect to the premises, alleging that the Defendant had failed to pay rent and had not performed his obligations under the written agreement.

The Court had previously denied Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and had deemed the case related to another case, Foster v. Cunningham, LASC Case No. 24STUD05853. The Court had also granted Defendant's request for judicial notice of a trial order dated June 21, 2024 in the related case.

The Defendant had argued that the Complaint fails to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer because the Notice to Quit issued by the Plaintiff is defective. The Defendant had also argued that possession of the premises is no longer at issue, but the Plaintiff has not filed an amended complaint. The Court has held that the Complaint does not allege a cause of action for unlawful detainer or a cause of action for damages.

Based on the foregoing, the Court has granted Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The Court clerk is directed to give notice of the order.
