And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has dismissed Petitioner Daniel Vergara's Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award. The petition was filed on April 2, 2024, against Respondent Gabriel Olin, and was initially scheduled for hearing on August 6, 2024, but was continued to November 5, 2024. The court ordered the petitioner to file proof of service of the petition and notice of hearing by October 8, 2024, but no such proof has been filed. The arbitration agreement does not provide for the manner of service, so the service must be made in the manner provided by law for service of summons. Since the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 have not been satisfied, the petition is dismissed.
