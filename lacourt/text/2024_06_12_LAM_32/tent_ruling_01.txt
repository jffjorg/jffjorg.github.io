  order RE:
defendant DAL-TILE DISTRIBUTION, LLc’s
  motion to strike (CRS# 5478)




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On January 19, 2024, Plaintiff
Fernando Barajas-Salomon filed this product liability action against various
defendants. Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint on March 18,
2024, asserting (1) negligence, (2) products liability – failure to warn, (3)
products liability – design defect, (4) fraudulent concealment, (5) breach of
implied warranties, and (6) loss of consortium. 
            According to the complaint, from
2005 to 2023, Plaintiff worked as a cutter, fabricator and/or installer of
Defendants’ stone products. (FAC ¶¶ 172-175.) As a result of this work,
Plaintiff came into contact with “inherently hazardous stone products
manufactured, imported, supplied, distributed, contracted, and/or brokered, by
the named Defendants and Does 1-100.” (Id., ¶ 177.) Specifically,
Plaintiff was “exposed to and inhaled stone dust containing silica and other
toxins and carcinogens.” (Ibid.) Plaintiff allegedly developed lung
disease and is at increased risk of developing other silica-related diseases. (Id.,
¶ 178.) Plaintiff alleges that he “has had to receive substantial medical
treatment, including hospitalizations and surgeries, and will require lung
transplantation.” (Id., ¶ 179.) 
            On May 7, 2024, Defendant Dal-Tile Distribution,
LLC filed the instant motion to strike against the FAC. The motion is
unopposed. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading, may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part of that pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b).) The
court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper, strike (1) any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading and (2) all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Id., § 436.) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face
of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id., § 437.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a motion to strike, the
moving party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purposes of
determining whether an agreement can be reached through a filing of an amended
pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the motion to strike.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5.) The Court notes that Defendant Dal-Tile
Distribution, LLC has complied with the meet and confer requirement. (See
Kavarian Decl., ¶¶2-4.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Motion to Strike
            a. Additional Products to be
Identified in Discovery
“In the ordinary personal injury lawsuit,
in which the complaint's factual recitations show plainly the connection
between cause and effect, it suffices to plead causation succinctly and
generally.” (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 78.)
“But when, by contrast, the pleaded facts of negligence and injury do not
naturally give rise to an inference of causation, the plaintiff must plead
specific facts affording an inference the one caused the others.” (Ibid.)
The facts must show that “the defective products supplied by the defendant were
a substantial factor in bringing about his or her injury.” (Id. at p.
79.) In order for a complaint to satisfy the substantial factor test in a toxic
exposure case, the plaintiff must plead the following: 
(1) he was exposed to each of the toxic
materials claimed to have caused a specific illness;
(2) he must identify each product that
allegedly caused the injury;
(3) he must allege that as a result of the
exposure, the toxins entered his body;
(4) he must allege that he suffers from a
specific illness, and that each toxin that entered his body was a substantial
factor in bringing about, prolonging, or aggravating that illness; and
(5) he must allege
that each toxin he absorbed was manufactured or supplied by a named defendant. 
(Id.
at p. 80.) These facts must be pled “in ordinary and concise language” and may
be pled “in a conclusory fashion if [the plaintiff’s] knowledge of the precise
cause of injury is limited.” (Ibid.)
Here, Defendant Dal-Tile Distribution, LLC
(“Defendant”) seeks to strike the phrase “and other silica-containing stone
products to be identified during the course of discovery.” (FAC ¶ 171 at 60:7.)
Defendant argues this open-ended, vague production identification is
insufficient to meet the standard for toxic tort pleading set forth in Bockrath.
The Court agrees. The heightened standard under Bockrath requires
Plaintiff to “identify each product that allegedly caused the injury.” (Bockrath,
supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 80.) As such, the catchall allegation set forth in
the FAC would allow Plaintiff to base liability on numerous unidentified
products, thereby contravening Bockrath. Furthermore, Plaintiff failed
to refute or rebut this contention by not opposing the instant motion.
Therefore, the phrase is stricken. 
            b. Immaterial and Improper
Allegations 
            Defendant also seeks to strike the following
allegations: 
“In 1991 the Texas Water Commission
imposed a record $1 million fine against
Dal-Tile
for 12 years of illegally dumping hazardous waste into two gravel pits in
southeastern
Dallas
County. It was the largest fine ever levied by a state agency for environmental
violations.
The
company was required by law to send contaminated wastes from the manufacturing
process
to
special landfills but, according to state investigators, dumped the material
from 1975 to 1987
in
pits that were not specially licensed. The commission also found that Dal-Tile
used waste oils on
farmland for dust control, failed to notify the state it had discharged
industrial solid wastes
into
water, and failed to keep records of the waste and file annual reports..” (FAC
¶ 670.) 
            “In 1993, a federal grand jury
indicted Robert Brittingham, Jr., and company
president
John Lomonaco on 17 criminal counts, including conspiracy to dump hazardous
waste.
Brittingham
was found guilty in 1993, fined $4 million, and sentenced to five years'
probation,
which
he began fulfilling with 15 hours a week in community service by financing and
operating
a
$6 million lead-abatement program for Dallas. The total cost of the fines and
dumpsite cleanup
came
to $16.5 million.” (FAC ¶ 671.)
Here, Defendant contends a 1991 fine by
the Texas Water Commission regarding dumping of hazardous waste into two gravel
pits in southeastern Dallas county is irrelevant and improper because it
involves information completely separate and unrelated to the claim or defense
of the subject matter of the instant action. Similarly, Defendant asserts the
1993 indictment of Robert Brittingham, Jr., and company president John Lomonaco
involving conspiracy to dump hazardous waste is also immaterial to a claim or
defense in this action. The Court agrees. Plaintiff must plead facts that are
relevant to the causes of action asserted in their pleading. This instant
action does not concern hazardous waste or conspiracy but rather product
liability related to stone products allegedly manufactured, supplied,
distributed and/or imported by defendants. Therefore, the cited allegations are
stricken. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Dal-Tile Distribution, LLC’s
motion to strike is GRANTED.
