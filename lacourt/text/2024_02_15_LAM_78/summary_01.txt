And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on Attorney David S. Shankman's motion to appear pro hac vice as counsel for defendants Regus Management Group, LLC, IWG PLC, Maile Gilleres, and Mark Sorum. The court grants the motion, finding that Shankman has complied with California Rules of Court 9.40, which allows an attorney in good standing from another jurisdiction to appear pro hac vice in California. The court notes that Shankman has provided the required information, including his residence and office addresses, his admission to the Florida Bar, and proof of payment of the $50 fee. The court also notes that Shankman's application contains the required declarations and proof of service on the State Bar of California. The court therefore grants Shankman's motion to appear pro hac vice as counsel for the defendants.
