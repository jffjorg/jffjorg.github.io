The court need not address the City’s additional argument that the 2022 MOU
does not meet the test of CCP section 1094.5(e) because it could have been
presented to the ALJ before her decision. 
City Opp. at 6-7.

CalPERS requests judicial notice of (1) an August 24, 2020 minute order in Beverly
Hills Police Officers’ Association, et al. v. City of Beverly Hills, 19STCV34358
(“Prior Lawsuit”) (Ex. 1); (2) a December 17, 2020 minute order in the Prior
Lawsuit (Ex. 2), (3) an October 5, 2021 minute order in the Prior Lawsuit (Ex.
3), (4) a May 15, 2023 Notice of Ruling from the defendants’ motion for summary
judgment in the Prior Lawsuit (Ex. 4), and (5) a June 06, 2023 judgment in the
prior lawsuit (Ex. 5).  The requests are
granted.  Evid. Code §452(d).

For convenience, the court will often refer to the ALJ’s proposed decision
rather than the Board’s final decision adopting it.


[5] The City points out that Duncan’s history of
employment demonstrates the potential absurd results of Petitioners’
interpretation of the MOU.  Duncan joined
BHPD police cadet, a non-sworn position, in 2008 and was hired as a pre-service
officer in May 2012. Thus, Duncan was an BHPD employee for over four years
before he was hired as a pre-service officer. 
The parties did not intend that an employee who is hired and works in a
non-safety position for more than four years prior to July 1, 2012, and becomes
a sworn safety employee afterwards, would be eligible for the 3% at 50
retirement formula.  City Opp. at 17.


[6] CalPERS
notes that the City and authorized representatives met in good faith in
negotiating the 2011 MOU and there is no evidence that the MMBA was violated.  CalPERS Opp. at 13.


[7] CalPERS initially took the position before the
ALJ that CalPERS and the ALJ have no authority to “rule on the proper
interpretation of the MOU.”  AR 125-26,
1029-30, 1044.  CalPERS argued that the issue before the ALJ
was limited to whether the Amended Contract precludes CalPERS from enrolling Petitioners in the 3% at 50 retirement
formula because they first became sworn Police Officers on December 13, 2012.  Id.  As noted by Department
72, the ALJ disagreed. AR 1045. The ALJ
addressed whether the Amended Contract complied with the PERL and
considered the 2011 MOU to make such a
finding.  Id.  CalPERS Opp. at 9.

Petitioners argue that the ALJ stated that they did not prove mistake, which is
a standard higher than statutorily provided: “The party seeking correction of
an error or omission pursuant to this section has the burden of presenting
documentation or other evidence to [CalPERS] establishing the right to
correction…”  §20160(d).  Petitioners provided evidence that they are
benefit plan members of CalPERS, the City is a contracting agency, CalPERS has
authority to correct the City’s errors and omissions, and certain language of
the MOU was not included in the contract amendment between the City and
CalPERS.  This satisfied Petitioners’
obligation to present documentation establishing the right to correction as
required by section 20160(d).  Reply at
5.
This is a distinction without a difference.  Petitioners’ obligation to present
documentation or other evidence establishing the right to correction is
the same as the burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence.
