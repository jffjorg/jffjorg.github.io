  Case Number:  23STCP02217    Hearing Date:   July 30, 2024    Dept:  85 
Ryan Lawrence, Alex Duncan, and Tyler Diamond v. California
Public Employees’ Retirement System and City of Beverly Hills, 23STCP02217


Tentative decision on petition for administrative mandamus:
denied



 
 
Petitioners Ryan Lawrence (“Lawrence”), Alex Duncan
(“Duncan”), and Tyler Diamond (“Diamond”) seek administrative mandamus against Respondents
California Public Employees Retirement System (“CalPERS”) and the City of
Beverly Hills (“City”).  Petitioners
separately move to augment the record.
The court has read and considered the moving papers, oppositions,
and replies, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
            1. Petition
            Petitioners filed this action against
CalPERS on September 26, 2019.  The operative
pleading is the First Amended Petition (“FAP”), filed against CalPERS and the
City on October 16, 2023 and alleging a claim for administrative mandamus.  The FAP alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Petitioners
Diamond and Lawrence were hired by Beverly Hills Police Department (“BHPD”) in
a non-sworn capacity on May 30, 2012.  Petitioner
Duncan was hired by BHPD in a non-sworn capacity on June 22, 2009.  FAP, ¶6. 
When they were hired, Petitioners were advised they were the last
academy class to be categorized in the “3% at age 50” retirement formula.  FAP, ¶6. 
Petitioners were provided with an employment packet stating the same
formula.  FAP, ¶6.   
After extensive negotiation between the City and the Beverly
Hills Police Officers Association (“BHPOA”) from October 2011 to November 2012,
a 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (the “2011 MOU” or “MOU”) provided that,
pursuant to Government Code (“Govt. Code”) section 21362.2, “all current sworn
police personnel hired prior to July 1, 2012” are subject to a 3% at 50
retirement formula.  FAP, ¶9.  The 2011 MOU also provided: “The City will
amend its contract with P.E.R.S. to provide for the 3% at 55 retirement formula
set forth in California Government Code section 21363.1 for employees hired on
or after July 1, 2012.”  FAP, ¶9.
On November 18, 2012, Petitioner Lawrence requested
confirmation that he would be enrolled in the 3% at 50 category under which he
was hired.  FAP, ¶9.  The next day a City Human Resources Analyst,
Sheryl Jacobson, confirmed that Lawrence would be enrolled in the 3% at 50
retirement plan.  FAP, ¶9.
            On
September 8, 2012, without any negotiation or agreement with the BHPOA, the
City submitted an amended contract to CalPERS (the “Amended Contract”) that applied
the 3% at 55 retirement formula to local safety members who became members in
the safety classification after September 8, 2012, the effective date of the Amended
Contract.  FAP, ¶11.
            In
2016, Lawrence discovered that he was improperly placed in the 3% at 55
retirement category.  FAP, ¶12.  He later learned Duncan and Diamond were
improperly placed in that category as well. 
FAP, ¶12.  
            On
December 22, 2020, Petitioners submitted to CalPERS a Request to Correct Status
of Retirement Benefits.  FAP, ¶13.  On February 2, 2021, CalPERS sent each
Petitioner a Determination Letter that denied his request and informed him of
his right to appeal.  FAP, ¶15.  
            All
three Petitioners filed appeals in February 2021.  FAP, ¶15. 
The administrative law judge (“ALJ”) heard the appeals on February 1,
April 13, and April 22, 2022.  FAP,
¶16.  On September 12, 2022, the ALJ issued
a proposed order denying the appeals. 
FAP, ¶17.  The ALJ found that
CalPERS correctly determined that Petitioners were properly enrolled by BHPD in
the 3% at 55 local safety police retirement benefit formula.  FAP, ¶17.
            On
September 13, 2022, CalPERS sent a letter to Petitioners’ counsel.  FAP, ¶18. 
The letter advised that the ALJ’s proposed decision would have no effect
until CalPERS’ Board of Administration (“Board”) formally adopted, remanded, or
declined to adopt it.  FAP, ¶18.  The appeal was calendared for the Board’s
consideration on November 16, 2022.  FAP,
¶18.
            On
November 22, 2022, CalPERS informed Petitioners’ counsel that it decided to
adopt the ALJ’s proposed decision.  FAP,
¶19.  
            Petitioners
seek a writ of administrative mandate compelling CalPERS to set aside the Board’s
final decision, issue a new decision acknowledging that the City erred by communicating
to CalPERS a mis-categorization of Petitioners’ retirement benefits, and recategorizing
Petitioners’ retirement in the 3% at 50 formula.  FAP. Prayer for Relief, ¶1.  Petitioners seek costs and attorney’s fees
under both CCP section 1021.5 and Govt. Code section 800.  FAP, Prayer for Relief, ¶¶ 3-5.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
June 29, 2023, Petitioners served CalPERS with the Petition and Summons.
            On
September 26, 2023, the court sustained CalPERS’ demurrer to the Petition based
on failure to join the City as a necessary party and overruled the demurrer
based on statute of limitations. 
Petitioners were given 20 days leave to amend to add the City as a Respondent.  
            On
October 16, 2023, Petitioners filed the FAP naming CalPERS and City as Respondents.  
            On
November 15, 2023, CalPERS filed an Answer to the FAP.  On December 12, 2023, City filed an Answer to
the FAP. 
 
B. Governing Law
1. Public
Employees’ Retirement Law
The Public
Employees’ Retirement Law (“PERL”) vests the
management and control of the system in CalPERS.  Govt. Code[1] §20120.  CalPERS has
a constitutional duty to “ensure the rights of members and retirees to their
full, earned benefits.”  §20170.  “[CalPERS’] fiduciary duty to its members does
not make it an insurer of every retirement promise contracting agencies make to
their employees.  [CalPERS] has a duty to
follow the law.”  City of Pleasanton v. Board of Administration,
(2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 522, 544.  
The Legislature empowered CalPERS’ Board to be the “sole
judge of the conditions under which persons may be admitted to and continue to
receive benefits under the system.”  §20125. 
The Board “shall correct all actions taken as a result of errors or
omissions of . . . any contracting agency, any state agency, or this system.”  §20160(b).  The Board accomplishes this by holding “a
hearing for the purpose of determining any question presented to it involving
any right, benefit, or obligation of a person” in accordance with PERL.  §20160.
“Contracting agency” means any
public agency that has elected to have all or any part of its employees become
members of the PERL system and that has contracted with the [B]oard for that
purpose.”  §20022.  Both the contracting agency employer
and the employee are required to make contributions to the retirement system
based on a percentage of compensation.  See
Molina
v. Board of Administration, CalPERS, (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 53,
64-65.  A member’s retirement formula is
based on the following: (1) years of service; (2) a percentage figure based on
the age on the date of retirement; and (3) final compensation.  Prentice v. Public Employees Retirement System,
(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1470, 1479.). The percentage figure is commonly referred
to as the “benefit factor” or “benefit formula” and is dependent on the
member’s classification and age at retirement.  Agencies that contract with CalPERS make the
determination which types of retirement benefits they provide their employees.  The more lucrative the benefits, the more the
employer/employee pays in contributions to CalPERS to fund these benefits.  See CalPERS Opp. at 1.
CalPERS members are generally
classified as either “miscellaneous members” or “safety members”.  §20371. 
The “miscellaneous member” classification includes “state miscellaneous members,
National Guard members, university members, local miscellaneous members, state
industrial members, and school members.” 
Id. 
The “local miscellaneous member”
classification includes “all employees of a contracting agency who have by
contract been included within [the PERL] system.”  §20383. 
“Local safety member” includes “all local police officers…employed by a
contracting agency who have by contract been included within this system.”  §20420. 
“Local police officer” means “any officer or employee of a police
department of a contracting agency which is a city…”  §20425. 
Local safety member classifications may be mandatory (e.g.,
§§ 20425 and 20433) or optional.  
A “3 percent at 50” retirement
formula is used to calculate the pension benefits for “local safety members
with respect to local safety service rendered to a contracting agency that is
subject to this section.”  §21363.1(a).  “The combined current and prior service
pensions…for local safety members…is a pension derived from the contributions
of the employer sufficient when added to the service retirement annuity that is
derived from the accumulated normal contributions of the…local safety member at
the date of his or her retirement to equal the fraction of 3 percent of his or
her final compensation set forth opposite his or her age at retirement taken to
the preceding completed quarter year, in the following table, multiplied by the
number of years of local safety service subject to this section with which he
or she is credited at retirement:…” 
§21363.1(a).  The earliest
retirement age set forth in the table is 50 years old.  Id. 
Pension legislation should be liberally construed.  In Re:
Retirement Cases, (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 426, 473.  “However, this rule of liberal construction is
applied for the purpose of effectuating obvious legislative intent and should
not blindly be followed so as to eradicate the clear language and purpose of
the statute.”  Barrett v. Stanislaus Co. Employees Retirement
Assn., (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1593, 1603.  
 
2.  Interpretation of Contract
The interpretation of a contract
is a question of law for the court, and the goal should be to give effect to
the mutual intent of the parties at the time of contracting.  Civil Code §1636; Pacific Gas & E. Co.
v. G.W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co., (1968) 69 Cal.2d 33, 37; MacKinnon v.
Truck Ins. Exch., (2003) 31 Cal.4th 635, 647-48.  Such intent is to be inferred, if possible,
from the written provisions of the contract based on their “ordinary and
popular sense,” unless a “technical sense or special meaning is given to them
by their usage.”  Id. at 648.  If the contractual language is clear and
explicit, it governs.  Id.
The whole of a
contract is to be taken together, so as to give effect to every part, if
reasonably practicable, each clause helping to interpret the other."  Civil Code §1641.  When the terms of a promise are in any
respect ambiguous or uncertain, the promise must be interpreted the way that
the promisor believed it was being understood by promisee.  Civil Code §1649.  California law recognizes that a contract may
be explained by reference to the circumstances under which it was made and the
matter to which it relates.  Civil Code
§1647.  
“When the parties dispute the
meaning of a contract term, the trial court's first step is to determine
whether the term is ambiguous, i.e., it is ‘reasonably susceptible’ to either
of the meanings urged by the parties.  In
making this determination, the court is not limited to the contract language
itself but provisionally receives, without actually admitting, any extrinsic
evidence offered by a party which is relevant to show the contract could or
could not have a particular meaning.  If,
in light of the language of the contract and the extrinsic evidence as to its
meaning, the trial court determines the language is ‘reasonably susceptible’ to
either of the meanings urged by the parties the court moves on to the second
step which is to determine just what the parties intended the contract term to
mean.”  Curry v. Moody, (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 1547, 1552. 
If no extrinsic evidence is
presented, or if the extrinsic evidence is not in conflict, the resolution of
the ambiguity is a question of law, which is subject to independent review on
appeal.  Even where uncontroverted
evidence allows for conflicting inferences to be drawn, the interpretation of a
written contract remains solely a judicial function.  Scheenstra v. California Dairies, Inc.
(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 370, 390.  
 
C. Standard of Review
            CCP
section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus provision which structures the
procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory decisions rendered by
administrative agencies.  Topanga
Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”)
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  
            CCP
section 1094.5 does not in its face specify which cases are subject to
independent review, leaving that issue to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of Angels, (“Fukuda”)
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  In cases
reviewing decisions which affect a vested, fundamental right the trial court
exercises independent judgment on the evidence.  Bixby v. Pierno, (“Bixby”)
(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143; see CCP
§1094.5(c).  The right to receive a
pension benefit in an amount specified by law is a fundamental vested right
governed by the court’s independent review of the facts.  Strumsky v. San Diego County Employees
Retirement Association, (1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 45. 
            Under
the independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the
administrative record for errors of law but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”  Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d at 143.  The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations.  Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City
of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners, (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 860,
868.  In short, the court substitutes its
judgment for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of what happened, when,
why, and the credibility of witnesses.  Guymon
v. Board of Accountancy, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1013-16.
            “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  Fukuda, supra, 20 Cal.4th at 817.  Unless it can be demonstrated by petitioner
that the agency’s actions are not grounded upon any reasonable basis in law or
any substantial basis in fact, the courts should not interfere with the
agency’s discretion or substitute their wisdom for that of the agency.  Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d 130, 150-51;
Bank of America v. State Water Resources Control Board, (1974) 42
Cal.App.3d 198, 208.
            Questions
of law are reviewed de novo.  Molina
v. Board of Administration of CalPERS, (“Molina”) (2011) 200
Cal. App. 4th 53, 61.   The
court interprets an MOU, which is a contract, de novo.  Pittsburg Unified School Dist. v. S.J.
Amoroso Const. Co., Inc., (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 808,
826.  The interpretation is solely a
judicial function unless the interpretation turns on the credibility of
extrinsic evidence.  Parsons v.
Bristol Development Company, (1965) 62 Cal.2d 861, 865.  “Accordingly, an appellate court is not bound
by a construction of a contract based solely upon the terms of the written
instrument without the aid of evidence, were there is no conflict in the
evidence, or a determination has been made upon incompetent evidence.”  Id. (internal citations omitted).  
The court’s interpretation of PERL also is a question of law
reviewed de novo.  While the court accords
deference to an administrative body’s reasonable construction of relevant
statutory provisions within its field of expertise (Dept. of Corrections and
Rehabilitation v. State Personnel Bd., (2016) 238 Cal. App. 4th 710,
717), “[u]ltimately, the interpretation of a statute is a legal question for
the courts to decide, and an administrative agency’s interpretation is not
binding.”  Sara M. v. Superior Court, (2005)
36 Cal. 4th 998, 1011-12. 
Application of law to undisputed fact is also reviewed de novo as a
question of law. S.G. Borello & Sons, Inc. v. Dept. of Industrial
Relations, (1989) 48 Cal. 3d 341, 349.
An agency is presumed to have regularly performed its
official duties (Evid. Code §664), and the petitioner therefore has the burden
of proof.  Steele v. Los Angeles
County Civil Service Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137.  “[T]he burden of proof falls upon the party
attacking the administrative decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings
were unfair, in excess of jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of
discretion.  Afford v. Pierno,
(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 691. 
The agency’s decision must be based on the evidence
presented at the hearing.  Board of
Medical Quality Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860,
862.  The hearing officer is only
required to issue findings that give enough explanation so that parties may
determine whether, and upon what basis, to review the decision. Topanga,
supra, 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15. 
Implicit in section 1094.5 is a requirement that the agency set forth
findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate
decision or order.  Id. at 115.
 
D. Motion to
Augment
Petitioners move to augment the administrative record with
the 2022 MOU between the City and BHPOA. 
CalPERS and the City separately oppose.
1.
Applicable Law
The administrative record shall include the transcript of
the proceedings, all pleadings, all notices and orders, any proposed decision
by a hearing officer, the final decision, all admitted exhibits, all rejected
exhibits in the possession of the local agency or its commission, board,
officer, or agent, all written evidence and any other papers in the case.  See CCP §1094.6; Govt. Code
§11523.  
            “The
general rule is that a hearing on a writ of administrative mandamus is
conducted solely on the record of the proceeding before the administrative
agency.”  Toyota of Visalia v. New
Motor Vehicle Bd. (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 872, 881.  The court can only admit additional evidence where
the party seeking its inclusion shows (1) the evidence could not have been
presented to the agency in the first instance in the exercise of reasonable
diligence or (2) was improperly excluded. 
CCP §1094.5(e); Western States Petroleum Assn. v. Superior Court,
(1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 578; Eureka Citizens for Responsible Govt.
v. City of Eureka, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 357, 366.  
            The
Code of Civil Procedure does not expressly provide for a motion to augment or
correct the administrative record, but they are routinely made.  See e.g., Pomona Valley Hospital
Medical Center v. Superior Court, (“Pomona Valley”) (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th
93, 101.
 
2. Analysis
Petitioners seek to augment the administrative record with
the 2022 MOU, effective May 24, 2022 through June 30, 2025.  Ex. A. 
According to Petitioners, the 2022 MOU places them in the 3% at 50 category
to which they should have belonged, subject to retirement under CalPERS prior
to January 1, 2013 when the Public Employee’s Pension Reform Act (“PEPRA”) went
into effect and limited retirement benefits. 
Mot. at 5; Reply at 3.  
Petitioners argue that the CalPERS Board is required to
correct all actions of a contracting agency, and it does so through a hearing
under section 20134.  A central issue in
this case concerns interpretation of the 2011 MOU.  The ALJ’s interpretation of the 2011 MOU did
not include an assessment of the City’s errors in its Amended Contract with
CalPERS based on a proper interpretation of the 2011 MOU.  The 2022 MOU places Petitioners in the 3% at
50 category.  The 2022 MOU did not exist
at the administrative hearing and could not have been assessed.  Mot. at 6-7.
Petitioners do not explain how or in what provision the 2022
MOU provides them with a 3% at 50 retirement plan.  Assuming arguendo that it does so, the
evidence must be relevant to meet the requirements of CCP section
1094.5(e).  Pomona Valley, supra,
55 Cal.App.4th at 102, 106-07. 
As CalPERS argues (Opp. at 2), Petitioners fail to make the required
showing of relevance for the 2022 MOU.  The issues in the administrative proceeding,
and before the court, concern only the 2011 MOU and its relation to the City’s
amended contract with CalPERS.  See AR
1117 (“The issues therefore in this proceeding are whether PERS correctly
interpreted the contract amendment with City and whether the contract amendment
accurately reflected the retirement provisions in the 2011 MOU. […]”).  The 2022 MOU does not state that it amends
the 2011 MOU.  Rather, it is a separate
agreement negotiated between the City and BHPOA that has no bearing on the
matter at issue.  The City also points
out that the 2022 MOU is not a remedial action, and would be inadmissible under
Evid. Code section 1151 if it were.  City
Opp. at 5.[2] 
The motion to augment is denied.
 
E.  Statement of Facts[3]
            1.  Petitioners’ Employment with City
            Diamond and Lawrence
were hired in a non-sworn capacity on May 30, 2012.  AR 1084. 
Duncan was hired in a non-sworn capacity on June 22, 2009.  AR 1084. 
Petitioners established membership with CalPERS in the miscellaneous
classification on those dates.  AR 48
(Duncan), 188 and 709 (Lawrence), 806 (Diamond).  
            Petitioners were
informed during recruitment by Sgt. Jay Kim and Officer Jennifer Ayre that they
would be the last academy class to be categorized in the 3% at age 50
retirement formula.  AR 779-80, 797,
809-10, 912-13.  Petitioners were
provided with an employment packet to the same effect.  AR 189. 
City Human Resources staffer Arlene Vargas also told Duncan he would be
eligible for the 3% at 50 formula.  AR
780-81.
            On November 8, 2012,
Lawrence emailed City Human Resources Analyst Sheryl Jacobson (“Jacobson”) that
he had received his CalPERS annual statement placing him in the 2.5% at 55
category and requesting confirmation that he would be enrolled in the 3% at 50
category under which he was hired.  AR
220.  On November 19, 2012, Jacobson confirmed
that Lawrence would automatically be enrolled in the 3% at 50 retirement plan
upon his graduation from the Police Academy. 
AR 221.  
            On December 12,
2012, Petitioners became sworn police officers with the City and entered the
safety classification with CalPERS.  AR
414-16, 714, 795, 816-17.  Prior to that
date, including the effective date of the MOU, July 8, 2012, Petitioners had
been classified as miscellaneous employees. 
AR 48; see AR 1084.  
 
            2.  The 2011 MOU
            On July 1, 1941, the
City contracted with CalPERS to provide certain benefits, including retirement
benefits, for its eligible employees.  AR
72-73.  Prior to 2011, the City’s contract
with CalPERS provided safety members retirement benefits using a 3% at 50
retirement formula.  AR 76, ¶9.  
In 2011, the City and the BHPOA
renegotiated the parties’ MOU.  AR
500-29.      Paragraph
A(3) of the 2011 MOU addresses “Pre Service Entry Level Employment” as follows:
 
“Each
newly hired entry level Police Officer excluding individuals hired as lateral
Police Officers) shall serve as a non-sworn civilian employee until such
time as he/she successful graduates from the Police Academy and is sworn in as
a Police Officer.  These
Pre-Service employees shall receive similar benefits as a sworn Police Officer
with the exception of retirement and workers’ compensation benefits.
Because Pre-Service employees are not sworn, they are considered miscellaneous
employees under the Public Employees’ Retirement Law and are not eligible for
workers’ compensation benefits pursuant to Labor Code section 4850. 
 
The probationary
period for Pre-Service entry level Police Officers shall be 18 months from date
of hire as a Pre-Service entry level employee.” 
AR 501 (emphasis added).
 
            Paragraph 16(C) of
the 2011 MOU summarized the retirement formula applied under the pre-2011 MOU
as follows:  
 
“The
City’s contract with [CalPERS] provides for the 3% at 50 retirement formula set
forth int California Government Code Section 21362.2 for all current sworn
police personnel hired prior to July 1, 2012.”  AR 520 (emphasis added).  
 
            Paragraph 16(D) of
the 2011 MOU agreed to the following amendment to the City’s contract with
CalPERS:  
 
“The
City will amend its contract with [CalPERS] to provide for the 3% at 55
retirement formula set forth in California Government Code section 21363.1 for
employees hired on or after July 1, 2012.” 
AR 521 (emphasis added).
 
            Subpart A of the preamble to the MOU includes
an integration clause, which states the MOU “embodies a written memorandum of
the entire understanding and mutual agreement of the parties as required by
section 3505.1 and supersedes all prior Memoranda of Understanding and verbal
agreements between the parties hereto.” 
AR 500.
After further negotiations on salary
terms unrelated to Petitioners’ claims, the 2011 MOU was finalized in November
2012.  AR 748, 887, 906-07.  The 2011 MOU was executed on November 13,
2012.  AR 527, 
 
            3.  The Amended Contract
            The City
Council adopted Resolution No. 12-R-12884 in open session to effectuate the
Amended Contract.  AR 871.  The City Council’s ordinance adopted on
August 7, 2012 codified the same language. 
AR 878-80. 
On September 8, 2012, City submitted its Amended Contract
to CalPERS with an effective date of September 8, 2012.  AR 411, 520. 

Paragraph A(9) of the Amended Contract provides:
 
“The percentage of
final compensation to be provided for each year of credited prior and current
service as a local safety member entering membership in the safety
classification on or prior to the effective date of this amendment to contract
shall be determined in accordance with Section
21362.2 of said Retirement Law (3% at age
50 Full).” (emphasis added).
 
Paragraph A(10) of the Amended Contract provides:
 
“The percentage of
final compensation to be provided for each year of current credited service
as a local safety member entering membership for the first time in the safety
classification after the effective date of this amendment to contract shall
be determined in accordance with Section 21363.1 of said Retirement Law (3%
at age 55 Full).”  AR 411 (emphasis
added).
 
            Paragraph A(11)(g) of the Amended
Contract provides:
 
“[Government Code]
Section 21363.1 (3% @ 55 Full Formula) and Section 20037 (Three-Year
Final Compensation) are applicable to local safety members entering
membership for the first time in the safety classification after the effective
date of this amendment to contract.” 
AR 412 (emphasis added); see AR 557.  
 
            4.  Petitioners’ Request to Correct Status of
Retirement Benefits
            In 2016, Lawrence discovered from
his CalPERS retirement account that he had been placed in the retirement
category of 3% at 55.  AR 39.  Lawrence subsequently confirmed that both Duncan
and Diamond were categorized in the retirement category of 3% at 55.  AR 39. 

            On December 22, 2020, Petitioners’
counsel submitted to CalPERS a Request to Correct Status of Retirement Benefits,
requesting that they be enrolled in the 3% at 50 retirement formula.  AR 37-40. 

On February 2, 2021, CalPERS issued a Determination
Letter to each Petitioner stating that they were not eligible to enroll in the
3% at 50 retirement formula because they were not enrolled in the safety
classification on or prior to the effective date of the Amended Contract.  AR 41-43, 48-50, 55-57.  
 
5. Petitioners’ Appeal
            On February 22 and 24, 2021,
Petitioners’ counsel submitted a letter to CalPERS for each of Petitioner appealing
its determination that he was not eligible for enrollment in the 3% at 50
retirement formula.  AR 62-71.  
            Petitioners argued that they were
hired prior to July 1, 2012 and, pursuant to the 2011 MOU, they were entitled
to the 3% at 50 retirement formula.  AR
62-71.  Under the Amended Contract, a
member is subject to the 3% at 55 retirement formula if enrolled in the safety
classification after September 8, 2012, the effective date of the Amended
Contract.  AR 62-71.  Petitioners contended that the Amended
Contract does not reflect the terms of the 2011 MOU, which only imposed the 3%
at 55 retirement formula on persons hired after July 1, 2012.  AR 62-71. 

            The City argued that Petitioners
were not entitled to the 3% at 50 retirement formula because they first became
sworn officers on December 13, 2012, after both the MOU’s July 1, 2012 date and
the Amended Contract’s September 8, 2012 date. 
AR 572-75.  The City denied that
it made any mistake in amending the CalPERS contract and maintained that it did
not breach the 2011 MOU in the Amended Contract.  AR 572-75.
 
            6.  The Hearing on the Appeal
            CalPERS held a consolidated administrative
hearing for all three Petitioners over the course of February 1, April 13, and
April 22, 2022.  AR 606-1026.  The issue presented to the ALJ was whether
CalPERS was correct in its determination that Petitioners were correctly
enrolled in the 3% at 55 formula rather than the 3% at 50 formula.  AR 1032.
            Petitioners, Peter Brown (“Brown”)
(the City’s chief negotiator of the 2011 MOU), CalPERS employe Andrew Harris
(“Harris”), and Sgt. Jay Kim testified.  The
relevant testimony is summarized as follows:
 
            a.  Peter Brown
            Brown has negotiated every
collective bargaining agreement for the City since 2007.  AR 727. 
Stephen Silver (“Silver”) negotiated the 2011 MOU on behalf of the BJPOA
and has served as the BHPOA’s negotiator since 2007.  AR 729. 
Brown and Silver have known one another since 1989.  AR 729-30. 
They were well versed with
one another’s negotiating styles and understanding of collective bargaining
through their years of interaction.  AR
729-30.
The retirement provisions in police association
collective bargaining agreements are negotiated with only sworn personnel in
mind because only sworn personnel are legally eligible to receive local safety
retirement benefits.  AR 726,
738-39.  At the time of negotiation, the
City had a 3% at 50 formula for safety personnel (i.e., sworn employees).   AR 732-33. 
Because it was grappling with the ongoing recession, the City Council wanted
to reduce the costs of the 3% at 50 retirement formula in place for all sworn
officers and hence wanted negotiate a two-tiered pension formula, with a
different benefit for newly hired sworn personnel.  AR 731. 
The City initially
proposed a 2% at 50 formula for those hired as sworn officers on or after March
1, 2012, as well as providing the same personnel with a three-year average
final compensation retirement calculation.  AR 731-33. 
Multiple proposals for the MOU were communicated in
the negotiations.  AR 734.  As
the parties negotiated the two-tier formula, the parties revised the language
in the MOU to reflect their negotiations. 
AR 737.  By January of 2012, the
draft MOU reflected that the 3% at 50 formula was for “all current sworn police
personnel hired prior to July 1, 2012.” 
AR 741-42. The term “current” was added by BHPOA negotiator Silver.  AR 741-42. 

BHPOA
and the City continued to negotiate the retirement formula and calculation
terms until November 8, 2011, when the parties tentatively agreed to provide a
second-tier retirement formula of 3% at 55 for sworn personnel hired on or
after July 1, 2012.  AR 734-35.  The intent of the parties was that the new 3%
at 55 retirement formula would apply to any person who becomes a sworn employee
after July 1, 2012.  AR 735, 764-65. 
The terms “employees” in section 16(D) and “sworn pol1ice
officers” in section 16(C) of the 2011 MOU are interchangeable.  A 739; see 1067-68.  The terms cover everyone in the bargaining
unit except pre-service officers, who are miscellaneous employees and are not
included in the terms of the MOU because no one can retire as a preservice
officer.  AR 739. The term “pre-service police officer” is defined as an individual who
must complete the Police Academy prior to serving as a sworn police
officer.  AR 727-28.  Either a pre-service officer finishes the Police
Academy and becomes a police officer or, if he or she does not successfully
finish the Academy, their employment with the City ends.  No one retires as a pre-service officer.  AR 739. 

The 2011
MOU reflected that the City would amend its contract with CalPERS to provide a
3% at 55 retirement formula for sworn officers hired on or after July 1, 2012.  AR 490.  The MOU also changed the method for
calculating pension payments from the single highest year to the average of
three consecutive years for sworn officers hired on or after July 1, 2012.  See AR 491.  
The 2011
MOU was approved by the City Council in March 2012 but negotiations reopened
and continued until November 2012 to address a unrelated salary compounding
issue raised by CalPERS. AR 748, 887. The 2011 MOU was then readopted by the
City Council in November 2012.  AR 887, 906-07.
 The retirement provisions remained
unchanged from the March 2012 version of the MOU.  AR 887.
 
            b.  Petitioners
            Petitioners testified that they
understood their employment as police officers with the BHPD was contingent on
their successful completion of the Police Academy.  AR 707, 781, 796, 803-04, 816-17.  Petitioners became sworn officers on December
13, 2012.  AR 702, 714-15, 795, 816-17.  From approximately 2008 until early 2011, Duncan
worked as a police cadet -- a non-sworn position doing various clerical and
office work for BHPD -- before becoming a pre-service officer.  AR 774, 795-96.  
            Petitioners testified that during
their recruitment, Sgt. Jay Kim, the personnel and training sergeant at BHPD,
and Officer Jennifer Ayre both told them they would be eligible for the 3% at
50 retirement formula.  AR 779-80, 797,
809-10, 912.  Human Resource staffers
Arlene Vargas and Sheryl Jacobson also told them that they would be eligible
for the 3% at 50 formula.  AR 780-781,
789.  
 
            c.  Sgt. Jay Kim
            Kim never participated in
negotiations between the City and BHPOA and did not recall speaking with any of
the negotiators about the terms discussed during bargaining sessions.  AR 1003-05. 
The hiring process can take 8-16 months and the terms and conditions of
employment can change during those months. 
AR 1005.  
 
            d. Harris
            Harris is an associate government
program analyst at CalPERS.  AR 640.  He is familiar with the process of correcting
a mistake or omission by a contracting agency. 
AR 681.  The 2011 MOU did not
impact CalPERS’ determination concerning Petitioners because CalPERS looks at
the agency contract and the member’s employment date as controlling items for
benefits.  AR 662.  CalPERS did not look at the 2011 MOU with
respect to the Amended Contract.  AR
681.  
 
            7.  The Decision
            On September 12, 2022, the ALJ
issued a proposed decision denying the appeals. 
AR 1114-1139.  The ALJ determined
the issue to be as follows: 
 
“[Petitioners] sought a
writ of mandate to direct PERS to request a new contract amendment with City
reflecting respondents' entitlement to the 3% at 50 retirement formula. Judge
Chalfant sustained PERS' demurrer and required respondents to exhaust all
administrative remedies to determine whether PERS had correctly enrolled [Petitioners]
in the 3% at 55 retirement plan under the contract amendment and the 2011 MOU. The issues therefore in this
proceeding are whether PERS correctly interpreted the contract amendment with
City and whether the contract amendment accurately reflected the retirement
provisions in the 2011 MOU.…”  AR 1117 (emphasis added).
 
The ALJ examined the text of the Amended Contract (AR
1120-22), the 2011 MOU, including Paragraphs 16(C) and 16(D) (AR 1123-25),
Brown’s testimony (AR 1125), Petitioners’ communications with City employees
(AR 1126-28), and the proceedings in the Prior Lawsuit (AR 1128-29).   
The ALJ found that CalPERS had correctly applied the
3% at 55 retirement formula to Petitioners based on the language of the 2011
MOU, the language of the Amended Contract, and the testimony offered at the
hearing.  AR 1117.  
 
“When considered
together, the language of the contract amendment, the language of the 2011 MOU, and the testimony offered at the
administrative hearing prove the amendment is consistent with the provisions of
the 2011 MOU and PERS correctly applied
the retirement formulas stated therein.  Thus,
respondents are subject to the 3% at 55 retirement formula because they became
local safety members after the date of the contract amendment.” AR 1117.  
 
The ALJ noted the Board’s authority under section
20160(a) to correct a contracting agency’s errors or omissions in a member’s
benefits.  AR 1130.   The City is a contracting agency.  AR 1130. 
Petitioners have the burden of presenting documentation or other
evidence establishing the right to correct. 
§20160(d).  Although CalPERS
disagreed, the ALJ concluded that she had jurisdiction to decide whether
CalPERS and the City complied with section 20475 in amending the City’s
contract with CalPERS and whether the City committed any error in applying the
3% at 55 formula to Petitioners.  AR
1132.
The ALJ stated that “[a]bsent a finding of mistake,
PERS correctly determined the 3% at 55 formula available to police officers
sworn after September 8, 2012, applied to [Petitioners].”  AR 1133. 
The ALJ found that Petitioners failed to prove that the Amended Contract
was based on the City’s mistaken interpretation of the 2011 MOU.  AR 1133-38. 

The ALJ noted that the 2011 MOU focuses exclusively on
benefits for sworn officers because such benefits are only available to sworn
officers.  AR 1136.  Both Paragraphs 16(C) and (D) concern only
retirement benefits for sworn officers. 
AR 1136.  There is no reference to
pre-service personnel and no evidence that the parties negotiated for such
benefits.  AR 1136.  As Brown testified, the 2011 MOU added the
July 1, 2012 cut-off date to distinguish between officers sworn before July 1,
2011 and those sworn afterwards.  AR
1136.  There was no evidence that the
2011 MOU negotiators intended the hiring dates of pre-service employees to be
determinative of sworn officer retirement benefits.  AR 1137. 
Moreover, there is no policy reason why retirement benefits for sworn
officer personnel should be conditioned on the officer’s date of hire as an
unsworn employee.  AR 1137.  The Amended Contract divides sworn officers
into the two categories outlined in Paragraphs 16(C) and (D), albeit using
different terminology and slightly different cutoff dates (September 8, 2012
instead of July 1, 2012).  AR 1137.  Petitioners failed to prove that CALPERS
misapplied the Amended Contract or that the Amended Contract was based on a
mistaken interpretation of the 2011 MOU. 
AR 2011.
On November 16, 2022, the Board adopted the ALJ’s proposed
decision in its entirety.  AR 1113.  
 
8. The Prior Lawsuit
On February 4, 2020, Petitioners filed the second amended complaint in the Prior Lawsuit,
alleging four causes of actions against the City and CalPERS.  CalPERS demurred. The mandate cause of action was
transferred to Department 85.  CalPERS RJN
Ex. 1.  On December 17, 2020, Department 85 sustained
the demurrer to the mandate cause of action for failure to exhaust
administrative remedies.  CalPERS RJN Ex. 2.  
The case was transferred back to Department 72 for the remaining cause of action,
to which CalPERS demurred.  On October 5, 2021, Department 72 sustained CalPERS’ demurrer to
the breach of contract cause of action because CalPERS was not a signatory to
the 2011 MOU and to the breach of individual
employment agreement cause of action because Petitioners were not employees of
CalPERS.  CalPERS
RJN Ex. 3.  The court overruled the demurrer
to the declaratory relief cause of action. 
Ex. 3, p. 3.
Following the underlying administrative hearing in
this case, the City moved for summary judgment.  On May 11, 2023, the court issued a tentative ruling
on the City’s motion.  CalPERS RJN
Ex. 4, pp. 4-11.  On June 6, 2023, the court
issued a judgment in the City’s favor.  CalPERS RJN Ex. 5.  
 
            F. Analysis
Petitioners seek mandamus setting aside the Board’s[4]
decision and compelling the Board to properly categorize Petitioners in the 3%
at 50 retirement category.  They argue
that the ALJ’s decision was a prejudicial abuse of discretion because the
finding that CalPERS correctly enrolled Petitioners in the 3% at 55 formula is
not supported by the weight of the evidence.  The ALJ also failed her duty to correct the
City’s errors and omissions in subjecting Petitioners to an Amended Contract with
CalPERS that is a blatant error in its verbiage.  The decision contravenes CalPERS’ fiduciary
duties owed to Petitioners.  Pet. Op. Br.
at 5.
 
1. The ALJ Properly Interpreted the 2011 MOU
Petitioners state that they remain steadfast in their
position that the MOU’s language is specific and purposeful, intending to make
a July 1, 2012 hire date the basis of determining each retirement category. AR
520.  Petitioners acknowledge they were
not sworn prior to July 1, 2012, but it is also undisputed that they were hired
prior to July 1, 2012.  But if the Board relies solely on the
language in the Amended Contract and “remains behind closed curtains” for the
language of the 2011 MOU, an interpretation of the 2011 MOU on its own is
insufficient.  Pet. Op. Br. at 10.
The parties dispute the proper
interpretation of the language in Paragraph 16(C) of the 2011 MOU, which summarized
the retirement formula under the pre-2011 MOU to be 3% at 50 for all current
sworn police personnel hired prior to July 1, 2012.”  AR 520. 
Yet, Paragraph 16(D) agreed to amend to the City’s contract with CalPERS  to provide for the 3% at 55 retirement
formula for employees hired on or after July 1, 2012.”  AR 521. 
The issue is whether the reference to “employees” in Paragraph 16(D) includes
all employees or only sworn police personnel. 

When the parties dispute the
meaning of a contract term, the trial court's first step is to determine
whether the term is ambiguous -- i.e., it is ‘reasonably susceptible’ to
either of the meanings urged by the parties. 
Curry v. Moody, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1547, 1552.  The court must provisionally receive, without
actually admitting, extrinsic evidence offered by a party which is relevant to
show the contract meaning.  If, in light
of the language of the contract and the extrinsic evidence, the trial court
determines the language is ‘reasonably susceptible’ to either of the meanings
urged by the parties the court moves on to the second step which is to
determine just what the parties intended the contract term to mean.”
The ALJ applied this law of contract interpretation to receive
extrinsic evidence of the Parties’ negotiation and determine the parties’
intent in the 2011 MOU.  Brown, the
City’s chief negotiator, was the only witness at the hearing who participated
in the negotiations over the terms of the 2011 MOU. Brown was familiar with Silver, the BHPOA’s chief negotiator, and the
two had worked together for decades.  Brown’s
uncontested testimony was that the parties intended the new retirement formula
to take effect on July 1, 2012, and that it would apply to sworn officers
joining BHPD on or after that date.  The
parties did not discuss retirement benefits for pre-service officers because
pre-service officers cannot receive the retirement formula.  They only obtain access to retirement
benefits once they become sworn officers. 
Thus, it would have made no sense to consider retirement benefits for
pre-service officers hired prior to July 1, 2012, as the formula was dependent
on when they completed the Police Academy and became sworn active law
enforcement officers.  Petitioners (1)
did not present any witnesses from BHPOA’s negotiating team and (2) provided no
evidence disputing Brown’s testimony about the parties’ discussions at the
negotiation tables or their intent during negotiations. 
The ALJ analyzed the text of the 2011 MOU and noted that Paragraphs 16(C) and 16(D) only apply to sworn police
officers because they provide retirement formulas based on sections 21362.2 and 21363.1, which are only
available to safety members.  AR 1135-36.  The ALJ noted the 2011 MOU does not address pre-service
personnel, which is the position Petitioners held on the effective date of the
2011 MOU.  Id.
   Brown’s
undisputed testimony established that the negotiating parties used the terms employees
and sworn police officers interchangeably in
Paragraphs 16(C) and 16(D) because those provisions only applied to sworn
officers.  AR 1067-68.  Thus,
the parties intended that sworn police
officers joining after July 1, 2012 would receive 3% at 55.[5]

The court
agrees.  The 2011 MOU is ambiguous.  The ALJ correctly interpreted it to reflect the parties’ intent not to provide
a 3% at 50 formula for per-service employees who were not sworn police
personnel before July 1, 2012.  Paragraph 16(C) of the 2011 MOU states that the City’s contract with
CalPERS provides for the 3% at 50 retirement formula for all current sworn
police personnel hired prior to July 1, 2012.  AR 520. 
The reference in Paragraph
16(C) to “current” sworn police personnel supports the conclusion that
employees must be sworn officers prior to July 1, 2012 to obtain the 3% at 50
formula.  Paragraph 16(D)
of the 2011 MOU agreed to amend the City’s contract with CalPERS to provide the
3% at 55 retirement formula for employees hired on or after July 1, 2012.”  AR 521. 
Brown’s testimony shows that the term “employees” means sworn officers.  
Thus, the
evidence established that the parties to the 2011 MOU intended to create a
two-tier retirement benefit that provided “current” sworn officers with the 3%
at 50 benefit and that provided any sworn officer joining BHPD after July 1,
2012 with the 3% at 55 benefit.  Petitioners
are not within the scope of the 3% at 50 formula because they were
miscellaneous employees (pre-service officers) on July 1, 2012, as well as the
effective date of the 2011 MOU, and did
not become sworn police officers until December 13, 2012. 
      2. The
Amended Contract
            A contracting agency may amend its
contract to reduce benefits so long as the contract amendments apply uniformly
with respect to all members within a classification.  §20475(a).
In addition, an existing member can be subject to the contract as amended “only
if, after the effective date of the contract amendment, the member…receives
service credit for the first time within a classification….”  §20475(b).

The City’s Resolution No. 12-R-12884 states in pertinent
part:
 
“WHEREAS, the Public Employees' Retirement Law
permits the participation of public agencies and their employees in the Public
Employees' Retirement System by the execution of a contract, and sets forth the
procedure by which said public agencies may elect to subject themselves and
their employees to amendments to said Law, and [¶]
 
WHEREAS the following
is a statement of the proposed change: 
 
To provide Section
20475 (Different Level of Benefits) Section
21363.1 (3%@ 55 Full formula) and Section
20037 (Three-Year Final Compensation) are applicable to local safety members
entering membership for the first time in the safety classification after the
effective date of this amendment to contract.” (emphasis added).
On September 20, 2012, CalPERS sent a letter to the City
informing it that CalPERS had executed the Amended Contract, effective
September 8, 2012. The Amended Contract provides the following:
 
“The percentage of
final compensation to be provided for each year of credited current service as
a local safety member entering membership for the first time in the
safety classification after the effective date of this amendment to contract
shall be determined in accordance with Section
21363.1 of said Retirement Law (3% at age
55 Full).”  (emphasis added).
 
The ALJ stated that “[a]bsent a finding of mistake, PERS
correctly determined the 3% at 55 formula available to police officers sworn
after September 8, 2012, applied to [Petitioners].”  AR 1133. 

The City legally amended its contract with CalPERS to create
a 3% at 55 benefit formula. The effective date of the amendment, September 8,
2012, is prior to the date Petitioners first received service credit as local
police officers in a safety classification.  While the Amended Contract’s September 8, 2012
effective date differs from the July 1, 2012 date in the 2011 MOU, it does not
work to the disadvantage of any employee. 

The ALJ correctly interpreted the Amended Contract as
providing that Petitioners must be enrolled in a 3% at 55 retirement formula.  
3. The ALJ Correctly Held That the City Did
Not Make a Mistake
Section 20160 provides
the Board “may, in its discretion and upon any terms it deems just, correct the
errors or omissions of any active or retired member.” §20160 (a).  The Board may also correct the errors and
omissions of any contracting agency.  §20160 (b).  The correction must not provide the party
seeking correction with a status, right, or obligation not otherwise available.
 §20160(a)(3).
 The party seeking correction of an error
or omission has the burden of presenting documentation or other evidence to the
Board establishing the right to correction.  §20160(d).  
Petitioners first contend that the City committed errors and omissions by
submitting the Amended Contract to CalPERS with language contradicting the 2011
MOU.  The applicable section of the City
Council Resolution No. 12-R-12884
is as follows: “Section 21363.1 (3% @ 55 Full formula) and Section 20037
(Three-Year Final Compensation) are applicable to local safety members entering
membership for the first time in the safety classification after the
effective date of this amendment to contract.” AR 441, 557 (emphasis added).
The effective date of the Amended Contract
is September 6, 2012.  This is an
entirely different delineation of those eligible for each respective retirement
category in accordance with the 2011 MOU, which uses the hiring date of July 1,
2012 as the effective date to determine placement of employees into retirement
categories.  Pet. Op. Br. at 6-7.
At the hearing, Petitioners argued the Amended Contract was
based on the City’s mistaken interpretation of the 2011 MOU.  Petitioners argued that their date of hire was
the determinative, not the date they became sworn police officer.  AR
395-96.  Because they were hired as
“police officers” before July 1, 2012, they are entitled to the 3% at 50
formula.  Petitioners note that the City
cannot reduce its benefit levels for employees without fully discharging its
obligations imposed by the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (“MMBA”) (§§ 3500-11).  §20475. 
Yet, the City, without review and approval by counsel for BHPOA, BHPOA
representatives, or any bargaining unit members, submitted the Amended Contract
to CalPERS with entirely different language relevant to the retirement language
at issue. [6] Pet.
Op. Br. at 9-10.
The ALJ rejected this argument.  The ALJ noted the Board’s authority under
section 20160(a) to correct errors or omissions by a contracting agency in a
member’s benefits.  AR 1130.   The City is such a contracting agency.  AR 1130. 
Petitioners had the burden of presenting documentation or other evidence
establishing the right to correct. 
§20160(d).  AR 1132.  
The ALJ found that Petitioners failed to prove that
the Amended Contract was based on the City’s mistaken interpretation of the
2011 MOU.  AR 1133-38.  The ALJ noted that the 2011 MOU focuses
exclusively on benefits for sworn officers because such benefits are only
available to sworn officers.  AR
1136.  Both Paragraphs 16(C) and 16(D)
concern only retirement benefits for sworn officers.  AR 1136. 
There is no reference to pre-service personnel and no evidence that the
parties negotiated for such benefits.  AR
1136.  As Brown testified, the 2011 MOU
added the July 1, 2012 cut-off date to distinguish between officers sworn
before July 1, 2011 and those sworn afterwards. 
AR 1136.  There was no evidence
that the 2011 MOU negotiators intended the hiring dates of pre-service employees
to be determinative of sworn officer retirement benefits.  AR 1137. 

The Amended Contract divides sworn officers into the two
categories outlined in Paragraphs 16(C) and (D), albeit using different
terminology and slightly different cut-off dates (September 8, 2012 instead of
July 1, 2012).  AR 1137.  “When considered together, the language of
the contract amendment, the language of the 2011 MOU, and the testimony offered
at the administrative hearing prove the amendment is consistent with the
provisions of the 2011 MOU and PERS correctly applied the retirement formulas
stated therein.  AR 1117.  Moreover, there is no policy reason why
retirement benefits for sworn officer personnel should be conditioned on the
officer’s date of hire as an unsworn employee. 
AR 1137.  Petitioners failed to
prove that CALPERS misapplied the Amended Contract or that the Amended Contract
was based on a mistaken interpretation of the 2011 MOU.  AR 2011. 
The court agrees. 
As CalPERS argues, Petitioners failed to present any evidence that they
were sworn police officers on or prior to the effective date of either the 2011 MOU or the Amended Contract.  All evidence, mainly the 2011 MOU and the personnel action forms,
demonstrated that Petitioners were miscellaneous members -- pre-service
officers who are non-sworn safety personnel -- on the effective date of the 2011 MOU. Therefore, the City and CalPERS did
not make a mistake by enrolling Petitioners in the 3% at 50 formula.  CalPERS Opp. at 12-13.
Petitioners next contend that the purpose of exhausting
administrative remedies was, in part, to obtain the expertise that the Board
would provide in its interpretation of the MOU as applicable to its
obligation to correct errors and omissions by the City.  AR 228. 
Specifically, the court’s demurrer ruling provided that the Board “can
conclude that the City erred in its contract amendment with CalPERS.” AR
228.  
The ALJ based her interpretation of the 2011 MOU on
extrinsic evidence, rather than any evidence of CalPERS’s interpretation of the
MOU’s relation to the Amended Contract. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 11.  The ALJ made
a caveat to her reasoning: “Absent a finding of mistake, PERS correctly
determined the 3% at 55 formula available to police officers sworn after
September 8, 2012, applied to [Petitioners].” 
AR 1046.  This statement shows the
2011 MOU must be interpreted in connection with the contract between CalPERS and
the City to determine whether there should be a finding of mistake by the City
in its altered language in its contract amendment with CalPERS.  If the Board relies solely on the language in
the Amended Contract, an interpretation of the MOU’s language does nothing to
quell this absence of mistake determination. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 10.
Despite the ALJ’s decision to follow the court’s ruling on
demurrer, she did not use the expertise of CalPERS in assessing the 2011 MOU in
conjunction with the Amended Contract. Harris, who worked at CalPERS in the
membership and post-retirement employment determinations unit, testified that
the 2011 MOU did not “impact CalPERS’ determination” in this case, and that the
2011 MOU “isn’t controlling for [CalPERS’s] review in this case.”  AR 662. 
Harris clearly testified that CalPERS has the authority to interpret the
2011 MOU and that it did not do so.  AR
662.  Pet. Op. Br. at 4.
Petitioners
essentially are arguing that CalPERS’s witness Harris was required to evaluate
the meaning of the 2011 MOU.  Petitioners
do not cite any legal support that Harris, or anyone else at CalPERS, was
required to interpret the 2011 MOU to determine if the City made a mistake in
the Amended Contract.  Petitioners also make no showing that the
interpretation of the 2011 MOU, Amended Contract, and their relationship
required CalPERS witness testimony.  Matters
of contract interpretation rarely require expert analysis.  When the extrinsic evidence is not in
conflict, the resolution of the ambiguity is a question of law.  Scheenstra v. California Dairies, Inc.,
supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at 390.
Whether a
decision-maker needs expert testimony to interpret a contract – as opposed to
whether it is ambiguous -- is a matter of discretion.  The ALJ, acting on behalf of the Board, reviewed the 2011 MOU, ascertained the intent of the
parties, and analyzed the Amended Contract to determine compliance with the PERL.  Her analysis was adopted the Board.  There was no reason for the ALJ to hear from CalPERS’
staff on the mistake issue.  CalPERS
staff did not draft the 2011 MOU or the Amended
Contract and the ALJ could make the
decision without such testimony.  
The City
also points out that Petitioners never argued in their closing briefs to the
ALJ, or in arguments before to the Board, that CalPERS analysts must interpret
the 2011 MOU and its relationship to the Amended Contract.  See AR 389-97, 1088-93.  City Opp. at 14-15.  The exhaustion doctrine includes issue exhaustion as well as
exhaustion of administrative remedies. 
The agency must be given the opportunity to reach a reasoned and final
conclusion on each and every issue upon which it has jurisdiction to act before
it is raised in a judicial forum.  Hill
RHF Housing Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles, (2021), 12 Cal.5th 458,
479 (citation omitted).  “Exhaustion
requires ‘a full presentation to the administrative agency upon all issues of
the case and at all prescribed stages of the administrative proceedings.’”  City of San Jose v. Operating Engineers
Local Union No. 3, (2010) 49 Cal.4th 597, 609 (citations
omitted).  As such, Petitioners failed to exhaust any need for a CalPERS assessment.[7]
Finally,
Petitioners argue that the ALJ did not comply with the law because she
interpreted the 2011 MOU (based on evidence concerning the intent of BHPOA and
the City when negotiating it), compared the language in the 2011 MOU to
the Amended Contract, and determined that the language in both documents is essentially
the same.  The ALJ cited no law concerning
mistake in her interpretation of the 2011 MOU, not mistake under contract law
nor mistake in the obligation of CalPERS to correct “the errors or omissions”
of the City (§20160(a)).  AR 1043–44, 1047–48.
 The ALJ merely cited case law on the
interpretation of the 2011 MOU without determining whether the City’s blatantly
different language in the Amended Contract constituted errors or omissions under
section 20160.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11; Reply
at 9.
 The ALJ failed to
assess whether the City erred solely because the City declared that it did not
make an error: “I believe that is a mistake that could be corrected [by
CalPERS] if the City believed that that (sic) was actually a
mistake. But the City’s continuously argued that it wasn’t a mistake.” AR 720.
(emphasis added). The irony of the ALJ’s analysis is that, on the one hand, she
cited Brown’s testimony as undisputed evidence that the negotiators never
considered the hire dates in negotiating the terms of retirement eligibility
(AR 1050) yet concluded that Petitioners’ extrinsic evidence that they were
advised by numerous City sources of their eligibility for 3% at 50 retirement
based on the date they were hired as police officers is irrelevant.  Pet. Op. Br. at 11-12. 
Petitioners add that the ALJ’s conclusory decision that
Petitioners did not prove mistake is not an assessment whether the City made
errors and omissions in the Amended Contract. 
Had the City asked in the Amended Contract to enroll Petitioners, who
were hired prior to July 1, 2012, in the 3% at 50 retirement category, CalPERS
would have swiftly done so. The City’s mistake was in omitting language agreed
upon in the MOU related to Petitioners’ retirement benefits. The impact of that
mistake was a misclassification of Petitioners in the 3% at 55 retirement
category.  Reply at 5-6.
Petitioners conclude that neither the ALJ nor the Board ever
decided whether the City made an error to be corrected by CalPERS.  In fact, the Board’s adoption of the ALJ’s
proposed decision alters the language of the MOU to support its contention:
“Those officers sworn before July 1, 2012, are eligible to receive the more
favorable formula due to their seniority. Those officers sworn after
July 1, 2012, receive the less favorable 3% at 55 formula.” AR 1085) (emphasis
added).  The actual language of the MOU is
that “employees hired on or after July 1, 2012” are in the 3% at 55
formula. AR 520.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12;
Reply at 9.
Contrary
to Petitioners’ argument, the ALJ did evaluate whether the City made a
mistake.  She compared the 2011 MOU and
the Amended Contract and found them to be consistent on the issue presented
based on the proper interpretation of both. 
Petitioners’ argument assumes that the City made a mistake in the
Amended Contract.  It did not because
2011 MOU and the Amended Contract are consistent on the material issues in this
case.  (The different dates of July 1 and
September 8, 2022 are immaterial to Petitioners.) [8]
The Board has the discretion to correct an error or
omission of any active or retired member that was the result of an error or
omission of any contracting agency or CalPERS. 
§20160(a).   In correcting an error or omission, the Board
may “hold a hearing for the purpose of determining any question presented to
it involving any right, benefit, or obligation of a person under this part.”
§20134.  Through the ALJ, the Board held a hearing to determine
the Petitioners’ rights, including the intention of the parties in the 2011 MOU,
the meaning of the Amended Contract, and whether the City made any mistake in
drafting it.  After considering the
evidence, the ALJ correctly concluded that the City’s interpretation of the MOU
was correct and that the Amended Contract did not contain any errors or
omissions.  
 
4. PEPRA Has No
Direct Application
PEPRA applies to all
California public sector employees and employers regardless of an employee’s
date of hire.  §7522.02.  A public employer that does not offer a
supplemental defined benefit plan before January 1, 2013, shall not offer a supplemental
defined benefit plan for any employee on or after January 1, 2013.  §7522.18(a). 
A public employer that provides a supplemental defined benefit plan,
including a defined benefit plan offered by a private provider, before January
1, 2013, shall not offer a supplemental defined benefit plan to any additional
employee group to which the plan was not provided before January 1, 2013.  §7522.18(b).
CalPERS argues that Petitioners seek to retroactively
increase their retirement benefits. Yet, under PEPRA,
a public employer that does not offer a supplemental defined benefit plan
before January 1, 2013, is prohibited from offering a supplemental defined
benefit plan for any employee on or after January 1, 2013. §7522.18 (a).  There is no evidence that the City offered a
supplemental defined benefit plan prior to January 1, 2013 and it therefore cannot
offer one to Petitioners. Additionally, PEPRA
precludes the City and Petitioners from contracting for a retroactive benefit
enhancement. §7522.44.  Thus, Petitioners cannot retroactively
contract for enhanced benefits.  CalPERS
Opp. at 13-14; see City
Opp. at 1-19.
Petitioners reply
that it is curious that CalPERS and the City rely on PEPRA. PEPRA is applies
to new members of a public retirement system on or after January 1, 2013.  §§ 75222.04(f).  There is no debate that Petitioners were
members of CalPERS before January 1, 2013. Nor is the City offering a
supplemental defined benefit plan after January 1, 2013.  More importantly, the court has the authority
to order CalPERS to correct an error that prevented Petitioners from obtaining
the benefits to which they are entitled. Petitioners are requesting a
correction of an error in the classification of their benefit plan having
nothing to do with a supplemental or retroactive benefit.  Thus, PEPRA cannot serve to prevent CalPERS
from correcting an error.  Reply at 7-8.
The court agrees that PEPRA is relevant only insofar as it
precludes retroactive benefits to Petitioners unless the City mistakenly
interpreted the 2011 MOU.  
 
5. The Representations to Petitioners Cannot
Contradict the PERL
Petitioners
argued at the hearing that Sgt. Kim, Officer Ayers, and Human Resources
employees Vargas and Jacobson told Petitioners that they would be eligible for
the 3% at 50 formula.  These statements
are irrelevant.  It is well
established under California law that principles of estoppel may not be invoked
to directly contravene statutory limitations by classifying employees as safety
members when they are not.  Medina v. Board of Retirement,
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 864, 869.
PERL defines a “local safety member” eligible for
retirement benefits.  The 2011 MOU and
the Amended Contract both provide that City elected to be subject to 21362.2 (providing
the 3% at 50 benefit) for all current sworn police personnel hired prior to
July 1, 2012.  The City also elected to
be subject to 21362.3 (providing the 3% at 55 benefit) for sworn police
personnel employees hired after July 1, 2012. 
Petitioners all admitted that they were not sworn at their time of hire
by the City in 2012. Moreover, they all admitted that they could not serve as
police officers until they successfully completed the Police Academy, which did
not occur until December 13, 2012.  
If CalPERS were to accept Petitioners’ arguments, it
would be violating both the PERL and PEPRA. Petitioners cannot rely on estoppel
to directly contravene these statutory limitations.  
 
G. Conclusion
The FAP is denied. 
CalPERS’ counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed judgment, serve it on
both other counsel for approval as to form, wait ten days after service for any
objections, meet and confer if there are objections, and then submit the
proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the existence/non-existence
of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re:
judgment is set for August 29, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.
