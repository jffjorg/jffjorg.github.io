And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition by CalPERS to enroll certain police officers in the 3% at 50 retirement formula. The issue arises from the interpretation of a 2011 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the City and CalPERS. The City argues that the MOU only applies to officers who were sworn on or before July 1, 2012, while CalPERS claims that it applies to all officers who became sworn after that date. The judge notes that the City and CalPERS met in good faith in negotiating the MOU and that there is no evidence that the MMBA was violated. The judge also points out that Duncan, an employee who was hired as a non-sworn officer in 2008 and became a sworn officer in 2012, would not be eligible for the 3% at 50 retirement formula under the City's interpretation of the MOU. The judge grants CalPERS' request for judicial notice of certain documents related to a prior lawsuit and denies the City's request to address an additional argument that the 2022 MOU does not meet the test of CCP section 1094.5(e). The judge will consider the parties' arguments and issue a final ruling.
