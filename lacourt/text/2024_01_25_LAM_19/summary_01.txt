The court grants the motion in part, ordering Kyu Kim to provide verified responses without objections within 30 days. Additionally, the court grants the request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $802.50, payable to Joongangilbo USA, Inc.'s attorney within 30 days. The court finds that Kyu Kim's failure to respond to discovery warrants sanctions for reasonable expenses incurred by Joongangilbo USA, Inc. The court takes into account the lack of formal opposition or reply in reducing the amount of sanctions awarded.
