And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on two motions. The first motion is from the plaintiff, who is asking to file a First Amended Complaint to update his allegations and add a new cause of action for declaratory relief. The judge has granted this motion, allowing the plaintiff to file the First Amended Complaint within 10 days. The judge found that the amendment does not change the factual theory of the case and will not require significant additional discovery or preparation.

The second motion is from the defendant, who is asking to file a Cross-Complaint against the other defendants. The judge has granted this motion as well, allowing the defendant to file the Cross-Complaint within 10 days. The motion was unopposed, and the judge found that this amounts to a concession by the other parties that the motion has merit.
