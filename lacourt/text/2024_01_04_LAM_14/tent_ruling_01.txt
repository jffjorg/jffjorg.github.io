  Case Number:  21STCV14528    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  14 David Starr vs James SpeedCase Background
 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has
allowed his rubber tree to grow into Plaintiff’s property.
 
On April 16, 2021, Plaintiff filed his
Complaint for (1) Private Nuisance, (2) Trespass, and (3) Negligence against
Defendants James Speed (“Speed”) and DOES 1-15.
 
On May 21, 2021, Defendant Speed
filed his Answer.
 
On September 22, 2022, Plaintiff
filed two Amendments to Complaint substituting Defendants Michelle McFadden and
Andrew Quinn in lieu of DOES 1-2, respectively.
 
            Jury Trial
is currently set for March 18, 2024.
 
(1)        Leave
File FAC
 
            Plaintiff
now moves this court for an order permitting him to file a First Amended
Complaint to update his allegations to be more specific about Defendants
Michelle McFadden and Andrew Quinn, as well as to add a cause of action for
declaratory relief.
 
Governing Standard
 
            “[T]he
court's discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit amendment of
the pleadings. [Citations]. The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.” Howard
v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428. It is
an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend based on delay alone; the
amendment must affirmatively prejudice the opposing side. Higgins v. Del
Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565. However, prejudice exists where
the delay is unwarranted and the result will be additional cost for trial
preparation, witness depositions, and other discovery. See Doe v. Los
Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family Services (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th
675, 689 (citing Melican v. Regents of University of California (2007)
151 Cal.App.4th 168, 175); P&D Consultants, Inc. v. City of
Carlsbad (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1345 (citing Huff v.
Wilkins (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 732, 746).
 
Decision
 
            The motion is
GRANTED. Plaintiff is ORDERED to file his First Amended Complaint within 10
days.
 
            Defendant
Speed identifies no prejudice in his opposition, and none appears to this
court. This amendment does not change the factual theory of the case as
previously understood by all parties, and should not necessitate much
additional discovery or preparation. It will certainly not disrupt the case any
more than the cross-complaint that Defendant Speed seeks leave to file.
 
(2)        Leave
File Cross-Complaint
 
            Defendant
Speed now moves this court for an order permitting the filing of a
Cross-Complaint for (1) Indemnity, (2) Contribution, and (3) Declaratory Relief
against Defendants Michelle McFadden and Andrew Quinn.
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is GRANTED. Defendant Speed is ORDERED to file his Cross-Complaint within 10
days.
 
The motion is unopposed. This
amounts to a concession by Plaintiff and by Defendants Michelle McFadden and
Andrew Quinn that the motion has merit. See California Rules of Court Rule
3.1113(a); see also Rule 3.1320(f); Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005)
133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20.
