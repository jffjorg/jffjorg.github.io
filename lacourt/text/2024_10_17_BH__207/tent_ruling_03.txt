ANALYSIS
 
Motion to Quash

81-33025240. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 10 
 
All DOCUMENTS reflecting a transaction made by LiveOne, Inc. on May 6,
2024 in the amount of $20,000.00 with the following ACH Payment Reference
#D873-3F80), including monthly bank statements for East West Bank Account No.
81-33025240.
 
            Defendant moves to quash the subpoena
on the grounds that (1) the requests are overbroad; (2) the requested financial
statements reveal confidential information about Defendant and third parties; and
(3) the requested financial statements are of limited probative value.
 
            Plaintiffs oppose, on the grounds
that Plaintiffs obtained a ledger in discovery, indicating that Defendant made
ten rent payments on the property, and listing the ten ACH payment reference
numbers noted above.  Plaintiffs now
seeks bank records pertaining to those specific transactions.
 
            The Court agrees with Plaintiff that
financial records pertaining to these ten specific ACH transactions are
directly relevant to the dispute, which concerns whether Defendant improperly
operated a business out of a residential home. 
However, the Court also agrees with Defendants that monthly bank
statements showing Defendant’s full account balance and every transaction
Defendant made from July 2023 through May 2024 (except March 2024) is overbroad.  Further, Defendant’s argument that these financial
records contain salary information for its employees is problematic.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff’s Motion to Quash.  Because Plaintiffs’ subpoena to East West
Bank seeks financial information beyond the ten ACH payment transactions listed,
the Court finds the requests are overbroad and violative of third-party privacy
rights.  
 
Instead of modifying the subpoena, the Court exercises its discretion
to quash the subpoena as currently crafted, compelling Plaintiffs to narrowly
tailor any subsequent subpoena to elicit information related solely to the ten
ACH payment transactions.  
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
