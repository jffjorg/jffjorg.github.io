And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a subpoena served by the plaintiffs on East West Bank. The subpoena seeks financial records related to ten specific transactions made by the defendant, LiveOne, Inc. The defendant argues that the requests are overbroad and reveal confidential information about itself and third parties. The plaintiffs argue that the financial records are directly relevant to the dispute and that they have already obtained a ledger showing the defendant's rent payments.

The court agrees with the plaintiffs that the financial records related to the specific transactions are relevant to the dispute, but also agrees with the defendant that the monthly bank statements showing the defendant's full account balance and every transaction it made from July 2023 to May 2024 (except March 2024) is overbroad.

Therefore, the court grants the motion to quash the subpoena and orders the plaintiffs to narrowly tailor any subsequent subpoena to elicit information related solely to the ten ACH payment transactions. The defendant must provide notice of the court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
