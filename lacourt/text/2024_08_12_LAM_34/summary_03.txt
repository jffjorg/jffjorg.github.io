The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The case involves an unlawful detainer action filed by the Plaintiff, Shahram Pascal Abrar, assignee of Yellow Hope Holdings, LLC, against the Defendant, Tayfun Paul Kadioglu, for failure to pay rent and failure to vacate the premises. The Defendant argues that the notice to pay rent or quit served on him does not state the number of bedrooms in the rental unit, as required by the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) section 165.03(A). The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with this requirement warrants the granting of the Defendant's motion.
