 Case Number:  24STCV05809    Hearing Date:   August 12, 2024    Dept:  34 Defendant Tayfun Paul Kadioglu’s Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED. 
Background
Plaintiff
Shahram Pascal Abrar, assignee of Yellow Hope Holdings, LLC (“Plaintiff”), alleges
as follows:
On May 23, 2022, Tayfun Paul Kadioglu, erroneously
sued as Tayfun King (“Kadioglu”),
entered into a written residential lease agreement with Plaintiff to pay
$18,500.00 per month until May 31, 2024. Kadioglu failed to make his monthly
rent payments as agreed and owes past-due rent in the amount of $65,500.00. On
February 21, 2024, Plaintiff personally served Kadioglu with notice to vacate
or pay rent. Kadioglu has failed to vacate the premises or pay the past-due
rent amount.
A final status conference is set for August 27, 2024.
The jury trial is set for September 9, 2024.
Legal Standard
The standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is
essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under
the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially
noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.¿(Bezirdjian
v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322, citing Schabarum
v. California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.)¿Matters
which are subject to mandatory judicial notice may be treated as part of the
complaint and may be considered without notice to the parties. Matters which
are subject to permissive judicial notice must be specified in the notice of
motion, the supporting points and authorities, or as the court otherwise
permits. (Id.)¿The motion may not be supported by extrinsic evidence. (Barker
v. Hull (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 221, 236.)¿ 
When the moving party is a defendant, he or she must demonstrate that
“The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in
the complaint” or “The complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action against that defendant.” (CCP §§ 438(c)(1)(B)(i)-(ii).)¿¿
Meet and Confer
Generally, before filing a judgment on the pleadings pursuant to this
chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with
the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the motion for judgment on
the pleadings for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the motion for
judgment on the pleadings...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 439(a).) However, this
requirement does not apply to unlawful detainer cases. (Code Civ. Proc., §
439(d)(2).)
Although Defendant Kadioglu did not file a meet and confer declaration
prior to filing the instant motion, he was not required to do so because this
is an unlawful detainer action.
Discussion
Defendant Tayfun Paul Kadioglu, erroneously sued as
Tayfun King (“Kadioglu”) moves for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds
that the notice to pay rent or quit served on him violates the Los Angeles Just
Cause for Eviction Ordinance. Specifically, Kadioglu argues the notice to pay
rent or quit does not state the number of bedrooms in the tenant’s rental unit
per Los Angeles Municipal Code (“LAMC”) section 165.03(A). 
Generally, “[t]he basic elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of
rent ... are (1) the tenant is in possession of the premises; (2) that
possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in default for nonpayment
of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a written three-day
notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day notice period has
elapsed.” (KB Salt Lake III, LLC v. Fitness Int'l, LLC, (2023) 95 Cal.
App. 5th 1032, 1045.) However, when a property is subject to the Tenant
Protection Act of 2019 under Civil Code section 1946.2, “[t]o plead a valid
unlawful detainer claim, the complaint must allege that the tenancy was
terminated for “just cause.” (Attenello v. Basilious (2022) 88 Cal. App.
5th Supp. 1, 6.)
Plaintiff alleges that the property at issue is subject to
the Tenant Protection Act of 2019. (UD Compl., ¶7b.) Plaintiff further alleges
that Kadioglu’s tenancy was terminated for at-fault just cause under Civil Code
section 1946.2(b)(1). (Id., ¶8a.) Plaintiff further alleges that
Kadioglu is in possession of the premises without permission, owes past-due
rent, and has failed to pay rent or vacate the premises after being served a
written three-day notice. (Id., at pp. 2-4.)
Los Angeles Municipal Code (“LAMC”) section 165.03(A) states
in pertinent part:
A landlord shall not terminate a
tenancy unless it is based upon one or more of the following grounds:
 A.   The
tenant has defaulted in the payment of rent to which the landlord is entitled;
provided, however, that the landlord’s right to evict a tenant lawfully in
possession of residential housing under this subsection is limited to defaults
in payment where the amount due exceeds one month of fair market rent for the
Los Angeles metro area set annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development for an equivalent sized rental unit as that occupied by the tenant.
The written notice to the tenant required under Section 165.05 of
this article shall state the number of bedrooms in the tenant’s rental unit.”
(emphasis added.)
However, LAMC section 165.03(A) “shall not apply until the
expiration of an initial original lease or after six months of continuous and
lawful occupancy, whichever comes first,” or the rental unit falls under one of
the exemptions set forth therein. (LAMC § 165.04.) These exemptions include,
but are not limited to, rental units subject to the Rent Stabilization
Ordinance, transient and tourist hotel occupancy, sorority and fraternity
housing accommodations, asylums, hospitals, religious facilities, etc. (Id.)
First, Plaintiff does not dispute that the three-day notice
served on Kadioglu fails to state the number of bedrooms for the rental unit at
issue. Instead, Plaintiff contends that the property at issue is exempt from
the requirements set forth in LAMC section 165.03 because it is a “luxury”
residential complex and Kadioglu is not a low-income resident. However,
Plaintiff fails to cite to any legal authority supporting that “luxury”
apartment complexes are exempt from LAMC section 165.03(A). Furthermore,
“luxury” apartment complexes are not one of the types of residential real
properties or residential circumstances that are exempted from LAMC section
165.03(A).
Next, Plaintiff argues that Code of Civil Procedure section
1161(2) preempts LAMC Section 165.00 because LAMC Section 165.00 conflicts with
the provisions set forth in Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161(2). Specifically,
Plaintiff asserts that Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(2) does not require
a three-day notice to state the number of bedrooms in the tenant’s rental unit.
As a preliminary matter, “[t]he party claiming that general
state law preempts a local ordinance has the burden of demonstrating
preemption.” (Rental Housing Assn. of Northern Alameda County v. City of
Oakland (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 741, 752.) Even though Plaintiff cites to
California Constitution Art. XI, section 7 to support this contention,
Plaintiff makes no showing that LAMC section 165.03 requirement that the
three-day notice include a statement of the number of bedrooms in the tenant’s
rental unit conflicts with Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(2). “A conflict
exists if the local legislation ‘duplicates, contradicts, or enters an area
fully occupied by general law, either expressly or by legislative
implication.’” (Id.) Plaintiff does not argue that LAMC section 165.03
is a duplicate of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161(2) or enters an area of
law fully occupied by the state but appears to argue that LAMC section 165.03
contradicts Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(2) by adding a requirement to
the three-day notice. Notably, a local ordinance is said to contradict a state
law if it tends to harm or obstruct the purpose of the state law. However, “the
purpose of the unlawful detainer statutes is procedural, and they do not
preempt municipal limitations on grounds for eviction that aid in enforcing
local rent control legislation. Thus, a local rent control ordinance may
permissibly eliminate a ground for eviction specified in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1161 without creating a conflict with the unlawful detainer
statutes.” (Rental Housing Assn. of Northern Alameda County, supra, 171
Cal.App.4th 764; see also Larson v. City and County of San Francisco
(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1263.) As such, LAMC sections 165.00 and 165.03 are not
preempted by Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(2).
Finally, “[t]he statutory situations in which the remedy of
unlawful detainer is available are exclusive and the statutory procedure must
be strictly followed” because an unlawful detainer case involves the forfeiture
of a tenant’s right to possession. (Berry v. Society of St. Pius X
(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 354, 363.) Thus, Plaintiff was required to comply with
LAMC Section 165.03(A) and failed to do so.
In light of the foregoing, the motion for judgement on the
pleadings is GRANTED.
