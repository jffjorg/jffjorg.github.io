And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of ALDI Law Group, counsel for Brother Energy LLC and Larry Dodds, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is granted effective upon the filing of a proof of service showing service of the signed order upon the clients at their last known address. The court finds that the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 have been met, including notice to the client, a declaration stating the reasons for the motion, and service of the notice and motion on the client and all other parties. The judge notes that the relationship of trust and confidence between the client and attorney has ceased to exist, making it unreasonably difficult for the attorney to continue representing the client.
