And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to serve verified responses to form interrogatories, set one, and request for sanctions, as well as the motion to deem requests for admission, set one, admitted, and request for sanctions. The defendant, Michico Marie Alexander, is ordered to serve the responses within 20 days of the order. Additionally, the defendant is ordered to pay sanctions of $530.00 to the plaintiff's counsel. The order to pay sanctions is stayed pending compliance with the order to serve the verified responses. The judge's ruling is based on the defendant's failure to serve initial responses to the discovery requests, despite a meet and confer effort. The judge finds that the defendant's actions constitute a misuse of the discovery process and that sanctions are appropriate.
