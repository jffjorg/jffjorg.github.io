DEFENDANT MICHICO MARIE ALEXANDER IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE INTERROGATORIES WITHIN 20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF THIS ORDER. ALSO, DEFENDANT MICHICO MARIE ALEXANDER IS TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $530.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL. THE ORDER TO PAY SANCTIONS IS STAYED, PENDING COMPLIANCE WITH THE ORDER TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE INTERROGATORIES WITHIN 20 DAYS' NOTICE OF THIS ORDER.ANALYSIS:Plaintiff Aspire General Insurance Company (“Defendant”) propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Admission, Set One, on Defendant Michico Marie Alexander (“Defendant”) on February 27, 2024. (Motions, Tapper Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort, Defendant had not served responses as of the filing of the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; (2) Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and Request for Sanctions, on September 30, 2024. (Id. at ¶3 and Exh. B.)The Motions initially came for hearing on November 4, 2024. (Minute Order, 11/04/24.) Both parties appeared and Defendant represented to the Court that she had responses to the Motions. (Ibid.) The Court ordered the parties to meet and confer and continued the hearing date to December 9, 2024. (Ibid.) To date, no supplemental papers have been filed regarding the responses or the parties’ meet and confer efforts.DiscussionBased on Defendant’s failure to serve initial responses to the discovery, the Motions to compel responses to interrogatories, and to deem admissions admitted, are granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b); 2033.280.) There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to compel initial responses or deem admissions admitted can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought any time after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.) Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling Defendant to serve verified responses to the interrogatories without objections. The Court also deems the requests for admission admitted against Defendant.Defendant’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for these straightforward and unopposed motions. Sanctions are awarded against Defendant in the amount of $530.00 based on two hours of attorney time billed at $225.00 per hour, plus $40.00 in filing fees per motion. (Motions, Tapper Decl., ¶4.)ConclusionPlaintiff Aspire General Insurance Company’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and Request for Sanctions, are GRANTED. DEFENDANT MICHICO MARIE ALEXANDER IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE INTERROGATORIES WITHIN 20 DAYS’ NOTICE OF THIS ORDER.

THE ORDER TO PAY SANCTIONS IS STAYED, PENDING COMPLIANCE WITH THE ORDER TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE INTERROGATORIES WITHIN 20 DAYS' NOTICE OF THIS ORDER.Moving party to give notice.
