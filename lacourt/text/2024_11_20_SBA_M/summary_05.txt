And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Rosemary Rivera's motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Identification and Production of Documents, Set One, and requests for sanctions. The judge also denied Rivera's motion to deem the truth of matters specified in Requests for Admissions, Set One, admitted and request for sanctions. The judge found that the discovery requests were served before defendants were properly served with the summons and complaint, and that the proof of service submitted by Rivera did not accurately reflect the method of service. As a result, the judge concluded that there were no discovery responses that could be compelled.
