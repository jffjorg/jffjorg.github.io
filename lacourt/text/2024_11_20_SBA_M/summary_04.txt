And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted Rose Marie Krawczyk's petition for approval of a compromise of her claim for a person with a disability. The judge has also granted Krawczyk's motion to file the guardian ad litem compromise approval forms under seal. The compromise was reached due to the negligent and willful conduct of the defendants, which caused Krawczyk to suffer multiple falls and serious injuries at the defendants' facilities. The judge found that Krawczyk made a competent showing to support a finding that the overriding interest in sealing the documents outweighs the public's right of access. The judge also found that the proposed sealing order is narrowly tailored and that there are no less restrictive means to achieve the identified overriding interest.
