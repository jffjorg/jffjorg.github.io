Here is the summary in English text:

The judge, Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Yolanda Williams v. Mercedes-Benz of South Bay, et al. The case involves a vehicle crash after service at Mercedes-Benz of South Bay, and Plaintiff Yolanda Williams seeks further responses to a request for production of documents, including confidential personnel files of Andy Chan, the technician who serviced her vehicle.

The judge grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses, in part, and denies it, in part. The judge finds that Plaintiff has adequately demonstrated that the need for the discovery outweighs the privacy interest of Mr. Chan, and orders Defendant to serve a verified further response within 10 days. The judge also denies Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions.

The judge notes that the parties stipulated to a protective order to address privacy interests, and that the complaint does not include a cause of action for Negligent Hiring, Training, and Supervision, to which the documents sought may be more pertinent. The judge also cautions Defendant that withholding discovery and making false and perjurious statements to the court and parties could result in serious consequences and ramifications.
