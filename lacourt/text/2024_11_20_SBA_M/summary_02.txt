And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Gary Y. Tanaka, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment brought by Torrance Memorial Medical Center against Merlita Q. Licaros. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that the defendant has failed to establish its right to obtain summary judgment based on its argument that the plaintiff lacks legal capacity to sue.

The motion was based on an alleged defective notice of intent to sue letter, which referenced a different patient, Charles Sandoval. However, the Judge found that the letter could also encompass a potential loss of consortium claim brought by the named plaintiff, Merlita Q. Licaros.

The Judge noted that loss of consortium is a separate and distinct cause of action, not a derivative cause of action. The Judge also found that the plaintiff's complaint, although titled "General Negligence", could encompass the elements of a cause of action for loss of consortium.

The Judge ruled that the defendant has failed to meet its burden of showing that there are no triable issues of material fact, and that the plaintiff has presented evidence that raises a triable issue of fact. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.
