And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to set aside the default and default judgment filed by A&Z Solutions, Inc., et al. without prejudice. The motion was filed in response to the entry of default and default judgment against them in the lawsuit brought by Del Amo Fashion Center Operating Company, LLC. The defendants claimed that they had not had notice in time to defend the action, that the service of summons and complaint was void on its face, and that the default and default judgment were caused by attorney mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. However, the court found that the evidence submitted by the defendants did not establish entitlement to relief under CCP § 473(b), 473.5, or the court's equitable power. The court also found that the defendants failed to provide facts to demonstrate their entitlement to relief under the mandatory provision of CCP § 473(b) or the discretionary provision of CCP § 473(b).
