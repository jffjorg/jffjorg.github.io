Background
 
Plaintiff’s’ Complaint was filed on June 12, 2024. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff purchased a defective foot stool from
Defendants that collapsed in use resulting in personal injuries.  
 
Motions to
Compel/Deem Admitted
 
CCP § 2030.290 states: “If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following
rules apply…The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories.” (CCP § 2030.290(b).)  
 
CCP § 2031.300 states: “If a party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to it, the following rules shall apply: The party making the
demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.”  (CCP § 2031.300(b)).
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 states:
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:
(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.
(2) The party's failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010).
(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020(b) states: “A plaintiff
may propound interrogatories to a party without leave of court at any time that
is 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, that party,
whichever occurs first.”
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020(b) states: “A plaintiff
may make a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling without leave
of court at any time that is 10 days after the service of the summons on, or
appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs
first.” 
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.020(b) states: “A plaintiff
may make requests for admission by a party without leave of court at any time
that is 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, that
party, whichever occurs first”
 
Plaintiff argues that she served upon Defendant Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and
Requests for Admissions, Set One, on July 3, 2024. (Decls., Leslie Keith
Kaufman, ¶¶ 4-16.)  Plaintiff contends
that no responses were served to the discovery requests. (Id.) 
 
The Court finds that the discovery items in question
here have not been properly served, and, therefore, there are no discovery
responses that can be compelled. Here, as noted above, Plaintiff states that
the discovery requests were served on July 3, 2024. However, the discovery
requests were served prior to Defendant being properly served with the summons
and complaint in contravention of Sections 2030.020(b), 2031.020(b), and
2033.020(b). 
 
Plaintiff’s proof of service of the summons and
complaint, filed with the Court on August 8, 2024, purports to state that
Defendant was served “by other means (specify means of service and authorizing
code section): by first-class mail, certified, postage prepaid, on June 12,
2024, from Santa Ana, CA; to the president, chief executive officer, or other
head of the Defendant corporation[ ... ] Code Civ. Proc.§ 416.10(b).” (Proof of
Service, 5d.) However, proof of service by mail does not become effective unless
there is an acknowledgment of receipt of service pursuant to CCP § 415.40. The
proof of service submitted by Plaintiff specifically notes that service was not
accomplished by this method as paragraph 5c was not checked. This is contrary
to the arguments made by Plaintiff with the motion and reply contending that
service of the summons and complaint was made pursuant to CCP § 415.40. Thus,
without the summons and complaint being properly served, any subsequent service
of discovery requests was premature. 
 
In addition, while the discovery requests themselves
were purportedly served pursuant to CCP § 415.40, there are no facts to
indicate that the signature of the individual who signed the return receipt
was, in fact, the President/CEO of HomeGoods, Inc. – the individual to whom the
discovery requests were purportedly served.
 
Therefore, the motions to compel responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Identification and Production of
Documents, Set One, and motion to deem Requests for Admissions, Set One, are
denied. Plaintiff’s requests for
monetary sanctions are also denied. 
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
