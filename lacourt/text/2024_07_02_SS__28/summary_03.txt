```

And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff Azariyah Burdette's action filed by Petitioner Raymond Ghermezian. The petition lacks essential information about Plaintiff's injuries, treatment, and medical expenses, and does not provide medical or billing records. Additionally, Ghermezian has failed to clarify his involvement in the accident and his relationship to Plaintiff. The Court cannot grant the petition without sufficient evidence that all of Plaintiff's medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. The petition is denied, and Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service with the Court within five days.
