 Case Number:  21STCV21467    Hearing Date:   July 2, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On June
9, 2021, Plaintiffs Mariah Ramirez, Alfredo Nicolas Ramirez, and Ocean Diaz
filed this action against Defendants Jose
William Juarez Ramos, Edgar Perez Diaz, Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber”), and
Does 1-10 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
June 29, 2021, the Court appointed Mariah Ramirez to
serve as guardian ad litem for Plaintiffs Alfredo Nicolas Ramirez and Ocean Diaz. 
On
July 15, 2022, Uber filed an answer. 
On
March 14, 2023, the Court dismissed Plaintiff Mariah Ramirez with prejudice at
Plaintiffs’ request. 
On
August 15, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On
August 16, 2023, the Court dismissed Plaintiff Ocean Diaz with prejudice at
Plaintiffs’ request. 
On
June 7, 2024, Petitioner Mariah Ramirez (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for expedited
approval of a minor’s compromise, to be heard on July 2, 2024. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Mariah Ramirez asks the Court to approve the
compromise of minor Plaintiff Alfredo
Nicolas Ramirez’s action. 
DISCUSSION 
          The petition contains the following information: 
          Gross settlement amount:                    $15,000.00
          Total medical expenses:                       $4,252.00
          Reductions:                                          $561.77
          To be paid/reimbursed:                        $3,500.00
          Attorney’s fees requested:                   $3,750.00
Non-medical
expenses:                                  $312.26
Net
balance:                                                   $7,057.40
 In Section
12b of the petition, Petitioner states that one or more of the Defendants have
offered to pay money to a person other than Plaintiff Alfredo Nicolas Ramirez
to settle claims arising out of the same incident that resulted in Plaintiff
Alfredo Nicolas Ramirez’s injury.  In
Section 12b(2), Petitioner states that she will receive money under the
settlement.  Petitioner should explain (1) how
much money Petitioner will receive, (2) if anyone other than Petitioner and
Plaintiff Alfredo Nicolas Ramirez will receive money, and (3) if so, how much. 
Section
13a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $4,252.00.  Section 13a(3) of the petition states that
this amount was reduced by $561.77 as the result of negotiated, contractual,
and statutory reductions.  This should
mean that $3,690.23 (the difference between the total medical expenses and the
amount of reductions) will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds.  However,
Section 13a(4) of the petition states that only $3,500.00 of the medical
expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  As a result, $190.23 of the medical expenses
are unaccounted for.  The Court cannot
grant a petition to approve a minor’s compromise unless it shows that all
medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed
from the settlement proceeds. 
In
addition, although Section 13a(4) of the petition states that $3,500.00 of the
medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds,
Section 17b of the petition states that $3,880.34 of the medical expenses will
be paid from the settlement proceeds. 
Petitioner should revise the petition to address this discrepancy. 
The
Court denies the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff Alfredo
Nicolas Ramirez’s action filed by Petitioner Mariah Ramirez on June 7, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
