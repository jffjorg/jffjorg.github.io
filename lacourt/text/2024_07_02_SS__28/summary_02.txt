And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff Alfredo Nicolas Ramirez's action filed by Petitioner Mariah Ramirez on June 7, 2024. The petition sought to approve a settlement of $15,000.00, with $4,252.00 in total medical expenses, reduced by $561.77, with $3,500.00 to be paid or reimbursed. However, the Court found a discrepancy in the petition, with Section 13a(4) stating that $3,500.00 of the medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed, while Section 17b states that $3,880.34 of the medical expenses will be paid. The Court also noted that $190.23 of the medical expenses are unaccounted for. As a result, the Court cannot grant the petition until the discrepancy is addressed.
