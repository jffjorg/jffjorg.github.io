purposes. 
On
July 27, 2022, the Court consolidated the cases for all purposes including

20STCV15807 remained the lead case. 
D.   Notice of settlement and petition for expedited approval
of minor’s compromise 
On
February 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On
May 13, 2024, Petitioner Eddy Rodriguez filed a third amended petition for
expedited approval of a minor’s compromise. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of minor Plaintiff
Mark-Anthony Rodriguez. 
DISCUSSION 
The
petition contains the following information about the proposed settlement: 
Gross
settlement amount:                              $5,000.00
Total
medical expenses:                                 $21,170.53
Reductions:                                                    $20,787.53
Payment/reimbursement
from proceeds:        $255.20 (Medi-Cal
lien)
Attorney’s
fees:                                             $0
Non-medical
costs:                                        $0
Net
balance:                                                   $4,744.80
 Section
13a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $21,170.53.  Section 13a(3) of the petition states that
this amount was reduced by $20,787.53 as the result of negotiated, contractual,
and statutory reductions.  This should
mean that $383.00 (the difference between the total medical expenses and the
amount of reductions) will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds.  However, Section 13a(4) of the
petition states that only $255.20 of the medical expenses will be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds (to satisfy the Medi-Cal lien).  As a result, $127.80 of the medical expenses
are unaccounted for.  The Court cannot
grant a petition to approve a minor’s compromise unless it shows that all
medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the third amended petition for expedited
approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Mark-Anthony Rodriguez’s action
filed by Petitioner Eddy Rodriguez Amira Youssef on May 13, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
