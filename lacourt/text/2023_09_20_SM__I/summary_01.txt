English text:
This is a summary of a tentative ruling by a judge regarding an ex parte application to enforce a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement consists of two parts: one from October 2022 setting the amount of the settlement and other terms, and another from May 2023 providing that certain art will be auctioned off to satisfy the debt. The defendant has been given time to sell the art privately, but the plaintiff believes that the private sale will not materialize and wants the art to be auctioned. The auction must occur no later than November 3, 2023. The court will hear from the defense, but the settlement agreement seems clear and direct. The defendant is required to cooperate with the auction house to effectuate the auction. The plaintiff has made out a prima facie case for enforcement, and the court will hear from the defense as to why the court should not order the defendant to comply with the agreement. Only enough art needs to be auctioned to satisfy the debt, which is the amount set forth in the original settlement agreement plus accrued interest. The plaintiff is to provide a payoff quote assuming the sale occurs on November 3, 2023. If the sale is earlier, the plaintiff will refund any unearned interest. If the defendant opposes the ex parte, the court will continue the matter for a short time to allow the defense to submit a written opposition.
