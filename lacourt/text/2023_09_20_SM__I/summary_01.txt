And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on an ex parte application to enforce a settlement agreement. The agreement is in two parts, with the first part setting forth the amount of the settlement and certain other terms, and the second part providing for the auction of art to satisfy the debt. The defendant has the option to sell the art privately, but the plaintiff believes that this will not materialize and is seeking to enforce the agreement to auction the art. The court finds that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case for enforcement and will hear from the defense as to why enforcement should not be ordered. The agreement meets the requirements of CCP section 664.6 and the court will consider the plaintiff's request to enforce the agreement.
