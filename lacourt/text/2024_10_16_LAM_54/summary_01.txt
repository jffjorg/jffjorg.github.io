And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On October 16, 2024, Judge Maurice A. Leiter will hear two motions in the case of Zia Abhari and Donya Entertainment, Inc. v. Farmers Insurance Exchange and Truck Insurance Exchange. The first motion is to compel production of documents, which the judge has denied. The judge finds that the plaintiffs failed to provide statutory authority for the motion and did not show good cause for discovery.

The second motion is for summary adjudication, which the judge has also denied. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have not met their burden to show that there is no defense to their cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty. The judge also finds that the defendants have raised triable issues of fact as to the breach of fiduciary duty, including whether the defendants had a duty to inspect the premises before issuing a policy and whether the plaintiffs suffered damages as a result of the breach.
