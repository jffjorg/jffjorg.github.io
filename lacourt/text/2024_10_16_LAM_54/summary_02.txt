And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the defendants' motion to stay the litigation pending appeal. The defendants, Dignity Health dba St. Mary Medical Center, Carolyn Caldwell, Charles Anderson, and Christopher Pook, had moved to stay the litigation of Dr. Nayyer Ali's claims based on the alleged termination/non-renewal of his Residency Agreement, pending the resolution of their appeal of the Court's order denying their motion to arbitrate those claims. The Judge found that Code of Civil Procedure ยง 1294(a) did not require a stay, and that delaying discovery would prejudice the plaintiffs. The Judge also noted that the defendants had not shown that the agreement at issue was governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), and that the principle in Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co. does not apply in California state court. As a result, the Court denied the motion to stay the litigation.
