Hearing Date: October 16, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice Leiter
Motion to Continue Trial
Moving Party: Defendant County of Los Angeles
Responding Party: Plaintiff Romelia Valenzuela
 
T/R:     DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS
GRANTED. THE TRIAL IS CONTINUED TO APRIL 14, 2025 AT 9:30. THE FINAL STATUS
CONFERENCE IS CONTINUED TO APRIL 4, 2025 AT 9:30. PRETRIAL DEADLINES ARE
EXTENDED TO BE BASED ON THESE NEW DATES.
 
DEFENDANT TO
NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative,
please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
While trial continuances are generally
disfavored, pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1332(c), circumstances that indicate good
cause for a continuance include “[a] party's excused inability to obtain essential
testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(c)(6).) Factors the Court may consider include,
“[t]he proximity of the trial date,” “[w]hether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party,” and
“[t]he length of the continuance requested.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(d).)
 
Defendant moves to continue trial from
December 2024 to June 2025. Defendant asserts that a key witness, Defendant’s
employee Nancy Castaneda, was on leave from May 2024 to September 2024,
preventing Defendant from obtaining her testimony until September 2024.
Defendants request a trial continuance so they may file a motion for summary
judgment incorporating Ms. Castaneda’s testimony. In opposition, Plaintiff
asserts that Defendants could have deposed Ms. Castaneda before going on leave
and could have reserved a summary judgment date but again failed to do so.
Plaintiff represents that she will be prejudiced by a trial continuance.
 
The Court will grant a brief
continuance of the trial. There have been no prior continuances, and the Court
will allow Defendant sufficient time to pursue a summary judgment motion
including this testimony.
 
Defendant’s motion to continue trial is
GRANTED.
