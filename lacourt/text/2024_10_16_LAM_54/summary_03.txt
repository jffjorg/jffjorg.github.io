And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to grant the Defendant's Motion to Continue Trial, moving the trial date from December 2024 to April 14, 2025. The Defendant, the County of Los Angeles, had requested the continuance to allow for a summary judgment motion, citing that a key witness, Nancy Castaneda, was on leave from May 2024 to September 2024 and they need time to incorporate her testimony into the motion. The Plaintiff, Romelia Valenzuela, opposes the continuance, arguing that the Defendant could have deposed Castaneda before she went on leave and could have reserved a summary judgment date. The Judge finds that, despite being generally disfavored, a brief continuance is warranted in this case, given the circumstances.
