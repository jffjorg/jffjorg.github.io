BACKGROUND
                
On August 1, 2022, Plaintiffs Zia
Abhari and Donya Entertainment, Inc. filed a complaint against Defendants
Farmers Insurance Exchange and Truck Insurance Exchange, asserting causes of
action for breach of fiduciary duty. Plaintiffs allege Defendants breached
their fiduciary duties to Plaintiffs by failing to inspect the premises of the
business Plaintiff purchased. Plaintiffs allege that had Defendants properly
inspected the premises, they would have seen contaminated water intrusion
defects that later led to the closing of the business. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiffs
move to compel production of the underwriting file for the subject property for
the last ten years. Plaintiffs do not provide statutory authority for this
motion nor provide facts showing good cause for discovery. In opposition,
Defendants assert that the files are confidential under Insurance Code § 791.13
and are irrelevant. Plaintiffs do not address Insurance Code § 791.13. Additionally,
Plaintiffs request sanctions but do not provide authority or the amount
requested in the notice or memorandum.
The
motion is DENIED.

BACKGROUND
                
On August 1, 2022, Plaintiffs Zia
Abhari and Donya Entertainment, Inc. filed a complaint against Defendants
Farmers Insurance Exchange and Truck Insurance Exchange, asserting causes of
action for breach of fiduciary duty. Plaintiffs allege Defendants breached
their fiduciary duties to Plaintiffs by failing to inspect the premises of the
business Plaintiff purchased. Plaintiffs allege that had Defendants properly
inspected the premises, they would have seen contaminated water intrusion

ANALYSIS
 
“In moving for summary judgment, a
‘plaintiff . . . has met’ his ‘burden of showing that there is no defense to a
cause of action if’ he ‘has proved each element of the cause of action
entitling’ him ‘to judgment on that cause of action.’”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)
25 Cal.4th 826, 849 (as modified (July 11, 2001).)  The plaintiff “must present evidence that
would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any
underlying material fact more likely than not—otherwise, he would not be
entitled to judgment as a matter of law, but would have to
present his evidence to a trier of fact.” 
(Id., at 851, original italics.)
 
Once the plaintiff has met that burden,
the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense
thereto.  (CCP § 437c(p)(1).)  “There is a triable issue of material fact
if, and only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find
the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance
with the applicable standard of proof.” 
(Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at 850.)  The defendant “shall not rely upon
the allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue
of material fact exists but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts
showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause
of action or a defense thereto.”  (CCP §
437c(p)(1).)
 
Plaintiffs move for summary
adjudication of the first cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty. 
 
The elements for a breach of fiduciary
duty cause of action are “the existence of a fiduciary relationship, its
breach, and damage proximately caused by that breach.” (Thomson v. Canyon
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 594, 604.) Plaintiffs assert that Defendants breached
their fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs by failing to inspect the premises before
issuing a policy, which would have revealed a water contamination defect. 
 
In opposition, Defendants assert they
were under no duty to inspect the premises because the policy does not require
inspection. It allows Defendants to inspect the premises, but does not obligate
it. Defendants also assert that it did not owe Plaintiffs a fiduciary duty
before the execution of the policy. And Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have
failed to meet their burden to show damages by failing to present any evidence
of damages. This is sufficient to establish triable issues of fact as to breach
of fiduciary duty.
 
Plaintiff’s motion for summary
adjudication is DENIED.
