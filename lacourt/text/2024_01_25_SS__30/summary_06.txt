And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has reviewed the Expedited Petition to Approve Minor's Compromise filed by Griffin Devine, a 17-year-old minor. The Judge declines to approve the petition as requested due to defects in the retainer agreement. The agreement has been redacted significantly, making it impossible for the Court to determine whether the fees were agreed to by the Plaintiff. The Judge schedules a hearing in 60 days to permit counsel to correct these defects and orders the counsel to file a new petition with the retainer agreement included. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
