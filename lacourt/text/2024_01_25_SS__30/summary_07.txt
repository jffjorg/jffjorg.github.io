And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Ean Holdings LLC. The court has overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff's complaint states a cause of action. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff had not sufficiently pleaded the elements of negligence, but the court found that the plaintiff had pled ownership liability against the defendant, which is sufficient to state a cause of action. Additionally, the court found that the defendant's argument that the Graves Amendment applies to the case was premature and cannot be determined at the pleading stage. The court has also taken judicial notice of the filings with the California Secretary of State, but has not taken notice of the truth of the matters asserted within those filings. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling.
