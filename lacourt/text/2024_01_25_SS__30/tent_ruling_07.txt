 Case Number:  23STCV16195    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  30 EDGAR RAMON SANDOVAL GARCIA vs STEPHEN TROVON DEVONTA SMITH, et al.TENTATIVEDefendant Ean Holdings LLC’s Demurrer is OVERRULED. Plaintiff to give notice.Judicial NoticeDefendant requests judicial notice of the Statements of Information for Ean Holdings and Enterprise Rent-A-Car filed with the California Secretary of State. The Court takes judicial notice of the filings of these documents as the filing is an official act of California. (See Evid. Code § 452, subd. (c).) However, the Court does not take judicial notice of the truth of the matters asserted within this document. (See C.R. Tenet Healthcare Corp. (2009) 169 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1103.)Legal StandardA demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525).) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.) The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)Meet and ConferThe demurrer is accompanied by the declaration of Adam Miller, which satisfies the meet and confer requirements. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a).)DiscussionDefendant argues that the demurrer should be sustained because Plaintiff has not stated sufficient facts against it because the complaint contains conclusory statements.The elements for negligence are: (1) a legal duty owed to the plaintiff to use due care; (2) breach of duty; (3) causation; and (4) damage to the plaintiff. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318.)Here, Plaintiff has pled ownership liability against Defendant. Under California law, every owner of a motor vehicle is liable and responsible for injuries caused by an individual operating the vehicle with the owner’s permission. (See Cal. Vehicle Code, § 17150; Marquez v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 319, 322; Rashtian v. BRAC-BH, Inc. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1847, 1852.) As Plaintiff has pled ownership, the demurrer cannot be sustained for failure to plead sufficient facts. (See Sheehan v. San Francisco 49ers, Ltd. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 992, 998 (stating that the sustaining of a demurrer may only be upheld if the complaint fails to state a cause of action under any possible legal theory).) While Defendant takes issue with the negligent entrustment claims and the allegations relating to agency and employment asserted within the causes of action for negligence and motor vehicle negligence, a demurrer does not lie to only part of a cause of action. If there are sufficient allegations to entitle plaintiff to relief, other allegations cannot be challenged by general demurrer. (Daniels v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1167.) Thus, the Court cannot entertain this demurrer to only a portion of Plaintiff’s causes of action.The demurrer is overruled on this ground.Graves AmendmentDefendant also contends it cannot be held liable based on vicarious liability under 49 U.S.C. section 30106(a). 49 U.S.C. section 30106(a) (“Graves Amendment”) states:(a) In general.-- An owner of a motor vehicle that rents or leases the vehicle to a person (or an affiliate of the owner) shall not be liable under the law of any State or political subdivision thereof, by reason of being the owner of the vehicle (or an affiliate of the owner), for harm to persons or property that results or arises out of the use, operation, or possession of the vehicle during the period of the rental or lease, if—(1) the owner (or an affiliate of the owner) is engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles; and(2) there is no negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the owner (or an affiliate of the owner).(42 U.S.C. § 30106.)There are no allegations in the FAC that Defendant is engaged in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles. While Defendant argues that the complaint expressly alleges that the vehicle was rented to Defendants, it does not state that Defendant Ean Holdings is engaged in the business of renting vehicles. Further, the Court has declined to take judicial notice of the truth of the matters asserted within the Secretary of State Statement of Information for Ean and Enterprise. The Court therefore cannot determine that the Graves Amendment applies to Defendant at the pleading stage. Further, a finding that Defendant was not independently negligent requires factual conclusions that are inappropriate on a demurrer. Defendant may instead opt to file a motion for summary judgment at a later point in the proceedings and present evidence as to this point.As such, the demurrer is overruled.
