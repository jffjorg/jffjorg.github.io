And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Jorge Luis Rico dba JLR Trucking's motion to compel Plaintiff Michael Fisher to produce documents. The documents are related to Plaintiff's medical/bodily injury claims and property damage claims. The Court finds that Defendant's Separate Statement sets forth facts showing good cause justifying the demand for the documents. The Plaintiff is ordered to produce the documents without objections within 20 days of this order. Additionally, the Plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $630 to Defendant within 30 days. The Court awards reduced sanctions because the amount requested by Defendant was unreasonable.
