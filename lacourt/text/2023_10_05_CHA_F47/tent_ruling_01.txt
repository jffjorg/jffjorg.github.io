  Case Number:  22CHCV00474    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  F47 Dept. F47 Date: 10/5/23 Case #22CHCV00474   MOTION TO  COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES (Special  Interrogatories, Set 1)   Motion filed on 6/12/23.   MOVING PARTY: Defendants Prestige Default Services, LLC  and Center Street Lending VIII SPE,  LLC RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Sam Ostayan NOTICE: ok   RELIEF REQUESTED: An order  compelling Plaintiff Sam Ostayan to provide further responses to Special  Interrogatories, Set 1, Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, and 16.   Additionally, Defendants seek sanctions.    RULING: The request to compel further responses is  granted.  Further responses are due  within 30 days.  Sanctions are  denied.     SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY   This action arises out of Plaintiff Sam Ostayan’s  (Plaintiff) claim that Defendant Prestige Default Services, LLC (Prestige), as  trustee of the nonjudicial foreclosure sale of real property located at 10711  Sunnybrae Avenue, Chatsworth,  California  91311 (the Property), failed to comply with Civil Code 2924m when conducting  the foreclosure sale of the Property.    Civil Code 2924m was enacted to give families, renters  and housing nonprofits an opportunity to purchase foreclosed properties after  the trustee’s sale by enlarging the timeline for the recordation of the  trustee’s deed depending on who the bidder is.   The version of Civil Code 2924m operative at the relevant  time period (1/1/21 – 12/31/21) defined an eligible tenant bidder as a natural  person, who at the time of the trustee’s sale:        “(A) Is occupying the real property as  their primary residence.  (B) Is occupying the real property  under a rental or lease agreement    entered  into as the result of an arm's length transaction with the mortgagor or trustor  on a date prior to the recording of the Notice of Default against the property.   (C) Is not the mortgagor or  trustor, or the child, spouse, or parent of the mortgagor or trustor.”     Civil Code 2924m(a)(2).     The  statute  further provided that a nonjudicial foreclosure sale of a residential property  (one to four units) would not be deemed final until the earliest of the  following:    “(1) If a prospective  owner-occupant is the last and highest bidder at the trustee's sale, the date  upon which the conditions set forth in Section 2924h of the Civil Code for the  sale to become final are met. The trustee shall require the prospective owner-occupant  to submit the affidavit described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a). The  trustee may reasonably rely upon this affidavit.  (2) Fifteen days after the  trustee's sale unless at least one eligible tenant buyer or eligible bidder  submits to the trustee either a bid pursuant to paragraph (3) or (4) or a  nonbinding written notice of intent to place such a bid. The bid or written notice  of intent to place a bid shall be sent to the trustee by certified mail,  overnight delivery, or other method that allows for confirmation of the  delivery date and shall be received by the trustee no later than 15 days after  the trustee's sale.  (3) The date upon which a  representative of all of the eligible tenant buyers submits to the trustee a  bid in an amount equal to the full amount of the last and highest bid at the  trustee's sale… This bid shall be accompanied by an affidavit stating that the  persons represented meet the criteria set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision  (a). The trustee may reasonably rely on this affidavit.  (4) Forty-five days after the  trustee's sale, except that during the 45-day period, an eligible bidder may  submit to the trustee a bid in an amount that exceeds the last and highest bid  at the trustee's sale… The bid shall be accompanied by an affidavit identifying  the category set forth in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) to which the  eligible bidder belongs and stating that the eligible bidder meets the criteria  for that category. The trustee may reasonably rely on this affidavit.”    Civil Code 2924m(c)(1)-(4).   If the winning bidder at the foreclosure sale was a  “prospective owner occupant” and completed all of the requirements, the sale  was deemed final on the date of the sale, and was deemed perfected as of that  date as long as the trustee’s deed was recorded within 18 calendar days.  Civil Code 2924m(c)(1).  If not, the foreclosure trustee must, within  48 hours of the trustee’s sale, post the following information on the internet:     “(a) The date on which the  trustee's sale took place. (Civil Code 2924m(d)(1)(A)).  (b) The amount of the last and  highest bid at the trustee's sale. (Civil Code 2924m(d)(1)(B)). (c) An address at which the trustee  may receive documents by mail and a method of overnight delivery.”    Civil Code 2924m(d)(1)(C).   Thereafter, an eligible tenant bidder or eligible bidder  may submit to the trustee a nonbinding written notice of intent to bid within  15 days after the sale.  An eligible  tenant bidder or eligible bidder will have additional time (no later than 45  days after the sale) to submit a bid and a code-compliant affidavit.  If an eligible tenant bidder submits a bid and  a compliant affidavit, then the eligible tenant bidder will be deemed the last  and highest bidder notwithstanding bids from other classes of eligible bidders.   Civil Code 2924m(c)(3).  If an eligible bidder submits a bid and a  compliant affidavit 45 days after the trustee’s sale, the eligible bidder that  submitted the highest bid will be deemed the last and highest bidder.  Civil Code 2924m(c)(4).   Here, the foreclosure sale occurred on 6/29/21.  At the sale, the Property was sold to U.S.  Bank Trust National Association, as Trustee for ABS Trust VI Select Portfolio  Servicing, Inc., who is not an owner occupant, for $401,000.00.  (FAC ¶¶10-11).  Because U.S. Bank is not an “eligible bidder”  under Civil Code 2924m, Prestige published the bid amount and started to accept  post-sale Notices of Intent to Bid pursuant to Civil Code 2924m.   On 7/12/21, Plaintiff sent a written letter indicating  his intent to bid on the Property as his personal residence.  (FAC ¶12).   Prestige informed Plaintiff that he must submit a bid by 8/13/21, which  is the statutory cut-off date (45th day) following the sale.  Id.   On 8/13/21, Plaintiff delivered a sealed post-sale bid for $555,500.  (FAC ¶13).   That same day, Defendant Soldiers of America (SOA) also delivered a  post-sale bid.  Id.  Prestige also received a post-sale bid in the  amount of $401,000 from a purported “Eligible Tenant.”  (FAC ¶14).   On 8/13/21, Prestige rejected and refunded both Plaintiff’s and SOA’s  respective bids advising Plaintiff and SOA that it was accepting a bid for  $401,000 from an “Eligible Tenant,” which bid held higher priority over  Plaintiff’s and SOA’s bids.  Id.       On 8/16/21, Prestige returned the deposited funds to the  purportedly “Eligible Tenant” upon determining that the bid was submitted by a  corporation on behalf of a bidder that was deceased at the time of the foreclosure  sale and who was, therefore, ineligible to bid under Civil Code section 2924m.  (FAC ¶15).   Prestige never issued a trustee’s deed upon sale to any  Eligible Tenant.  (FAC ¶16).  Instead, on 8/23/21, Prestige issued a Trustee’s  Deed Upon Sale (TDUS) to SOA based on a new bid submitted outside the 45-day  deadline.  Id.   The  TDUS stated that SOA had the highest bid in the amount of $556,000 (just $500  over Plaintiff’s bid of $555,500).  Id.   Thereafter, Plaintiff  learned that SOA’s original sealed but  rejected bid submitted to Prestige on 8/13/21, was for $700,000, and not for  $556,000, the amount for which SOA purportedly purchased the Property at a  later date outside the 45-day window through a new bid.  (FAC ¶17).  SOA’s original bid and its proffered payment  is evidenced by three cashier’s checks that it submitted to Prestige with its  bid in the amounts of $500,000, $125,000, and $75,000, which bid was rejected  and refunded to SOA on that same date, along with Plaintiff’s bid.  Id.      After rejecting Plaintiff’s and SOA’s bids, Plaintiff  alleges that Prestige informed SOA of the amount of Plaintiff’s bid, and Prestige  allowed only SOA to submit a new bid of $556,000.00.  (FAC ¶17).   Prestige did not offer Plaintiff the same opportunity to submit a new  bid.  (FAC ¶18).   Plaintiff contends that Prestige’s acts were unlawful,  and that SOA’s new bid was not permitted as it was done outside of the 45-day  statutory deadline provided in Civil Code 2924m(c)(4), making the sale void.  (FAC ¶18).   Plaintiff alleges that SOA then sold the Property to Defendant SoCal Innovative  Group, LLC (SoCal) for approximately $1,010,000.00, thereby realizing a  substantial profit from its alleged improper purchase of the Property.  (FAC ¶19).   Plaintiff further alleges that on or about 6/13/22, Defendant Center  Street Lending VIII SPE, LLC (Center Street) executed a deed of trust in the  amount of $1,152,450.00 secured by the Property.  (FAC ¶29).   Plaintiff claims that SoCal was not a bona fide purchaser of the  Property because the TDUS in favor of SOA was void, as is the legal title of  SoCal, a defaulted entity.  (FAC ¶21).   Therefore,  Plaintiff claims that Center Street has no valid lien secured by the Property.   On 6/28/22, Plaintiff filed this action against Prestige,  Center Street, SOA, and SoCal.  On 7/27/22,  Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging causes of action  for: (1) Declaratory Relief (against all defendants); (2) Violation of Civil  Code 2924m (against Prestige and SOA); (3) Bid Rigging (against Prestige and  SOA) and (4) Quiet Title (against SOA, SoCal and Center Street).     By way of the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff seeks a  judicial declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties concerning  the rights, title to, and ownership of the Subject Property. (FAC ¶23).  Plaintiff further requests a judicial  declaration that neither SoCal nor Center Street have any right, title, lien,  or ownership to the Property because the TDUS under which SOA purportedly  obtained title was null and void, in addition to the grant deed to SoCal, and  therefore, SoCal has no valid interest in the Property, nor does its lender,  Center Street have any secured lien.   (FAC ¶24).  Plaintiff also seeks a  judicial declaration that his bid was the last and highest legitimate bid and  that he is the owner of the Property for a purchase price of $555,500, which he  offers to immediately tender to Prestige.   (FAC ¶25).   Finally, Plaintiff  alleges that Prestige violated the procedures in Civil Code 2924m and  participated in a bid rigging scheme by manipulating and artificially  determining the post-sale bidding process and by accepting an untimely new bid  from SOA, among other things.  (FAC ¶¶30,  35).   On 2/24/23, Prestige and Center Street’s demurrer to the  First Amended Complaint was overruled.   On 3/24/23, Prestige filed an answer to the First Amended Complaint.  On 3/27/23, Center Street filed an answer to  the First Amended Complaint.     On 3/10/23, Prestige and Center Street (collectively,  Defendants) served Plaintiff with Special Interrogatories, Set 1.  (Davieau Decl., Ex.A).  After being granted an extension, Plaintiff  served responses on 4/26/23.  (Id.,  Ex.B-C).  Defendants found certain of the  responses to be deficient.  (Davieau  Decl.).  Meet and confer efforts between  the parties failed to resolve the discovery issues.  (Davieau Decl., Ex.D-E).  Therefore, on 6/12/23, Defendants filed and  served the instant motion seeking an order compelling Plaintiff to provide  further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set 1, Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10,  14, 15, and 16.  Additionally, Defendants  seek sanctions.  On 9/21/23, Plaintiff  filed an opposition to the motion wherein he seeks sanctions against  Defendants.  On 9/28/23, Defendants filed  a reply to the opposition.     On 9/28/23, Plaintiff dismissed his 1st and 4th  causes of action.     ANALYSIS   Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice is granted.    Upon receipt of a response to interrogatories, the  propounding party may move to compel further responses if the propounding party  deems that an objection is without merit or too general.  CCP 2030.300(a)(3).  The responding party has the burden of  justifying its objections and responses.   See Fairmont Insurance Co. (2000) 22 C4th 245, 255.   The subject interrogatories seek information relating to  Plaintiff’s history of submitting bids to purchase property in foreclosure as a  prospective owner-occupant and subsequent sales of such properties and facts  related to Plaintiff’s primary residence.      Plaintiff responded only with objections to Special  Interrogatories 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15 and 16.   Special Interrogatory 3 asks Plaintiff what his primary residence  is/was from January 2021 to the present.    Special Interrogatories 4, 5, 6 and 7 ask Plaintiff why he submitted a  Prospective Owner Occupant (POO) Affidavit for the Trustee’s Sales of several  different properties.  Special  Interrogatory 14 asks Plaintiff why he sold a certain property less than a year  after taking title.  Special  Interrogatories 15 and 16 ask Plaintiff whether he lives(ed) at two different  addresses from January 2022 to present.     Plaintiff objected to these interrogatories on the ground  that they violate CCP 2030.060(d) because the definitions for certain terms are  included in a prefatory statement rather than in each interrogatory.  The Court finds this objection places form  over substance and overrules it.  Plaintiff  also objects to these interrogatories on relevance grounds.  Plaintiff contends that any POO Affidavits he  submitted for property and any alleged sales of property consummated after the  sale of the Property which is the subject of this action are not relevant to  any claims or defenses in this action and are not likely to lead to the  discovery of admissible evidence.     The Court disagrees.   In discovery, the concept of relevance is broader than evidence that is  admissible at trial with any doubts regarding relevance generally being  resolved in favor of allowing discovery.   Mercury Interactive Corp. (2007) 158 CA4th 60, 98; See also Gonzalez (1995) 33 CA4th 1539, 1546 (in discovery, information is  relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case,  preparing for trial or facilitating settlement).     The information sought may assist in establishing whether  or not Plaintiff complied with Civil Code 2924m entitling him to seek damages  for Defendants’ claimed violation.   Plaintiff has not established that the information is not discoverable  merely because it concerns conduct that occurred after the sale of the Property  at issue in this action.   Special Interrogatory 9 asks Plaintiff to identify all of  the documents that support his response to Special Interrogatory 1 and Special  Interrogatory 10 asks Plaintiff to identify all of the documents that support  his response to Special Interrogatory 3.   Special Interrogatory 1 asks Plaintiff what his occupation is and  Special Interrogatory 3 asks Plaintiff what his primary residence is/was from  January 2021 to present.   Again, Plaintiff objects on the ground that these  interrogatories do not comply with CCP 2030.060(d).  As noted above, the Court finds this  objection to put form over substance and overrules it.  Without waiving the objection, Plaintiff  responds by stating that “[n]o documents have been identified in response to  that interrogatory.”  Plaintiff’s claim  that no documents were identified in response to Special Interrogatories 1 and  3 does not make sense.  Special  Interrogatories 9 and 10 are not requests for production.  Rather, they are asking Plaintiff to identify  documents which would support his claim that he is self-employed as he  indicated in response to Special Interrogatory 1 and to support where he has  lived from January 2021 to present.     Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied as it does  not comply with CCP 2023.040.  CCP  2023.040 provides:    “A request for a sanction shall, in  the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom  the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought. The notice of  motion shall be supported by a memorandum of points and authorities, and  accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any  monetary sanction sought.”      Here, the notice of motion merely indicates that  Defendants seek sanctions without indicating the type of sanctions or against  whom the unspecified sanctions are sought.   (See Notice of Motion, pp.1-2).      Defendants’ request in the reply that the Court issue an  Order to Show Cause Re Why Plaintiff’s Counsel Should Not Be Sanctioned based  on conflict of interest in its representation of Plaintiff against Center  Street is denied without prejudice.  As  noted above, Plaintiff has now dismissed his 1st and 4th  causes of action, which were the only causes of action alleged against Center  Street.   If Defendants still believe that disqualification of  Plaintiff’s counsel is warranted, a noticed motion for such relief should be  filed.  If Defendants believe that some  other sanctions should be imposed upon counsel, they may file a noticed motion  for such relief or a new request for the issuance of an Order to Show Cause  specifying the type of sanctions to be imposed.   CONCLUSION   The request to compel further responses to Special  Interrogatories Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, and 16 is granted.  Further responses are due within 30  days.  Sanctions are denied.  The request for issuance of an Order to Show  Cause is denied without prejudice.               The Court notes that both Plaintiff and Defendant have  failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to their respective  papers.  The parties are reminded to  review the 5/3/19 First Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing  for Civil.  When e-filing documents,  parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set forth at  page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First Amended  General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil.  See also CRC 3.1110(f)(4).     Continued failure to comply with these requirements in  the future may result in  matters being  placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be resubmitted in  compliance with these requirements, documents not being considered and/or the  imposition of sanctions.    Dept.

SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY

 

This action arises out of Plaintiff Sam Ostayan’s
(Plaintiff) claim that Defendant Prestige Default Services, LLC (Prestige), as
trustee of the nonjudicial foreclosure sale of real property located at 10711
Sunnybrae Avenue, Chatsworth,  California
91311 (the Property), failed to comply with Civil Code 2924m when conducting
the foreclosure sale of the Property. 

 

Civil Code 2924m was enacted to give families, renters
and housing nonprofits an opportunity to purchase foreclosed properties after
the trustee’s sale by enlarging the timeline for the recordation of the
trustee’s deed depending on who the bidder is.

 

The version of Civil Code 2924m operative at the relevant
time period (1/1/21 – 12/31/21) defined an eligible tenant bidder as a natural
person, who at the time of the trustee’s sale:

 

     “(A) Is occupying the real property as
their primary residence. 

(B) Is occupying the real property
under a rental or lease agreement    entered
into as the result of an arm's length transaction with the mortgagor or trustor
on a date prior to the recording of the Notice of Default against the property.


(C) Is not the mortgagor or
trustor, or the child, spouse, or parent of the mortgagor or trustor.”  

 

Civil Code 2924m(a)(2).  

 

The  statute
further provided that a nonjudicial foreclosure sale of a residential property
(one to four units) would not be deemed final until the earliest of the
following: 

 

“(1) If a prospective
owner-occupant is the last and highest bidder at the trustee's sale, the date
upon which the conditions set forth in Section 2924h of the Civil Code for the
sale to become final are met. The trustee shall require the prospective owner-occupant
to submit the affidavit described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a). The
trustee may reasonably rely upon this affidavit. 

(2) Fifteen days after the
trustee's sale unless at least one eligible tenant buyer or eligible bidder
submits to the trustee either a bid pursuant to paragraph (3) or (4) or a
nonbinding written notice of intent to place such a bid. The bid or written notice
of intent to place a bid shall be sent to the trustee by certified mail,
overnight delivery, or other method that allows for confirmation of the
delivery date and shall be received by the trustee no later than 15 days after
the trustee's sale. 

(3) The date upon which a
representative of all of the eligible tenant buyers submits to the trustee a
bid in an amount equal to the full amount of the last and highest bid at the
trustee's sale… This bid shall be accompanied by an affidavit stating that the
persons represented meet the criteria set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision
(a). The trustee may reasonably rely on this affidavit. 

(4) Forty-five days after the
trustee's sale, except that during the 45-day period, an eligible bidder may
submit to the trustee a bid in an amount that exceeds the last and highest bid
at the trustee's sale… The bid shall be accompanied by an affidavit identifying
the category set forth in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) to which the
eligible bidder belongs and stating that the eligible bidder meets the criteria
for that category. The trustee may reasonably rely on this affidavit.” 

 

Civil Code 2924m(c)(1)-(4).

 

If the winning bidder at the foreclosure sale was a
“prospective owner occupant” and completed all of the requirements, the sale
was deemed final on the date of the sale, and was deemed perfected as of that
date as long as the trustee’s deed was recorded within 18 calendar days.  Civil Code 2924m(c)(1).  If not, the foreclosure trustee must, within
48 hours of the trustee’s sale, post the following information on the internet:  

 

“(a) The date on which the
trustee's sale took place. (Civil Code 2924m(d)(1)(A)). 

(b) The amount of the last and
highest bid at the trustee's sale. (Civil Code 2924m(d)(1)(B)).

(c) An address at which the trustee
may receive documents by mail and a method of overnight delivery.” 

 

Civil Code 2924m(d)(1)(C).

 

Thereafter, an eligible tenant bidder or eligible bidder
may submit to the trustee a nonbinding written notice of intent to bid within
15 days after the sale.  An eligible
tenant bidder or eligible bidder will have additional time (no later than 45
days after the sale) to submit a bid and a code-compliant affidavit.  If an eligible tenant bidder submits a bid and
a compliant affidavit, then the eligible tenant bidder will be deemed the last
and highest bidder notwithstanding bids from other classes of eligible bidders.
 Civil Code 2924m(c)(3).  If an eligible bidder submits a bid and a
compliant affidavit 45 days after the trustee’s sale, the eligible bidder that
submitted the highest bid will be deemed the last and highest bidder.  Civil Code 2924m(c)(4).

 

Here, the foreclosure sale occurred on 6/29/21.  At the sale, the Property was sold to U.S.
Bank Trust National Association, as Trustee for ABS Trust VI Select Portfolio
Servicing, Inc., who is not an owner occupant, for $401,000.00.  (FAC ¶¶10-11).  Because U.S. Bank is not an “eligible bidder”
under Civil Code 2924m, Prestige published the bid amount and started to accept
post-sale Notices of Intent to Bid pursuant to Civil Code 2924m.

 

On 7/12/21, Plaintiff sent a written letter indicating
his intent to bid on the Property as his personal residence.  (FAC ¶12). 
Prestige informed Plaintiff that he must submit a bid by 8/13/21, which
is the statutory cut-off date (45th day) following the sale.  Id. 
On 8/13/21, Plaintiff delivered a sealed post-sale bid for $555,500.  (FAC ¶13). 
That same day, Defendant Soldiers of America (SOA) also delivered a
post-sale bid.  Id.  Prestige also received a post-sale bid in the
amount of $401,000 from a purported “Eligible Tenant.”  (FAC ¶14). 
On 8/13/21, Prestige rejected and refunded both Plaintiff’s and SOA’s
respective bids advising Plaintiff and SOA that it was accepting a bid for
$401,000 from an “Eligible Tenant,” which bid held higher priority over
Plaintiff’s and SOA’s bids.  Id.    

 

On 8/16/21, Prestige returned the deposited funds to the
purportedly “Eligible Tenant” upon determining that the bid was submitted by a
corporation on behalf of a bidder that was deceased at the time of the
foreclosure sale and who was, therefore, ineligible to bid under Civil Code
section 2924m.  (FAC ¶15).

 

Prestige never issued a trustee’s deed upon sale to any
Eligible Tenant.  (FAC ¶16).  Instead, on 8/23/21, Prestige issued a Trustee’s
Deed Upon Sale (TDUS) to SOA based on a new bid submitted outside the 45-day
deadline.  Id.   The
TDUS stated that SOA had the highest bid in the amount of $556,000 (just $500
over Plaintiff’s bid of $555,500).  Id.
 Thereafter, Plaintiff  learned that SOA’s original sealed but
rejected bid submitted to Prestige on 8/13/21, was for $700,000, and not for
$556,000, the amount for which SOA purportedly purchased the Property at a
later date outside the 45-day window through a new bid.  (FAC ¶17).  SOA’s original bid and its proffered payment
is evidenced by three cashier’s checks that it submitted to Prestige with its
bid in the amounts of $500,000, $125,000, and $75,000, which bid was rejected
and refunded to SOA on that same date, along with Plaintiff’s bid.  Id. 


 

After rejecting Plaintiff’s and SOA’s bids, Plaintiff
alleges that Prestige informed SOA of the amount of Plaintiff’s bid, and Prestige
allowed only SOA to submit a new bid of $556,000.00.  (FAC ¶17). 
Prestige did not offer Plaintiff the same opportunity to submit a new
bid.  (FAC ¶18).

 

Plaintiff contends that Prestige’s acts were unlawful,
and that SOA’s new bid was not permitted as it was done outside of the 45-day
statutory deadline provided in Civil Code 2924m(c)(4), making the sale void.  (FAC ¶18). 
Plaintiff alleges that SOA then sold the Property to Defendant SoCal Innovative
Group, LLC (SoCal) for approximately $1,010,000.00, thereby realizing a
substantial profit from its alleged improper purchase of the Property.  (FAC ¶19). 
Plaintiff further alleges that on or about 6/13/22, Defendant Center
Street Lending VIII SPE, LLC (Center Street) executed a deed of trust in the
amount of $1,152,450.00 secured by the Property.  (FAC ¶29). 
Plaintiff claims that SoCal was not a bona fide purchaser of the
Property because the TDUS in favor of SOA was void, as is the legal title of
SoCal, a defaulted entity.  (FAC ¶21).   Therefore,
Plaintiff claims that Center Street has no valid lien secured by the Property.

 

On 6/28/22, Plaintiff filed this action against Prestige,
Center Street, SOA, and SoCal.  On 7/27/22,
Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging causes of action
for: (1) Declaratory Relief (against all defendants); (2) Violation of Civil
Code 2924m (against Prestige and SOA); (3) Bid Rigging (against Prestige and
SOA) and (4) Quiet Title (against SOA, SoCal and Center Street).  

 

By way of the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff seeks a
judicial declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties concerning
the rights, title to, and ownership of the Subject Property. (FAC ¶23).  Plaintiff further requests a judicial
declaration that neither SoCal nor Center Street have any right, title, lien,
or ownership to the Property because the TDUS under which SOA purportedly
obtained title was null and void, in addition to the grant deed to SoCal, and
therefore, SoCal has no valid interest in the Property, nor does its lender,
Center Street have any secured lien. 
(FAC ¶24).  Plaintiff also seeks a
judicial declaration that his bid was the last and highest legitimate bid and
that he is the owner of the Property for a purchase price of $555,500, which he
offers to immediately tender to Prestige. 
(FAC ¶25).   Finally, Plaintiff
alleges that Prestige violated the procedures in Civil Code 2924m and
participated in a bid rigging scheme by manipulating and artificially
determining the post-sale bidding process and by accepting an untimely new bid
from SOA, among other things.  (FAC ¶¶30,
35).

 

On 2/24/23, Prestige and Center Street’s demurrer to the
First Amended Complaint was overruled. 
On 3/24/23, Prestige filed an answer to the First Amended Complaint.  On 3/27/23, Center Street filed an answer to
the First Amended Complaint.  

 

On 3/9/23, Prestige and Center Street (collectively,
Defendants) served Plaintiff with Requests for Admissions, Set 1.  (Davieau Decl., Ex.A).  After being granted an extension, Plaintiff
served responses on 4/26/23.  (Id.,
Ex.B-C).  Defendants found certain of the
responses to be deficient.  (Davieau
Decl.).  Meet and confer efforts between
the parties failed to resolve the discovery issues.  (Davieau Decl., Ex.D-E).  Therefore, on 6/12/23, Defendants filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order compelling Plaintiff to provide
further responses to Requests for Admissions, Set 1, Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23.  Additionally, Defendants seek sanctions.  On 9/21/23, Plaintiff filed an opposition to
the motion wherein he seeks sanctions against Defendants.  On 9/28/23, Defendants filed a reply to the
opposition.  

 

On 9/28/23, Plaintiff dismissed his 1st and 4th
causes of action.  

 

ANALYSIS

 

Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice is granted. 

 

Upon receipt of a response to requests for admissions,
the propounding party may move to compel further responses if the propounding
party deems that an objection is without merit or too general.  CCP 2033.290(a)(2).  The responding party has the burden of
justifying its objections and responses. 
See Fairmont Insurance Co. (2000) 22 C4th 245, 255.

 

The subject requests for admissions seek admissions of
fact relating to Plaintiff’s history of submitting bids to purchase property in
foreclosure as a prospective owner-occupant and subsequent sales of such
properties and facts related to Plaintiff’s primary residence.  

 

Plaintiff responded only with objections to Requests for
Admissions 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23.

 

Plaintiff objected to these requests on the ground that
they violate CCP 2033.060(d) because the definitions for certain terms are
included in a prefatory statement rather than in each request.  The Court finds this objection places form
over substance and overrules it.  Plaintiff
also objects to these requests on relevance grounds.  Plaintiff contends that any POO Affidavits he
submitted for property and any alleged sales of property consummated after the
sale of the Property which is the subject of this action are not relevant to
any claims or defenses in this action and are not likely to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.  

 

Additionally, Plaintiff objected on the ground that the
requests are vague, ambiguous and unintelligible because they reference
“SECTION 2924” which is not defined. 
Based on the totality of circumstances and the subject of this action,
the Court finds it clear that the reference is to Civil Code 2924m.  If Plaintiff had any real doubt, this could
have been resolved through the meet and confer process.  Plaintiff’s objections in relation to the
defined term “POO” are similarly place form over substance and/or are without
merit.     

 

In discovery, the concept of relevance is broader than
evidence that is admissible at trial with any doubts regarding relevance
generally being resolved in favor of allowing discovery.  Mercury Interactive Corp. (2007) 158
CA4th 60, 98; See also Gonzalez (1995) 33 CA4th 1539, 1546 (in
discovery, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in
evaluating the case, preparing for trial or facilitating settlement).  

 

The information sought may assist in establishing whether
or not Plaintiff complied with Civil Code 2924m entitling him to seek damages
for Defendants’ claimed violation. 
Plaintiff has not established that the information is not discoverable
merely because it concerns conduct that occurred after the sale of the Property
at issue in this action.

 

Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied as it does
not comply with CCP 2023.040.  CCP
2023.040 provides: 

 

“A request for a sanction shall, in
the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom
the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought. The notice of
motion shall be supported by a memorandum of points and authorities, and
accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any
monetary sanction sought.”   

 

Here, the notice of motion merely indicates that
Defendants seek sanctions without indicating the type of sanctions or against
whom the unspecified sanctions are sought. 
(See Notice of Motion, pp.1-2). 


 

Defendants’ request in the reply that the Court issue an
Order to Show Cause Re Why Plaintiff’s Counsel Should Not Be Sanctioned based
on conflict of interest in its representation of Plaintiff against Center
Street is denied without prejudice.  As
noted above, Plaintiff has now dismissed his 1st and 4th
causes of action, which were the only causes of action alleged against Center
Street.

 

If Defendants still believe that disqualification of
Plaintiff’s counsel is warranted, a noticed motion for such relief should be
filed.  If Defendants believe that some
other sanctions should be imposed upon counsel, they may file a noticed motion
for such relief or a new request for the issuance of an Order to Show Cause
specifying the type of sanctions to be imposed.

 

CONCLUSION

 

The request to compel further responses to Requests for
Admissions 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, and 23 is granted.  Further
responses are due within 30 days. 
Sanctions are denied.  The request
for issuance of an Order to Show Cause is denied without prejudice.            

 

The Court notes that both Plaintiff and Defendant have
failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to their respective
papers.  The parties are reminded to
review the 5/3/19 First Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing
for Civil.  When e-filing documents,
parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set forth at
page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First Amended
General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil.  See also CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  

 

Continued failure to comply with these requirements in
the future may result in  matters being
placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be resubmitted in
compliance with these requirements, documents not being considered and/or the
imposition of sanctions.
