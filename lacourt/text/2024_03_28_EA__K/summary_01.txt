Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the motion to compel deposition filed by Kindercare Learning Centers, LLC and Margue Zarate (Defendants) against John Roe (Plaintiff), a minor who alleges sexual assault and battery at daycare. The court finds that Plaintiff's refusal to attend deposition without a valid objection is unjustified and orders Plaintiff to attend a three-hour deposition. The court also awards sanctions against Plaintiff and/or his attorneys in the amount of $1,050.00, payable within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling. The court rejects Plaintiff's arguments that the deposition would not be effective or that he will not be testifying at trial.
