Legal
Standard
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a
person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230,
without having served a valid objection . . ., fails to appear for examination,
or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
A motion to compel deposition “shall be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails
to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).)
A court shall impose monetary sanctions if the motion to
compel is granted, “unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(g)(1).)
Discussion
Defendants move the
court for an order, per Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450, compelling
Plaintiff to appear for deposition. Defendants also seek sanctions against
Plaintiff and/or his attorneys in the amount of $5,070.00.
Defendants’ counsel
Joshua Stewart (“Stewart”) and Charles S. Russell (“Russell”) represent as
follows:
On
January 26, 2024, Defendants’ counsel’s office electronically served
“Defendants’ Notice of Deposition of Plaintiff John Roe,” scheduling
Plaintiff’s deposition for February 15, 2024 (Stewart Decl., ¶ 1, Exh. E);
within minutes, Stewart received an email from Plaintiff’s counsel Nadine
Khedry (“Khedry”), who advised that they would be filing for a protective order
regarding same. (Id., ¶ 2, Exh. F). On February 13, 2024, Russell
emailed Plaintiff’s counsel and asked if they would be producing Plaintiff for
his deposition. (Russell Decl., ¶ 1, Exh. A.) Russell noted that no motion for
protective order had been filed and that the deadline to serve an objection had
passed. (Id.) Khedry sent an email later that day stating that Plaintiff
would not appear for his deposition and that she would “file an objection today
for your record.” (Id., ¶ 2, Exh. B.) Khedry and Russell subsequently
met and conferred telephonically during which time Khedry advised Russell that
she could not agree to produce Plaintiff for deposition under any
circumstances. (Id., ¶ 3). Plaintiff’s counsel served an objection on
February 13, 2023. (Id., ¶ 4, Exh. C). 
A defendant is empowered to obtain discovery regarding any
non-privileged matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action, including evidence relating to Plaintiff’s claims. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2017.010.) “[T]he principle that a party to a civil action has a right to depose
any adverse party in the action is both fundamental to our legal system and
longstanding.” (Slaieh v. Superior Court of Riverside County (2022) 77
Cal.App.5th 266, 275.) “An important aspect of legitimate discovery from a
defendant’s point of view is the ascertainment, in advance of trial, of the
specific components of plaintiff’s case so that appropriate preparations can be
made to meet them. It is impossible to discover this other than from the
plaintiff.” (Karz v. Karl (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 637, 650.)
Defendants duly noticed Plaintiff’s deposition. Plaintiff’s
counsel, in turn, refused to produce Plaintiff for same but failed to move for
a protective order, raise timely objections or propose parameters.
Defendants are entitled to obtain Plaintiff’s version of the
events under oath. Plaintiff and the other boy involved are the only two
witnesses who can provide first-hand accounts of what transpired. Further, only
Plaintiff can provide firsthand testimony with respect to the emotional
distress he claims to have suffered. As Defendants note, Plaintiff’s
“statements, under oath, lock [him] into his positions and theories of the
case, provide a basis to impeach him and other witnesses, and provide his
version of the incident.” (Reply, 3:3-5; see also, Motion, 6:2-4).
Plaintiff argues that “[t]here is no basis to compel” the
deposition because he will not be testifying at trial, Defendants have
conducted a defense medical examination, his parents have been deposed, and he has
already submitted to a forensic interview with authorities. (Opp., 2:5-9). The
foregoing arguments are unsupported by any authority. Further, as Defendants
point out, Plaintiff’s unsworn statements to law enforcement are hearsay.
Plaintiff also argues that his deposition would not be
effective in “gathering discoverable information” because of his age (Id.,
2:9-10), but fails to provide any supporting evidence for this statement.
Plaintiff’s request for a protective order on the basis of unwarranted
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression and undue burden, moreover, ignores the
fact that this is not Plaintiff’s motion and that Plaintiff made no
attempt to seek a protective order earlier. Plaintiff is not entitled to seek
relief in an opposition brief.
The motion is
granted. The court is inclined to set a three-hour deposition limit and to
allow one of Plaintiff’s
parents to be present during the deposition under the circumstances. The court will hear further from
counsel in this regard at the time of the hearing. The court is not inclined to
set any other
parameters as suggested by Plaintiff.
Sanctions
Defendants seek sanctions against Plaintiff and/or his attorneys in the amount of $5,070.00.
[calculated as follows: 3.6
hours preparing motion, plus 0.5 hours drafting proposed order, plus 0.7 hours
drafting declaration, plus 1 hour reviewing opposition, plus 2 hours preparing
reply at $350.00/hour, plus 1.5 hours editing motion, plus 2 hours meeting
& conferring/researching, plus 1 hour reviewing opposition, plus 2 hours
preparing reply at $350.00/hour. Note: this equals $5,005.00, not $5,070.00].
Utilizing a Lodestar approach, and
in view of the totality of the circumstances, the court finds that the total
and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the pending motion is $1,050.00 (i.e., 3 hours at
$350.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee). Sanctions are payable within 20 days from
the date of the notice of ruling.
