 Case Number:  23STCV09293    Hearing Date:   April 24, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff St. Andrews Second Home LLC’s
Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint
Plaintiff St. Andrews Second Home LLC
moves for leave to file a first amended complaint.  Courts have discretion to permit an amendment
to any pleading “in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) 
“This discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments,
for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same
lawsuit.”  (Kittredge Sports Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)  
Defendants did not timely oppose the
motion.  Permitting the amendment serves
the interest of justice.  
Disposition
Plaintiff St. Andrews Second Home LLC’s
motion for leave to file a first amended complaint is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to file the first
amended complaint (attached as exhibit A to the declaration of Michael A.
Taitelman) forthwith.
