And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding motions to compel filed by the defendant in a lawsuit. The defendant propounded form interrogatories and a request for production of documents on the plaintiff on July 1, 2022, and the plaintiff failed to respond. Despite multiple extensions being provided, the plaintiff still has not responded. The defendant filed a motion to compel the plaintiff to provide responses to the discovery requests, and the court has granted the motion. The plaintiff is ordered to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests served on them within 30 days. The defendant's request for sanctions is denied because it did not identify who it seeks sanctions against in the notice of motion.
