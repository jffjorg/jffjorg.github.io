This is a tentative ruling issued by a judge in a case where Porsche Leasing LTD. demurred to the complaint filed by Carrillo et al. alleging that Sabouhi, who leased the vehicle from Porsche Leasing LTD., struck the plaintiff. Porsche Leasing LTD. argued that it is in the business of leasing vehicles and that the Graves amendment limits its liability, citing the fact that it is an owner of the vehicle and that there is no negligence or criminal wrongdoing on its part. However, the judge ruled that the defendant cannot establish the applicability of the Graves amendment or that it did not act with negligence or criminal wrongdoing on demurrer, as these arguments require evidence. The judge denied the demurrer, stating that these arguments are more properly made on summary judgment.
