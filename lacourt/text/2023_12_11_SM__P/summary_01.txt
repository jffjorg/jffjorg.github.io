This tentative ruling addresses Defendant Bass's Motion to Quash Complaint for Lack of Service. Defendant Bass argues that the complaint was not personally served, citing that Process Server Jorge Rivera made two attempts to personally serve Bass at his residence before serving Bass's brother at the same location. However, Plaintiff Doe filed a proof of substituted service, which indicates that Rivera complied with all requirements for substituted service under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง415.20(b). The Judge denied the motion, ordering Defendant Bass to answer the complaint within 20 days.
