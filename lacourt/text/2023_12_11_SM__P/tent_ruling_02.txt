Carrillo et al. v.
Porsche Leasing LTD., Case No. 23SMCV03121
Hearing Date December
11, 2023
Defendant Porsche
Leasing LTD.’s Demurrer to Complaint 
 
Plaintiff sued demurring
defendant Porsche Leasing, which leased a vehicle to defendant Sabouhi, who allegedly
struck plaintiff. Porsche demurs under the Graves amendment. 
 
Under the Graves
amendment “An owner of a motor vehicle that rents or leases a vehicle to a
person (or an affiliate of the owner) shall not be liable under the law of any
State or political subdivision thereof, by reason of being the owner of the
vehicle (or an affiliate of the owner),
For harm to
persons or property that results or arises out of the use, operation, or
possession of the vehicle during the period of the rental lease, if – (1) the
owner (or an affiliate of the owner) is engaged in the trade or business of
renting or leasing motor vehicles; and (2) there is no negligence or criminal
wrongdoing on the part of the owner.” 49 U.S.C. §30106. 
 
Defendant Porsche argues
it is in the business of leasing vehicles and submits a State of California
Certificate of Title (Exhibit C) showing it owned the involved vehicle. The
court can take judicial notice of the certificate and the fact that Porsche is
in the business of leasing vehicles under Cal. Evid. Code §452(g) and (h). 
 
On demurrer, Porsche
cannot establish applicability of the Graves Amendment limiting its liability
or that it did not act with negligence or criminal wrongdoing. A complete
affirmative defense under the Graves amendment cannot be established on
demurrer, as it requires evidence. These arguments are more properly made on
summary judgment. DENIED.
