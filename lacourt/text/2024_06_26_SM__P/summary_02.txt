Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Subaru of America, Inc.'s (SOA) demurrer to DCH Subaru of Thousand Oaks' (DCH) second amended cross-complaint. DCH alleges that SOA is liable for damages caused by DCH's allegedly negligent repair of a vehicle. The court has sustained SOA's demurrer to DCH's claims for implied indemnity, equitable indemnity, and declaratory relief without leave to amend. The court has also granted DCH's request for judicial notice of certain documents. In its ruling, the court has emphasized that DCH's claims do not allege any basis for SOA's liability, and that DCH's allegations are uncertain and fail to demonstrate a proper subject of declaratory relief.
