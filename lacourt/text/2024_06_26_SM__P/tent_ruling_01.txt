v. Allarie-Larson, et al., Case No. 20SMCV01208
Hearing
date June 26, 2024
Defendant’s
Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment
 
Defendant
tenant seeks to set aside default in this failure to pay rent case. Defendant
seeks relief under Code Civ. Proc. §473.5, asserting she did not have notice
because she was not served and arguing default was fraudulently obtained.
 
Evidentiary
Ruling Objections
Defendant’s
Request for Judicial Notice of Proof of Service of Process filed by plaintiff
on November 2, 2020 GRANTED as a court document per Evidence Code 452(d).
 
Plaintiff’s
evidentiary objections to defendant’s declaration and supplemental declaration
are not numbered consecutively (as required by CRC 3.1354), but the court rules
as follows: Objections to Allarie’s Declaration: SUSTAINED as to paragraph 8
(hearsay). Other objections are OVERRULED. Objections to Allarie’s Supplemental
Declaration: SUSTAINED as to paragraphs 7 (lines 6-9) (lacks personal
knowledge) and 11 (irrelevant). Other objections are OVERRULED.
 
When a motion is
made on grounds that default judgment is void for lack of service, the
limitation period in Code of Civ. Proc., sec. 473.5 applies. Defendant must
file the motion within two years after entry of default judgment (Trackman
v. Kenney (2010) 187 Cal. App. 4th 175, 180-181; Code
Civ. Proc. §473.5) and file a proposed responsive pleading. 
 
Relief from default or default judgment can be sought
at any time on the ground of extrinsic mistake. Olivera v. Grace
(1942) 19 Cal.2d 570, 576; Sporn v. Home Depot USA, Inc. (2005) 126
Cal.App.4th 1294, 1300. To obtain relief, moving party must show: (1) a
meritorious defense; (2) diligence in seeking relief; and (3) a satisfactory
excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action. Rappleyea v.
Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 982. Once the extrinsic fraud or mistake is
discovered, a party must proceed diligently to seek relief. Id., at
983-984.
On
September 3, 2020 plaintiff sued for past due rent. Process
server Alexandra Melgoza substitute served the summons and complaint to “Chris Kim”
on 9/14/20 at 2:41 PM at Postal Annex, defendant’s P.O. box location. Copies
were also mailed. See 11/2/20 Proof of Service. Allarie did not file responsive
pleadings. On November 2, 2020 plaintiff requested entry of default. Default
was entered February 17, 2021 for $86,589.37. 
 
On April 2, 2024
defendant moved to set aside per to Code Civ. Proc. §473.5, claiming lack of
notice and that the default was obtained by fraud. A proposed answer was filed
June 7, 2024. 

 
A proof of service
attested to by a registered process server creates a rebuttable presumption of
service. Evid. Code §647; American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara¿(2011)
199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390. The party seeking to defeat service of process must
present sufficient evidence to show that the service did not take place as
stated. Palm Property Investments, LLC v. Yadegar¿(2011) 194
Cal.App.4th 1419, 1428.
Defendant argues she was not served by
mail. Allarie Decl. ¶¶5-6. Per the proof of service, process server Melgoza states
she served at defendant’s residence, but the address served was actually
defendant’s P.O. box. Allarie Decl. ¶7. Based upon this discrepancy, defendant
argues Melgoza’s declaration is fraudulent. Defendant states she does not know
what happened to the documents served by Melgoza. Allarie Decl. ¶9. However, this
is contradicted by Exh. 3 to Allarie’s declaration (filed 4/2/24), which states:

 
“In early December the
elderly woman at my PO Box gave me a legal documents not in an envelope or
folder, given to her by a process server. (FYI: I HAVE DECEMBER AS WHEN I
RECEIVED THE CMC STATEMENT DOCUMENT IN MY NOTES. I KNOW THE PROCESS SERVER SAYS
SEPTEMBER 14, 2020 WAS THE DATE SHE LEFT THE DOCUMENTS AT MY PO BOX SO MAYBE I
MADE A MISTAKE? I WAS MOVING SO IT IS POSSIBLE I DIDN’T STOP BY MY PO BOX UNTIL
DECEMBER?) I assumed it was for a hearing for a lawsuit. The paperwork
said; “NOTICE OF CASE MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE”
 
Your Case Management Conference has been scheduled at the
courthouse address shown above on: 03-02-2021 at 8:30am   Dept. P 
 
I understood this to mean, I needed to
show up at the SM Courthouse at 8:30am on the 2nd of March 2021. Allarie Decl.
Exh. 3, p. 3.
 
This constitutes an admission that
Allarie was in receipt of the summons and complaint by no later than December
2020. Defendant’s supplemental declaration (filed 5/7/24, para. 3) states: 
 
In fact, I only first learned that I was being sued by KADOSH
in September or possibly October of 2020 when the “Notice of Case
Management Conference” was mailed to my PO Box. The Notice of Case Management
Conference informed me of a hearing on March 2, 2021 for this lawsuit. It was
then that I discovered that KADOSH was suing both me and my deceased husband,
whom KADOSH knew had died (by suicide) in April of 2020. (emphasis added)
 
This acknowledges notice of the suit and
CMC in September or October 2020. Allarie Supp. Decl. ¶3. A motion under Code
Civ. Proc. §473.5 must be made within two years after entry of a default
judgment, which occurred February 17, 2021.
 
Defendant was aware of the suit by late
2020 and the default by no later than March 1, 2021, when she called the court clerk
to ask for directions to the March 2, 2021 CMC and was told the CMC was
cancelled since default judgment had been entered. Allarie Supp. Decl. ¶8.
 
Based on the totality of the evidence, Allarie’s
motion is untimely under Code Civ. Proc. §473.5. As default judgment was
entered February 17, 2021, the motion would have to have been filed by February
17, 2023.
 
Evidence of a false proof of service
constitutes grounds for a set-aside based on extrinsic fraud. County of San Diego
v. Gorham (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1229. To be entitled to such
equitable relief, defendant must meet the Rappleyea standard (discussed
above). 
 
At the court’s instruction, defendant
provided a supplemental declaration regarding when and how she discovered the
default judgment and whether she proceeded thereafter in a timely manner to
seek relief. Defendant learned of the default from the court clerk on March 1,
2021. She filed her motion to set aside April 2, 2024, three years later.
Defendant did not take reasonable steps to set aside promptly and was outside
the two year statutory time period.
 
Defendant argues the
process server’s affidavit was fraudulent because states the summons and
complaint were served at defendant’s residence, but the address listed is
defendant’s P.O. box location. This may be evidence of a mistake, but defendant
proves no fraudulent intent. Further, she had actual notice (see discussion
above). 
 
Mailboxes at a
private business can receive service. Code Civ. Proc., sec. 415.20. Defendant’s
mailbox was at Postal Annex. See Allarie Decl. ¶7. By her own admission, she
received notice of the CMC in “early December” from “the elderly woman at my PO
Box” who gave her “legal documents . . . given to her by a process server.”
Allarie Decl. Exh. 3, p. 3. There is no proof of fraud. 
 
There is no basis
on which the court can grant the requested relief. DENIED.
