And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Allarie-Larson, is seeking to set aside a default judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff, Kadosh, due to alleged lack of notice and fraud. The defendant claims that she did not receive notice of the lawsuit and that the default judgment was obtained fraudulently. However, the court finds that the defendant was in fact served notice of the lawsuit through a process server, and that she received notice of the suit in December 2020. The court also finds that the defendant failed to take reasonable steps to set aside the default judgment promptly and was outside the two-year statutory time period for filing the motion.

The court relies on various California court cases to support its decision, including Trackman v. Kenney and Rappleyea v. Campbell. The court denies the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment, finding that the defendant's claims of lack of notice and fraud are not supported by the evidence.
