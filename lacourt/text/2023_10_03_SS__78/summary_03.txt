And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admissions admitted and the defendant's request for relief from waiver of objections. The motion to compel defendant's responses to requests for admissions is denied because the defendant has since filed complete responses to the requests. The request for sanctions is granted, and the defendant is ordered to pay $1,345 in sanctions for failing to serve timely responses.

The defendant's request for relief from waiver of objections is granted because the defendant's failure to serve timely responses was due to excusable neglect, and the late responses were substantially code compliant. The court finds that the defendant's counsel's failure to calendar the deadline to respond to the requests was due to a mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.

The judge notes that the defendant's late responses contained objections and verifications were not served until after the late responses were served, but the court finds that the responses are substantially code compliant and that the inclusion of objections in the late responses does not mean the responses are not substantially code compliant.

## English Summary

In a lemon law case, the judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion by the plaintiff (Maribel Jiorge) seeking to have the defendant's (General Motors, LLC) responses to requests for admissions deemed admitted and to impose sanctions.

The judge denied the motion because the defendant ultimately provided complete responses to the requests. However, the judge granted the defendant relief from waiver of objections due to excusable neglect, finding that the late responses were substantially compliant with the applicable statutes.

The judge also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,345, finding that the defendant's late response to the requests for admissions necessitated the motion.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admissions admitted and the defendant's request for relief from waiver of objections. The plaintiff's motion is denied, but the court grants the defendant's request for relief from waiver of objections. The court also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,345 against the defendant for failing to serve timely responses to the requests for admissions.

The court's ruling is based on the facts that the defendant failed to serve timely responses to the requests for admissions, and that the defendant's counsel failed to calendar the deadline for responses. The court finds that the defendant's failure to serve timely responses was excusable due to counsel's mistake in not calendaring the deadline. The court also finds that the defendant's late responses were substantially code compliant, despite containing objections and verifications being served after the responses were served.

The court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, which requires that a party who fails to serve a timely response to requests for admissions waive their right to object to the requests. However, the court can relieve a party of this waiver if they subsequently serve a response that is in substantial compliance with the code and their failure to serve a timely response was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
