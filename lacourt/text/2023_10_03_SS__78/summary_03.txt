And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admissions admitted and the defendant's request for relief from waiver of objections. The motion to compel defendant's responses to requests for admissions is denied because the defendant has since filed complete responses to the requests. The request for sanctions is granted, and the defendant is ordered to pay $1,345 in sanctions for failing to serve timely responses.

The defendant's request for relief from waiver of objections is granted because the defendant's failure to serve timely responses was due to excusable neglect, and the late responses were substantially code compliant. The court finds that the defendant's counsel's failure to calendar the deadline to respond to the requests was due to a mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.

The judge notes that the defendant's late responses contained objections and verifications were not served until after the late responses were served, but the court finds that the responses are substantially code compliant and that the inclusion of objections in the late responses does not mean the responses are not substantially code compliant.
