And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant Hitham Ahmed's responses to form interrogatories, set two. The motion is granted in part and denied in part. The court finds that the defendant was substantially justified in opposing the motion, and therefore sanctions are denied. The court grants the motion with respect to FROGs nos. 15.1 and 1, as it is reasonable for the plaintiff to propound these questions again. However, the court denies the motion as to FROGs numbers 50.1-50.6, as the plaintiff failed to file a motion to compel further responses within the statutory deadline.
