The court grants the motion with respect to FROGs nos. 15.1 and 1, as it is reasonable for the plaintiff to propound these questions again. However, the court denies the motion as to FROGs numbers 50.1-50.6, as the plaintiff failed to file a motion to compel further responses within the statutory deadline.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's responses to Form Interrogatories (FROGs), set two, in part. The defendant had failed to serve responses to the FROGs, which were propounded on September 6, 2022. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's responses to the first set of FROGs were deficient, and that the second set of FROGs was not duplicative. The judge agreed that the defendant's responses to FROGs 15.1 and 1 were reasonable and not duplicative, and granted the motion as to those FROGs. However, the judge denied the motion as to the remaining FROGs, numbers 50.1-50.6, which were identical to the questions asked in the first set of FROGs. The judge also denied sanctions against the defendant, finding that the defendant was substantially justified in opposing the motion.
