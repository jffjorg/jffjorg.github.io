The judge found that the Plaintiff is a third-party beneficiary of the lease agreement between Defendant Saenz LLC and Plaintiff's partner, Edwin Pereira, and that the Complaint sufficiently alleges the breach of the implied warranty of habitability.

The judge also found that the Complaint sufficiently alleges the negligence of Defendant Saenz, including the failure to install a working heater and carbon monoxide alarms in the unit, and that the harm suffered by the Plaintiff was foreseeable.

The judge has denied Defendant Saenz's request to strike the Plaintiff's demand for punitive damages, finding that the Complaint adequately sets forth the elements required for a prima facie claim for punitive damages.

Finally, the judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer in person or via telephone to attempt to resolve their dispute, and has granted a 30-day extension of time for Defendant Saenz to file a responsive pleading.
