And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Defendant Saenz and has ruled that the demurrer is OVERRULED.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff's Complaint states facts sufficient to support her causes of action for breach of implied warranty of habitability, tortious breach of implied warranty of habitability, and negligence.

The Court also finds that the Plaintiff is a third-party beneficiary of the lease and that the Complaint alleges facts showing that the Defendants had notice of and sufficient time to cure the alleged defective conditions.

The Court further finds that the Plaintiff has stated a prima facie claim for punitive damages and that the Defendant's request to strike the demand for punitive damages is denied.

The Court orders the parties to meet and confer to resolve any remaining disputes and sets the matter for a hearing on October 3, 2023.
