  Case Number:  20STCV32746    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78  WESTLAKE SERVICES, LLC,Plaintiff, vs. HITHAM AHMED,Defendant.  Case No.:  20STCV32746 Hearing Date:  October 3, 2023   [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:   PLAINTIFF WESTLAKE SERVICES’ MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT HITHAM AHMED’S RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES (SET TWO) The motion is granted in part and denied in part. Moving party to provide notice.FACTUAL BACKGROUNDThis is an action for breach of contract. Plaintiff Westlake Services, LLC alleges that it entered into a contract with Defendant Hitham Ahmed to sell a vehicle to Ahmed. Ahmend failed to make payments as required by the parties’ contract.PROCEDURAL HISTORY On August 27, 2020, Plaintiff Westlake Services, LLC filed its Complaint against Defendant Hitham Ahmed dba Inline Auto Sale, Inc.On November 18, 2021, Defendant filed his answer.On November 18, 2021, Defendant filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff.On January 11, 2022, Plaintiff answered Defendant’s Cross-Complaint.On May 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel Defendant’s responses to requests for written discovery.DISCUSSION Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant to respond to its Form Interrogatories (“FROGs”), Set Two.Within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them on the propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court has shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding party the court has extended the time for response. (Code Civ. Proc. section 2030.260, subd. (a).)If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc section 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that needs be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)A party waives its objections to a discovery request when it does not serve a timely response to the request. (Code Civ. Proc., section 030.290(a)) Even if objections do not need to be verified, objections will be waived if the responding party “fails to file any response within the statutory time period.” (Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 658.)Failure to timely move to compel further responses within the specified period constitutes a waiver of any right to compel a further response. The 45–day rule to bring a motion to compel is mandatory and jurisdictional “in the sense that it renders court without authority to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v. Superior Ct. (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  Here, Plaintiff’s Counsel testifies that he served Defendant with Form Interrogatories, set two on September 6, 2022. (Friedman Decl., ¶2.) On October 12, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed a meet and confer letter to Defendant’s counsel. (Id., ¶3.) On May 1, 2023, the parties participated in IDC and were unable to resolve their discovery disputes. As of the date of filing this motion, Defendant has not served responses to Plaintiff’s FROGs. (Id., ¶6.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s motion is improper, untimely, and constitutes an abuse of the discovery process. Defendant alleges that on March 1, 2022, Plaintiff propounded its first set of FROGs on Defendant. (Park Decl., ¶2.) On April 28, 2022, Defendant provided responses without objections. (Id., ¶3.) On September 6, 2022, Plaintiff propounded another set of FROGs (the ones at issue here) that was identical to the first. (Id., ¶4, Exh. C.) On October 21, 2022, Defendant served its response to the second set of FROGs objecting to the interrogatories on the grounds that the request was duplicative of the first set of FROGs. (Id., ¶5.) Defendant argues that it already served responses to the first set of FROGs and the deadline for Plaintiff to file a motion to compel further responses has passed. Defendant alleges that in serving an identical set of FROGs, Plaintiff is attempting to circumvent the deadline to file a motion to compel further responses. Defendant cites Professional Career Colleges, Magna Institute, Inc. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 490, 493 in support of Defendant’s position. In Professional Career Colleges, the court ruled that a party propounding discovery who failed to bring a motion to compel further after the statutory deadline may not reset the clock by propounding the same discovery again. (Id.)In reply, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s responses to the first set of FROGs were deficient because Defendant failed to answer FROG numbers 15.1, 17.1, and 50.1. Defendant responded to FROG 15.1 stating discovery was still ongoing. Plaintiff alleges Defendant did not respond to sub parts of FROG no 17.1 and did not respond to FROG 50.1. Plaintiff also argues that that its FROGs, set two, are not duplicative of the first set of FROGs. Plaintiff alleges FROG number 1 is different because a different person could be preparing the second set of FROGs. FROG 17.1 is different because it pertains to a different set of Requests for Admissions. Plaintiff does not address FROGs 15.1 and 50.1-50.6. Plaintiff’s FROGs (Set Two) sought Defendant’s responses to numbers 1, 15.1, 17.1, and 50.1-50.6. Each of these questions were already asked in the first set of FROGs. As Plaintiff points out, a different person could have prepared Defendant’s answers to FROG number 1. Additionally, FROG 15.1 in the second set could be different from the first set because Plaintiff propounded a second set of Requests for Admissions. However, neither party included the Requests for Admissions, set two in their papers. If the second set of Requests for Admissions is different from the first, then FROG number 17.1 is different from the question asked in Plaintiff’s first set of FROGs. If that is the case, the motion is granted with respect to FROG No. 17.1.As for FROG number 15.1, Defendant’s original response states that discovery was still ongoing. It is reasonable that Defendant’s answer to this question would change later, after it had the opportunity to conduct additional discovery. Therefore, it was reasonable (and not duplicative) for Plaintiff to propound this FROG a second time.It is also reasonable and not duplicative to propound FROG number 1 for a second time.The motion is granted as to FROGs nos. 15.1 and 1.Plaintiff’s remaining FROGs, numbers 50.1-50.6 are identical to the questions asked in the first set of FROGs. Plaintiff’s argument that Defendant should have been compelled to answer these questions because the original responses were incomplete fails. If Plaintiff believed the answers to these questions were incomplete, the proper action was to file a motion to compel further responses. Now that the 45-day deadline to file such a motion has passed, the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear a motion compelling answers to FROGs numbers 50.1-50.6. With respect to sanctions, Plaintiff’s motion was granted in part. Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2030.290(c). Here, Plaintiff’s motion was denied in part because it sought answers to questions already asked in a previous set of FROGs. Because the motion was denied as to part of the discovery request, the Court finds that Defendant was substantially justified in opposing this motion. Sanctions are denied.DATED: October 3, 2023 ____________________________ Hon. Jill FeeneyJudge of the Superior Court
