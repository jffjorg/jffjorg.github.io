And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling to transfer and reassign the case to an Independent Calendar Court in the North Central District, presided over by Judge Ashfaq Chowdhury, for all purposes except trial. The case was deemed complicated due to the number of pretrial hearings and/or complexity of issues. The Judge has delegated authority to the Independent Calendar Court to assign the case for trial. Any pending motions or hearings will be reset, continued, or vacated at the direction of the newly assigned court. This means that no hearings will be held in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse, even if hearings remain on the docket.
