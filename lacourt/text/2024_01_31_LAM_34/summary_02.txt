And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff has not filed the required documents, including a request for court judgment, interest computation, memorandum of costs, and declaration of non-military status. The judge also notes that the damages requested in the proposed judgment are higher than the amount prayed for in the complaint, and punitive damages were never prayed for in the complaint. Additionally, the court cannot award pre-judgment interest based on the damages requested, and attorney's fees on a default judgment are limited to the amount awarded. The court has continued the OSC re Entry of Default Judgement until February 27, 2024, and if default judgment is not entered by that date, the court may dismiss the case.
