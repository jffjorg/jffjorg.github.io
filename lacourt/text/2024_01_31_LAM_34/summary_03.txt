And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Demurrer filed by Defendant Bridget L. Jones to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Morgan Cain. The Judge sustains the Demurrer in part, specifically to the first cause of action for deprivation of custody and visitation, without leave to amend the Complaint. The Judge overrules the Demurrer as to the second cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and the third cause of action for defamation.

The Judge notes that the Complaint does not state a cause of action for deprivation of custody and visitation under Penal Code section 278.5, as it is a criminal statute that authorizes the City Attorney or District Attorney to prosecute, but does not authorize an individual to file a civil action. The Judge also finds that the Complaint sufficiently states a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and defamation.

The Judge rejects Defendant's arguments that the Complaint is barred by res judicata, that there are procedural issues with the Complaint, and that the statute of limitations has been exceeded. The Judge concludes that the Demurrer is sustained in part and overruled as to the other causes of action.
