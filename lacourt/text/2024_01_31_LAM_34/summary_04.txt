The judge is considering a petition for approval of the transfer of structured settlement payment rights from Rene Rigard (the Transferor) to J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (the Petitioner). The Petitioner has proposed a payment of $44,000 to the Transferor, which is 12.22% of the discounted present value of the future payment. The judge is concerned that the Transferor did not receive independent legal or financial advice regarding the proposed transaction and is unsure whether the transfer of payment rights is in the best interest of the payee. The judge is also concerned about the use of a 12.22% discount rate and would like to hear from the Petitioner about how it determined to use this rate. Additionally, the judge would like to see a copy of the settlement agreement to ensure that it does not violate Insurance Code section 10138, subdivision (a)(4). The judge is interested in hearing more information about the proposed transaction before making a final ruling.
