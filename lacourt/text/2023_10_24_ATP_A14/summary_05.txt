The court grants the plaintiff's petition to relieve himself from the requirement to present a claim to Southern California Regional Rail Authority (SCRRA) within the statutorily prescribed time period. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to present a claim was excusable due to the efforts of his counsel to file a claim with SCRRA, despite SCRRA's lack of clear instructions on how to file a claim. The court notes that the plaintiff's counsel was in direct contact with SCRRA's senior counsel, William Garrett, and was directed to file a claim with the Board Secretary. The court finds that SCRRA's failure to provide clear instructions on how to file a claim was a factor in the plaintiff's failure to present a claim. The court also notes that the plaintiff's counsel exercised due diligence in attempting to file a claim with SCRRA, despite the lack of clear instructions. Finally, the court grants the plaintiff's petition and orders the plaintiff's Complaint to be amended and refiled with the court within 30 days.
