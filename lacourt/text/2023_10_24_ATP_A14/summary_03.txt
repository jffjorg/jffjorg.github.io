English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses a premises liability action brought by Isabelle Hill against Best Western International, Inc. and Bains Hospitality, LLC (erroneously sued and served as Best Western Plus Desert Poppy Inn) regarding a bedbug infestation during her stay at the hotel. The ruling grants leave to amend the pleadings, sustains the demurrer in part, and denies the motion to strike in part. The Court finds that the plaintiff's claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, public nuisance, and breach of contract are deficient and must be cured through amendment. The Court also allows the claim for fraudulent concealment to proceed, finding that the allegations demonstrate a relaxed standard for fraud.
