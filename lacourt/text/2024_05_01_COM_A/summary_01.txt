```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to bifurcate the issue of workers' compensation exclusivity from the trial. The defendant, Essilor of America, Inc., argued that the issue should be bifurcated because it would promote efficiency and avoid the waste of time and money caused by the unnecessary trial of damage questions. However, the judge found that the defendant failed to proffer any evidence of its right of control over the plaintiff's employment or any admissible evidence of the degree of separateness between the defendants and the plaintiff's employer. The judge also noted that the defendant's reliance on the declaration of Richard Hughes, President of Satisloh, was insufficient because it did not establish "complete and absolute" control over Elite Optical. The judge therefore denied the defendant's motion to bifurcate the issue of workers' compensation exclusivity.
