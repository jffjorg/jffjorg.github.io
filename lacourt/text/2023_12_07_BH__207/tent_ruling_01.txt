MOTION


Garnish Wages of Debtor’s Spouse




MOVING PARTY


Plaintiff Swift Financial, LLC as servicing agent for
  WebBank




OPPOSING PARTY


(none)



 
BACKGROUND
 
On September 30, 2021, Plaintiff Swift Financial, LLC as servicing
agent for WebBank (“Plaintiff”) moved for an order to confirm a February 19,
2020 arbitration award, stemming from a March 20, 2019 contract signed by
Defendant Jeffrey Taraday (“Jeffrey”), as guarantor and on behalf of Defendant
Wellness Program Services, LLC d/b/a Trusii International (“Wellness”)
(together, “Defendants”), whereby Plaintiff loaned Wellness $100,000.  The arbitrator awarded Plaintiff
$79,405.92.  On November 22, 2021, the
Court entered judgment against Defendants in the amount of $71,944.24.  (Schlecter Decl. ¶ 3.)
 
Plaintiff now moves for an order permitting an earnings withholding
order against Ariella S. Taraday (“Ariella”), who Plaintiff contends is Judgment
debtor Jeffrey Taraday’s spouse.  The
motion is unopposed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
            Community property is subject to
attachment only if it would be subject to enforcement of the judgment obtained
in the action in which an attachment is sought. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 487.010, subd. (d).) 

 
In
support of the motion, Plaintiff has provided property records for a residence
on Huron Avenue in Culver City, indicating that Jeffrey and Ariella took title
as “Husband and Wife” on April 27, 2020. 
The property records also indicate Ariel Wienir and Jeffrey Wienir took
title to the property as wife and husband on September 27, 2014.  (Ex. A to Schlecter Decl.)
 
            Plaintiff has also provided
screenshots of social media accounts for an Ariel Shukert, who Plaintiff claims
is Ariella, Jeffrey’s wife; for a “Jeff Taraday (Wienir),” showing a man and a
woman together in the profile picture; and an announcement for the July 9, 2020
birth of a daughter.  (Ex. B to Schlecter
Decl.)
 
            The proof of service indicates that
Plaintiff served both Jeffrey and Ariella at the Huron Avenue address.
 
            Although the property records create
some inference that Jeffrey and Ariella were married when they jointly took
title to the Huron Avenue property in April 2020, the Court does not have sufficient,
competent evidence to determine that Jeffrey and Ariella were actually married,
that they were married in 2019 when Jeffrey incurred the debt in question, or
that the Ariel Shukert who works in Santa Monica is the same as Ariella Taraday.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore,
the Court lacks sufficient evidence to garnish the wages of Ariella Taraday
and/or Ariel Shukert at this time.  As
such, the Court denies without prejudice Plaintiff’s motion for an
earning withholdings order against Ariella S. Taraday/Ariel Shukert.
