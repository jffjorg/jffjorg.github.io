Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and costs because the motion was filed and noticed too close to the hearing date, violating the procedural due process requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. Additionally, the motion is not yet ripe because Plaintiff is not yet the "prevailing party" in the action, having not yet submitted a default judgment package or had judgment entered in its favor. The judge has vacated the Case Management Conference and set an Order to Show Cause re: entry of default judgment on January 22, 2024, and requires Plaintiff to file a default judgment package on or before January 8, 2024.
