And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied, without prejudice, the motion by Swift Financial, LLC to garnish the wages of Ariella S. Taraday (also known as Ariel Shukert), who is allegedly the spouse of Jeffrey Taraday, a judgment debtor. The motion was unopposed, but the court found that it lacked sufficient evidence to determine whether Jeffrey and Ariella were actually married, whether they were married in 2019 when Jeffrey incurred the debt in question, or whether Ariel Shukert is the same as Ariella Taraday. The court noted that the property records created some inference that Jeffrey and Ariella were married when they jointly took title to a residence on Huron Avenue in Culver City, but that inference was not sufficient to establish the necessary facts. The court has therefore denied the motion, but left the door open for the plaintiff to provide additional evidence in the future.
