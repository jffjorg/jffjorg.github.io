Here's a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion for summary judgment brought by Defendant Ashley Wendell, who seeks to dismiss the claims against her. The dispute arises from two agreements between Plaintiffs Stefan Wrobel and Melissa Pena and Hazel & Oak Construction, LLC (H&O) for construction services on two residential properties. Wendell is alleged to be liable as an alter ego for H&O's alleged unsatisfactory construction work. The judge finds that there are disputed issues of material fact regarding Wendell's involvement with H&O, including whether she was an agent or officer of H&O, and whether she was involved in the company's financial transactions. The judge also notes that there is evidence that Wendell may have performed work for H&O beyond her role as an interior designer. As a result, the judge denies Wendell's motion for summary judgment, finding that a trial is necessary to resolve the disputes.
