And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to compel depositions of defendant ERC Trade, LP's employees/agents, Giselle Carrasco, Nadia Bojorques, Suzanna Cervantes, and Enrique Carrasco Sr. The motion is DENIED.

The court finds that the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that these individuals are "officers, directors, managing agents, or employees" of ERC Trade, LP, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §2025.450(a). Defendant's objections have merit.

The court also finds that sanctions are not warranted against either party.
