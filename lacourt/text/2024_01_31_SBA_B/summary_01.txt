And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the City of Torrance, et al.'s Motion for Use of Peace Officer Personnel Records (Pitchess) and Motion to File Peace Officer Records Under Seal. The judge grants both motions.

The judge finds that the City has met the requirements to compel disclosure of the personnel records, which are emails related to the plaintiff's personnel file, internal affairs files, and disciplinary notices. The judge orders an in-camera review of the requested records.

The judge also grants the City's motion to seal the records, finding that the City has shown an overriding interest in protecting the peace officers' personnel records and that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored. The judge concludes that there are no less restrictive means to achieve the identified overriding interest.
