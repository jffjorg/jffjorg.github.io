**Summary of Tentative Ruling**
The judge grants the motion to set aside the preliminary injunction based on defense counsel's failure to appear at the OSC hearing due to an inadvertent calendaring error. The judge finds that the underlying hearing process was compromised and that it is in the interests of justice to set aside the preliminary injunction and allow both parties to present oral argument. The court sets an OSC hearing to allow for the court to hear and consider oral argument from both parties.
