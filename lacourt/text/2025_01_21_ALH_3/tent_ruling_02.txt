      CASE NO.: 24NNCV00528
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFENDANT/CROSS-DEFENDANT SPECIALIZED ELEVATOR SERVICES,
   LLC’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE CROSS COMPLAINT

On March 27,
 2024, Plaintiff Kevin Brandon filed this action against
Defendant Specialized Elevator Services, LLC (“SES”) arising
from a
 malfunctioning elevator. SES filed an Answer on June 5,
 2024. On June 6, 2024, co-defendants Orange Medical Partners (“Orange
Medical”) and Tiarna Real Estate (“Tiarna”) filed a cross-complaint against
SES. On December 2, 2024, SES filed this motion seeking leave
to file a cross-complaint against Orange Medical and Tiarna or equitable
indemnity, contribution, and apportionment. The motion is unopposed. 
A party who fails to file a
cross-complaint asserting any related cause of action may seek leave from the
court to do so at any time during the course of the action. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
426.30, subd. (a); 426.50.) The court, after notice to the adverse party, shall
grant, upon such terms as may be just to the parties, leave to file the
cross-complaint if the party acted in good faith. (Code Civ. Proc., § 426.50.) 
SES seeks leave to file a compulsory
cross-complaint against Orange Medical and Tiarna as the owner and managing
agent, respectively, for the premises on which the allegedly malfunctioning
elevator was located. SES alleges that Orange Medical and Tiarna had the
exclusive duty to control, maintain, and provide notice of any malfunction or
defect experienced by the elevator and caused Plaintiff’s injuries. 
SES’s proposed cross-complaint arises from
Plaintiff’s complaint and Orange Medical and Tiarna’s cross-complaint. Further,
there is no evidence that SES is not acting in good faith. Accordingly, SES’s motion
is GRANTED and SES is ordered to file its proposed cross-complaint within 5
days of the date of this Order. 
Moving party to give notice.

this 21st
day of January
