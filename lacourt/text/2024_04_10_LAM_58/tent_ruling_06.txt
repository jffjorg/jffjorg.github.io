Analysis
 
Judgment Debtor Barabra Winters’
claim of exemption asserts that certain property is exempt because it is: “Social
Security Benefits, Trust Funding, Fuel for Residence, and Private Health
Insurance” (Claim of Exemption (Claim), ¶ 4.) 
 
The evidence shows that on December
4, 2023, Bank of America issued a notice to the Los Angeles County Sheriff,
referencing the account ending in “3519,” which is the joint account of Barbara
Winters, Leonard Winters and Steven Winters; the notice states that there was
$60,000 in the “joint account”, and that the sum of $6,747 was designated as “Federal
amount protected.” 
 
Plaintiffs argue that based on Bank
of America’s determination that $6,747 of the funds are exempt, Plaintiffs may
still levy the remaining amount in the account of $60,000, leaving a balance of
$846.50 in addition to the this “Federal amount protected” of $6,747. 
 
The Claim of Exemption argues the following
property is exempt: “Social Security Benefits, Trust
Funding, Fuel For Residence, and Private Health Insurance.” (Claim, ¶ 4.) In
support, Defendant Barbara cites “CCP 704.020, CCP 704.130, CCP 704.080, 42 USC
407, FIN C 704.080” (Claim, ¶ 5.) The facts in support of Defendant Barabra’s
claim are as follows “Deposit Accounts, Checking, Mercer/Charles Schwab, Social
Security Office, MEDICAID.” (Claim, ¶ 6.) 
 
Further,
in support, Defendant Barabra attaches a statement to a Bank of America account
ending in “3519”, a 2023 Social Security Benefit 1099 in the amount of $26,988,
and a statement to a Charles Schwab account ending in “1197.” 
 
As
a preliminary matter, the burden of
proof is upon the party claiming the exemption. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.580,
subd. (b) [“At a hearing under this section, the exemption claimant has the
burden of proof”].)
 
As the opposition notes, neither the
evidence nor the citation to various statutes demonstrates that the accounts in
question are subject to any exemption. That is, Defendant Barbara fails to
trace any amount in the accounts from or to an exempt source.
 
Specifically, the joint Bank
of America account does not identify where the funds from the account came from
or how the funds in the account were used. The Social Security 1099 does not show
where these funds were deposited or if they were comingled in any specific
account. Laslty, the Charles Schwab account is in the name of the Winters
Trust, not Barbara Winters; moreover, none of the evidence shows that any
monies in account can be traced to an exempt source.

 
Conclusion
 
Based
on the foregoing, Judgment Debtor has not met her burden of showing the
exemption applies. The Claim of Exemption is denied.
