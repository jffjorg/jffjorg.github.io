The judge grants Costco Wholesale Corporation's motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Gloria Sanchez. The judge finds that the deposition was properly noticed, Plaintiff did not object, and Plaintiff did not appear. The judge also finds that Plaintiff's counsel delayed scheduling the deposition for months, which is not justified. As a result, the judge orders Plaintiff Gloria Sanchez to appear for deposition on October 1, 2024, and orders Plaintiff and her counsel to pay $690 in sanctions to Costco Wholesale Corporation.
