 Case Number:  23STCV12927    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  29 Sanchez v. Costco Wholesale Corporation
23STCV12927
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff
Tentative
The motion is granted.
The request for sanctions is granted in part.
Background
On June 6, 2023, Gloria Sanchez (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco”), Deborah
Cosca (collectively, with Costco, “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 30 for
premises liability and negligence arising out of a slip and fall occurring on
June 11, 2021.
On November 8 and 17, 2023, each of the
Defendants filed an answer.
On August 22, 2024, Costco filed this motion to compel
the deposition of Plaintiff. Plaintiff filed an opposition on September 11. No
reply has been filed, but Plaintiff’s counsel filed a “supplemental declaration”
in opposition to the motion on September 20.
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd.
(a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
Costco
seeks to compel Plaintiff’s deposition.
 
On April
15, 2024, Costco noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for May 21, 2024. (Duenas
Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. 2.) Plaintiff’s counsel did not serve an objection
but advised Costco that the deposition would not proceed on May 16. (Id.,
¶¶ 4-6.) Plaintiff did not appear, and Costco’s attempts to arrange for a new
deposition date were not successful. 
(Id., ¶¶ 7-15 & Exhs. 3-9.)  On
August 15, 2024, Costco noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for September 11.  (Id., ¶ 17 & Exh. 10.)
 
The
parties have not advised whether Plaintiff’s deposition proceeded on September
11, but the Court assumes (from the parties’ silence) that it did not.
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff’s counsel states that the scheduling of the deposition was
delayed because of a flood in counsel’s office. 
(Forstrom Decl., ¶ 4.)  The Court
understands that such an event would necessitate a reasonable postponement of
the deposition, but there is no reason why the deposition – originally scheduled
for May 16, 2024 – has not been rescheduled at some point in the past four
months.
 
In an
unauthorized supplemental declaration in opposition to the motion, filed just
two court days in advance of the hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel attaches emails
between counsel from the period of April 15 through August 2, 2024.  There is no explanation as to why these
emails were not attached to the timely opposition; accordingly, the Court
exercises its discretion to disregard this untimely and unauthorized
supplemental declaration.
 
The
evidence shows that Plaintiff’s deposition was properly noticed, Plaintiff did
not object, and Plaintiff did not appear. 
Costco contacted Plaintiff’s counsel to attempt to reschedule the
deposition, but those efforts were not successful.  The motion to compel the deposition is
granted.
 
Costco
requests monetary sanctions.  As the
motion is granted, the Court must impose sanctions “unless the court finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450(g)(1).)  A showing of
bad faith is not required, as Plaintiff appears to contend.
 
The
Court grants the request for sanctions in part. 
Plaintiff has not acted with substantial justification in delaying this
deposition for months, and the imposition of sanctions would not be
unjust.  Given the straightforward nature
of this motion, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $690, calculated
based on three hours of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable
billing rate of $210 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (Duenas Decl., ¶¶ 21-22.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
GRANTS Costco Wholesale Corporation’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition.
 
The Court
ORDERS Plaintiff Gloria Sanchez to appear for deposition on October 1, 2024 at
10 a.m. at 901 Via Piemonte, Suite 350 in Ontario, California.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Gloria
Sanchez and her counsel of record, First Law Group, APC, jointly and severally,
to pay $690 in sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to Costco Wholesale
Corporation within 30 days of notice.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
