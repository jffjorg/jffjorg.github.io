As for the English-text summary:

The Judge denies the Defendants' motion to continue trial and reopen discovery. The motion was filed on September 16, 2024, and the hearing was held on September 23, 2024. The Defendants claim that they were blindsided by the recent development that the Plaintiff had a procedure to insert a trial spinal cord stimulator device on September 5, 2024, and that they need a continuance to conduct discovery. However, the Judge finds that the Defendants had sufficient notice of the possibility or probability that the Plaintiff would need a spinal cord stimulator months before trial. The Judge concludes that the Defendants were not diligent in conducting discovery on this issue and that they did not take the deposition of any of the Plaintiff's treaters or experts. As a result, the Judge denies the motion and orders the moving party to give notice.
