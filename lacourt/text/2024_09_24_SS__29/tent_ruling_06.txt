 Case Number:  21STCV38649    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  29 Sanchez v. Ampac
Logistics LLC
21STCV38649
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Monetary, Evidentiary, and
Issue Sanctions 
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
This action arises from an alleged vehicle accident on
November 16, 2019, on the Southbound Interstate 5 Freeway in or near Valencia,
California. On October 20, 2021, Plaintiffs Fernando and Hilda Sanchez
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint asserting causes of action for
motor vehicle negligence, general negligence, and loss of consortium against
Defendant Ampac Logistics LLC and Does 1 to 100.
 On November 1, 2021,
Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Rush Truck Leasing, Inc. (“Rush”) as
Doe 1 and Ampak Logistics Inc. as Doe 2. On December 17, 2021, Plaintiff
amended the complaint to name 3Power Logistics Management (“3Power”) as Doe 3. 
On January 5, 2022, Rush filed its answer and a
cross-complaint against Ampak Logistics, Inc. On March 9, 2022, 3Power filed
its answer. 
On October 11 and 12, 2022, Ampak Logistics, LLC (erroneously
sued as Ampak Logistics, Inc. and Ampac Logistics, LLC) (“Ampak”) filed its
answer and a cross-complaint against 3Power. On November 30, 2022, 3Power filed
its answer to Ampak’s cross-complaint. 
On February 8 and 10, 2023, at the request of Plaintiffs, the
Court dismissed, with prejudice, Plaintiffs’ claims against Rush and 3Power.
On March 2, 2023, the Court granted the request
of Ampak’s counsel to be relieved as counsel.  Ampak, as a corporate
entity, cannot represent itself in pro per.  As set forth in the order
(and the proof of service of the order on Ampak), Ampak may be served, however,
through Junaid Sultan at Ampak Logistics, LLC, 4637 West 191st Street in
Torrance.
On November 6 and 7, 2023,
the Court granted the motion of Plaintiff Fernando Sanchez (“Plaintiff”) to
compel Ampak’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and
Request for Production of Documents. (Quiroga Decl., ¶ 6.)  (The discovery
requests, and the motions to compel, were all served while Ampak was still
represented by prior counsel.) 
Moving party was ordered to
give notice.  On November 13, 2023, Plaintiff gave notice by email; notice
to Ampak was given to its former counsel, who had been relieved months earlier.
On January 26, 2024, Plaintiff Fernando Sanchez filed a motion
for terminating sanctions; the motion was denied on February 27, 2024, as Ampak
never received proper notice of the orders granting the motions to compel.
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff Fernando Sanchez filed a second
motion for terminating, issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions against
Ampak. This motion was taken off-calendar at the hearing on April 17, 2024.
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a revised notice of the Court’s
rulings on November 6 and 7, 2023. 
Notice was given to Ampak by mail and email.
On the same day, May 13, Plaintiff Fernando Sanchez filed a
third motion for terminating sanctions. The motion was denied on the merits on June
10, 2024.
On August 27, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this motion for monetary,
evidentiary, and issue sanctions against Ampak. 
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling answers to
interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to,
that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling responses to
requests for production, “the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in
addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.030 provides
for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions for any “misuse of the
discovery process,” “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  A “misuse of
the discovery process” is defined to include (among other things) failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide
discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without
substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).) 
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery
Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v. Super. Ct. (1995)
40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction should not create a “windfall”
for a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if
the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court’s
orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023),
¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
Discussion
Service
of this motion is not timely and proper.
 
Plaintiffs
filed this motion on August 27, 2024, and served Ampak by email and mail.
 
The email
service is not proper.  Ampak is not
represented by counsel, and there is no indication that Ampak has consented to
electronic service.
 
The mail
service is proper but not timely.  A motion
must be served 16 court days prior to the hearing if the motion is personally
served, or five additional calendar days earlier if the motion is served by
mail.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b).)  For a hearing on September
24, 2024, the deadline for personal service was on August 30, and the deadline
for mail service was five days earlier, or August 25. 2024.  The motion was served on August 27, 2024.
 
Therefore,
the motion is DENIED without prejudice based on untimely service.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion for sanctions is DENIED. 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
