Background
On May 22, 2019, Vahe Menachkanian and
Margyet Manaserian (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Simon
M. Keushkerian, M.D. (“Keushkerian”), Faisal A. Khan, M.D. (“Khan”), Glendale
Adventist Medical Center (“GAMC”), and Does 1 through 20 for professional
negligence and loss of consortium arising out of a surgical procedure that
occurred on May 25, 2018.
Keushkerian, Khan, and GAMC filed their
answers on October 8 and 11, 2019.  
In or about July 2020, Plaintiffs settled
with Khan.
The case has proceeded against Keushkerian
and GAMC.  Although the parties in a
mediation at Judicate West in May 2023 and appeared to have reached a
settlement, and each of the remaining defendants filed a motion to enforce the
settlement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, the Court denied
the motions by Minute Order dated May 1, 2024.
In the interim, on January 4, 2024, counsel
for Plaintiffs was relieved as counsel. 
Since that date, Plaintiffs have been representing themselves, in pro
per.
The case is now set for trial on October 16,
2024.
Between August 26 and 28, 2024, a total of no
less than fourteen discovery motions were filed by defendants.  These motions are set for hearing on various
dates between September 24 and 30.  
Before the Court and set for hearing on
September 24, 2024, are three motions filed on August 28, 2024, by Defendant
Keushkerian (“Defendant”): (1) a motion to compel Plaintiff Menachkanian (“Plaintiff”)
to respond to interrogatories; (2) a motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to
requests for production; and (3) a motion for an order deeming Plaintiff to
have admitted the truth of the matters specified in requests for admission.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal
Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for
admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff to
respond to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for
production. 
Defendant also moves for an order deeming
Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in requests for
admission.
Defendant served Plaintiff with the form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for production, and requests
for admission on July 17, 2024. (Kaiser Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff has not responded. (Id., ¶ 6.)
Defendant need not show anything more.
The motions are granted, except as set forth
below.
In Defendant’s motion to compel responses to
the requests for production of documents, Defendant also requests an order that
Plaintiff produce responsive documents within ten days.  That request is denied without prejudice.  
The Civil Discovery Act authorizes three separate
types of motions with regard to requests for production: (1) a motion for an
order compelling an initial response (when no response has been received) under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300; (2) a motion for an order compelling
a further response (when a response has been received but the propounding party
contends it is inadequate) under section 2031.310; and (3) a motion to compel
production (when a party has stated that it will comply with one or more requests
but has failed to do so) under section 2031.320.  This motion is brought under section
2031.300, and the only order that is authorized is an order compelling the
responding party to provide a written response to the requests for production.
Turning to sanctions, the requests are
granted in part and denied in part.
On the motions to compel responses to
interrogatories and requests for production, the Civil Discovery Act authorizes
the imposition of sanctions against “any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes”
the motion to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (c) & 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Here,
Plaintiff has not opposed the motion, and so no sanctions are authorized.  Those requests are denied.
On the motion for a
deemed-admitted order, however, the Civil Discovery Act requires that sanctions
be imposed “on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  Plaintiff’s failure to serve a timely
response necessitated this motion, and so the request is granted.
In light of the straightforward
nature of a motion for a deemed-admitted order, the Court sets sanctions in the
amount of $397.50, based on one and half hours of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s
reasonable billing rate of $225 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee. (See Kaiser
Decl., ¶ 7.)
Finally, the Court notes that,
with regard to the two sets of interrogatories, Defendant has filed a single
motion for what should have been two separate motions.  Combining discovery motions allows
the moving party to avoid paying the requisite filing fees. Filing fees are
jurisdictional and it is mandatory for court clerks to demand and receive them.
(See Duran v. St. Luke’s Hospital (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 457, 460.)
Thus, Defendant is ordered to pay to the Clerk of the Court an additional
filing fee of $60.  As to the motion to
compel responses to the interrogatories, this ruling will be final only upon filing
and service of proof of payment of the filing fee.
