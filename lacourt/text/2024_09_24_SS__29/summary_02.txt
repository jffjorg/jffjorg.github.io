And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to reopen discovery, which was filed on August 28, 2024. The defendant argued that they needed to reopen discovery because the plaintiff served amended discovery responses on May 15, 2024, which disclosed a new witness and included records showing ongoing medical care. The judge concluded that the defendant did not make a sufficient showing of good cause to reopen discovery and that the motion was not made in good faith. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the defendant acted with substantial justification. The trial is currently scheduled for October 18, 2024.
