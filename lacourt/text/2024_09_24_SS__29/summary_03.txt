The court has reviewed the petitions filed by Eliza De La Cruz and Izael De La Cruz on August 20, 2024, seeking approval of their minor compromises. The court finds the settlements and proposed fees to be fair and reasonable, and all necessary procedures have been followed. As a result, the court grants the petitions to approve the minor compromises. The court also sets an OSC hearing for proof of deposit into a blocked account for a date to be determined. The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call instead.
