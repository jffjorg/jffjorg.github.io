Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing on the motion for summary judgment filed by 940 Figueroa, LLC, which was scheduled for September 24, 2024. The motion was filed by Figueroa, seeking summary judgment, and was opposed by the plaintiff, Jeconiah Ethridge.

The case involves a dispute over whether Figueroa, as the owner of a property, has a duty to maintain a sidewalk in front of its property that was allegedly defective and caused the plaintiff's injury. Figueroa argues that it did not own, lease, occupy, or control the sidewalk, and therefore did not owe a duty to the plaintiff.

The judge has reviewed the evidence submitted by both parties and has found that the requirements for a statutory continuance under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h), are satisfied. The judge has granted a continuance to allow the plaintiff to schedule and take the deposition of a critical witness, Val Muraoka, who is a director of asset management for Robhana Management, Inc., Figueroa's authorized agent.

The judge has ordered that the hearing be continued to a date available for the court in December 2024 or January 2025, and that the parties may file supplemental or amended oppositions and replies, as necessary, prior to the new hearing date.
