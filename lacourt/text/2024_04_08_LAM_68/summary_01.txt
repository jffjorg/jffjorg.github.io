```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to quash service of the summons and complaint filed by Caesarstone LTD on the grounds of lack of general or specific jurisdiction. The judge finds that Caesarstone LTD made a general appearance in the action on January 16, 2024, and therefore waived its right to bring a motion to quash on grounds of general or specific jurisdiction. The judge also denies the motion to withdraw the notice of appearance filed by Caesarstone LTD, finding that the appearance was not entered in error and that the client was aware of the prior lawsuits and only allegedly clarified the scope of permission for counsel after the deadline lapsed. The judge concludes that the delays were the result of client decision making, not excusable mistake by counsel. The court sets the case management conference and two OSCs re: sanctions for April 15, 2024.
