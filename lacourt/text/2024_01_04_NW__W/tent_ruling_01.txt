BACKGROUND
 
On January 29, 2021, Plaintiff Lewitt,
Hackman, Shapiro, Marshall, & Harlan filed a complaint against Defendants
Jill Dailey and TDM Franchise Company, LLC for breach of contract, Open Book
Account and Account Stated. Plaintiff and Defendants entered into a written
agreement whereby Plaintiff agreed to represent Defendants and Defendants
agreed to pay Plaintiff's fees and costs for such services. Plaintiff alleges
Defendants, however, breached the agreement on March 29, 2019 when Defendants ceased
payment to Plaintiff for legal services performed and costs incurred. 
 
Default was entered against TDM
Franchise Company, LLC on August 2, 2023. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff Lewitt, Hackman, Shapiro,
Marshall, & Harlan, a Law Corp.’s Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs is
GRANTED. 
 
discussion
 
Plaintiff Lewitt, Hackman, Shapiro, Marshall, & Harlan move
the court for an order awarding attorney fees to Plaintiff as prevailing party.
Plaintiff seeks $1,200.00 in attorney fees. 
 
Parties to litigation must generally bear their own attorney’s
fees, unless they otherwise agree. (CCP § 1021.) In contract actions based on a
book account when fees are not otherwise specified, the prevailing party is
entitled to reasonable fees. (Civil Code §1717.5.) This section is limited
by subsection (b) which states: “The attorney’s fees allowed pursuant to this
section shall be the lesser of either the maximum amount allowed by this
section, the amount provided by any default attorney’s fee schedule adopted by
the court applicable to the suit, or an amount as otherwise provided by the
court.” (Cal. Civ. Code § 1717.5(b).)  
 
Plaintiff requests $1,200 for attorney’s fees and $2,875.86 in
costs. On November 20, 2023, the court found in favor of Plaintiff. (See
11/20/23 Minute Order.) Plaintiff’s claims were for Defendants failure to make
payments pursuant to a written agreement for Plaintiff’s legal services.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claims fall within Civil Code section 1717.5. 
 
Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion for Attorney fees is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s
unopposed Memorandum of Costs is GRANTED less the attorney fees listed
in section 10.  
 
The court will sign the proposed judgment.
