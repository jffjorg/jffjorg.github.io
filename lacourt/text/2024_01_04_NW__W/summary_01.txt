The judge is granting the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and costs, as the plaintiff was the prevailing party in the case. The plaintiff is seeking $1,200 in attorney fees and $2,875.86 in costs. The court has found in favor of the plaintiff, as the defendants failed to make payments to the plaintiff for legal services performed and costs incurred. The plaintiff's claims fall under Civil Code section 1717.5, which allows the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorney fees. The court will sign the proposed judgment.
