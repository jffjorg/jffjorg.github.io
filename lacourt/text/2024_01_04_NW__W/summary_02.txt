Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted in part the motion of the plaintiffs, Jonathan Davis and Kimberly Davis, to compel further responses to certain special interrogatories from the defendants, Crown Media Holdings, Inc. and Hallmark Cards, Inc. The court has limited the scope of the special interrogatories to the relevant time period and facts alleged in the complaint. The court has also denied the request for sanctions, finding that both parties acted with substantial justification.

The motion was brought in response to the defendants' failures to provide adequate responses to the special interrogatories, which seek information about the defendants' managing agents, officers, and directors. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants' responses were evasive and incomplete, and that the defendants have imposed arbitrary and restrictive conditions on the discovery process.

The court has also granted the plaintiffs' request for judicial notice of certain documents and court records, and has denied the defendants' request for judicial notice of certain online documents.

The court has ordered the defendants to provide further responses to the special interrogatories, and has denied the request for sanctions.
