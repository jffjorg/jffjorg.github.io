And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Plaintiff Ashley Ryan is awarded $9,143.50 in attorney fees, but does not award costs because Plaintiff did not submit a verified memorandum of costs and Defendant's opposition objects to Plaintiff's claimed costs. The judge also denied Plaintiff's motion to determine that trade-in value should not be treated as an offset, finding that the trade-in value should be deducted from Plaintiff's damages award. The judge's decision is based on the requirement in California Civil Code section 1793.2 that a manufacturer "make restitution in an amount equal to the actual price paid or payable by the buyer," which does not include amounts already recovered by the buyer through trade-in. The judge also found that the concerns over a "windfall" are misplaced, and that the Court's decision is consistent with the Niedermeier Court's analysis.
