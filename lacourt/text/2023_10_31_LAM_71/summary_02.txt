The judge grants the plaintiff's unopposed motion to seal certain documents supporting the defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The plaintiff seeks to seal documents containing confidential business information and private financial and personal information to protect its competition and prevent harm to its business operations. The judge finds that the right of public access to the records is overcome by the overriding interest in protecting the confidentiality of the plaintiff's business information and private financial and personal information. The judge orders the sealing of specific documents and requires the plaintiff to provide proposed redacted versions of the documents before the court's ruling can be effectuated.
