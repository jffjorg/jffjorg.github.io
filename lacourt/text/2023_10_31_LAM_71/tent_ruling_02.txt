motion to seal Defendants Jon Gimbel’s, Anthony Guagliano’s, and Gallant
Capital Partners, LLC’s Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary Judgment or, in
the Alternative, Summary Adjudication is granted. 
Plaintiffs are to promptly confer with this Court’s judicial
assistant in order to provide proposed redacted versions for the documents
noted below before this Court’s ruling can be effectuated.
          
Plaintiffs The Gores Group, LLC (“TGG”) and AEG Holdings, LLC (“AEGH”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) move unopposed for an order sealing several exhibits
supporting Defendants Jon Gimbel’s (“Gimbel”), Anthony Guagliano’s
(“Guagliano”), and Gallant Capital Partners, LLC’s (“GCP”) (collectively,
“Defendants”) motion for summary judgment, or, in the alternative, summary
adjudication.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2;
CRC, Rules 2.550, 2.551.)  Specifically,
Plaintiffs request the Court seal the following documents: (1) portions of Exhs.
1-3, 11, 12, 14-16, 20, and 28 to the Declaration of Sheehan; (2) Exh. 6 to the
Declaration of Sheehan in its entirety; (3) portions of Defendants’ motion for
summary judgment that refer to or quote from the aforementioned exhibits; and
(4) portions of Defendants’ separate statement of undisputed material facts in support
of Defendants’ motion for summary judgment that refer to or quote from the
aforementioned exhibits (collectively, “Lodged Documents”).  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)  Plaintiffs offer proposed redactions for the
public file. 
 
Background
Plaintiffs allege four
causes of action against Defendants arising from Plaintiffs’ alleged agreement
to support Defendant GCP, and Defendants allegedly reneging on the agreement
and refusing to provide Plaintiffs the consideration they promised in exchange
for Plaintiffs’ support.  (See Second
Amended Complaint (“SAC”).)  On
December 9, 2022, Defendants filed their motion for summary judgment, or in the
alternative, motion for summary adjudication, concurrently filed with their
separate statement of undisputed materials facts in support of their motion,
the Declaration of Sheehan, and Defendants’ compendium of evidence
(“D-COE”).  
On June 13, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed the instant motion.  On June 12,
2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of non-opposition.  On July 6, 2023, Plaintiffs dismissed the
instant action.  As of the date of this
hearing, Defendants have not filed an opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion.
 
Legal Standard
CRC Rule 2.551(a) provides, as follows: “A record must not be
filed under seal without a court order. The court must not permit a record to
be filed under seal based solely on the agreement or stipulation of the
parties.”
CRC Rule 2.551(b)(1) provides, as follows: “A party requesting
that a record be filed under seal must file a motion or an application for an
order sealing the record. The motion or application must be accompanied by a
memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the
sealing.”
CRC Rule 2.550(d) provides, as follows: “The court may order that
a record be filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish:
(1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public
access to the record; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record;
(3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding
interest.”  
CRC Rule 2.550(e) provides: “An order sealing the record must: 
(A) Specifically state the facts that support the findings; and (B)
Direct the sealing of only those documents and pages, or, if reasonably
practicable, portions of those documents and pages, that contain the material
that needs to be placed under seal. All other portions of each document or page
must be included in the public file.”
California
courts ordinarily grant requests to seal information “involv[ing] confidential
matters relating to . . . business operations,” particularly where “public
revelation of these matters would interfere with its ability to effectively
compete in the marketplace.”  (Universal
City Studios, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1286; see
also Huffy Corp. v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 97, 108 [“[D]ocuments
which are not trade secrets may nonetheless be subject to sealing in the face
of a proper . . . showing of prejudice to an overriding interest.”], citation
omitted.)
 
Motion to Seal
Plaintiffs move to seal on grounds that the right of public access
to the documents attached to the Declaration of Sheehan in support of
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is overcome by the overriding interest
in protecting the confidentiality of Plaintiffs’ competition business
information as well as the private financial and personal information of
non-party Alec Gores and Plaintiff TGG’s employees.  (Motion, pg. 5.)  Plaintiffs argue a substantial probability
exists that their overriding interests and those of non-Party Alec Gores will
be prejudiced if the records are not sealed because the relevant documents would
provide Plaintiffs’ competitors with detailed, commercially sensitive
information concerning Plaintiffs’ business operations in raising private
equity funds and making investments, including the detailed performance metrics
for Plaintiffs’ investments, Plaintiffs’ confidential investor lists, and the
proprietary structure and ownership of Plaintiffs and related entities.  (Decl. of Pollard ¶¶4-5; Decl. of Harris ¶4.)  Plaintiffs argue competitors could use this
information regarding Plaintiffs’ proprietary, strategic business decisions to
undercut Plaintiffs on prospective deals and improve their own methods in the
marketplace.  (Decl. of Pollard ¶¶4-5;
Decl. of Harris ¶4.)  Further, non-party Alec
Gores would be prejudiced by the disclosure of his financial and personal
information because it would violate his right to privacy.  (Decl. of Pollard ¶6; Decl. of Harris ¶4.)  Plaintiffs argue there is no less restrictive
means to achieve the overriding interest and the redactions are narrowly
tailored to include only Plaintiffs’ confidential and commercially sensitive
business information, as well as non-party Alec Gores’ private financial and
personal information and certain non-party TGG employees’ private personal
information.  (Motion, pg. 11.)  Defendants do not oppose Plaintiffs’ motion
to seal the records.  After reviewing
Plaintiffs’ proposed redactions, the Court agrees.
Exhibit 1 at pages TGG_00003962-00003964 contains Plaintiff TGG’s proprietary
investment track record and a list of investors in TGG’s private equity funds.
Exhibit 2 at pages 14:2-3; 28:3, 5; 40:1-41:25; 66:1-25; 118:2-24;

personal living situation, phone number, financial information, investment
entities, and investment amounts raised; Plaintiffs’ employment structure,
including the number of individuals who are employed by Plaintiffs and report
to Alec Gores; the performance of Plaintiffs’ funds; and Plaintiffs’ and Alec
Gores’ deal compensation.  Exhibit 3 at pages

211:4-213:21; and 282:3-7, 18-19 contain proprietary information related to Alec
Gores’ private financial information and investments and Plaintiffs’ business
operations, including marketing, investment, and fundraising activity, and the formation,
ownership, purpose, structure, and assets of Plaintiffs’ investment entities.  Exhibit 6, in its entirety, contains
Plaintiff TGG’s investment track record, which reflects Plaintiff TGG’s trade
secrets, including proprietary information regarding Plaintiff TGG’s business
operations and proprietary strategy.  Exhibit 7 contains a TGG employee’s private
cell phone number protected by an individual’s constitutional right to privacy.  Exhibit 8 contains a TGG employee’s private
cell phone number protected by an individual’s constitutional right to privacy.
Exhibit 11 at pages 45:20-23 and 152:19-24 contains proprietary information
related to the ownership and structure of Plaintiffs’ investment entities, as
well as Plaintiff TGG’s employee compensation. 
Exhibit 14, only at the cell phone number listed, contains Plaintiff
TGG’s employee’s private cell phone number protected by an individual’s constitutional
right to privacy.  Exhibit 15, only at
the cell phone number listed, contains Plaintiff TGG’s employee’s private cell
phone number protected by an individual’s constitutional right to privacy.  Exhibit 16, only at the cell phone number
listed, contains Plaintiff TGG’s employee’s private cell phone number protected
by an individual’s constitutional right to privacy.  Exhibit 20, only at the cell phone number
listed, contains Plaintiff TGG’s employee’s private cell phone number protected
by an individual’s constitutional right to privacy.  Exhibit 28, only at the cell phone number
listed, contains Plaintiff TGG’s employee’s private cell phone number protected
by an individual’s constitutional right to privacy.
          Defendants’ summary
judgment motion at pages 3:22-23 and 18:5-7 contains proprietary information
related to Plaintiffs’ investment fund performance and deal compensation.
Defendants’ separate statement of undisputed material facts at
pages 11:6-8 and 13:5-8 contains proprietary information related to Plaintiffs’
deal compensation.
Plaintiffs sufficiently demonstrated that the information
contained in the exhibits amounts to confidential information such that there
exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of the public access to
the records, the overriding interest supports sealing the record, a substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed, and Plaintiffs’ proposed redactions are the least
restrictive way of protecting the interests of third-parties to this
litigation.  
However, Plaintiffs failed to submit proposed redactions for the
documents to be sealed in their entirety and are ordered to do so before this
Court may enter this order.
Accordingly, the Court orders the following:
