Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED.

Background
This lawsuit arises out of a dispute between a homeowner’s
association and its former board president, Ronald M. Beilke.    
On March 19, 2024, Mr. Beilke (“Plaintiff”) filed suit
against Defendants The Villages at Heritage Springs Homeowners Association,
John Park, Maribel Diaz, Wil Sung, Desmond Blackburn, and Son Nguyen (collectively
“Defendants”) for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Declaratory Relief, Preliminary and
Permanent Injunction, and Temporary Restraining Order.
Defendants have levied an assessment totaling $195,351.34 ($192,201.34
in misappropriated funds and $3,150 in attorney fees) against Plaintiff based
on alleged misappropriation of funds from 2017-2019. Plaintiff contends the
assessment lacks proper authorization and is a violation of California law. 
On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff applied ex parte for a
temporary restraining order to stop Defendants from selling, trying to sell,
causing to be sold, encumbering, or causing to be encumbered Plaintiff’s real
property located at 12353 Heritage Springs, Santa Fe Springs, California 90670.  The matter was continued to today’s date for
a hearing.

Legal
Standard 
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure, section 527, subdivision (a), “[a] preliminary
injunction may be granted at any time before judgment upon a verified
complaint, or upon affidavits if the complaint in the one case, or the
affidavits in the other, show satisfactorily that sufficient grounds exist
therefor.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 527, subd. (a).)¿ “The purpose of a preliminary
injunction is to preserve the status quo pending final resolution upon a
trial.”¿ (Grothe¿v. Cortlandt Corp.¿(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313,
1316.)¿¿¿The status quo has been
defined to mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded
the pending controversy. (14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp.
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.) Preliminary injunctive relief requires the
use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds
for relief. (See, e.g.,¿ReadyLink¿Healthcare v. Cotton (2005) 126
Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016;¿Ancora-Citronelle Corp. v. Green (1974) 41
Cal.App.3d 146, 150.)¿ 
 
The
trial court considers two factors in determining whether to issue a preliminary
injunction: (1) the likelihood the plaintiff will prevail on the merits of its
case at trial, and (2) the interim harm the plaintiff is likely to sustain if
the injunction is denied as compared to the harm the defendant is likely to
suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
526(a);¿Husain v. McDonald’s Corp.¿(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 860,
866-67.)  The balancing of harm between the parties “involves
consideration of such things as the inadequacy of other remedies, the degree of
irreparable harm, and the necessity of preserving the status quo.” (Husain,
supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at p. 867.)¿  
 
“The
decision to grant a preliminary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the
trial court ... before the trial court can exercise its discretion the
applicant must make¿a prima facie¿showing of entitlement to injunctive relief.¿
The applicant must demonstrate a real threat of immediate and irreparable
injury.”¿ (Triple A Machine Shop, Inc. v. State of Cal.¿(1989) 213
Cal.App.3d 131, 138.)¿¿“[A]n injunction is an unusual or extraordinary
equitable remedy which will not be granted if the remedy at law (usually
damages) will adequately compensate the injured plaintiff,” and the party
seeking injunctive relief bears the burden to prove its absence.¿ (Department
of Fish & Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist. (1992)¿8
Cal.App.4th 1554, 1564-1565.)¿¿¿ 
 
1.           
PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS
ON THE MERITS 
 
A
preliminary injunction may not issue unless it is “reasonably probable that the
moving party will prevail on the merits.  (San Francisco Newspaper
Printing Co., Inc. v. Superior Court (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 438, 442; see Costa
Mesa City Employees’ Association v. City of Costa Mesa (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 298, 309 [no injunction may issue unless there is at least “some
possibility” of success].)   
 
Here, Plaintiff brings causes of action for Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, Declaratory Relief, Preliminary and Permanent Injunction, and
Temporary Restraining Order. Plaintiff contends he will likely prevail at trial
on claims asserted. 
Plaintiff contends his HOA board expenditures should be
deemed justified as a matter of law as they were made in good faith. Plaintiff
further argues all expenditures were approved by the HOA board and made to
benefit the members of the community. The Board approved the expenses,
including charges for community events, supplies and maintenance, meals for
meetings, and travel for board business, and other community related and
incurred community maintenance related expenses, with all documented charges in
the years 2017-2019 being unanimously approved by the HOA Board. (Beilkie
Decl.pgs. 3, 7, 8, 9).
Plaintiff further maintains that the Special Assessment is
not authorized in the CCRs, as they do not adhere to the procedural
requirements. Plaintiff argues this Court should disapprove of the new Board
for utilizing summary proceedings not intended to replace a civil tort matter,
where the accused would be entitled to a jury trial. Plaintiff argues the
proceeding allowed the Board to act as judge and jury, potentially finding a
member liable for significant sums of money without any legitimate and proper proof,
thereby violating due process protections.
Lastly, Plaintiff argues that the HOA’s assessment without
notice and opportunity to be heard violates the common law right to a fair
procedure. 
In opposition, Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s has no
probability of prevailing on the merits. Defendants argue that Plaintiff was a
fiduciary board member to the Association and his transactions were not voted
on in Board meetings, and he submits zero corporate records supporting these
problematic transactions. (Park Dec., Para. 11-12 and Ex. 6.) Defendants
contend that after hiring a CPA to go through the records, it was discovered
that Plaintiff misappropriated Association assessment money totaling $192,201.34
from September 2017 to December 31, 2020. (See Park Dec., Para. 13).
In reply, Plaintiff contends that the audit is not
substantial evidence of the alleged theft. The purpose of this audit was
crystal clear: to assess internal controls over financial reporting and
compliance matters. (See Exhibit 1 to Park’s Declaration, Page 1.)
CA Corp § 309(a) protects individual directors from
liability when acting in “good faith… as an ordinarily prudent person in a like
position would use under similar circumstances.” The section further outlines
that a director acting in good faith shall have no liability based upon any alleged failure to discharge the
person's obligations as a director. (CA Corp § 309(c).) 
A homeowners
association seeking to enforce CC&R's to compel an act by a member owner
must “show that it has followed its own standards and procedures prior to
pursuing such a remedy, that those procedures were fair and reasonable and that
its substantive decision was made in good faith, and is reasonable, not
arbitrary or capricious.” (Lamden v. La Jolla Shores
Clubdominium Homeowners Assn. (1999)
21 Cal.4th 249, 266.)
 
The relevant portion of the CCR states: “Special assessment
shall mean… a charge against a particular Owner directly attributable to, or
reimbursable by, the Owner, equal to the cost incurred by the Master
Association for corrective action performed pursuant to the provisions of this
Master Declaration, or a reasonable fine or penalty assessed by the Board, plus
interest and other charges on such Special Assessments as provided for in this
Master Declaration. Special Assessments shall not include any late payment
penalties, interest charges or costs (including attorneys’ fees) incurred
by the Master Association in the collection of Annual, Capital Improvement, if
any, and Reconstruction Assessments.” (Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. A, 1.7
p. 3.) 
Thus, the attorneys’ fees associated with the alleged
misappropriation shall not be included. 
Further under the CCR owners “shall have an opportunity to
be heard in person, or by counsel at the Owner’s expense.” (Request for
Judicial Notice, Ex. A, 1.50 p. 11.) 
Here, it is unrefuted that Plaintiff was not given the
opportunity to be heard in person prior to the special assessment being
rendered against Plaintiff. 
Accordingly,
in light of the competent evidence presented by the parties, the Court
concludes that Plaintiffs have demonstrated a reasonable probability that
Plaintiffs will succeed on their claim at trial. 
2.           
IMMEDIATE AND
IRREPARABLE HARM 
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 526, an injunction may be granted “[w]hen it
appears by the complaint or affidavits that the commission or continuance of
some act during the litigation would produce waste, or great or irreparable
injury, to a party to the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 526, subd.
(a)(2).)  The threat of irreparable harm must be imminent as opposed to a
mere possibility of harm sometime in the future.  “An injunction cannot
issue in a vacuum based on the proponents’ fears about something that may
happen in the future.  It must be supported by actual evidence that there
is a realistic prospect that the party enjoined intends to engage in the
prohibited activity.”  (Korean Philadelphia Presbyterian Church v.
California Presbytery (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1069, 1084.)  Plaintiffs
need not wait until they have suffered actual harm before applying for an
injunction, however, they may seek injunctive relief against threatened
infringement of their rights.  (Maria P. v. Riles (1987) 43 Cal.3d
1281, 1292.)
 
Here, Plaintiff contends that he and his wife will suffer
irreparable harm if they are foreclosed upon and evicted from their home.
(Decl. Beilke, ¶ 26.) He further states that losing his residence would disrupt
his social network, uproot his family, and subject him to the uncertainty of
finding alternative housing in a competitive market. (Decl. Beilke, ¶ 26.)
In opposition, Defendants state there is no irreparable
harm. Defendants state Plaintiff may pay under protest and cancel the
foreclosure sale at any time.
The Court finds that Defendant would face irreparable harm.

Bond Requirement 
Plaintiff contends that he should not have to post a bond,
given that his wife is currently undergoing cancer treatments placing a
financial burden on the family. 
In opposition, Defendant argues that The Association’s
Notice of Sale identifies amounts owed to the Association for $231,759.55 and
given the mandatory bond obligation, the damages to protect the Association
from being wrongfully enjoined is $231,759.55. (Request for Judicial Notice,
Ex. C). Defendant contends amount less than this would be inadequate to protect
the Association against the possibility that Plaintiff Beilke will not be able
to prevail on a wrongful foreclosure action at trial.
Section
529, subdivision (a), requires that the amount of the undertaking be sufficient
to “pay to the party enjoined such damages ... as the party may sustain by
reason of the injunction, if the court finally decides that the applicant was
not entitled to the injunction.” (Abba Rubber Co. v. Seaquist (1991)
235 Cal.App.3d 1, 14.)
Here,
the Court finds that the requested bond of $231,759.55 is
unreasonable given Defendants’ allegations that the amount in misappropriated
funds amounts to $195,351.34 and attorneys’ fees cannot be included in a
special assessment. (See CCR Section 1.7.) 
Accordingly, Plaintiff is to post a bond of $192,201.34, the alleged
amount in misappropriated funds.
