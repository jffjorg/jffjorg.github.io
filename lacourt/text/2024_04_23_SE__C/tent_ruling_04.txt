 Case Number:  22NWCV00320    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  C The Pacific Southwest District of the Lutheran  Church-Missouri Synod vs Irene Jensen, et al Case No.: 22NWCV00320 Hearing Date: April 23, 2024 @ 9:30 AM    #3  Tentative Ruling  Plaintiff Pacific Southwest District of the  Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special  Interrogatories, Set Three, is GRANTED as to Nos. 9-11, 14-22, and 26-29, and DENIED  as to Nos. 12-13, 23-25.  Responses are  due in 30 days.     Plaintiff to give notice.    Background  This is a quiet title action filed by Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant  The Pacific Southwest District of the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod  ("Plaintiff") seeking to determine the ownership of church property used  by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Peace Lutheran Church, Inc., of South Gate,  California ("Defendant"). Plaintiff contends that it now owns the  property pursuant to Defendant’s constitution because Defendant’s congregation  no longer exists. Defendant and Chastity Carvel filed Cross-Complaints alleging  that Plaintiff’s lawsuit is improper. Plaintiff moves to Compel Further Responses to Special  Interrogatories, Set Three, numbers 9-29.  On December 8, 2023, Plaintiff served Special  Interrogatories, Set 3. (Leverone Decl., Ex. A) On January 8, 2024, Defendant  served responses. (Leverone Decl., Ex. B.) Plaintiff contends the responses are  insufficient and contain meritless objections. Meet and Confer Requirement  A  motion¿to compel further responses to requests for production “shall be  accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §  2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and  good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the  motion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿     The Court finds that Plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and  confer requirement. Separate Statement  A motion to compel further  responses requires a separate statement.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1345(a).) Plaintiff properly filed separate statements. Legal Standard  A  party may make a demand for production of documents  and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after  the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand  is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b);  Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents  is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting  requirements in Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.030.   The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to  respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed  to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.060, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.060, subd.  (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.070, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070,  subd. (a) - (b).)    If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or  interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to  exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and  waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for  work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.290, subd. (a).)     Discussion  At issue are Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set  Three, Nos. 9-29, which seek contact information of persons alleged to be  Defendant’s current members and current and former officers.  As to each request, the Court rules on  Defendant’s objections as follows:  California  Consumer Privacy Act  Defendant objects under the California Consumer Privacy Act  of 2018.  The Act pertains to businesses  that collect a consumer’s personal information. (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798, subd.  (a).) As such, the Act does not apply to Defendant.  Moreover, the Act does not restrict the  ability of a business to “exercise or defend legal claims.” (Cal. Civ. Code §  1798.145(a)(1)(A).) The objection is OVERRULED.    California Corporations Code §§ 9511-9512 Defendant cites California Corporations Code §§ 9511-9512; however, these sections pertain to  a nonprofit religious corporation’s responsibility to its members, not to the  obligation to comply with court orders.   The objection is OVERRULED.  General Privacy  Defendant objects under the  First and Fourteenth Amendments, but Defendant cites no authority which applies  to the facts or circumstances of this case.   The objection is OVERRULED.   Special Interrogatories, Set Three, Nos. 9-11  and 14-22 These special interrogatories request contact information  for people identified by Chastity Carvel as present members of Peace Lutheran  Church. (Carvel Decl., ¶ 11, in Support of Opposition to Plaintiff’s Special  Motion to Strike.) By introducing these potential witnesses into the lawsuit,  Ms. Carvel has exposed them to potential questioning by Plaintiff.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED as to  Nos. 9-11 and 14-22.  Special Interrogatories, Set Three, Nos. 12-13,  23-25 These special interrogatories request contact information  for Heriberto Alarcon, Jr., Heriberto Alarcon, Sr., Theodore Bates, Staria  Carranza, and Starla Carranza.  The  deposition of Heriberto Alarcon, Sr. has already taken place. Defendant asserts  Heriberto Alarcon, Jr. is unknown to it and therefore it cannot provide further  information. (Mot., Separate Statement, pg. 36.) Plaintiff fails to demonstrate  good cause for obtaining the contact information for the remaining  individuals.   Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED as to Nos.  12-13 and 23-25.  Special Interrogatories, Set Three, Nos. 26-29 These special interrogatories request contact information  for Defendant’s current and former officers.   In addition to the objections already discussed, Defendant argues that Plaintiff  may look at the California Secretary of State filings of officers of the  corporation, which are public records located on the California Secretary of  State website and informational service. (Mot., Separate Statement, p. 187.)  However, this does not excuse Defendant from responding  with either valid objections or the information sought by Plaintiff.   Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED as to Nos.  12-13 and 23-25. Sanctions The court shall impose a monetary sanction against the  party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses  to interrogatories or demand for production of documents unless the party  subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or the sanction  would otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d),  2031.310, subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).)  Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amount of $2,580.00.  Given the mixed ruling, the Court declines to  impose sanctions.    The Pacific Southwest District of the Lutheran Church-Missouri
