Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff George Garibay’s Motion to Set Aside
Dismissal is CONTINUED to April 30, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  Plaintiff is ordered to file and serve an
amended complaint before that date.  
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background
This is an unlawful detainer action. In a Complaint filed
on September 25, 2023, Plaintiff Geroge Garibay alleges that Defendant Maria
Chavez has not paid rent since August of 2022. 
On January 10, 2024, the case was called for non-jury trial.  Plaintiff was not present and the case was
dismissed without prejudice.
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff applied ex parte to set aside
dismissal.  The Court scheduled a hearing
for today’s date.  
On April 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed an untimely opposition. 
Legal Standard 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (CCP § 473, subd. (b).) 
Discussion 
Plaintiff moves to set aside dismissal of the Complaint
that was entered on January 10, 2024. 
The motion is timely because it was filed within six months
of dismissal.  (CCP § 473, subd. (b).)
Plaintiff states that on December 12, 2023 the filing clerk
voided a request to set the case for non-jury trial due to non-payment of the $20.00
fee. (Garibay Decl., ¶ 6.) On December 14, 2023, Plaintiff went to clerk to pay
the $20.00 fee. (Garibay Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff avers that the clerk informed
him that because the Case Management Conference was already scheduled for
January 23, 2024, the non-jury trial would take place on that same date or on a
date following. (Garibay Decl., ¶ 9.) Lastly, Plaintiff contends that on
January 23, 2024, he traveled back to court to attend the Case Management
Conference at which time he was informed by the court that the case had been
set for a non-jury trial on January 10, 2024 and his case was dismissed.
(Garibay Decl., ¶ 11.) Plaintiff states he never received notice of the
non-jury trial scheduled for January 10, 2024. (Garibay Decl., ¶ 13.) 
In the untimely opposition, Defendant states that the
dismissal was without prejudice, and she would be prejudiced if the motion is
granted.  Defendant has not articulated
prejudice beyond the expense of defending the lawsuit, which is insufficient to
deny the relief sought.  
Defendant also states that normal procedural rights should
be maintained. Here, Plaintiff has timely asserted his statutory right to set
aside dismissal on the grounds of mistake and excusable neglect.   
Lastly, Defendant argues that Plaintiff should pay the sum
of $2,500.00 as costs incurred in preparing and defending the action.  However, Defendant has not attached a
declaration itemizing the costs; therefore, Court declines to award costs at
this time.  
Based on the above, the Court is inclined to grant
Plaintiff’s motion to set aside dismissal. 
However, Plaintiff has not attached an amended complaint with the
motion.  Therefore, the hearing is
CONTINUED to April 30, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  Plaintiff is ordered to file and serve an
amended complaint before that date.
