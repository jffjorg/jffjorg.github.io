Here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Pacific Southwest District of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod has filed a quiet title action to determine the ownership of church property used by Peace Lutheran Church, Inc. The Plaintiff served special interrogatories, set three, and the Defendant responded. The Plaintiff moves to compel further responses to the special interrogatories, arguing that the Defendant's responses are insufficient and contain meritless objections. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and confer requirement and that the Defendant's objections are without merit. The Court rules that the Plaintiff's motion is GRANTED as to Nos. 9-11, 14-22, and 26-29, and DENIED as to Nos. 12-13 and 23-25. The Court also grants the Defendant's application to advance the hearing date on the motion to bifurcate and sever the action.
