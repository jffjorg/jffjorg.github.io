Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is as follows: The plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint is continued to April 30, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve an amended complaint before that date. The plaintiff's motion is granted due to the mistake and excusable neglect in failing to pay the $20.00 fee and not receiving notice of the non-jury trial. However, the defendant has not articulated sufficient prejudice to deny the relief sought.
