And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Stephen I. Goorvitch, has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) in the case of Kenneth Berry, an African-American employee who claims racial discrimination in his termination. Berry, who was terminated by the LAUSD, alleges that he was subjected to racial discrimination and that the LAUSD terminated him because of his race. The LAUSD claims that Berry was terminated due to his physical altercation with a coworker, Leonel Fierro, who referred to Berry's mother with a racial epithet. The Judge finds that Berry failed to prove that he was terminated due to his race and that the LAUSD's reason for termination was legitimate. The Judge grants the LAUSD's motion for summary judgment and orders the defendant to lodge a proposed judgment forthwith. The Judge also denies the LAUSD's request for costs, citing the California Code of Civil Procedure.
