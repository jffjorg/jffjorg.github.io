 Case Number:  22STCV33867    Hearing Date:   May 24, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Motion Of Plaintiff For Terminating Sanctions And For Further Monetary
Sanctions Against Defendant Nile Niami.
BACKGROUND
In this action, INFERNO CALIFORNIA, INC. (Plaintiff)
filed a Complaint against NILE NIAMI (“Defendant Niami”) and CONTEMPORARY
VISTA, LLC (“Defendant Contemporary”), for fraud and breach of contract, alleging
that Defendants fraudulently induced Plaintiff to make a loan on a real
property investment and they failed to pay back a loan secured by a Gulfstream
corporate jet.
On 4/24/24, at the Order to Show Cause hearing, the
Court issued an order striking the answer filed by Defendant Contemporary and
entering default against Defendant Contemporary.  
Now, Plaintiff moves the Court for terminating and
monetary sanctions against Defendant Niami. Plaintiff requests that the Court
strike Defendant Niami’s answer, enter his default, and impose $5,753.90 in
sanctions against him.
LEGAL STANDARD
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order,
courts have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary
sanctions. E.g., R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 486, 495. To avoid sanctions, the burden of proving that a
discovery violation was not willful is on the party on whom the discovery was
served. Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250,
252-253.
Default prove-up procedures must be followed for
defaults entered as discovery sanctions. E.g., Reedy v. Bussell (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1294.
ANALYSIS
In support of the sanctions requests, Plaintiff states
that Defendant Niami willfully refused to comply with the 3/28/24 order compelling
deposition attendance and further responses and production as to requests of
production, and imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $7,247.00.
Defendant Niami has filed no opposition to satisfy his
burden to prove that the failure to obey the order was not willful.  
CONCLUSION
The Court will grant the unopposed motion for terminating
sanctions and sign the proposed order submitted by Plaintiff. Plaintiff must
submit a default judgment package that complies with California Rule of Court
3.1800 for both Defendants. The Court vacates the FSC and trial dates and will
set an OSC Re: Default Judgment on a date that works for Plaintiff’s counsel.
