And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Law Offices of Eric V. Luedtke to be relieved as counsel for SOUTH BAY SAFETY, INC. The motion was filed due to breakdowns in the attorney-client relationship and lack of cooperation from the client. The Judge found that the attorney-client relationship had deteriorated to the point where it was unreasonably difficult for the attorney to continue representing the client. The Judge also found that there was no evidence of prejudice to the client in allowing the attorney to withdraw. Therefore, the Judge granted the motion and will sign the proposed order submitted by counsel.
