SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On May 10, 2024,
Defendants Hernan Preciado Corona and Maria Corona (Defendants) served requests
for production on Plaintiffs Evelio Cardona Marroquin and Carolina Paz
(Plaintiffs). Defendants had not received any responses by June 11, 2024, so
Defendants’ counsel wrote to Plaintiffs’ counsel on June 14 that the answers
were due. Defendants have not received any answers to the Requests for
Production.
 
Defendants filed
this motion to compel discovery responses to the requests for production on July
25, 2024. No opposition has been filed. Defendants also request sanctions in
the amount of $760.00 against Plaintiffs.
 
Requests
for Production
A propounding
party may move to compel responses to requests for production of documents
where the responding party fails to provide responses. (CCP § 2031.300.) The
responding party must provide responses within thirty days after the demand is
served. (CCP § 2031.030(c)(2) & (3).) The responding party waives all
objections, including privilege and work product, by failing to timely respond
to requests for production of documents. (CCP § 2031.300.) 
 
Plaintiffs have
failed to respond to Defendants’ Requests for Production. Defendants have moved
for an order compelling Plaintiffs’ responses to these Requests for Production.
The Court grants Defendants’ motion to compel responses to the Requests for
Production.
 
Sanctions
CCP § 2023.030
authorizes the Court to issue sanctions against a party engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process. Failure to respond to discovery,
evasive responses, and objections lacking substantial justification are
“misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.010, subd. (d)-(f).)
 
Defendants have
requested sanctions in the amount of $760.00 against Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’
attorney of record. The amount was based on Defendants’ counsel spending 4 hours
preparing this motion and attending the hearing on the motion at $175.00 an
hour, plus the $60 filing fee. (Hiller Decl., ¶ 5.) The Court grants the
sanctions in the full requested amount.
 
Defendants’
request for sanctions against Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ attorney of record is
granted in the total amount of $760.00.
 
ORDER
1.      Defendants’
motion to compel responses to the requests for production is granted.
2.      Plaintiffs
are ordered to serve responses within twenty (20) days.
3.      Plaintiffs
and Plaintiffs’ attorney of record are ordered to pay sanctions in the total
amount of $760.00. Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ attorney of record are ordered to
pay these sanctions to Defendants’ counsel within twenty (20) days.
4.      Moving
party to give notice.
