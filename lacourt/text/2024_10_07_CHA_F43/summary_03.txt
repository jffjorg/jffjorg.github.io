And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the documents submitted by the parties and determined that the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories is moot. The defendant has served additional amended responses to the interrogatories, which are responsive to the questions asked. The plaintiff has not filed a reply to the defendant's opposition and has only addressed special interrogatories nos. 12-14 and 25 in their separate statement. The court will address only these interrogatories as they are the only ones mentioned in the separate statement. The court will determine at the hearing whether monetary sanctions are warranted. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
