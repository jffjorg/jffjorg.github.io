Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Ford Motor Company, to the fourth cause of action for fraudulent inducement - concealment in the lawsuit filed by the plaintiffs, John Pule Rodriguez and Juan Pule Lopez. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant concealed known defects in the transmission of a 2018 Ford Mustang, which they purchased, and that the defendant intended to deceive them into buying the vehicle.

The judge finds that the plaintiffs have not pled sufficient facts to maintain a cause of action for fraudulent inducement - concealment. Specifically, the plaintiffs have not stated what the marketing materials that they reviewed said about the transmission defect, which is necessary to establish the fraud.

However, the judge notes that the economic loss rule, which bars tort recovery for economic losses, is not applicable in this case. The judge cites California Supreme Court decision Rattagan v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2024) 324 Cal.Rptr.3d 433, which holds that a party purchasing a vehicle does not bargain with the expectation that the car manufacturer is concealing known material defects from them, and that public policy reasons, exclusive of the contract, support tort liability in such cases.

The judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs may refile their cause of action with additional allegations to address the deficiencies identified in the ruling.
