And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel responses to their requests for production from the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs failed to respond to the requests, and the defendants had requested that the court compel the responses. The court also grants the defendants' request for sanctions in the amount of $760.00 against the plaintiffs and their attorney. This amount was based on the time and expense incurred by the defendants' counsel in preparing and arguing the motion. The court orders the plaintiffs to serve their responses to the requests for production within 20 days and to pay the sanctions within 20 days.
