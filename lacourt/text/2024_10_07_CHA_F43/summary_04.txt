  - "Assuming for a moment that ADSB's late-asserted objection based on that Section was proper, though as will be discussed below, it was not proper, CCP § 2019.210 states that 'In any action alleging the misappropriation of a trade secret under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (Title 5 (commencing with Section 3426) of Part 1 of Division 4 of the Civil Code), before commencing discovery relating to the trade secret, the party alleging the misappropriation shall identify the trade secret with reasonable particularity subject to any orders that may be appropriate under Section 3426.5 of the Civil Code.'"

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Golden Hammer Ops, LLC and Gregory Rowlee vs. ADSBexchange.com, LLC, et al. The case involves a dispute over trade secrets and discovery. The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel ADSB to produce responsive documents.

The judge found that ADSB failed to comply with its statement of compliance and waived any objections to the nine requests for production (RFPs) based on CCP § 2019.210. The judge also found that ADSB's late-asserted objection based on that section was not proper.

The judge noted that the RFPs at issue do not directly relate to any trade secrets, but it is possible that some responsive documents may involve trade secrets. The judge concluded that the strongest basis upon which to grant the plaintiffs' motion is ADSB's failure to timely object based on CCP § 2019.210.

The judge also denied the request for sanctions against the plaintiffs, finding that ADSB acted with substantial justification in opposing the motion. However, the judge warned that if ADSB fails to comply with the order, sanctions may be appropriate.

The judge ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
