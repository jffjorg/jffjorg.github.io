 Case Number:  23CHCV02449    Hearing Date:   October 7, 2024    Dept:  F43 Dept. F43 Date: 10-7-24 Case #23CHCV02449,  Cesar Buenrostro vs. City of Los Angeles, et al. Trial Date: 4-14-25   MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO SPECIAL  INTERROGATORIES   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff  Cesar Buenrostro RESPONDING  PARTY: Defendants Israel Junior Colon and City of Los Angeles   RELIEF  REQUESTED Defendant’s  further responses to certain special interrogatories, along with monetary  sanctions.   RULING: Motion  is moot.   SUMMARY OF  ACTION This action  arises from a motor vehicle accident wherein Defendant Israel Junior Colon  (Colon), an employee of Defendant City of Los Angeles (the City) struck a motor  vehicle driven by Plaintiff Cesar Buenrostro (Plaintiff).    Plaintiff  propounded Special Interrogatories on Defendant Colon on March 28, 2024. On May  13, 2023, the City served responses to the Interrogatories on behalf of Colon. On  July 15, 2024, the City served further responses on behalf of Colon. On July  19, 2024, the City provided a privilege log at Plaintiff’s request, and on  August 20, 2024, the City served further amended response to the Special  Interrogatories.    On August 29,  2024, after the parties were unable to meet and confer regarding the further  amended responses, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel further responses to  the Special Interrogatories. Though Plaintiff’s motion mentions additional  interrogatories (Nos. 17 through 23), Plaintiff’s separate statement only  addresses Special Interrogatories Nos. 12-14 and 25. The Court will only address  Nos. 12-14 and 25, as those are the ones mentioned in the separate statement.  Plaintiff’s issue with Defendant’s responses is that they were based on unmeritorious  objections.   In Defendant’s  opposition, filed on September 23, 2024, Defendant indicates that the City  served additional amended responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 12-14 and  25 after the filing of Plaintiff’s motion. These responses indicated that the  information is not known to Colon, that there were no prior accidents, and that  no documents exists. These answers are all responsive to their respective  interrogatories. Plaintiff has not filed any reply to Defendant’s opposition.   The Court has  reviewed the documents submitted by the parties and has determined that the  further responses submitted with Defendant’s opposition moot the motion. As for  the issue of sanctions, the Court will determine at the hearing whether  sanctions are warranted.   Moving party to  give notice.
