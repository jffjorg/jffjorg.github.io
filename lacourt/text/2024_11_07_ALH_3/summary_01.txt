And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorney fees and costs filed by the Defendant, San Marino Gardens Wellness Center, LP, in an unlawful detainer action. The Defendant is seeking $64,522.50 in attorney fees and $42.15 in costs after the Court sustained its demurrer without leave to amend on June 10, 2024. The Defendant argues that it is entitled to attorney fees and costs under the Sublease between the parties, which provides that the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs. The Plaintiff, Park Marino Convalescent Center, Inc., opposes the motion, arguing that there is no prevailing party for purposes of fees under Civil Code section 1717 because the underlying contract claims relating to the Sublease are still being litigated in a related case, Case No. 24NNCV01000. The Court has concluded that there is no prevailing party for purposes of fees under Civil Code 1717, and therefore has denied the Defendant's motion for attorney fees. However, the Court has awarded the Defendant $42.15 in costs under section 1032.
