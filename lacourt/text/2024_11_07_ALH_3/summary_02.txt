And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling is in response to Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant's Person Most Qualified to appear for deposition and produce documents. The Court finds that Plaintiff satisfied the requirement to meet and confer before filing this motion to compel. The Court grants the motion to compel with respect to categories of examination 1-4 and 6, which pertain to Defendant's decision not to repurchase or replace the Subject Vehicle, as well as the Subject Vehicle's repair history and any communications about the Subject Vehicle. The Court also grants the motion to compel production of documents and policy and procedure documents for Song-Beverly Act compliance.

The Court denies the motion to compel production of RFP No. 7, which seeks information about recalls applicable to the Subject Vehicle. The Court imposes sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1,800 for failing to respond to Plaintiff's multiple attempts to meet and confer and to schedule the deposition for a mutually agreeable date.

The Court orders Defendant to produce a Person Most Qualified within the next 60 days and to pay sanctions within 20 days. The Court also orders Defendant to produce policy and procedure documents for Song-Beverly Act compliance, including any "buy back manual" provided to decision makers, subject to privilege limitations.
