And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff, Flynt Management Group, LLC, summary judgment in its sole claim for breach of contract against defendant Cinetel Films, Inc. and others. The dispute arises from a landlord-tenant dispute over unpaid rent. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to pay monthly rent and owes the plaintiff a total amount of $161,090.20. The court has found that the plaintiff has met its burden of showing that there is no triable issue of fact and that the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court has also granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of certain guidelines and resolutions regarding Covid-19 tenant protections. The court has ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff the total amount of unpaid rent, plus interest at 10% per annum, and has also ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff's attorney's fees. The final ruling will be issued after the defendant has been given an opportunity to file a response.
