**Tentative Ruling**

Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Kent Moyer's motion to compel Defendant James S. Davidson's further responses to requests for production sets one and two and for sanctions. The motion was denied because the joint statement filed by the parties did not comply with the Department's rules, which require the inclusion of brief bullet-point statements from each party as to why a further response should or should not be compelled. The Defendant failed to provide its position on why a further response should not be compelled, and as a result, the Court denied the motion to compel further responses.
