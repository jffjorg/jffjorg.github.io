 Case Number:  22SMCV02201    Hearing Date:   November 16, 2023    Dept:  205  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  KENT MOYER,   Plaintiff, v.  JAMES S. DAVIDSON, et al.,    Respondents.    Case No.:  22SMCV02201     Hearing Date:  November 16, 2023   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF KENT MOYER’S MOTION    TO COMPEL DEFENDANT JAMES S.    DAVIDSON’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO    REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION AND    FOR SANCTIONS       This hearing is on Plaintiff Kent Moyer’s motion to compel Defendant James Davidson’s further responses to his requests for production sets one and two and for sanctions.  This Department’s rules require Plaintiff to file a joint statement consisting of four columns: the first column will identify the number of the discovery request; the second, the text of the discovery request; the third, the text of the response, and the fourth, brief bullet-point statements, one from each party as to why a further response should or should not be compelled.¿ While a “joint statement” was filed, it does not include Defendant’s position as to why a further response should not be compelled.  Accordingly, it fails to comply with this Department’s rules, and the Court, therefore, denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to his requests for production.  ¿¿¿  IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: November 16, 2023    ___________________________ Edward B. Moreton, Jr. Judge of the Superior Court
