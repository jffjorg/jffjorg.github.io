LEGAL STANDARD
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. Wilson v. Transit Authority of City of Sacramento
(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must
be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. “A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not on the evidence or facts alleged.” E-Fab, Inc. v.
Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315. As such, courts
assume the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual
allegations. Ibid. However, it does not accept as true deductions,
contentions, or conclusions of law or fact. Stonehouse Homes LLC v. City of
Sierra Madre (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 531, 538. 
Further, the court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a). The court
may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
Id., § 436(b). The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading
has irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in
conformity with laws. Id. § 436. The grounds for moving to strike must
appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. Id. §
437. 
Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 349 (court shall not "sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment"); Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency
(2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 ("A demurrer should not be sustained
without leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause
of action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect
can be cured by amendment."). The burden is on the complainant to show the
Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.
 
 
ANALYSIS
I. Statute of Limitations 
First, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s claims are barred
by the statute of limitations. 
A. Song Beverly Claims
“[The Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act] supplements,
rather than supersedes, the provisions of the California Uniform Commercial
Code.” Krieger v. Nick Alexander Imports, Inc. (1991) 234
Cal.App.3d 205, 213 (Kreiger). Because “California Commercial Code section
2725 specifically governs actions for breach of warranty in a sales context…
[it] controls rather than the general provision of Code of Civil Procedure
section 338, subdivision (a) for liabilities created by statute.” Id. at
p. 215 (fn. omitted). 
California Commercial Code section 2725, subdivision
provides in relevant part, 
(1) An action for breach of any
contract for sale must be commenced within four years after the cause of action
has accrued…. 
(2) A cause of action accrues when
the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party’s lack of knowledge of the
breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except
that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and
discovery of the breach must await the time of such
performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have
been discovered.
“[T]he ‘future performance’ exception to the four-year
limitations period applies only when the seller explicitly has agreed to
warrant its product for a defined period of time.” Carrau v. Marvin Lumber
& Cedar Co. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 281, 291.
Here, Plaintiff purchased the vehicle on May 25, 2020. FAC ¶
5. Plaintiff filed this action more than four years later, on August 8, 2024. Defendant
argues that the cause of action accrued on the date of the sale, and therefore
this action is untimely.
Defendant’s argument fails because the express warranty
provides that the “vehicle is covered for 3 years or 36,000 miles, whichever
comes first.” FAC, Ex. A at p. 8. This warranty “explicitly extends to future
performance of the goods.” Cal. Com. Code § 2725, subd. (2). Krieger, supra,
234 Cal.App.3d at pp. 216-17, is directly applicable. Faced with an almost
identical set of facts, the court held “a written warranty that all defects
would be repaired for a period of 36 months or within the first 36,000 miles of
use” constitutes “an express warranty of future performance….”) (citations
omitted). Because the warranty consists of a promise to repair, discovery of
the breach can only occur after the manufacturer fails to repair the vehicle. Id.
at p. 218 ([B]ased on the evidence that [plaintiff] determined
that respondent had been unable to repair his car as of May 30, 1984, a
reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the cause of action accrued in May
1984.). Here, the breach occurred after, at the earliest, sometime after
Plaintiff first presented the vehicle for repair, on August 6, 2021. Therefore,
the action is within the four-year limitations period for breach of a sale’s
contract. 
B. Fraud
“An action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake
[must be brought within three years]. The cause of action in that case is not
deemed to have accrued until the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the
facts constituting the fraud or mistake.” Code Civ. Proc., § 338.
[S]tatutes of limitation do not begin to run until a cause
of action accrues.” Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th
797, 806. “[A] cause of action accrues at ‘the time when the cause of action is
complete with all of its elements.’” Ibid (quoting Norgart v. Upjohn
Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 397 (Norgart)). “An exception is the
discovery rule, which postpones accrual of a cause of action until the
plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover, the cause of action.” Norgart,
supra 21 Cal.4th at p.389. “Under the discovery rule, the statute of
limitations begins to run when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that
her injury was caused by wrongdoing, that someone has done something wrong to
her.” Jolly v. Eli Lilly & Co. (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1103, 1110. 
“In order to raise the issue of belated discovery, the
plaintiff must state when the discovery was made, the circumstances behind the
discovery, and plead facts showing that the failure to discover was reasonable,
justifiable and not the result of a failure to investigate or act.” Bastian
v. County of San Luis Obispo (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 520, 527 (citations
omitted). Once properly pleaded, belated discovery is a question of fact. Ibid.
A demurrer may be sustained only where “the trial court could determine as a
matter of law that failure to discover was due to failure to investigate or to
act without diligence.” Ibid. 
Plaintiff fails to oppose Defendant’s arguments that the
fraudulent concealment claim is barred by the statute of limitations.
Accordingly, the Court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend as to that
claim. See Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215
Cal.App.4th 972, 995, fn. 3 (“if no legal argument with citation to authority
‘is furnished on a particular point, the court may treat it as waived, and pass
it without consideration.’” [Citation omitted] [internal quotation marks
omitted]).
II. Motion to Strike
To state a prima facie claim for punitive damages, a
complaint must set forth the elements as stated in the general punitive damage
statute, Civil Code Section 3294. College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 721. These statutory elements include allegations that
the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. Civ. Code §
3294, subd. (a). “‘Malice’ means conduct which is intended by the defendant to
cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the
defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others.” Civ. Code, § 3294 subd. (c)(1). “‘Oppression’” means despicable
conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious
disregard of that person’s rights.” Civ. Code, § 3294 subd. (c)(2). 
“In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation of
punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief must
be pled by a plaintiff. In passing on the correctness of a ruling on a motion
to strike, judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike
as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their truth. In ruling on a
motion to strike, courts do not read allegations in isolation.” Clauson v.
Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255. (citations omitted). “The
mere allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant
an award of punitive damages. Not only must there be circumstances of
oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to
support such a claim.” Grieves v. Superior Ct. (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d
159, 166 (fn. omitted) (citations omitted). 
Because the Court sustained the demurrer as to the fraud
claim, it likewise grants the motion to strike punitive damages with leave to
amend. 
 
CONCLUSION
Defendant's Demurrer is sustained in part and overruled in part.
Defendant’s Motion to Strike Punitve Damages is granted.  Plaintiff has twenty days leave to amend.
