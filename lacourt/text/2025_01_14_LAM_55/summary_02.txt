And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike. The demurrer is sustained in part and overruled in part. The defendant's argument that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations is unsuccessful, as the written warranty provided by the defendant explicitly extends to future performance of the goods. The breach of warranty occurred after the manufacturer failed to repair the vehicle, and the action is within the four-year limitations period.

The judge also grants the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages, as the complaint does not adequately plead the elements of oppression, fraud, or malice. The plaintiff has twenty days to amend the complaint to address these issues.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's fraudulent concealment claim is barred by the statute of limitations, and the demurrer is sustained as to that claim. The plaintiff may amend the complaint to address this issue.
