And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this case, Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC (Plaintiff) is suing Vanessa Navarro and LA Immigration Center LLC (Defendants) for allegedly offering immigration consulting services out of compliance with the California Immigration Consultant Act. The Plaintiff is seeking to deem the truth of matters stated in requests for admissions as admitted and is requesting sanctions for the Defendants' failure to respond to the requests.

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, has granted the Plaintiff's motion to deem the truth of matters stated in the requests for admissions as admitted, but has denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions. The Judge found that the Plaintiff is entitled to the order deeming the truth of matters stated in the requests for admissions as admitted, but has denied the request for sanctions as the fee request is unreasonably inflated. The Judge has also noted that the Plaintiff's fee request should not take five hours to prepare a straightforward motion to deem matters admitted.
