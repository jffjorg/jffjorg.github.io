**Significant Statements**
```
- "The Court does not share Defendants' view that the gravamen of Plaintiffs' claim arises from those statements. The injury-producing conduct, as alleged, is Defendants' refusal, as the agents of the property managers and the new owners, to show another unit to Plaintiffs for illegitimate reasonsâ€”i.e., retaliation and discrimination."
- "The specific statements described in paragraph 21 are therefore collateral to Plaintiffs' claims."
- "The Court finds that the claims asserted against these Defendants do not arise out of protected activity, without reaching the issue of whether the statements quoted are subject to the litigation privilege."
