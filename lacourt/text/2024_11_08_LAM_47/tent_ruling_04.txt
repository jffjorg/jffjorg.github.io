//
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves to deem the truth
of matters stated in requests for admissions propounded to each Defendant as
admitted, and for sanctions. As both motions are substantively identical, the
Court addresses the motions jointly in the interest of brevity. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
When a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to respond, the party
propounding the requests may move for an order that the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).)
“The court shall make this order [deem the requests admitted], unless it finds
that the party to whom the request for admissions have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with section 2033.220.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)
 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiff
served each Defendant with a set of requests for admissions via U.S. Mail on
March 11, 2024. (Declaration of Sebastian M. Medvei ISO Mot. ¶ 4; Exh. 1.) To
date, no responses have been received. (Id.) Plaintiff is therefore
entitled to an order deeming the truth of matters stated in the requests for
admissions. 
 
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
also requests sanctions in the amount of $3,992.15 against each Defendant for
failing to respond to the Requests for Admissions. 
 
Failure to respond or submit to an
authorized method of discovery is a misuse of the discovery process for which
sanctions may be imposed. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2023.010(d); 2023.030(a).)
Sanctions are mandatory on the party or attorney or both whose failure to serve
a timely response to requests for admission necessitated a motion to deem
requests for admissions as admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)
 
            Plaintiff
requests $3,992.15 in sanctions against each Defendant based on 2 hours
actually incurred at $750 per hour, plus an additional 3 anticipated hours,
plus $78.80 in filing fees. (Medvei Decl. ¶ 6.) This fee request is
unreasonably inflated on its face. It should not take five hours to prepare a
straightforward motion to deem matters admitted. The Court therefore exercises its discretion to deny this request as
unreasonably inflated. (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal. 4th 970, 989-991.)   
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters Stated in Requests for
Admissions Propounded to Defendant Navarro as Admitted is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters Stated in Requests for Admissions
Propounded to Defendant LA Immigration Center LLC as Admitted is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
