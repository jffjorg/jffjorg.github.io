And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Genius Fund I ABC, LLC v. Ari Stiegler and Gabriel Borden. The case involves a dispute over breach of fiduciary duties by the defendants, who are alleged to have catastrophically mismanaged a private equity fund. The defendants have demurred to the second amended complaint and moved to strike portions of the complaint.

The judge has overruled the defendants' demurrer and denied their motion to strike. The judge found that the complaint states a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duties and that the defendants have failed to demonstrate that the complaint is deficient.

The judge also rejected the defendants' arguments that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts and that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The judge found that the complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and that the statute of limitations is not applicable.

The judge ordered that the parties give notice of the tentative ruling and invited any party to submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by a certain deadline.
