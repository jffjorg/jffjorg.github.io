 Hearing Date:  March 28, 2024



 
Plaintiffs
Luis Sanchez’s and Shannon Sanchez’s motion
for attorneys’ fees is granted in the total reduced amount of $162,795.00.

 
Plaintiffs Luis Sanchez (“Luis”) and
Shannon Sanchez (“Shannon”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) move for an order
awarding their attorneys’ fees pursuant to a settlement with Defendant Kia Motors America,
Inc. (“KA”) (“Defendant”) in the amount of $165,920.00, including a 1.5
lodestar enhancement in the amount of $82,960.00, for a total of $248,880.00 in
attorneys’ fees.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1; Civ.
Code §1794(d).)  The Court
grants fees in the amount of $162,795.00.
 
Evidentiary Objections
Defendant’s 3/15/24 evidentiary
objections to the Declaration of Norman F. Taylor (“Taylor”) are sustained as
to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.
Defendant’s 3/15/24 evidentiary
objections to the Declaration of Richard M. Wirtz (“Wirtz”) are overruled as to
Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, and sustained as to No. 13.
Plaintiffs’ 3/21/24 evidentiary
objection to the Declaration of Siyun Yao (“Yao”) is sustained as to No. 1. 
 
Background
This is a lemon law action
brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly Act”).  On May 1, 2023, Defendant accepted
Plaintiffs’ 998 Offer.  (Decl. of Wirtz ¶30,
Exh. 7; Decl. of Yao ¶10.)
On
March 4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this motion for attorneys’ fees.  Defendant filed its opposition on March 15,
2024.  Plaintiffs filed their reply on March
21, 2024.
 
Discussion
Civil Code §1794(d) provides that a
buyer who prevails in an action under that section, “shall be allowed by the
court to recover as a part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount
of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and the prosecution of such action.” 
Here, Plaintiffs are the prevailing
party per parties’ 998 agreement and are entitled to attorneys’ fees.  (Decl. of Wirtz ¶30, Exh. 7 at ¶5.)  Defendant does not contest that Plaintiffs
are the prevailing party.
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by the Plaintiff’s counsel. The Supreme Court of California
has concluded that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for
private attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Plaintiffs
retained two law firms for their representation in this matter, Norman Taylor
& Associates (“NTA”) and Wirtz Law (“WL”).
 
A.   NTA
Norman
Taylor declares his hourly rate is $645.00/hour, and he received the assistance
of two paralegals who billed at a rate of $250.00. (Decl. of Taylor ¶¶5, 12;
Exh. 1.)  This rate is appropriate given
each the attorney’s relative experience and qualifications.  (See id.)  Plaintiffs has sufficiently demonstrated their
NTA counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable in their community of practice in their
specialized area of law.
Defendant
does not challenge Plaintiff’s NTA counsel’s hourly rate as unreasonable with
the necessary particularity.  The Court
finds Plaintiff’s NTA counsel’s rate to be reasonable and does not warrant a
reduction.
 
B.    WL
Counsel for WL
declares the following hourly rates of the attorneys who worked on this case: (1)
Kelsey Henry ($450.00/hour); (2) Daniel Inscore ($550.00/hour); and (3) Amy
Rotman ($550/hour); as well as four legal assistants whose hourly rates range
from $250.00-$300.00/hour.  (Decl. of Wirtz
¶¶15-21, 31, Exh. 1 at pg. 28.)  These
rates are appropriate given each attorney’s relative experience and
qualifications.  (See id.)  Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated ther
WL counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their community of practice in their
specialized area of law.
Defendant
does not challenge Plaintiffs’ WL counsel’s hourly rate as unreasonable with
the requisite particularity.  The Court
finds Plaintiffs’ WL counsel’s rate to be reasonable and does not warrant a
reduction.
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
Plaintiff’s NTA
Counsel’s fee recovery is based on the 31.9 hours spent by their NTA attorneys
litigating this case for a total of $15,875.00.  (Decl. of Taylor ¶5, Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff’s WL Counsel’s fee recovery is
based on 346.4 hours spent by their WL attorneys litigating this case for a
total of $150,045.00.  (Decl. of Wirtz
¶2, Exh. 1.)  Defendant argues Plaintiff’s
counsel’s billed hours were not reasonably incurred and were block billed, and
therefore should be cut.  (Opposition, pgs.
5-9.)  The Court has reviewed Defendant’s
objections to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s billed hours and agrees with some of
Defendant’s objections.
First,
Defendant does not cite to specific examples of hours that were not for “actual
time expended.”  Therefore, Defendant did
not meet its burden to challenge these fees.
Second,
Defendant’s objection to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s block billing on December 16,
2021; January 7, 2022; November 7, 2022; and November 8, 2022, is well taken.  However, Defendant only cites to these
examples in its opposition.  Accordingly,
the Court will reduce the requested hours from Plaintiffs’ request for
attorneys’ fees by $2,310.00.
Third,
Defendant’s objection to Plaintiff’s opposition to the motion to compel
arbitration is not well taken, and not supported by case law.  Therefore, Defendant did not meet its burden
to challenge these fees.
Fourth, Defendant’s
objection to Plaintiff’s fees involving the first vehicle inspection is not well
taken because the inspection was cancelled due to Defendant’s expert’s COVID-19
diagnosis, not for any fault of Plaintiffs, who made appropriate travel plans
to attend the inspection from out of state. 
Therefore, Defendant did not meet its burden to challenge these fees.
Fifth, Defendant’s
objection to duplicative tasks billed for reviewing and revising the statement
of claims as well as reserving a previously served set of discovery is well
taken.  Accordingly,
the Court will reduce the requested hours from Plaintiffs’ request for
attorneys’ fees by $815.00.
Finally,
Defendant’s objection to excessive, unreasonable, and unnecessary billing is
not well taken.  Plaintiffs are entitled
to conduct research relevant to the claims asserted, issue non-party subpoenas
signed by the arbitrator, prepare an arbitration brief, and audit a fee
invoice.  Therefore, Defendant did not
meet its burden to challenge these fees.
 
Final
Lodestar Determination
The Court
denies Plaintiffs’ request for a 1.5 lodestar multiplier.  Given the routine work done in this case and
the results obtained in this lemon law area, a multiplier is not appropriate.
Any contingency risk factor is already accounted for in the hourly rates, which
the Court has found to be reasonable.
 
Conclusion
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ request
for attorneys’ fees is granted in the reduced amount of $162,795.00.
Moving Party to give notice.
