[1] Plaintiff’s counsel is admonished for failing to
properly label its filings in eCourt; each of Plaintiff’s filings is identified
as Memorandum of Points and Authorities without reference to the specific
motion or the Defendant to which the motion is directed.  Plaintiff’s failure to label his motion has
wasted extensive judicial resources because of the sheer volume of Defendants
and filings on the instant docket.
