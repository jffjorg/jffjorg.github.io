Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law case brought by Luis Sanchez and Shannon Sanchez against Kia Motors America, Inc. The Plaintiffs are seeking attorneys' fees in the amount of $248,880.00, which includes a 1.5 lodestar multiplier. The Court has reduced the requested amount to $162,795.00.

The Court has granted the Plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees, finding that they are the prevailing party. The Court has also found that the hourly rates of the Plaintiffs' counsel are reasonable, and that the billed hours are reasonable and necessary to the conduct of the litigation.

However, the Court has reduced the requested hours by $2,310.00 due to block billing and other issues. The Court has also denied the Plaintiffs' request for a 1.5 lodestar multiplier, finding that the routine work done in this case and the results obtained do not warrant a multiplier.

The Court's tentative ruling is subject to change after considering any further objections or arguments presented at the hearing date of March 28, 2024.
