And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (Plaintiff) against Galen Wilson aka Galen W. Wilson aka Galen William Wilson dba Maquina (Defendant). The lawsuit alleges that Defendant breached a five-year lease agreement between Defendant and NMM Investments, LLC, and seeks a default judgment against Defendant for $118,206.93.

The judge notes that the Plaintiff's proposed judgment includes several unexplained items on the Statement of Account, including a $11,000 charge for "Lawsuit" and an unidentified item for $2,600. The judge also questions how the Plaintiff calculated the amount of prejudgment interest owed.

The judge has continued the hearing on the Default Prove-up to a later date, and requires any additional papers to be filed no later than 5 court days before the hearing. The judge advises that parties intending to submit on the tentative must send an email to the Court, and that if no submissions are received, the Court may adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
