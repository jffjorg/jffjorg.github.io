          Plaintiff
Creditors Adjustment Bureau (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendant
Galen Wilson aka Galen W. Wilson aka Galen William Wilson dba Maquina (“Defendant”)
on March 1, 2024. This is an action for breach of contract and personal
guaranty arising from a lease entered into between Defendant and Plaintiff’s
assignor, NMM Investments, LLC (“NMM”). Plaintiff alleges Defendant entered
into a five-year lease beginning on May 1, 2019. (Compl., ¶ 10.) Plaintiff
alleges Defendant breached the lease by “failing to pay either in whole or in
part of the rent that became due on or after November 1, 2023. (Compl., ¶ 11.) Plaintiff
seeks a default judgment against Defendant for $118,206.93, consisting of
$105,415.94 as demanded in the complaint, $9,299.71 in prejudgment interest at
a rate of 10% per annum, $547.13 in costs, and $2,944.15 in attorney fees. 
          NMM’s
manager, Jason Fujimoto, authenticates copies of the lease and personal
guaranty and explains that on or about March 1, 2021, Defendant vacated and
abandoned the premises. (Fujimoto Decl., Ex. 1; ¶ 7.) NMM re-let the premises,
albeit for a lower monthly rent. (Fujimoto Decl., ¶ 7.) Fujimoto states that
this rent collected from Defendant’s replacement ($38,445.20) is accounted for
in Defendant’s Statement of Account. (Fujimoto Decl., Ex. 2.)
          The Statement
of Account reflects $105,415.94 as the net owed amount, but there are several
unexplained items on this document. First, Fujimoto does not explain how the
$11,000 charge in Year 2 for “Lawsuit” are damages resulting from Defendant’s
alleged breach of the lease, why Plaintiff is entitled to recover that amount,
and how the amount is not duplicative of the fees requested in this application.
(Fujimoto Decl., p 36.) There is also an unidentified item for $2,600. Although
it appears to be a credit against the amount owed by Defendant, it is not
labeled and its significance is unknown. 
          Additionally,
Plaintiff does not demonstrate how it calculated the amount of prejudgment
interest owed. Plaintiff s proposed judgment seeks prejudgment interest at a
rate of 10% from November 1, 2023, but there is no explanation why this
particular date was chosen. 
          Last, the
Court briefly notes that Defendant sent correspondence stating he was unable to
appear telephonically at a case management conference. However, since Defendant
is in default, Defendant has no right to appear in the action other than to
file a motion to set aside the default. (See Devlin v. Kearny Mesa
AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-86.) Therefore,
nothing in the correspondence affects Plaintiff’s application for default
judgment. 
          Based on the
foregoing, the hearing on the Default Prove-up is CONTINUED to
________________________ at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra
Courthouse. Any additional papers must be filed no later than 5 court days
before the hearing. 
Dated
this 25th
day of October, 2024
