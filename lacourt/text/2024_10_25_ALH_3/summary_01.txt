And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the defendant's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's responses were incomplete and that the defendant was entitled to compel further responses. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's motions were untimely filed and that the defendant was precluded from serving previously-propounded discovery requests.

The judge finds that the defendant's motions were timely filed and that the plaintiff's responses were incomplete. The judge also finds that the defendant's discovery requests were served after the default was vacated, and therefore, the defendant was not obligated to pursue a motion to compel further responses.

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the extent that it seeks information that is not protected by the Pitchess statutes. The judge denies the defendant's motion to the extent that it seeks information that is protected by the Pitchess statutes, and orders the plaintiff to produce the requested documents through the Pitchess procedure.

The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions and orders the parties to give notice of their intention to submit on the tentative ruling.
