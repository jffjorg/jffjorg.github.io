And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment on all eight causes of action. The plaintiff, Ramon Miramontes, alleged that the defendant, the Board of Trustees of the Los Angeles Community College District, discriminated against him and retaliated against him for filing grievances and complaints. The defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination and retaliation.

The court found that the plaintiff failed to establish a causal link between his disability and the adverse employment actions he faced. The court also found that the defendant did not discriminate against the plaintiff based on his race, gender, or sexual orientation. The court further found that the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing were invalid, as public employment is governed by statute and not contract.

The court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment on all eight causes of action, including discrimination, retaliation, hostile work environment, failure to prevent harassment, failure to engage in the interactive process, disparate impact, and breach of contract and implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
