And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in regards to the case between Hennig, Kramer, Ruiz & Singh, LLP (Plaintiff) and Wendy Seretan (Defendant). The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant failed to compensate them after settling the Defendant's case. The Defendant has moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the Complaint does not state sufficient facts to state a cause of action against them. The court has denied the motion, finding that the Complaint adequately alleges that the Plaintiff is entitled to a reasonable fee, whether through contract or equity. The court has also granted the Defendant's request for a protective order, requiring a remote deposition due to concerns for the Defendant's mental and physical health. The court has scheduled the deposition to take place within 20 days.
