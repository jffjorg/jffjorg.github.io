And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in an employment action between Alberto Moncada, the plaintiff, and Federal Insurance Company, the defendant. On December 7, 2023, the Court granted a motion to compel Federal Insurance Company to comply with a subpoena issued to it. The subpoena requested workers' compensation claims and diary notes related to Federal Insurance Company's claim number 076916026971 and a Los Angeles Workers' Compensation Appeals Board case number ADJl0605607. The Court ordered Federal Insurance Company to comply with the subpoena within 30 days. However, Federal Insurance Company failed to comply with the Court's order, prompting the plaintiff to seek contempt proceedings against the defendant. The plaintiff also seeks a $1,000.00 monetary fine against Federal Insurance Company payable to the Court and $3,000.00 in monetary sanctions against Federal Insurance Company payable to the plaintiff for his reasonable attorney fees incurred in connection with these contempt proceedings.
