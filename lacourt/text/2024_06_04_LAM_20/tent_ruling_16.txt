This is an employment action.  On December 7, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff Alberto Moncada’s motion to compel Federal Insurance Company to comply with a subpoena issued to it.  Plaintiff had sought “workers compensation claims and diary notes as well as investigative records for Plaintiff’s workers compensation bearing Federal Insurance claim number 076916026971 and Los Angeles Workers' Compensation Appeals Board Case Number ADJl0605607.”  The Court ruled that “[t]he production is to be completed within 30 days.”Plaintiff now seeks for the Court to hold Federal Insurance Company in contempt because it failed to comply with the Court’s order with respect to the above mentioned subpoena.  Plaintiff also seeks “the imposition of both: (1) a $1,000.00 monetary fine against Federal Insurance pursuant toCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure (‘C.C.P.’) § 1218(a), payable to the Court; and (2) $[3],000.00 in monetary sanctions against Federal Insurance pursuant to C.C.P. § 2023.030(e), payable to Plaintiff as his reasonable attorney fees incurred in connection with these contempt proceedings.”Because there is no opposition and it is not apparent that there has been any compliance, the Motion is granted.  Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
