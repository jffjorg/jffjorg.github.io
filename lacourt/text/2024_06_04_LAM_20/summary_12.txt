```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Defendant Heriberto Plascencia, which challenges the allegations in the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The court finds that the plaintiff's claims for FEHA harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress are deficient because the alleged conduct does not meet the legal standards for severity, pervasiveness, or extremity. The court further finds that personnel management alone is not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of harassment or intentional infliction of emotional distress. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained, and the plaintiff is granted leave to amend the complaint to cure the deficiencies identified by the court. The court encourages counsel to submit on the tentative ruling and to consider appearing remotely due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
