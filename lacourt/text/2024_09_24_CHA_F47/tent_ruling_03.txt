 Case Number:  24CHCV01642    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  F47 PETITION FOR
ORDER FOR RELIEF FROM GOVERNMENT CLAIM STATUTE
 
Petition filed 7/10/24.  
 
MOVING PARTY: Petitioner/Nominal
Defendant Noel Morales by and through his guardian ad litem Cynthia Morales

RESPONDING PARTY: Respondent/Defendant Southern
California Regional Rail Authority (SCRRA)
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
for relief from Government Claim Statute pursuant to Government Code 946.6.

 
RULING: The hearing on the petition will be
continued.  
 
This action arises out of death of Luis Miranda
(Decedent).  On 5/1/23, Decedent was a
passenger on a Metrolink train which stopped at the Newhall train station in
the City of Santa Clarita for passengers to disembark.  Since this was Decedent’s stop, he disembarked
the train and, as he was crossing the train tracks allegedly in a marked
crosswalk, he was struck and killed by a different train.  Decedent is survived by Plaintiffs Desarae
Miranda (Decedent’s wife), Gabriel Miranda (Decedent’s minor son), Serenity
Miranda (Decedent’s Minor son) (collectively, Plaintiffs) and Nominal Defendant/Petitioner
Noel Morales (Decedent’s minor son).  
 
On 4/25/24, an Application for Leave to Present a Late
Claim (Application) was submitted to Respondent/Defendant Southern California
Regional Rail Authority (SCRRA) on behalf of Petitioner/Nominal Defendant Noel
Morales by and through his guardian ad litem Cynthia Morales (Petitioner).  (Malek Decl., Ex.A).  On 6/6/24, SCRRA issued a denial of the
Application which was received by Petitioner’s counsel on 7/2/24.  (Malek Decl., Ex.B).
 
On 7/10/24, Petitioner filed the instant petition for an order
for relief from Government Claim Statute pursuant to Government Code 946.6
which was originally set for hearing on 8/8/24. 
The proof of service for the petition indicates that it was served by
certified mail on the Board of Secretary for SCRRA, County of Los Angeles,
Executive Offices of Board of Supervisors and Office of Risk and Insurance
Management for Caltrans.  
 
Thereafter, Petitioner rescheduled the hearing to 8/26/24
and then to 9/24/24.  (See Notices
filed 8/1/24 and 8/13/24).  On 8/20/24,
SCRRA filed an answer to the complaint and on 8/21/24, SCRRA filed a
cross-complaint against MOES 1-100.  The
proofs of service for the Notices of the Rescheduled hearing dates indicate
that they were served on counsel for SCRRA by electronic transmission at jkrutcik@gmail.com.  However, the email address of record for
SCRRA’s counsel is jak@krutciklaw.com.  No opposition or other response to the motion
has been filed by SCRRA to cure the defect in notice.  
 
Based on the foregoing, the hearing on the petition will
be continued so that the petition and notice of the new/continued hearing date
can be properly served on SCRRA’s counsel.
