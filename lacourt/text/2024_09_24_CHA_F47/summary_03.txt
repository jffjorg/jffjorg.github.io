And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing on the petition filed by Noel Morales, the minor son of Luis Miranda, who was killed in a train accident. The petition seeks an order for relief from the Government Claim Statute, which allows late claims to be filed. The judge has decided to continue the hearing because the petition and notice of the new hearing date have not been properly served on the Southern California Regional Rail Authority (SCRRA), the respondent in the case. The judge is requiring that the petition and notice be properly served on SCRRA's counsel before the hearing can proceed.
