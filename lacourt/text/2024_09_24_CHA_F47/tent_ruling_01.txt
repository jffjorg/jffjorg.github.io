RECONSIDERATION
 
Motion filed on 7/25/24.

ruling denying the Referee’s Application for a Writ of Possession. 
 
RULING: 
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 7/22/23, Plaintiff Maria Isela Orozco aka Maria I.
Avalos (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendant Juan F. Nuno (Defendant)
for: (1) Accounting, (2) Partition of Real Property and (3) Declaratory Relief.  On 1/30/23, this Court entered default
judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant.  Pursuant to the Judgment, Michael S. Pecherer
(Referee) was appointed as referee to complete the partition sale of the
property commonly known as 10716 Telfair Avenue, Pacoima, California 91331 (the
Property) which is the subject of this action. 
(1/30/23 Judgment, Attachment 5a ¶6).
 
On 9/15/23, the Referee filed an ex parte application
seeking the issuance of a writ of execution for the property commonly known as
10716 Telfair Avenue, Pacoima, California 91331 (the Property) pursuant to
paragraphs 6, 8.f. and 13 of the Judgment. 
(See Ex Parte Application, p.2:2-7).  On 9/20/23, the Court denied the ex parte
application for several reasons, including the application not being supported
by a memorandum and failure to establish that ex parte relief was warranted under
the circumstances.  (See 9/20/23
Minute Order).  However, the Court
specifically noted that the Referee may file a properly noticed motion supported
by authority for the relief requested.  (Id.
at p.3).
 
On 7/25/24, the Referee filed the instant motion seeking
reconsideration of this Court’s 9/20/23 ruling denying the Referee’s
Application for a Writ of Possession. 
The proof of service for the motion indicates that it was served by mail
on defaulted Defendant Juan Nuno at the Property address where he resides.  (See Proof of Service filed 7/25/24).  The proof of service for the motion does not
show service on counsel for Plaintiff.  Id.  
 
No opposition or other response to the motion has been
filed.  
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Court finds that rather than seeking reconsideration
of the denial of the ex parte application, which was denied for both procedural
and substantive reasons, the proper procedure would have been to file a properly
supported noticed motion/application for writ of possession.  As such, the Court deems the instant motion
to be a motion for writ of possession for the Property.
 
Since the unlawful detainer statutes primarily concern
landlord-tenant relationships, which is not the relationship between Plaintiff
and Defendant in this case, the Court finds that the issuance of the requested
of writ of possession regarding the Property is appropriate.  See Castaic Studios, LLC (2023)
97 CA5th 209, 217.
 
CONCLUSION 
 
 
The request for reconsideration of the Court’s 9/20/23
denial of the Referee’s ex parte application for writ of possession is denied
as the Court finds that the ex parte application was properly denied for some,
if not all, of the reasons set forth in the 9/20/23 Minute Order.  However, the Court deems the instant motion
to be a motion for a writ of possession of the Property.
 
If Plaintiff’s counsel waives any defect in notice of the
motion as to Plaintiff, the request for the issuance of a writ of possession instructing
the Sheriff of Los Angeles County to evict Juan F. Nuno, and any persons
residing there with him, and to deliver possession of the real property located
at 10716 Telfair Avenue, Pacoima, California 91331 (Assessor Parcel No.
2619-019-012) to the Referee in Partition, Michael S. Pecherer and/or to Robert
P. Sievers, Attorney for Plaintiff, Maria Isela Orozco will be granted.
 
The Referee is ordered to submit an amended order in
accordance with the above ruling.
