And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the Referee's motion for reconsideration of the denial of the Referee's ex parte application for a writ of possession. The Referee seeks to reconsider the court's 9/20/23 ruling denying the writ of possession. After reviewing the facts and procedural history, the court finds that the Referee's motion is not properly filed and should be denied. However, the court deems the instant motion to be a motion for a writ of possession and grants the request. The court orders the Sheriff of Los Angeles County to evict the Defendant and any persons residing with him and to deliver possession of the property to the Referee in Partition.
