The Court denied the motion to strike as moot, as the demurrer was sustained and the motion to strike was no longer necessary. The Court granted Plaintiff's request for leave to amend the Complaint. The Court declined to reach the issue of sufficiency, meaning that it did not address whether the Complaint adequately alleged facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendants.
