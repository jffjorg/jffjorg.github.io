And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling on May 6, 2024, denies Onni's motion for summary adjudication on several grounds. The judge finds that Geodis stored materials for Onni's benefit, despite Onni's claims that it did not benefit from Geodis's services. The judge also finds that Onni did not have the right to stop Domus from storing the materials with Geodis. The judge concludes that a controversy remains over Domus's and Onni's obligations under their contract and whether either party was obligated to pay Geodis. The judge also finds that the dispute is not dispositive of Geodis's claim for declaratory relief.
