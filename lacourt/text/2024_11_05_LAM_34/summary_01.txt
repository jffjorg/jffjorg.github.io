The court notes that the Plaintiff's counsel did not properly inform Counsel Patel that the settlement was not completed and that the payment to Plaintiff was still outstanding. The court further notes that Defendant's counsel was aware of these issues but did not inform the court. The court concludes that the dismissal was caused by Plaintiff's counsel's mistake and grants the relief requested.
