Legal Standard
 
1.              
Motion to
Compel Responses to Interrogatories and Demand Requests
 
California Code of Civil Procedure
requires a response from the party to whom form interrogatories, special
interrogatories, and demand requests are propounded within 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the time is extended by agreement of the parties.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a), 2030.270, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd.
(a), 2031.270, subd. (a).) If a party fails to serve timely responses,
"the party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to
the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) By failing to respond,
the offending party waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
 
For a motion to compel, all a propounding
party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the
time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were
directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Super. Ct.
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905, 906.) Indeed, "[o]nce [a party] 'fail[ed]
to serve a timely response,' the trial court had authority to grant [opposing
party's] motion to compel responses." (Sinaiko Healthcare Counseling,
Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 405.) 
 
The court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel motions for interrogatories or requests for
production, unless the Court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
 
2.              
Motion to
Deem RFAs Admitted 
 
When a party fails to serve a
timely response to a request for admission, the party propounding the request
for admission may move for an order to deem the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted. (Code Civ.
Proc., §¿2033.280, subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely response
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that
the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for
admission that is in substantial compliance with Section  2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on the party or attorney,
or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Discussion
 
On
April 24, 2024, Plaintiff propounded form interrogatories, request for
production of documents, and request for admissions, sets one, on Defendant.
(Motion, at p. 5; Shapiro Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. A.) Plaintiff contends that
Defendant’s discovery responses were due by May 28, 2024 to which Plaintiff’s
counsel granted several extensions until September 6, 2024 to respond. (Motion,
at pp. 5-6; Shapiro Decl., ¶¶ 6-10, Exh. B.) On September 18, 2024 Plaintiff’s
counsel emailed a meet and confer letter to Defendant’s counsel requesting that
discovery responses be produced by September 25, 2024. (Shapiro Decl., ¶ 10.) Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that Defendant has not responded to any of the discovery
requests. (Shapiro Decl., ¶ 12.) 
 
Defendant
does not oppose or otherwise respond to any of the discovery
motions.  
 
There
is no evidence before the court that would indicate Defendant responded to any
of these discovery requests. 
 
The
court grants Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories and
Request for Production of Documents, Sets One, propounded on April 24, 2024. 
 
Defendant
shall provide initial responses, without objections, to the Form
Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents, sets one, within
fourteen (14) days of the issuance of this order.  
 
            The court grants Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Request for
Admissions Admitted. Request for Admission, set one, is deemed admitted. 
 
Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions in connection with this discovery motion. (Motion, at
pp. 9-11.) The court does not have evidence before it that would indicate there
were timely responses, that there is substantial justification for the failure
to respond, or that there are other circumstances that would make the
imposition of a sanction unjust. Thus, the Court must impose monetary
sanctions.   
 
Plaintiff
requests monetary sanction in the amount of $1,060.00 composed of a $60.00
filing fee for this motion and $1,000.00 for the hours spent preparing this
motion (4.00 hours at a $250.00 billing rate per hour). (Motion, at pp. 10-11;
Shapiro Decl., ¶ 13.)  
 
The court
finds that the hourly rates and costs incurred are reasonable. The court AWARDS
monetary sanctions for Plaintiff and against Defendant in the total amount of
$1,060.00.  
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Compel Responses to
Form Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents, Set One,
Propounded on April 24, 2024 is GRANTED.
