And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer and motion to strike filed by American Honda Motor Company, Inc. The court has ordered that the demurrer and motion to strike be continued to May 15, 2024. The court has also advanced the motion to transfer venue to May 13, 2024. The court notes that the demurrer and motion to strike do not implicate Song-Beverly, and therefore, plaintiff must separately account for the time devoted to these motions in their counsel's time records.
