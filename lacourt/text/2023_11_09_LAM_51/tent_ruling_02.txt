Plaintiff notes she tried to serve Moving Defendant’s officer earlier this year
at C & C North America’s office and the officer’s home in Florida.

The court disregards Plaintiff’s authority that is not reported. [Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 8.1115.] The court declines to review those federal cases from
district courts and circuits other than the 9th Circuit. Additionally, Plaintiff
admits she has not yet received the return receipt. Accordingly, service in
this method is not yet effective. [CCP § 415.50.]

The only method of service under California law which does not require the
transmission of documents abroad, and consequently does not implicate the Hague
Service Convention, is service of summons by publication where the party's
address remains unknown during the publication period despite the exercise of
reasonable diligence.”  (Kott supra, 45 Cal.App.4th, at p. 1136.)
Plaintiff may argue that it attempted service in Florida but could not do so.
This argument does not excuse Plaintiff from transmitting the documents to
Spain’s central authority.

The court refers to HCCH authority indicating that Spain does not oppose
Articles 10(a) – (c). https://www.hcch.net/en/states/authorities/details3/?aid=273
