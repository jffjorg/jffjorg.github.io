And here is the summary in English text:

Judge Upinder S. Kalra has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ana Gonzalez v. ADB Global Trade LLC, et al. (Case No. 21STCV06984). The case involves a motion to quash service of summons filed by Specially-Appearing Defendant Cosentino Group, S.A. (Moving Defendant). The Moving Defendant argues that the service of the summons and complaint did not comply with the Hague Service Convention, while the Plaintiff argues that service was valid.

The court has agreed with the Moving Defendant that service did not comply with the Hague Service Convention. The court found that the Plaintiff did not transmit the summons and complaint to Spain's central authority for service on the Moving Defendant, and that service by Federal Express did not comply with California law.

As a result, the court has granted the motion to quash service of summons, finding that the service was invalid. The Moving Party is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
