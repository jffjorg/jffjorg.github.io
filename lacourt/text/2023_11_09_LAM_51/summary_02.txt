And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is currently considering the method of service for the plaintiff's summons. The plaintiff attempted to serve the moving defendant's officer at C & C North America's office and the officer's home in Florida, but the officer's address remains unknown and the plaintiff has not yet received the return receipt. The court finds that this method of service is not yet effective and notes that the plaintiff has not transmitted the documents to Spain's central authority, as required.

The court also references California law, which permits service of summons by publication where the party's address remains unknown during the publication period despite the exercise of reasonable diligence. The plaintiff may argue that it attempted service in Florida but could not do so, but this argument does not excuse the plaintiff from transmitting the documents to Spain's central authority.

Finally, the court references HCCH authority indicating that Spain does not oppose Articles 10(a)-(c) of the Hague Service Convention. The court's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff must use service of summons by publication in order to comply with California law and international treaty obligations.
