LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Evidentiary
Objections
 
This court is unaware of any legal
authority which requires a court to rule on evidentiary objections on a motion,
except as to a motion for summary motion/adjudication [CCP § 437c (q)] or
a special motion to strike [CCP § 425.16 (b)(2); see also, Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019)
6 Cal.5th 931, 947-949.] As such, this court respectfully declines to rule
on any of these objections.  This Court is well aware of the rules of
evidence, and to how much weight, if any, should be given to any of the
proposed evidence.
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
The court denies Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice.¿ 
 
Motion to Quash
 
A defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over
it.  (Code Civ. Proc. (CCP) § 418.10,
subd. (a).)  CCP § 418.10 provides the
exclusive procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset.  (Roy v.
Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 337, 342.)  Although the defendant is the moving party,
the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to defeat the motion by establishing
that jurisdictional grounds exist.  (Mihlon v. Superior Court (1985) 169
Cal.App.3d 703, 710.) 
 
CCP § 413.10, subdivision (c) states “[e]xcept as otherwise
provided by statute, a summons shall be served on a person: . . . Outside the
United States, as provided in this chapter or as directed by the court in which
the action is pending, or, if the court before or after service finds that the
service is reasonably calculated to give actual notice, as prescribed by the
law of the place where the person is served or as directed by the foreign
authority in response to a letter rogatory. These rules are subject to the
provisions of the Convention on the “Service Abroad of Judicial and
Extrajudicial Documents” in Civil or Commercial Matters (Hague Service
Convention).”  Spain is a signatory to
the Hague Service Convention. 
(Convention Done at the Hague November 15, 1965; (Feb. 10, 1969) 20
U.S.T. 361, T.I.A.S. No. 6638.)   
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Motion to Quash –
Hague Service Convention
 
Moving Defendant is a Spanish company headquartered in Spain
and contends that Plaintiff did not comply with the Hague Service Convention
because Plaintiff first tried to personally serve an officer while he was
visiting Canada and Plaintiff’s second attempt via Federal Express was not
valid service under California law.[1]
 Plaintiff argues that she served Moving
Defendant personally, via Federal Express, and via U.S. Mail with return
receipt requested.[2]
 
“The Hague Service Convention states each signatory nation
shall designate a central authority through which service of process may be
effected. (Hague Convention, art. 2.) That authority receives documents and
serves them in accordance with either the internal law of the receiving state
or a compatible method requested by the sender. The authority then provides the
sender with a certificate of service. (Hague Convention, arts. 5, 6.)” (Kott v. Superior Court¿(1996) 45
Cal.App.4th 1126, 1134.)  
 
“Failure to properly serve a party who resides outside the
country under the Hague Service Convention renders all subsequent proceedings
void as to that person. [Citation] This is true even when the party
indisputably had notice of the action.” 
(In re Alyssa F. (2003) 112
Cal.App.4th 846, 852.)  “Failure to
comply with the Hague Service Convention procedures voids the service even
though it was made in compliance with California law. . . .” (Kott v. Superior Court (1996) 45
Cal.App.4th 1126, 1136 (Kott).)  “In cases governed by the Hague Service
Convention, service by mail is permissible if two conditions are met: first,
the receiving state has not objected to service by mail; and second, service by
mail is authorized under otherwise-applicable law.” (Inversiones Papaluchi S.A.S. v. Superior Court (2018) 20
Cal.App.5th 1055, 1065-66 (Inversiones).)
The validity of a service method “must come from California law.” (Id. at 1066 [referring to service by Federal
Express.])
 
Here, the court agrees with Moving Defendant that service
did not comply with the Hague Service Convention. First, Plaintiff provides no relevant
authority that personal service on Mr. Cosentino in Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada complied with the Hague Service Convention. Second, Plaintiff does not
contend that she ever transmitted the summons and complaint to Spain’s central
authority, under Article 6 of the Hague Service Convention, for service on
Moving Defendant.[3]
Third, California does not allow service of the summons and complaint by
Federal Express. In Inversiones, the
Plaintiff served a Columbian defendant by Federal Express and via email. (Inversiones, supra, 20 Cal.App.5th at 1061.) The Court found that
Federal Express service did not comply with the Hague Service Convention because
“service by Federal Express did not constitute valid service of process under
California law.” (Id. at 1067.) As in
Inversiones, here, Spain does not
object to service by mail and Plaintiff attempted to serve Moving Defendant by
Federal Express at its corporate headquarters in Spain.[4]
(Metzger Decl., Exhibit 7, FedEx Confirmation.) Accordingly, service did not
comply with the Hague Service Convention and is therefore invalid.
 
Therefore, the court GRANTS Moving Defendant’s motion to
quash service of summons.
 
Personal
Jurisdiction
 
The court declines to develop this argument as moot.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      
Motion
to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED.
 
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
