And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint. The Court grants the motion, but with conditions. The proposed First Amended Complaint must be revised to remove improper allegations and correct the names of defendants. The Plaintiffs are ordered to file and serve a stand-alone copy of the proposed First Amended Complaint within 10 days of the order. The Court notes that the proposed First Amended Complaint contains irrelevant allegations and improper dumping of hazardous waste claims. The Court declines to address these issues at this time. The Court observes that the proposed First Amended Complaint includes allegations regarding silica-containing stone products, which are improper.
