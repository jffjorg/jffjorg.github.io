And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has denied the Cross-Defendants' motion to strike the cross-complaint filed in the fee action (BC616434) as redundant as to the complaint in the legal malpractice action (BC594432). The Court found that the cross-complaint is not duplicative of the claims in the Murrays' complaint and that the Cross-Defendants failed to demonstrate what new or different facts, circumstances, or law warrant a different ruling. The Court also noted that the Cross-Defendants failed to address the prior ruling on the demurrer to the cross-complaint and failed to demonstrate what new or different facts, circumstances, or law warrant a different ruling.
