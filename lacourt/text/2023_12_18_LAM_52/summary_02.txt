Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules in favor of plaintiff Lajos "Lali" Hugyetz's motion to compel defendant Equinox Holdings, Inc. to provide a further response to special interrogatory No. 41. The interrogatory asks the defendant to identify the full name, address, telephone number, and date of hire for the first three personal trainers hired at the gym where the plaintiff worked. The defendant objected to the interrogatory on the grounds that it is overbroad in time and seeks private information, but the judge finds that the objection is meritless. The judge also finds that the information sought is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and does not violate the privacy rights of third parties. The judge orders the defendant to provide a further verified response without objections to special interrogatory No. 41 within 20 days.
