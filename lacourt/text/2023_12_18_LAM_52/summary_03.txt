Summary:

The tentative ruling grants defendant Easy Financial, LLC's motion to expunge the lis pendens recorded by plaintiff 630 Quebec LLC. The court finds that the plaintiff has not met its burden of showing the probable validity of its real property claims. The plaintiff's opposition fails to properly cite evidence and relies on vague and conclusory statements. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not established a breach of the "forbearance agreement" and verbal "foreclosure agreement" or any other agreement to modify a loan or cure a default. As a result, the court grants defendant's motion to expunge the lis pendens.
