And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction will be continued to June 26, 2024. The court has not yet made a final decision on the motion. The court notes that the defendant has provided evidence that it is incorporated and headquartered in Florida, which establishes that California has no general jurisdiction over the defendant. The court also finds that the defendant has not engaged in business in California, and that the plaintiff's allegations of exposure to asbestos products in California are disputed. The court has ordered the parties to file supplemental opposition and reply briefs based on regular notice, and has given notice to the moving party.
