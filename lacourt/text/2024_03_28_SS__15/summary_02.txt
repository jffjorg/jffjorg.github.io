Significant Statements:

(Weber v. John Crane, Inc. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1433, 1440)
  - "The standard under FELA is a relaxed one, and it is well established that the 'evidence required to establish liability in a FELA case is much less than in an ordinary negligence action.'"

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The defendant argued that the plaintiff, Alfred Hernandez, cannot establish medical causation for his renal cell carcinoma, which he alleges was caused by his exposure to asbestos while employed by BNSF Railway Company. The defendant presented expert testimony and evidence that the plaintiff's cancer was not caused by his exposure to toxins at work. However, the plaintiff presented competing expert opinions that the plaintiff's exposure to toxins contributed to his renal cancer. The judge found that there are disputed issues of fact, including the question of whether the plaintiff's exposure to toxins caused his renal cancer, and that the defendant's evidence was not sufficient to shift the burden to the plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact. The judge also rejected the defendant's arguments that the plaintiff's experts' opinions were not based on sufficient evidence and that the plaintiff's smoking history contributed to his renal cancer. Finally, the judge noted that the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the issue of duty under the Locomotive Inspection Act was not properly filed and was therefore denied.
