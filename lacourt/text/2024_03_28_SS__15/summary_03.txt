And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to stay the action filed by Nissan North America, Inc. and Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc. The defendants argued that Oregon is a suitable alternative forum because most of the defendants are subject to jurisdiction in Oregon, and the statute of limitations does not bar the plaintiffs' claims. However, the judge finds that the defendants did not show that most of the defendants are subject to jurisdiction in Oregon, and that California has an interest in regulating the activities of at least some of the defendants. The judge balances the private interests of the parties and the public interest in keeping the case in California, finding that Oregon is not a suitable alternative forum for 70% of the defendants.
