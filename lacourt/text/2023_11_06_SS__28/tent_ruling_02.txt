 Case Number:  22STCV01467    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2023    Dept:  28 


        Having considered the moving,
  opposing, and reply papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
 On January 13, 2022,
  Plaintiff Margaret Lopez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants
  Archdiocese of Los Angeles Education & Welfare Corporation (“Defendant”)
  and Does 1-100 for general negligence and premises liability. 
 On June 22, 2022, Defendant
  filed an answer. 
 On August 15, 2023,
  Defendant filed motions (1) to compel further responses to requests for
  production of documents, set three, and for sanctions and (2) to compel
  further responses to special interrogatories, set three, and for sanctions.  The hearings were scheduled for September 28
  and 29, 2023.  On September 14, 2023,
  Plaintiff filed oppositions.  On September
  25, 2023, Defendant filed replies.  The
  Court continued the hearings on the motions to November 30, 2023.  The Court later advanced the hearings to November 6, 2023. 
 Trial is currently
  scheduled for December 15, 2023. 
PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
 A.      Informal Discovery Conference 
 The Eighth Amended Standing
  Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts Effective October 10,
  2022 (Filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub Courts will not hear
  Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery until the parties
  have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion
  to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and
  complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further
  Responses to Discovery.” 
 The parties participated in
  an IDC on July 11, 2023. The parties reached an agreement that was memorialized in a
  notice of outcome which Defendant filed on July 13, 2023.  The notice of outcome states in part:
 “Plaintiff
  contends that her attorneys have conducted a reasonable inquiry and diligent
  search and have been unable to obtain the information requested by
  Defendant’s discovery. Plaintiff has agreed to provide further responses to
  each of the discovery requests at issue. In further responding to Defendant’s
  Special Interrogatories, Plaintiff will confirm that the requested
  information is unknown both to herself and her current and former attorneys.
  In further responding to Defendant’s document production requests, Plaintiff
  will state her inability to comply in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure
  section 2031.230.”  
 B.       Timeliness of Motions 
 A notice of motion to
  compel further responses must be given within 45 days of the service of the
  responses, or any supplemental responses, or on or before any specific later
  date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
  2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c).) Failure to file a motion within
  this time period constitutes a waiver of any right to compel further responses
  to requests for production of documents and interrogatories.
 Defendant asserts that
  Plaintiff never provided a verification for her responses to Defendant’s request
  for production of documents, set three, which Plaintiff served on March 20,
  2023.  As a result, Defendant argues, no
  deadline existed to file a motion to compel further responses.  Plaintiff, however, contends that she
  served a verification by email on June 28, 2023, triggering the 45-day period
  to file a motion to compel.  According
  to Plaintiff, the deadline was August 14, 2023, the day before Defendant
  filed the motion. 
 Even assuming that Plaintiff
  served the verification for the responses to the requests for production of documents on June 28, 2023, Defendant had 45 days plus 2 days (due
  to service by email) from June 28 to file the motion to compel further responses to those requests. 
  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B), 2031.310, subd. (c).)  The motion was timely because Defendant filed it before the August 16, 2023 deadline.  For the same reason, the motion to compel further
  responses to special interrogatories, set three – for which Plaintiff served
  a verification on June 28, 2023 – is timely. 
 C.   Meet and Confer 
 “A motion to compel must be
  accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure
  section 2016.040.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
  §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)  “A meet and confer declaration must state
  facts showing a reasonable and good-faith attempt at an informal resolution
  of each issue presented by the motion.” 
  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
 Defendant has satisfied its
  meet and confer obligation. 
 D.      Separate Statement 
 With exceptions that do not
  apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, requires that any motion
  involving the content of discovery contain a separate statement with the text
  of each request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons
  for why an order compelling further responses is warranted.  
 Defendant filed separate statements
  for both motions. 
APPLICABLE LAW 
 A.      Inspection demand 
 “(a)
  On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
  sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further
  response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following
  apply: 
 “(1)
  A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete. 
 “(2)
  A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
  evasive. 
 “(3)
  An objection in the response is without merit or too general. 
 “(b)
  A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with each of the following: 
 “(1)
  The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
  discovery sought by the demand. 
 “(2)
  The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
  Section 2016.040. 
 “(3)
  In lieu of a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court,
  the court may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the
  discovery request and each response in dispute. 
 “(c)
  Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the
  verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any
  specific later date to which the demanding party and the responding party
  have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a
  further response to the demand. 
 *
  * * 
 “(h)
  Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary
  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any
  party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
  compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
  the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
  make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
  subds. (a), (b), (c), (h).) 
 Code of Civil Procedure
  section 2031.230 provides: 
 “A
  representation of inability to comply with the particular demand for
  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent search
  and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that
  demand. This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is
  because the particular item or category has never existed, has been
  destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no
  longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party. The
  statement shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or
  organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or
  control of that item or category of item.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.) 
 B.       Interrogatories 
 Code of Civil Procedure
  section 2030.300, subdivision (a) provides:         
 “On
  receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for
  an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that
  any of the following apply: 
 “(1)
  An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. 
 “(2)
  An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
  unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. 
 “(3)
  An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.”(Code
  Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).) 
 Code of Civil Procedure
  section 2030.220, subdivision (c), provides: 
 “If
  the responding party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond
  fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a
  reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to
  other natural persons or organizations, except where the information is
  equally available to the propounding party.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220,
  subd. (c).) 
 C.    Discovery sanctions 
 “The court may impose a
  monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
  process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
  expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
  conduct. The court may also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully
  asserting that another has engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or
  on any attorney who advised that assertion, or on both. If a monetary
  sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose
  that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
  substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
  the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ.
  Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
 “Misuses of the discovery
  process include . . . 
 “(d) Failing to respond or
  to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2023.010.) 
I.        Defendant’s
  motion to compel further responses to demand for production of documents, set
  three, numbers 40 and 45 [1]
  Propounded: January 19, 2023
 Unverified responses: March
  20, 2023
 Amended responses: August
  23, 2023
  Granted:  40, 45  At the IDC, the parties agreed that "[i]n further responding to Defendant’s document production requests, Plaintiff will state her inability to comply in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.230.”  Plaintiff's amended responses do not satisfy the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.230.   Defendant requests
  sanctions of $888.78 based on 2.5 hours of attorney time at a rate of $325
  per hour.  Counsel spent 1.5 hours to
  prepare the motion and anticipated spending 1.0 hour to prepare a reply and
  attend the hearing.  In addition,
  Defendant seeks recovery of a hearing reservation fee of $61.65 and a charge
  of $14.63 to electronically file the motion. 
 The Court grants sanctions
  of $701.28 based on 2.5 hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250
  per hour plus the hearing reservation fee and charge for electronic filing. 
II.      Defendant’s
  motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, set three, numbers
  79 through 86 
 Propounded: February 2,
  2023
 Unverified responses:  March 20, 2023
 Verification provided: June
  28, 2023
 Amended responses: August
  23, 2023
  Denied: 79, 80, 81, 82, 83,
  84, 85, 86
 At the IDC, the parties agreed that "[i]n further responding to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Plaintiff will confirm that the requested information is unknown both to herself and her current and former attorneys."  In her August 23, 2023 amended responses, Plaintiff provided this confirmation.  Although Defendant argues that "Plaintiffs further responses continue to be deficient," Defendant has not shown that Plaintiff's amended responses violate Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.220, subdivision (c). 
CONCLUSION 
 The Court GRANTS Defendant Archdiocese
  of Los Angeles Education & Welfare Corporation’s motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production of documents, set three, request numbers 40

  of Los Angeles Education & Welfare Corporation’s motion to compel further
  responses to special interrogatories, set three, special interrogatory numbers
  79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86.
  The Court GRANTS Defendant Archdiocese
  of Los Angeles Education & Welfare Corporation’s requests for sanctions
  on the motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents, set three, and orders Plaintiff Margaret Lopez and her counsel to pay Defendant
  Archdiocese of Los Angeles Education & Welfare Corporation $701.28 by November 27, 2023. The Court DENIES Defendant Archdiocese of Los Angeles Education & Welfare Corporation's request for sanctions on the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, set three.
