And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Gregory Johnson, is seeking a default judgment against Ground Zero Customs, LLC for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and other claims. The plaintiff served the defendant on June 30, 2021, and the defendant's default was entered on August 2, 2021. The court dismissed Does 1-10 at the plaintiff's request, but the plaintiff has not dismissed Does 11-50.

The court finds that the plaintiff's request for default judgment is deficient because the plaintiff has not dismissed all parties against whom judgment is not sought, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7). The court denies the application for default judgment without prejudice and orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
