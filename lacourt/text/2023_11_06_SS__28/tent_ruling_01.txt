considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
June 24, 2019, Plaintiff Gregory Johnson (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Ground Zero Customs, LLC (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for
breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
fraud: intentional misrepresentation, fraud: false promises, and fraud:
negligent misrepresentation. 
On
June 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing service on Defendant,
through the Secretary of State, of the summons, complaint, statement of damages,
and other documents on June 30, 2021. 
On
August 2, 2021, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
October 26, 2021, August 12, 2022, and February 15, 2023, the Court dismissed Does
1-10 without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
September 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment of $50,000 against Defendant. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court enter a default judgment against Defendant and award Plaintiff $50,000.00, consisting of $50,000.00 in
general damages, $0.00 in prejudgment interest, $0.00 in attorney’s fees, and
$0.00 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2)  Declarations
or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A declaration
of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against specified
parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
          On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a cause of
action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence
establishing a prima facie case for damages.” 
(L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure), citing
Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred
in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's
default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal injury
cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount listed in
the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585, subd. (b).)
“The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental
fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494
(Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken against
them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is taken
against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a right to a
hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A trial court
exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified
in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494; see Cal.
Practice Guide: Procedure, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.) 
The
court “shall hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and shall render
judgment in the plaintiff’s favor for that relief, not exceeding the amount
stated in the complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11, or in the
statement provided for by Section 425.115, as appears by the evidence to be
just. If the taking of an account, or the proof of any fact, is necessary to enable
the court to give judgment or to carry the judgment into effect, the court may
take the account or hear the proof . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff’s
complaint named Does 1-50 as defendants. 
At Plaintiff’s request, the Court dismissed Does 1-10.  However, Plaintiff has not dismissed Does 11-50.  A party seeking default judgment must dismiss
“all parties against whom judgment is not sought” or “appl[y] for separate
judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).) 
The
Court denies the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the application for default judgment without prejudice. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
