significant_statements:

  - The subpoena is overly broad and should be limited to documents evidencing any transfer of over $500 made to and from the A-May Investment trust accounts held by Liang LLP starting from January 2020, excluding billing invoices, who paid the invoices, and documents that would identify the firm's clients.
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court grants Liang Ly LLP's motion to quash the order for appearance and examination and subpoena duces tecum. The court finds that the subpoena is overly broad and should be limited to documents evidencing any transfer of over $500 made to and from the A-May Investment trust accounts held by Liang LLP starting from January 2020, excluding billing invoices, who paid the invoices, and documents that would identify the firm's clients. The court also finds that the order for appearance and examination is proper because it seeks documents from Mr. Liang and Liang LLP upon information and belief that they hold a special trust account on behalf of A-May Investment LLC. The court denies Plaintiff's request for attorney's fees and sanctions.
