ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On August 28,
2023, Plaintiff Silvia Vargas (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Bryan Titus
Allison (“Defendant”) and Does 1-25 alleging causes of action for Motor Vehicle
and General Negligence. (Compl., ¶
10.) 
 
On June 28, 2024,
Counsel for Plaintiff, Barry Carl Eisenberg (“Counsel”) of the Eisenberg Law
Group filed a Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.
 
On August 1,
2024, the Court found several deficiencies with Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel – namely, the Motion lacked a MC-052 Form (Declaration of Counsel),
MC-053 Form (Proposed Order), and Proof of Service of the Motion. (8/1/24
Order.) The Court denied the motion without prejudice. (8/1/24 Order.)
 
On August 8,
2024, Counsel filed the instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the “Motion”).
 
 
On September 24,
2024, the Court did not call a hearing and determined Counsel’s proposed Order (MC-053
Form) granting the Motion to be deficient because the Order was blank. The
Court, on its own motion, continued the Hearing on the Motion to allow Counsel
to serve and submit a perfected proposed Order. (9/24/24 Order.)
 
On September 30,
2024, Counsel filed a new proposed Order (MC-053 Form).
 
On October 29,
2024, the hearing on the Motion was continued due to the Court’s
unavailability. (10/29/24 Order.)
 
No Opposition to
the Motion has been filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 284 states that “the attorney in an action…may be
changed at any time before or after judgment or final determination, as
follows: (1) Upon the consent of both client and attorney…; (2) Upon the order
of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice
from one to the other.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 284; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)  “The determination whether to grant or deny a
motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial
court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th
1128, 1133); see Lempert v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th
1161, 1173.) 
 
An application
to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Forms MC-051 (Notice
of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) 
 
In addition,
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 subsection (d) requires that the notice
of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal service,
electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by electronic service, it
must be accompanied by a declaration stating that the electronic service
address is the client’s current electronic service address. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d)(2).) As used in this rule, “current” means: 
 
“[T]he address
was confirmed within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved. 
Merely
demonstrating that the notice was sent to the client’s last known address and
was not returned or no electronic delivery failure message was received is not,
by itself, sufficient to demonstrate that the address is current.” 
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subd. (d).) 
 
III.             
Discussion
 
On August 8,
2024, Counsel moved the Court to
relieve him as attorney of record for Plaintiff. (MC-051.) Counsel’s filed MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053
Forms. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) Counsel
seeks to be relieved due to a
breakdown of the attorney-client relationship (MC-052, ¶ 2.) The Court is
satisfied with Counsel’s reasons for seeking to be relieved. 
 
While Counsel rectified past
deficiencies, the Motion still contains errors. The MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053
Forms do not list the proper court address, the Proposed Order (MC-053 Form)
does not list the instant hearing as the next hearing date (MC-053, ¶ 7), and
there is no proof of service of the MC-053 form.
 
Although the Court is satisfied with
Counsel’s reasons for seeking to be relieved, the Court cannot grant the Motion
without adequate forms. 
 
IV.             
Conclusion & Order
 
Accordingly, Counsel Silvia
Vargas’s Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel for Plaintiff is CONTINUED to JANUARY 21, 2025 at 10:00 a.m.
in Department 25 at the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. 
 
At least 16 court days before the next
scheduled hearing, Counsel must file and serve supplemental papers correcting
the errors noted herein. Failure to do so will result in the Motions being
placed off calendar or denied.  
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel is ordered to give
notice.
