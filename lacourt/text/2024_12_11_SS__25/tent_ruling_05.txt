ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff Creditors
Adjustment Bureau, Inc (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Heart of
Angels Limited Liability Company aka Heart of Angels LLC aka Heart of Angels (“Defendant”)
and Does 1-10 requesting damages of $13,247.04 and alleging a Promissory Note
cause of action. (Compl., pp. 1-3.)
 
On October 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Enforce Settlement Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6 (the “Motion”). 
 
No Opposition was filed.   
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes
that while a “Settlement Agreement” is attached to the Motion, Plaintiff neither
notified the Court of this alleged settlement nor requested entry of dismissal.

 
According to California Rules of Court
rule 3.1385, “If an entire case is settled or otherwise disposed of, each
plaintiff or other party seeking affirmative relief must immediately file
written notice of the settlement or other disposition with the court and serve
the notice on all parties and any arbitrator or other court-connected
alternative dispute resolution (ADR) neutral involved in the case. Each
plaintiff or other party seeking affirmative relief must also immediately give
oral notice to all of the above if a hearing, conference, or trial is scheduled
to take place within 10 days.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1385, subd.
(a)(1).)
 
Further, “[e]xcept as provided in
[subdivisions] (c) or (d), each plaintiff or other party seeking affirmative
relief must serve and file a request for dismissal of the entire case within 45
days after the date of settlement of the case. If the plaintiff or other party
required to serve and file the request for dismissal does not do so, the court
must dismiss the entire case 45 days after it receives notice of settlement
unless good cause is shown why the case should not be dismissed.” (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1385, subd. (a)(1).)
 
III.             
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6: 
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the
parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
 
(1) The party. 
(2) An attorney who represents the
party. 
(3) If an insurer is defending and
indemnifying a party to the action, an agent who is authorized in writing by
the insurer to sign on the party’s behalf. This paragraph does not apply if the
party whom the insurer is defending would be liable under the terms of the
settlement for any amount above the policy limits.” 
 
The Settlement filed by Plaintiff was electronically
signed by Defendant’s owner on August 6, 2024, and Plaintiff’s “EVP” on
September 25, 2024 on September 25, 2024. (Settlement, p. 3.)
 
The Settlement states
Defendant is to pay a total sum of $15,543.24, reflecting three separate payments
of $5,181.08 to be made as follows: (1) the first payment shall be due on or
before July 30, 2024; (2) the second payment shall be due on or before August
30, 2024; and (3) the third payment shall be due on or before September 30,
2024. (Settlement, ¶ 1.)
 
The Settlement then
states: “This Agreement shall be a judicially enforceable settlement under the
terms of Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. In the event that any party to
this agreement is in breach under any terms of performance due from that party
hereunder, then the non-breaching party may bring a motion with the Los Angeles
County Superior Court under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The
prevailing party under any motion to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled
to collect reasonable attorney's fees and costs associated with bringing said
motion.” (Settlement, ¶ 9.) 
 
The Court finds the
Settlement to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6. Plaintiff requests a judgment of $15,543.24 to be entered against
Defendant (Motion, p. 3) based on the terms of settlement outlined in the
Settlement, Paragraphs 1. 
 
Notwithstanding, the Court
notes that the address listed in Proof of Service for the Motion does not
correspond with the address listed in the Proof of Services for the Summons and
Complaint. Thus, the Court will require Moving party to clarify the discrepancy
prior to the next hearing date. 
 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s
Motion is CONTINUED.
 
IV.

Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc.’s Motion to
Enforce Settlement is CONTINUED to JANUARY 27, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in
Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse.

ruling.
