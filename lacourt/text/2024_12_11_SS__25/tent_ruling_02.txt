ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On July 28, 2023, Plaintiff Alternative
Lending Holdings Trust II (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant
Ernest Miller (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 5, alleging a single cause of
action for Breach of Written Contract. (Compl., p. 1.)
 
The Complaint alleges the following: “Defendant(s)
(hereinafter the ‘Defendant’) entered into a Borrower Agreement (hereinafter
the ‘Borrower Agreement’) and Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (hereinafter
the ‘Promissory Note’) with WebBank, a Utah-Chartered FDICinsured industrial
Bank (hereinafter ‘WebBank’) for the Loan ID Number XXXXX0261 (hereinafter the
‘Loan’).” (Compl., ¶ 1.) The Promissory Note and the Borrower Agreement were
purchased by Upgrade, Inc. and were subsequently sold and assigned to Plaintiff.
(Compl., ¶ 10.) “On or about May 05, 2022 Plaintiff’s predecessor issued and
funded the loan request of the Defendants.” (Compl., ¶ 19.) Defendant defaulted
by failing to make the required payments. (Compl., ¶ 20.) There is due and
owing the principal sum of $7,039.21. (Compl., ¶ 22.)
 
On January 25, 2024, default was
entered against Defendant.
 
On March 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Stipulated
Settlement Agreement” (the “Stipulation”). 
 
On April 2, 2024, the Honorable Mark
Windham signed an order dismissing the action but retaining jurisdiction under
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. (4/2/24 Order.)
 
On August 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Enter Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation (the “Motion”). No
Opposition was filed. 
 
On September 11, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on the Motion from October 17, 2024, to October 23, 2024
due to the Court’s unavailability. (9/11/24 Order.) 
 
On October 23, 2024, the Court held a
hearing on the Motion and found the Stipulation was “reasonably well-defined
and certain regarding Defendant’s payment obligations and the consequences for
not making those payments.” (10/23/24 Order.) The Court found “Defendant
expressly acknowledged that he understood and agreed to be bound by [the
Stipulation’s] terms by signing the agreement.” The Court then found that “[t]hrough
its counsel’s declaration, Plaintiff has met its burden of showing that
Defendant has defaulted on his payments under the agreement. Defendant has not
filed any opposition indicating otherwise.” (10/23/24 Order.) However, the
Court continued the Motion because Notice of Continuance was not provided by
Plaintiff/Moving party as ordered by the Court on September 11, 2024. Thus, the
Court continued the hearing to allow Plaintiff to provide proper notice and
proof of service.  (10/23/24 Order.)
 
On November 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed
Notice of Ruling and proof of service of the Notice of Ruling. After reviewing
the Notice and proof of service, the Court finds the deficiencies from October
23, 2024 to be remedied.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6: 
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the
parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
 
(1) The party. 
(2) An attorney who represents the
party. 
(3) If an insurer is defending and
indemnifying a party to the action, an agent who is authorized in writing by
the insurer to sign on the party’s behalf. This paragraph does not apply if the
party whom the insurer is defending would be liable under the terms of the
settlement for any amount above the policy limits.” 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)
 
The Stipulation filed by
Plaintiff was signed by Defendant on March 7, 2024, and Plaintiff’s counsel on March
22, 2024. (3/27/24 Stipulation, p. 5.) 
 
The Stipulation provides
the matter would be settled for a total sum of $7,039.00. (3/27/24 Stipulation,
¶ 5.) The Stipulation states Defendant is to pay the total sum of $7,039.00, reflecting
an initial payment of $215.00 due on March 28, 2024, 22 monthly payments of $215.00
beginning on April 28, 2024, and a final payment of $230.00 due on February 28,
2026. (3/27/24 Stipulation, ¶ 5.) The Stipulation also states Defendant will
forward to Plaintiff Defendants’ first appearance fee in a check of $225.00
made payable to the “CLERK OF THE COURT.” (3/27/24 Stipulation, ¶ 5.) Further,
the Stipulation states Defendant will be entitled to a discount if Defendant
makes each installment payment when due. (3/27/24 Stipulation, ¶ 6.)
 
The Stipulation further
states that failure to make a full and timely payment constitutes a default
and, in the event of default, “the full stipulated settlement amount” outlined
in Paragraph 1 of the Stipulation will become due. (3/27/24 Stipulation, ¶ 10.)
The first paragraph of the Stipulation states: “(1) Principal in the amount of
$7,039.21 plus (2) costs in the amount of $363.00; (3) less credits for any and
all amounts paid to PLAINTIFF by DEFENDANT. The total amount of Judgment shall
equal $7,402.21, less credits for any and all payments received.” (3/27/24
Stipulation, ¶ 1.)
 
The Court finds the
Stipulation to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6. Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant made partial payment of
$215.00. (D’Anna Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.) As of the date this Motion was filed,
however, Plaintiff had received no further payments from Defendant. (D’Anna
Decl., ¶ 9.) 
 
Plaintiff requests that a
judgment of $7,187.21 be entered against Defendant. (D’Anna Decl., ¶ 11.) 
 
Based on the principal
amount of $7,039.21, plus costs in the amount of $363.00, less payments
received in the amount of $215.00, the Court finds Plaintiff’s calculation of
$7,187.21 to be in conformance with the Stipulation’s terms. (3/27/24
Stipulation, ¶ 1.)
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s unopposed
Motion is GRANTED. Judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiff in the total
amount of $7,187.21.
