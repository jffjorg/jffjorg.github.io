ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On September 30, 2022, Plaintiff Gerardo
Aguilar (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant Northgate
Gonzalez, LLC (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20, alleging Premises Liability. (Compl.,
pp. 1, 3, 4.) The underlying facts of this dispute involve Plaintiff being
injured on the following premises – Northgate Market, Store #38,944 Slauson
Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90011. (Compl., p. 4.) 
 
On November 3, 2022, Defendant filed
an Answer.
 
On January 17, 2024, the Court granted
the parties’ Stipulation to continue the trial date from March 29, 2024 to September
17, 2024 and to continue all discovery and trial-related deadlines. (1/16/24
Order.) 
 
On September 16, 2024, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application to Continue Trial Date. (9/16/24
Order.) Accordingly, the Jury Trial scheduled for September 17, 2024 was
continued to December 19, 2024. The Court stated that non-expert discovery was
closed with the exception of video tape of Plaintiff. (9/16/24 Order.)
 
On September 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Reclassify and For Leave to Amend Complaint (the
“Motion”). 
 
On October 25, 2024, Defendant filed
an Opposition. 
 
No Reply has been filed.
 
On October 29, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on the Motion from November 7, 2024 to December 11, 2024
due to the Court’s unavailability and calendar congestion. (10/29/24 Order.)
 
On November 8, 2024, Defendant filed a
Stipulation to Continue Trial and Related Trial Dates (the “Stipulation”). 
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
A.     Motion to Reclassify
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 403.040 allows a
plaintiff to file a motion for reclassification of an action within the time
allowed for that party to amend the initial pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., §
403.040, subd. (a).) “A party may amend its pleading once without leave of
court at any time before an answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or
after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed if the amended pleading is filed
and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion
to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a).) If the motion is made after the
time for the plaintiff to amend the pleading, the motion may only be granted if
(1) the case is incorrectly classified; and (2) the plaintiff shows good cause
for not seeking reclassification earlier. (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd.
(b).) 
 
In Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 262, the California
Supreme Court held that a matter may be reclassified from unlimited to
limited only if “the absence of jurisdiction is apparent before trial from
the complaint, petition, or related documents,” or “during the course of
pretrial litigation, it becomes clear that the matter will ‘necessarily’ result
in a verdict below the superior court jurisdictional amount, and the court
affords the parties an opportunity to contest transfer.” (Walker, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 262.) This high standard is appropriate in
light of “the circumscribed procedures and recovery available in the limited
civil courts.” (Ytuarte v. Superior Court
(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 266, 278.)

 
            In Ytuarte, the
Second District Court of Appeal examined the principles set forth in Walker and granted a petition for writ
of mandate regarding the trial court’s denial of a party’s motion to reclassify
her case from limited to unlimited. (Ytuarte, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th 266.) In so
concluding, the Court of Appeal held that “the court should reject the
plaintiff’s effort to reclassify the action as unlimited only when the lack
of jurisdiction as an ‘unlimited’ case is certain and clear.” (Id., at p. 279.) In other words, the
trial court should deny reclassification “only where it appeared to a legal certainty
[the party’s] damages would necessarily be $25,000 or less.” (Id.,
at p. 271.) The Court qualified that a “party must present evidence to
demonstrate a possibility that the verdict will exceed $25,000,” and the
trial court must review the record to determine “whether a judgment in excess
of $25,000.00 is obtainable.” (Id., at pp. 277, 279.) 
 
Moving
Party Position
 
            Plaintiff
seeks to reclassify the action to unlimited jurisdiction on the grounds that
Plaintiff’s counsel mistakenly checked the wrong jurisdictional box on the
Complaint and was not aware of the error until Defense counsel raised the issue
that damages “were limited to $25,000.00” at mediation in August 2024. (Motion,
p. 5; Perez Decl., pp. 3-4.)
In asserting this case could exceed the limited jurisdiction amount, Plaintiff
relies on Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration, medical bills and reports, and
certain items from discovery. (Perez
Decl., p. 3; Exhs. B, D.) Further, Plaintiff states discovery has
proceeded as if the case were unlimited, and Plaintiff filed a settlement
demand of $100,000 to defense counsel on October 12, 2022. (Perez Decl., p. 3,
Exh. C.)
 
Opposition
            
            Defendant
opposes reclassification on the grounds that Plaintiff has not shown good cause
for failing to seek reclassification earlier, and reclassification would be
unfairly prejudicial to Defendant. (Opp., pp. 3-4.) Defendant argues Plaintiff prepared
the instant Complaint nearly thirteen months before filing it (as evidenced by
the dates on the signature dates on the Complaint and Civil Case Cover Sheet
Addendum), and thus it “is hard to believe that in the thirteen months between
preparing and filing the Complaint, that Plaintiff’s counsel would not confirm
that he checked the proper jurisdiction.” (Opp., p. 3; Hsieh Decl., ¶ 4.) In terms of prejudice, Defendant
argues reclassification would be prejudicial because Defendant has been
litigating the matter for two years as if were a limited civil case – for
example, Defendant “has not sought an independent medical examination of
Plaintiff,” and “the only deposition taken in the last two years of litigation
has been of Plaintiff.” (Opp., p. 4.) Finally, Defendant notes the trial date
is fast on the horizon. (Opp., p. 4.)  
 
            Motion
to Reclassify Analysis
 
The instant Motion to Reclassify was filed after
the time to amend the Complaint. Thus, Plaintiff must show that the amount in
controversy exceeds the jurisdiction of this Court and good cause for the
timing of the Motion. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b).) 
 
As to the amount in controversy, Plaintiff
relies on Plaintiff counsel’s declaration, Plaintiff’s medical records,
and items from discovery to
support the claim that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdiction of
this Court. (Perez Decl.; Exhs. B, D.) Plaintiff’s counsel states
Plaintiff’s orthopedic doctor recommends surgery from the subject accident
costing approximately $55,000, which is in addition to already-incurred medical
costs. (Perez Decl., p. 3,
Exh. B, D.) Dated December 16, 2020, Plaintiff’s medical records state that “[i]t
is within reasonable medical probability [Plaintiff] will require right wrist
surgery in the future. [Plaintiff] was referred to LAC/USC for hand surgery
evaluation.” (Exh. B, p. 6.) Plaintiff’s medical records then list the costs
associated for a wrist surgery, which total to be well over $35,000. (Exh. B,
pp. 4-5.) Plaintiff’s counsel also states Plaintiff testified in deposition
that his right hand continues to hurt daily. (Perez Decl., p. 4.)   
 
After reviewing
the record, the Court
finds Plaintiff has demonstrated an Award of over $35,000 is obtainable. (Ytuarte, supra,
129 Cal.App.4th at pp. 277-279.) Plaintiff presents evidence by way
of Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration, Plaintiff’s medical records, and items
from discovery that medical costs may far exceed $35,000.  Plaintiff need only demonstrate the
possibility that a $35,000 award is attainable under Ytuarte; in this
action, Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence for the Court to find such
an award is possible. (Id., at pp. 277, 279.)
 
The Court
reminds the parties that jurisdiction may be defeated only if “it appears to a legal
certainty that plaintiff cannot recover the amount [of the] deman[d].”
(Maldonado v. Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 397, 401, emphasis in
original.) Here, it does not appear, to legal certainty, that Plaintiff cannot
recover more than $35,000.00.  
 
Plaintiff also
has shown good cause for the timing of this Motion. Plaintiff has demonstrated
Plaintiff’s counsel made an inadvertent mistake as to the Complaint form, which
Plaintiff’s counsel then diligently and promptly attempted to rectify as soon
as Counsel was aware of the error. (Perez Decl.) Defendant does not dispute
Plaintiff’s proffered evidence of medical costs exceed $35,000 or that the
parties engaged in discovery as if the rules of unlimited jurisdiction applied.
Further, Defendant’s claims of prejudice ensuing from the re-classification of
the case can be remedied with a continuance of the trial date and a brief
re-opening of discovery. Thus, the Court finds Plaintiff has satisfactorily
demonstrated sufficient good cause for the timing of this Motion. (Perez Decl.) 
 
Moreover, the Court highlights
reclassification is appropriate if “during
the course of pretrial litigation, it becomes clear that the matter will
‘necessarily’ result in a verdict” above the limited jurisdictional amount, and
“the court affords the parties an opportunity to contest transfer.” (Walker, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 262, emphasis
added.)
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED.
 
Motion for
Leave to File Amended Complaint Analysis
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “[t]he court may, in furtherance of justice,
and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading.”
Amendment may be allowed at any time before or after commencement of trial.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 576.) “[T]he court’s discretion will usually be exercised
liberally to permit amendment of the pleadings. The policy favoring amendment
is so strong that it is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be
justified.” (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428 (internal citations omitted).) “If the motion to amend is timely made and
the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error
to refuse permission to amend….” (Morgan v. Sup. Ct. (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in trial, loss of critical
evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit v. Tokai Bank, Ltd. New
York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.) 
            A
motion to amend a pleading before trial must include a copy of the proposed
amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate
it from previous pleadings or amendments. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1324(a).) The motion must also state what allegations are proposed to be
deleted or added, by page, paragraph, and line number. (Ibid.) Finally,
a separate supporting declaration specifying the effect of the amendment, why
the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered, and the reason the request for amendment
was not made earlier must also accompany the motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1324(b).) 
            Initially,
the Court notes that a separate motion should have been filed. Notwithstanding,
the Court finds that Plaintiff’s declaration explains the necessity to file an
Amended Complaint and attaches the Proposed Amended Complaint as Exhibit E.
However, the Amended Complaint erroneously lists it as the “Second”
Amendment.  The Court orders Plaintiff’s
counsel to correct the Proposed Amended Complaint reflecting it as the First -
not Second - Amended Complaint before filing it, within 10 days of this order.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to file First Amended Complaint is
GRANTED. 
B.    
Stipulation
 
The Stipulation is between Plaintiff
and Defendant and signed by both parties’ counsel on November 7, 2024.
(Stipulation, p. 3.) The parties request to continue trial from December 19,
2024 to March 25, 2025, or as soon thereafter as the Court determines.
(Stipulation, p. 1.) The parties allege good cause exists for this continuance
on the following grounds: (1) Plaintiff’s Motion is set for hearing just eight
days before the currently set trial date; (2) Defense counsel spoke to the
Court clerk on November 4, 2024 and discussed ways to continue the trial date;
(3) This is only the second request for a continuance; (4) the parties will
need more time to prepare for trial in the event the Court grants the Motion;
(5) Defense counsel has a calendar conflict with the currently set trial due to
a pre-planned family trip. (Stipulation, ¶ 2, subds. (a)-(e).) 
 
The Stipulation
was served on Plaintiff via electronic service on November 8, 2024.
(Stipulation, p. 5.)
 
In light of the Court’s ruling on the Motion for
Reclassification, all dates, including trial, are hereby VACATED.
