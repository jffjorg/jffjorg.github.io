ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On August 14, 2024, Plaintiff David
Tracy (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, initiated this action against
Defendants Salvation Army (Whittier), Stephanie Ortiz, Shonda Brown, Christina
Cuevas, Melanie Gonzalez, and Emma Cox (“Defendants”). 
 
On September 30, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint. Plaintiff did not file an
Opposition.
 
On October 29, 2024, Defendants filed
a Notice of Plaintiff’s Non-Opposition to the Demurrer, notifying the Court of
Plaintiff’s failure to file an Opposition. 
 
On October 29, 2024, the hearing on
the Demurrer was continued from November 6, 2024, to December 11, 2024 due to
the Court’s unavailability. (10/29/24 Order.)
 
On October 30, 2024, the Court issued
a Nunc Pro Tunc Order correcting the October 29, 2024 Order to add pertinent
details about the rescheduled hearing on the Demurrer. (10/30/24 Order.)
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues 
 
The Court notes that the Notice of the
Demurrer does not provide a specific address for the Court. However, it
provides the proper department and presiding judge.
 
III.             
Legal
Standard
 
“As a general matter, in a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone,
and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes
the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.)
The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it
stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
A general demurrer may be
brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) if
insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted or under
section 430.10, subdivision (a), where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject
of the cause of action alleged in the pleading. All other grounds listed in
Section 430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision (f), are special
demurrers. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).) 
Where a demurrer is
sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015)
244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
IV.             
Discussion

 
A.    
Meet and Confer
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or
by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five
days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a
declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(3).) 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a). In the declaration, Defendants’ counsel attests that Counsel
met and conferred with Plaintiff on September 23, 2024. (Ricardo Decl., ¶ 3.)
Defendants’ counsel confirmed Plaintiff was not represented, explained the
nature of the Demurrer, and asked Plaintiff to withdraw or amend his Complaint;
however, Plaintiff refused to amend or withdraw. (Ricardo Decl., ¶ 3.) 
 
The Court finds the meet and confer
requirement satisfied. 
 
B.    
Demurrer 
 
Defendants demur on the basis the
Complaint is “unintelligible and uncertain” and fails to state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action. (Demurrer MPA, p. 2.) 
 
As to Defendants’ contention that the
Complaint is uncertain, special demurrers, such as those based on uncertainty,
are not permitted in limited jurisdiction courts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd.
(c).) Thus, the Court will only address the Demur as it pertains to the
Complaint’s failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
As to Defendant’s argument that the
Complaint fails to state sufficient facts, the Court agrees. Plaintiff filed a
one-page Complaint alleging the misuse of Defendant’s program manual. (Compl.,
at p. 1.) Plaintiff did not allege any other facts or state an intelligible
cause of action. Further, the exhibits attached to the Complaint do not aid in
determining whether the Complaint states a cause of action.
 
Accordingly, the unopposed
Demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
C.    
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants
Salvation Army (Whittier), Stephanie Ortiz, Shonda Brown, Christina Cuevas,
Melanie Gonzalez, and Emma Cox’s unopposed Demurrer to the Complaint is
SUSTAINED WITH 20 DAYS’ LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice.
