And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (Plaintiff) and Heart of Angels Limited Liability Company (Defendant). The settlement agreement was electronically signed by both parties on August 6, 2024, and September 25, 2024. The agreement states that Defendant is to pay a total sum of $15,543.24, with three separate payments due on July 30, 2024, August 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024. The Court finds the settlement agreement to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.

However, the Court notes that the address listed in Proof of Service for the Motion does not correspond with the address listed in the Proof of Services for the Summons and Complaint. Therefore, the Court requires the Moving party to clarify the discrepancy prior to the next hearing date.

The Court continues the motion to enforce the settlement agreement to January 27, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The Moving party is ordered to give notice of this Court's ruling.
