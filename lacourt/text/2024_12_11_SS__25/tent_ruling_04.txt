Procedural Issues
 
The Court notes
Plaintiffs do not include a proposed order with their Motion. 
 
III.             
Legal Standard & Discussion 
 
Plaintiffs move
to continue trial from August 5, 2025 to October 1, 2025 or later on the
following grounds: this is the first time that Plaintiffs have requested a
trial continuance; Defendants will not suffer prejudice by a two-month continuance
whereas Plaintiffs will suffer prejudice without a trial continuance; Plaintiffs
and Plaintiffs’ counsel are unavailable on August 5, 2025; and the Motion is
not made in close proximity to the August 5, 2025 trial date. (Motion, pp. 5-7;
Niedbalski Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, 8, 11.) Further, Plaintiffs’ counsel state they requested
a continuance of the trial date prior to associating in as Plaintiffs’ counsel
and attempted to informally resolve this matter with Defendants since April 30,
2024. (Motion, p. 7; Niedbalski Decl., ¶¶ 5-7.) Finally, Plaintiffs also state there is
no alternative means to resolve this situation because, without a continuance,
Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ counsel will not be in attendance at trial. (Motion,
p. 7; Niedbalski Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
In Opposition,
Defendants oppose a trial continuance because (1) Plaintiffs selected the trial
date, Plaintiffs’ counsel accepted employment knowing the trial date was set,
and effective counsel should be able to settle this matter before the trial
date; (2) Defendants have attempted various alternative means for resolution of
this dispute to no avail; and (3) Plaintiffs and/or their counsel have engaged
in “unnecessary dilatory delays to harass and incur further legal expenses” for
Defendants. (Opp., pp. 2-4.) 
 
In Reply,
Plaintiffs highlight the Opposition fails to provide any relevant grounds for
the Court to deny Plaintiffs’ request, alleges the Opposition merely brings
attention to Defendants’ “unreasonableness to compromise on any issue,” and
reiterates the arguments made in the Motion. (Reply, pp. 2-3.) 
 
California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332, subdivision (c) states: “Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits. The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance.” Circumstances that may indicate good
cause include: the excused unavailability of a party, trial counsel, or
witness; the substitution of trial counsel if the substitution is required in
the interests of justice; the addition of a new party in certain circumstances;
a party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other
material evidence despite diligent efforts; or a significant, unanticipated
change in the status of the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, subd. (c)(1)-(7).)
 
The Court may also look to the
following factors in determining whether a trial continuance is warranted: (1)
proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance,
extension, or delay of trial due to any party; (3) the length of the
continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address the
problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or
witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; (6) if the case is
entitled to preferential trial setting; (7) the court’s calendar; (8) whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; (9) whether all parties have
stipulated to the continuance; (10) whether the interests of justice are best
served by the continuance; and (11) any other fact or circumstance relevant to
the fair determination of the motion or application.  (See generally Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd.
(d)(1)-(11).)  
 
Here, the Court finds good cause
exists for a trial continuance. Indeed, this is the first trial
continuance in this matter; Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ counsel are unavailable
on August 5, 2025 due to other trials and a pre-planned trip; and the Motion is
made in far proximity from the August 5, 2025 trial date and shortly after the
parties ceased settlement discussions. (Motion, pp. 5-7; Niedbalski Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, 8,
11.) While Defendants broadly claim they will suffer prejudice if trial
is continued to October 2025, the Court neither finds nor do Defendants specify
exactly how a two-month delay in the trial date negatively impacts them or the
case. Finally, Plaintiffs demonstrate there is no alternative means to resolve
this situation because, without a continuance, Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’
counsel will not be in attendance at trial. (Motion, p. 7; Niedbalski Decl., ¶ 10.)
 
Given these circumstances, the
Court finds the interests of justice are best served by a brief continuance.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332.)    
 
Plaintiffs request a continuance
until at least October 1, 2025. (Motion, p. 2.) Plaintiffs’ request is GRANTED.
Trial is CONTINUED TO __________.
