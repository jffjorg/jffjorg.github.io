ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On November 2,
2012, the Justice Court of Maricopa-Stanfield in the County of Pinal entered a
Judgment (the “Judgment”) in favor of Plaintiff Maricopa Meadows Homeowners
Association (“Plaintiff”) and against Defendants Jermayne Cooper and Jeannette
Morgan (“Defendants”). The Judgment was entered in the amount of $1,995.00,
which included $500.00 in attorneys’ fees. (Request for Judicial Notice “RJN,”
Exh. 2, ¶¶ 4, 6.) The Judgment also included “all reasonable costs and
attorneys’ fees incurred by Plaintiff after the entry of this judgment in
collecting the amounts awarded herein.” (RJN, Exh. 2, ¶ 7.) On February 27,
2018, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Attorneys’ Fees seeking a total of
$4,975.50. On April 18, 2018, this Court granted that motion in the reduced
amount of $4,895.50. (4/18/18 Minute Order, p 1.) On August 26, 2019, Plaintiff
filed another motion for attorneys’ fees and costs and a request for judicial
notice. On January 22, 2020, this Court granted that motion in the full amount
of $4,847.73. (1/22/20 Minute Order.)
 
On April 26,
2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiff’s request for
judicial notice filed on December 13, 2022. (4/26/23 Minute Order.) The Court also
granted Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees and costs, also filed on
December 13, 2022, in the amount of $2,388.46. (4/26/23 Minute Order.)
 
            On
October 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees and
Costs (the “Motion”) incurred post-judgment, as well as a request for judicial
notice. 
 
No Opposition
was filed.
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
The Court notes that while much of the
Notice of Motion is proper, there is a discrepancy in the date and time listed
for the instant hearing. While part of the Notice states the correct date and
time, another portion states the instant hearing takes place on “February 2,
2021.” Since the erroneous date is almost four years past and the correct date
and time is also present on the Notice, the Court finds the notice requirements
are substantially met and proceeds to address the merits of the Motion. 
 
III.             
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
The Motion is accompanied by a request
for judicial notice of the (1) Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and
Restrictions of Maricopa Meadows Homeowners Association recorded in the Pinal
County, Arizona Recorder's Office on March 19, 2004 as Instrument No. 2004-019765;
(2) the Judgment entered in the Maricopa Stanfield Justice Court, County of
Pinal, State of Arizona entitled “Maricopa Meadows Homeowners Association v.
Jermayne Cooper and Jeanette Morgan,” case number CV2012-0468; and (3) a copy
of the Notice of Entry of Sister-State Judgment filed and entered in the Los
Angeles Superior Court, case number 16K11483. 
 
The request for judicial notice is GRANTED
pursuant to California Evidence Code section 452, subdivisions (c) and (d).
 
IV.             
Legal
Standard
 
The Court’s objective is to award
attorneys’ fee at the fair market value based on the particular action. (See Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “The reasonable hourly rate is that
prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “ ‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.’ ” (Ketchum, supra,
24 Cal.4th at p. 1134.) The lodestar method is based on several factors, as
relevant to each particular case: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Id., at p. 1132.)
“The ‘ “experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional
services rendered in his court, and while his judgment is of course subject to
review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that
it is clearly wrong.” ’ ” (Ibid.) A negative multiplier is appropriate
when duplicative work is performed. (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819, 834.) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section
685.070, subdivision (a) states in pertinent part: “The judgment
creditor may claim under this section the following costs of enforcing a
judgment: . . . (6) Attorney's fees, if allowed by Section 685.040.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 685.070, subd. (a).) 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 685.040 states: “The judgment creditor is entitled to the
reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment. Attorney’s fees
incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in costs collectible under
this title unless otherwise provided by law. Attorney’s fees incurred in
enforcing a judgment are included as costs collectible under this title if the
underlying judgment includes an award of attorney’s fees to the judgment
creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of
Section 1033.5.” 
 
The motion must
also be brought within two years of the incurred costs. (Code Civ. Proc., §
685.080, subd. (a).)
 
Additionally,
Code of Civil Procedure, section 685.080 subdivision (b) requires that: “[t]he
notice of motion shall describe the costs claimed, shall state their amount,
and shall be supported by an affidavit of a person who has knowledge of the
facts stating that to the person's best knowledge and belief the costs are
correct, are reasonable and necessary, and have not been satisfied. The notice
of motion shall be served on the judgment debtor. Service shall be made
personally or by mail.”
 
V.               
Discussion
 
A.   
Timeliness and Service
 
Here, Plaintiff
seeks fees and costs “incurred from December 13, 2022, to the present.”
(Motion, p. 4; Baillio Decl., ¶ 15.) 
 
As the Motion
was brought on October 1, 2024, within two years of the incurred costs, the
Court finds the Motion to be timely and in conformance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 685.080, subdivision (a).
 
Further,
Plaintiff properly served the judgment debtors by mail on October 1, 2024.
(10/1/24 Proof of Service.)
 
B.    
Attorney’s Fees
 
Since the
judgment from the underlying case awarded Plaintiff attorney’s fees, Plaintiff
is entitled to attorney’s fees in connection with the enforcement of its judgment
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 685.070, subdivision (a)(6). 
 
A court
determining the number of hours reasonably expended on a case “must carefully
review attorney documentation of hours expended; ‘padding’ in the form of
inefficient or duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation.” (Ketchum,
supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1132.) In doing so, the court should exclude
hours that were not reasonably expended in pursuit of successful claims (Harman
v. City & County of San Francisco (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 407, 417), “[a]ttorney
time spent on services which produce no tangible benefit for the client,” (Meister
v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 437, 452), or hours that
were otherwise “duplicative or excessive” (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales,
Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 161). 
 
Here, Plaintiff
submits a declaration from its attorney, B. Austin Baillio (“Baillio”) in
support of its request for attorney’s fees. First, Ballio states fellow counsel,
Garren Laymon, assisted in collection efforts and billed a flat fee of $400.00
between December 13, 2022 and September 26, 2024. (Baillio Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.) Next,
Baillio states he has spent a total of 4.1 hours in collection efforts between
December 13, 2022, and September 26, 2024 billed at his hourly rate of $375.00
per hour. (Baillio Decl., ¶ 8.) Fees also include a flat fee of $450.00 for
preparing a withholding order, a flat fee of $100.00 for the Payoff Department
to help obtain the information needed to prepare a payoff, and a $60.00 filing
fee for this Motion. (Baillio Decl., ¶¶ 8, 14, 15.) In addition, Baillio
declares his three paralegals spent a total of 2.4 hours in providing legal
support to this collection effort, with .4 hours billed at $150.00 and then
$175.00 per hour; 1.8 hours billed at $175.00 per hour; and .2 hours billed at
$175.00 per hour. (Baillio Decl., ¶¶ 11-13.) Finally, Baillio states he
incurred 1.5 hours at $375.00 per hour drafting this Motion, the declaration
and request for judicial notice in support, the history bill, the proposed
order, and proof of service. (Baillio Decl., ¶ 15.) Baillio anticipates
spending .4 hours of attorney time at $375.00 per hour to attend the hearing on
this Motion. (Baillio Decl., ¶ 15.)
 
Attorney’s fees
incurred to date, including the anticipated fees of $150.00 for the hearing on
this Motion, total $2,715.00 and costs total $272.73. (Baillio Decl., Exh. A.)
In reviewing the billing record, the Court finds that the rate charged is
reasonable and that hours charged were reasonably expended in collection
efforts in Plaintiff’s interest. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
request for $2,715.00 in attorney’s fees and $272.73 in costs.

Association’s Motion for
Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED in the amount of $2,987.73, reflecting $2,715.00
