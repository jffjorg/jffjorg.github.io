ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On June 20, 2024, Plaintiff Gail D.
Hall (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Gwendolyn Cole
(“Defendant”) alleging a cause of action for Unlawful Detainer. 
 
On June 26, 2024, Defendant filed an
Answer.
 
On July 29, 2024, the matter was
reassigned to Limited Civil from Unlawful Detainer Department. 
 
            On
October 3, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion for Leave to File a
Cross-Complaint (the “Motion”). 
 
No Opposition was filed. 
 
On November 4, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on the Motion from November 7, 2024 to December 11, 2024
due to the Court’s unavailability. (11/4/24 Order.)
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
The Motion’s Proof of Service states
that service by mail was made on Plaintiff of the “Notice of Motion and Motion
to Set Aside Entry of Judgment; Points and Authorities; Declaration of Stefon
A. Jones” on October 3, 2024. (Motion, Proof of Service.) However, the Motion
named in the Proof of Service does not pertain to the instant action, and not
all accompanying documents of the instant Motion were served.
 
Defendant is ordered to correct the
errors discussed herein and file a new proof of service.
 
III.             
Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 428.50
provides: 
 
“(a) A party shall file a
cross-complaint against any of the parties who filed the complaint or
cross-complaint against him or her before or at the same time as the answer to
the complaint or cross-complaint. 
 
(b) Any other cross-complaint may be
filed at any time before the court has set a date for trial. 
 
(c)¿A party shall obtain leave of
court to file any cross-complaint except one filed¿within¿the time¿specified in
subdivision (a)¿or¿(b).¿ Leave may be granted in the interest of justice at any
time during the course of the action.” 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50.) 
 
A “party who fails to plead a cause of
action subject to the requirements of this article, whether through oversight,
inadvertence, mistake, neglect, or other cause, may apply to the court for
leave to amend his pleading, or to file a cross-complaint, to assert such cause
at any time during the course of the action. The court, after notice to the
adverse party, shall grant, upon such terms as may be just to the
parties, leave to amend the pleading, or to file the cross-complaint, to assert
such cause if the party who failed to plead the cause acted in good faith. 
This subdivision shall be liberally construed to avoid forfeiture of
causes of action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 426.50, emphasis added.) 
 
“The legislative mandate is clear. A
policy of liberal construction of section 426.50 to avoid forfeiture of causes
of action is imposed on the trial¿court. A motion to file a cross-complaint at
any time during the course of the action must be granted unless bad faith of
the moving party is demonstrated where forfeiture would otherwise result.
Factors such as oversight, inadvertence, neglect, mistake or other cause, are
insufficient grounds to deny the motion unless accompanied by bad faith.” (Silver
Organizations Ltd. v. Frank¿(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 98-99 (Silver
Organizations).) “ ‘ “Bad faith,” is defined as “[t]he opposite of ‘good
faith,’ ” generally implying or involving actual or constructive fraud, or a
design to mislead or deceive another, or a neglect or refusal to fulfill some
duty or some contractual obligation, not prompted by an honest mistake . . . ,
but by some interested or sinister motive[,] . . . not simply bad judgment or
negligence, but rather . . . the conscious doing of a wrong because of
dishonest purpose or moral obliquity; . . . it contemplates a state of mind
affirmatively operating with furtive design or ill will.  [Citation.]” 
[Citations.]’  [Citation.] ” (Id., at p. 100.)
 
A cross-complaint is compulsory if it
is transactionally related to the subject matter of the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 426.10.) “To be considered a compulsory cross-complaint, a related cause of
action must have existed at the time of the service of [the] answer to [the]
complaint.” (Crocker National Bank v. Emerald (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 852,
864.) The late filing of a motion for leave to file a compulsory
cross-complaint “absent some evidence of bad faith is insufficient evidence to
support denial of the motion.” (Silver Organizations, supra, 217
Cal.App.3d at p. 101.) “Permission to file a permissive cross-complaint is
solely within the trial court’s discretion.” (Crocker, supra, 221
Cal.App.3d at p. 864.)
 
            Cross-complaints
are typically not allowed in unlawful detainer proceedings. (Briggs v.
Electronic Memories & Magnetics Corp. (1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 900, 906,
fn. 5 [“Because unlawful detainer is a summary remedy and its primary purpose
is to quickly recover possession of leased premises from a defaulting lessee,
unlawful detainer actions are given precedence on the calendar . . . [and]
there is no right to assert a cross-complaint or counterclaim”].) However, the Court
may exercise jurisdiction to adjudicate an improper cross-complaint where
opposing counsel neither objects nor makes a “motion to strike the
cross-complaint from the record.” (See Lakeside Park Ass’n of Kelseyville v.
Keithly (1941) 43 Cal.App.2d 418, 422.) 
 
            Thus, even though Cross-Complaints are typically not
allowed in unlawful detainer proceedings, the Court exercises jurisdiction to
adjudicate the instant Cross-Complaint. (See Briggs, supra, 53 Cal.App.3d at p.
906, fn. 5; Lakeside Park, supra, 43 Cal.App.2d at p. 422.) Furthermore, (2) In
an unlawful detainer action, a cross-complaint by the tenant is not allowed so
long as she remains in possession of the premises. See Gonzales v. Gem
Properties (1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 1029, 1034, Code Civ. Proc., § 1170) Once the
tenant moves out, she becomes eligible to file a cross-complaint under the
provisions of Civil Code section 1952.3. 
The filing of a cross-complaint in this situation is governed by Code of
Civil Procedure section 428.50 which provides: "A party shall obtain leave
of court to file any cross-complaint except one filed before or at the same
time as his answer to the complaint or cross-complaint. Such leave may be
granted in the interest of justice at any time during the course of the
action." The court, in its discretion, may continue the trial date where
filing or responding to the cross-complaint necessitates such a continuance. Medford
v. Superior Court (1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 236.
 
IV.             
Discussion

 
Defendant seeks leave of court to file a compulsory Cross-Complaint to
assert related causes of action against Plaintiff. (Motion, p. 3.) 
 
As an initial matter, Defendant’s proposed Cross-Complaint is a
compulsory Cross-Complaint. The Cross-Complaint arises out of the same
“transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences” as the
causes of action in Plaintiff’s Complaint, specifically the circumstances
surrounding Defendant’s tenancy at the Property in question – 1158 West 51st
Place, Los Angeles, California, 90037 – which existed at time of service of the
Answer to the Complaint. (Compl., ¶ 3a; Code Civ. Pro., § 426.10; Crocker, supra,
221 Cal.App.3d at p. 864.) 
 
In the proposed Cross-Complaint, Defendant asserts the following causes
of action against Plaintiff: (1) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing; (2) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (3) Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress; (4) Constructive Eviction; (5) Breach of
Implied Warranty of Habitability; (6) Breach of Implied Covenant of Quiet
Enjoyment; (7) Violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 1954(a)(2) – Unlawful
Entry; and (8) Violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 52.1 – Bane Act. (Motion,
Exh. A p. 1.) 
 
Defendant’s Cross-Complaint is based on the following allegations: (1) Plaintiff
would belittle and humiliate Defendant by stating she was doing Defendant a
favor by helping her with a place to live; (2) Defendant hoarded items and
broke Defendant’s refrigerator as a result; (3) Defendant had to pay to repair
items at the property even though she was the tenant; (4) Plaintiff harassed
Defendant to pay her more money without formal notice; (5) Plaintiff’s husband
used Defendant’s bathroom without notice while Defendant was in the shower, and
Defendant was traumatized and angry as a result; (6) Despite Defendant’s
protests, Plaintiff gave her friend permission to enter Defendant’s house while
Defendant was not there; (7) Defendant increased her rent payments due to
harassment from Plaintiff; (8) Plaintiff would use the property as “her
personal hotel” without Defendant’s consent; (9) Plaintiff demanded payment of
rent after Defendant was in a car accident; (10) Plaintiff started a physical
altercation with Defendant and the police were called; (11) Plaintiff filed the
instant action and changed the locks on Defendant; (12) Plaintiff’s husband
verbally abused Defendant; (13) Plaintiff called the police to remove Defendant
from her house, and the police told Plaintiff to leave and that she was
harassing Defendant; (14) Defendant moved out on July 5, 2024; and (15) Plaintiff
texted Defendant after the first court date of this action implying she stole
guns. (Cross-Complaint, ¶¶ 12-15, 18-19, 22, 24-26, 28, 30, 31-32, 36-37, 39,
40, 41.) 
 
Defendant argues that she was a self-represented litigant when she filed
the Answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint and, as such, did not know she needed to
file a Cross Complaint to preserve actions against Plaintiff. (Cole Decl., ¶¶
4-5.) Defendant’s counsel asserts there is no showing Defendant acted in bad
faith in seeking leave to assert a Cross Complaint and that he does not see any
prejudice in granting this Motion, especially as “possession is no longer an
issue, so the usual expedited nature of unlawful detainer actions is not needed
here.” (Jones Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court is inclined to grant Defendant’s Motion. However,
Defendant’s Motion for Leave to File a Cross-Complaint is CONTINUED so that
Defendant may correct the service issues noted herein.
