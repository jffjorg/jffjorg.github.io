The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the unopposed Demurrer filed by the Defendants, Salvation Army (Whittier), Stephanie Ortiz, Shonda Brown, Christina Cuevas, Melanie Gonzalez, and Emma Cox.

The Judge also notes that the parties had met and conferred as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41.
