And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Mkrtchyan, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Counsel Silvia Vargas, representing Plaintiff Silvia Vargas. The motion was filed on August 8, 2024, and was previously denied without prejudice due to deficiencies in the forms filed by Counsel. The judge has continued the motion to January 21, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse.

The judge has noted several errors in the forms filed by Counsel, including the lack of a MC-052 Form (Declaration of Counsel), MC-053 Form (Proposed Order), and proof of service of the MC-053 form. Counsel must file and serve supplemental papers correcting these errors at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. Failure to do so may result in the motion being placed off calendar or denied.

The judge has also ordered Counsel to give notice of the continued hearing.
