And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the defendant's motion for leave to conduct an independent medical examination (IME) and a neuropsychiatric examination of the plaintiff. The court found good cause for the defendant to obtain an updated IME based on the plaintiff's own representations of the progression of her injuries. The court also granted the defendant's motion for leave to conduct a neuropsychiatric examination, finding that the plaintiff's mental condition was relevant and at issue in the case. The court ordered the plaintiff to sit for her updated IME within 20 days and to undergo a neuropsychiatric examination.
