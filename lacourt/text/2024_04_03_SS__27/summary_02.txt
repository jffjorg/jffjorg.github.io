And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to continue the trial date by 60 days, from April 17, 2024 to June 2024. The Court finds that the motion to continue trial is granted due to the unavailability of Defendants, the recent substitution of defense counsel, and the parties' agreement to extend the trial date and expert discovery. The Court denies the motion for relief from default, as the default against Defendant Wave Community Newspapers, Inc. was previously vacated. The new trial date is set for June 2024, and the Final Status Conference is continued to the same date.
