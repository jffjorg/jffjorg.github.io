```

And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions, set two, and for sanctions. The motion was filed by the defendant, Postmates, LLC, on March 8, 2024, but was served electronically, which means it should have been served 18 court days prior to the hearing on April 3, 2024. Since the motion was served only 17 court days prior to the hearing, it is considered untimely. Additionally, the plaintiff has already served the further discovery responses at issue, making the motion moot. Therefore, the motion is denied. The judge also denies sanctions because the motion is denied.
