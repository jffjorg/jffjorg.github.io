Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel arbitration brought by the defendants, Darden Restaurants, Inc. and GMRI, Inc. The plaintiff, Tkeyah Campbell, alleged seven causes of action against the defendants, including racial harassment and retaliation during her employment at an Olive Garden restaurant. The defendants argued that the plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement as part of her onboarding process, but the plaintiff disputed this, claiming that she did not see the agreement and did not sign it.

The judge found that the plaintiff had met her burden of producing evidence challenging the authenticity of the arbitration agreement by declaring under penalty of perjury that she did not see or review the agreement. The defendants did not produce sufficient evidence to rebut the plaintiff's challenge, and therefore the motion to compel arbitration was denied.
