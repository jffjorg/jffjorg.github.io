 Case Number:  21STCV38973    Hearing Date:   November 16, 2023    Dept:  30 SEBASTIAN DE JESUS GODOY TOBAR vs HENRY YEE, et al.Motion to Compel Attendance at DepositionTENTATIVE: The Court is unable to make its tentative until Defendant appears in Court to inform the Court whether Plaintiff appeared for his deposition.DISCUSSION  As an initial matter, Defendant argues in the reply that Plaintiff’s opposition is untimely and should be disregarded.“A trial court has broad discretion to overlook late-served papers and to resolve the matter on the merits.” (Gonzalez v. Santa Clara County Dept. of Social Services (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 162, 168 [“(E)ven if the service had been untimely, the trial court was vested with discretion to overlook the defect”]; see also Bozzi v. Nordstrom, Inc. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 755, 765 [“A trial court has broad discretion under rule 3.1300(d) of the Rules of Court to refuse to consider papers served and filed beyond the deadline without a prior court order finding good cause for late submission.”].) The court exercises its discretion and considers the merits of the opposition. Further, Defendant has filed a reply on the merits, and has not argued any prejudice.On July 7, 2023, defense counsel inquired as to availability of the Plaintiff, for deposition. (Caoile Decl., Exh. C.) On July 12, 2023, after not hearing back, Defense counsel unilaterally noticed Plaintiff’s deposition to take place on August 3, 2023. (Id., Exh. D.) On the date of the scheduled deposition, Plaintiff’s counsel stated that the deposition had already been taken. (Id., Exh. E.) On August 28, 2023, defense counsel re-noticed Plaintiff’s deposition to take place on September 19, 2023. (Id.) Plaintiff’s counsel sent an objection to the deposition on the grounds that Plaintiff’s deposition was previously taken. Defense counsel had asked for evidence of the alleged deposition in the form of a notice by defense counsel or a transcript. To date, Defendant’s office has not received any evidence that the deposition has already taken place. Defense counsel then notified Plaintiff’s counsel that a certificate of nonappearance would be taken. (Id.) On September 19, 2023, Plaintiff did not appear for deposition and a certificate of non-appearance was taken. (Id., Exh. F.)In opposition, Plaintiff argues that he refused to provide dates because discovery was closed at the  time. Plaintiff additionally argues that he offered to be deposed on November 15, 2023.In reply, Defendant argues that discovery was never closed. (Caoile Decl., Exh. B.) Defendant also argues that although Plaintiff offered his deposition to be taken on November 15, 2023, this is just one day before the hearing on this motion. Defense counsel is attempting to confirm the date for deposition.First, the Court notes that on April 6, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation to continue trial to November 9, 2023, and to also continue the motion and other deadlines to the new trial date. (Caoile Decl., Exh. B; 4/6/2023 Joint Stipulation to Continue Trial.) This stipulation was granted by the Court. Therefore, Plaintiff’s argument is unconvincing.However, it appears that the deposition was set to take place on November 15, 2023. Counsel for defendant must appear at the hearing to inform the Court whether Plaintiff appeared or not.
