```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has not made a tentative ruling on the motion to compel attendance at deposition as the Defendant has not appeared in Court to inform the Court whether the Plaintiff appeared for his deposition. The Court notes that the Defendant unilaterally noticed the Plaintiff's deposition on August 3, 2023, but the Plaintiff did not appear. The Plaintiff then offered to be deposed on November 15, 2023, but the Court is unable to make a decision until the Defendant appears in Court. The Court has considered the merits of the opposition and exercises its discretion to consider the Defendant's reply. The Court notes that the parties had previously stipulated to continue trial and deadlines to November 9, 2023, and therefore, the Plaintiff's argument that discovery was closed is unconvincing.
