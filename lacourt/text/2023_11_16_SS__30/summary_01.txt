And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint for 60 days. This is to allow the plaintiff to serve the insurance company and the defendant with the motion. The plaintiff's complaint was initially dismissed for failure to serve the defendant. However, the plaintiff claims to have been in ongoing discussions with the insurance company, but has not served them with the motion. The judge believes that substantial rights are affected and due process is implicated, as the defendant has not been timely served with the motion. The judge concludes that the plaintiff cannot benefit from their own dilatory actions and therefore grants the continuance to allow the necessary parties to be served.
