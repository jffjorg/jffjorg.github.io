The Judge issued a tentative ruling on November 16, 2023, in the case 22STCV25040, NJDEH Karabedian vs Lilybeth Gomez-Garcia. The Plaintiff filed a motion to compel the Defendant's responses to a request for production of documents, which was served on September 28, 2022. However, the Defendant did not respond until October 31, 2023, and only after being contacted by their counsel. The Judge denied the motion as moot since the Defendant has now responded to the discovery. Additionally, the Judge denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the Defendant's counsel provided substantial justification for the delay and that the motion was not unsuccessful.
