And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to change venue to San Bernardino County. The defendants argued that the venue in Los Angeles County is improper because the events giving rise to the action occurred in San Bernardino County, where one of the defendants resides, and the other defendant's principal place of business is located. The plaintiff argued that the corporation's principal place of business is in New Jersey, but the judge found that the corporation's designation of its principal place of business in New Jersey in its documents filed with the Secretary of State outweighs the plaintiff's argument. The court ordered the transfer of the case to San Bernardino County upon payment of the transfer fee and filing fee, and gave notice to the moving party.
