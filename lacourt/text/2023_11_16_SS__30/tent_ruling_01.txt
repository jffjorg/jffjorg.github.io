YOUNGMotion to Set Aside / Vacate DismissalTENTATIVE:  Motion is continued 60 days for Plaintiff to serve Insurance Company and Defendant.  Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSION:  Plaintiff's complaint was dismissed for failure to serve the defendant. Plaintiff avers that she has been in ongoing discussions with the insurance company. The Motion to Set Aside the Complaint / Vacate the Dismissal was not served on the insurance company nor the defendant. As substantial rights are affected, Plaintiff has not timely served Defendant, and due process is implicated, the Court continues the matter so that those entities can be served with this motion. Plaintiff cannot benefit from its dilatory actions in failing to serve the complaint, and then rest on their not being in the action to justify not serving them with a motion that affects their rights.
