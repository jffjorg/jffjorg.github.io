December 14, 2022. Trial is set for January 29, 2025. Plaintiffs Maria Avina
Jacobo and Alfredo Lopez Gomez now move ex parte for an order to continue trial

are continuing to meet and confer to schedule depositions of Defendant’s
designated experts.

party's excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other
material evidence despite diligent efforts. The Court will confer with the
parties to select a new trial and final status conference date. Discovery
