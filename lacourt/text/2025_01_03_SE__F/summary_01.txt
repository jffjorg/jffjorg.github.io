And here is the English text summary:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' ex parte application to continue the trial for 90 days. The plaintiffs, Maria Avina Jacobo and Alfredo Lopez Gomez, filed a lemon law action against American Honda Motor Co., Inc. on December 14, 2022, and the trial is currently set for January 29, 2025. The plaintiffs argued that good cause exists to continue the trial because both parties have served Demands for Exchange of Expert Information and are continuing to meet and confer to schedule depositions of the defendant's designated experts. The judge has concluded that the plaintiffs have demonstrated a "party's excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts" and has granted the application. The court will confer with the parties to select a new trial and final status conference date, and discovery and all trial deadlines will track the new trial date.
