And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to amend the filing date of the Complaint. The Complaint was initially filed on June 18, 2024, but the court clerk rejected it due to an error on the Civil Case Cover Sheet. However, the court finds that the clerk improperly rejected the filing and failed to file the Complaint on the date it was electronically received, June 17, 2024. Therefore, the court orders that the Complaint be deemed filed on June 17, 2024, at 11:34 pm. No notice is required under the circumstances.
