And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs. The defendant, Rehabbers Financial, Inc. d/b/a Aztec Financial, Inc., seeks to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiffs, Ingerson & Associates, Inc. and Greg M. Ingerson, alleging that the plaintiffs failed to disclose material facts in their loan applications. The judge finds that the cross-claims alleged in the proposed cross-complaint arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the causes of action alleged in the plaintiffs' complaint, and that the defendant has a right to bring the cross-complaint.

The judge rejects the plaintiffs' argument that the defendant's motion is not in good faith, finding that the defendant has not engaged in any bad faith conduct. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs have not shown that they would be prejudiced by the filing of the cross-complaint, and that the defendant is entitled to file the proposed cross-complaint.

The judge orders that the defendant must file its proposed cross-complaint within five court days, and that the defendant must give notice unless the parties waive notice at the hearing.
