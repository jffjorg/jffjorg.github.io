addressing the following issues:

Each of the parties shall identify an appraiser whom it
selected to determine the fair market value of Perdana Group, LLC’s 5.55%
membership interest in Mad Science Laboratories, LLC; and
2.    
The two appraisers selected by the parties shall
attempt to mutually agree upon a third neutral appraiser. Failing such
agreement, the parties shall provide the Court with two nominations each for a
third neutral appraiser, including his or her name, contact information, and
resume. The Court shall select the neutral third appraiser from the four

3.    
If necessary, a status conference regarding the

Each of the three appraisers shall independently arrive

the Court will make that final determination based on the three appraisals it
has received.

one-half of the cost of the Third Appraiser
 
            Defendant Attila, LLC RJN is GRANTED. The Court “may take
judicial notice of the fact of a document's recordation, the date the document
was recorded and executed, the parties to the transaction reflected in a
recorded document, and the document's legally operative language, assuming
there is no genuine dispute regarding the document's authenticity. From this,
the court may deduce and rely upon the legal effect of the recorded document,
when that effect is clear from its face.” (Scott v. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 743, 755, as modified on denial of reh'g (Apr.
