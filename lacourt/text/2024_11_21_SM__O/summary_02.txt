And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion for a court order accepting the late filing of the First Amended Complaint for unlawful detainer. The Plaintiff, as trustee of the CF Fox and JS Fox Living Trust, filed the amended complaint 31 days late, but the Judge has accepted the Plaintiff's explanation that the delay was caused by a mistake. The Judge has also declined to dismiss the action under CCP §581(f)(2) or otherwise, as the Court has discretion to do so, and there is no evidence that the delay has caused the Defendants any prejudice. The Judge has ordered the Defendants to file a responsive pleading to the First Amended Complaint within five days.
