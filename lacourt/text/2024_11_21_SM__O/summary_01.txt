The judge grants Defendant Attila, LLC's motion to stay the dissolution action as to Mad Science Laboratories, LLC, appoint an appraiser, and order a buyout pursuant to Corporations Code § 17707.03. The stay is in effect pending the buyout of Perdana Group, LLC's 5.55% membership interest in Mad Science Laboratories, LLC.

The judge also orders Defendant Attila, LLC to post a bond of $10,000.00 within 15 days of the order.

The appraisers will submit their final reports on or before 60 days from the selection of the third appraiser.
