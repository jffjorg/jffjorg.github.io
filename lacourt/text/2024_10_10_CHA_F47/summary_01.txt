And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, University Plaza, LLC, has filed an application for a writ of attachment against the defendants, Kayden Ressel, Sally Butros Friedlander, and Russell Friedlander, seeking to attach orders and writs of attachment against them with a total amount of $689,992.49. The defendants have opposed the application, but the court has ruled in favor of the plaintiff.

The court found that the plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim and that the amount of the claim is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount well in excess of $500.00. The court also found that the claim on which the attachment is based is one on which an attachment may be issued against natural persons such as the defendants.

The court noted that the defendants signed a written guarantee for a lease of commercial premises and that the guaranty was made to further their profit on a continuing basis. The court held that the plaintiff has sufficiently shown that the obligation sued upon has resulted from an extension of credit in reliance upon the defendants' continuing guarantee.

As a result, the court granted the application and ordered the plaintiff to post an undertaking of $10,000.00 before any writ of attachment may issue.
