ANALYSIS
 
Defendants’ objections to the declaration of David Moradzadeh
(numbers 1-4) are overruled.
 
To obtain a prejudgment writ of attachment, the moving
party must establish that: (1) the obligation is based upon a claim for money;
(2) the obligation is based upon a contract; (3) the amount of the claim is a
fixed or readily ascertainable amount in excess of $500, excluding costs,
interest and attorneys’ fees; and (4) when sought against a natural person, the
obligation arises out of the person’s trade, business or profession.  CCP 483.010(a), (c). 
 
Here, the obligation due from Defendants to Plaintiff is
based on the breach of a personal written  guarantee. 
As such, the obligation is based on a claim for money due under a
contract.  CCP 483.010(a).  
 
Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, the declaration of
David Moradzadeh and the attached exhibits
establish that the amount of the claim is a fixed or readily ascertainable
amount well in excess of $500.00.  The
declaration sets forth the facts to support the relief requested with
sufficient particularity.  See CCP
482.040.  Additionally, the exhibit
attached to the declaration sets forth each category of the debt owed by
Defendants and credits given.  (See
Moradzadeh Decl., Ex.B).  Plaintiff has also
explained that the amount claimed in the applications differs from the amount
claimed in the complaint because the complaint was filed several months before
the applications and the amount owed continues to accrue.  Defendants have not provided any evidence to
refute the foregoing.  As such, Plaintiff
has established the probable validity of its claim as required.  See CCP 484.090(a)(2); CCP 481.190.
 
Further, Plaintiff has shown that the claim on which the
attachment is based is one on which an attachment may be issued against natural
persons such as Defendants.  See
CCP 483.010(c); CCP 484.090(a)(1). 
Defendants contend that Plaintiff has failed to meet the requirements
set forth in Advanced Transformer Co. (1974) 44 CA3d 127 for obtaining a
writ of attachment against a personal guarantor.
 
In Advance Transformer Co., the Court of Appeal
held that:   
 
“In cases involving guarantees by
principal shareholders of closely held corporations, consideration will
necessarily be given to the degree and continuity of the guarantor's
involvement in the affairs of the primary obligor out of which the indebtedness
has arisen. For example, (1) if a corporation has habitually been provided with
operating capital through the medium of such guarantees by the defendant, or (2) the obligation sued upon has resulted from an
extension of credit in reliance upon defendant's continuing guarantee, or
(3) the defendant has extensively occupied himself in the management of the
primary obligor on a continuing basis and has a major stake in its success, the
required ‘frequency and continuity’ may be found to exist. In short, if the sum
total of the circumstances justifies the conclusion that the guarantor occupied
himself to a substantial degree and on a continuing basis in promoting his own
profit through provision of credit or management to the primary obligor, a
guarantee executed in the course of such activity may properly be considered an
obligation arising out of the conduct of the guarantor's business.”  
 
Advance Transformer Co., supra
at 144; See also Wells Fargo Bank National Association 2021 WL
5862455, *4-5.
 
Recently, relying on Advance
Transformer Co., it has been noted that an attachment may issue against
individual guarantors who are “so involved in the primary obligor’s business
that the guaranty is made to further the guarantor’s livelihood or profit on a
continuing basis.”  See Rosen
2021 WL 3264144, *2.       
 
The opposition does not dispute
that Defendants signed the written guaranty. 
The written “Guarantee of Lease” specifically provides that the
“Landlord is not willing to enter the Lease without this Guaranty;” that the
guarantors agree that that the lease of the premises to the tenant “grants a
material benefit to Guarantor[s];” and that the guarantors/Defendants executed
the Guaranty “voluntarily in order to induce the Landlord to enter the Lease
agreement.”  (See Moradzadeh
Decl., Ex.A, pdf 54, 56).  
 
As such, Plaintiff has sufficiently shown that the
obligation sued upon has resulted from an extension of credit in reliance upon Defendants’
continuing guarantee and that the guaranty was made to further Defendants’
profit on a continuing basis.  See
Advanced Transformer Co., supra at 144.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The applications are granted. 
Plaintiff is ordered to post an undertaking of $10,000.00 before any
writ of attachment may issue.  CCP
489.210; CCP 489.220(a).
