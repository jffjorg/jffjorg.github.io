Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to compel compliance with subpoena duces tecum filed by the defendant. The plaintiff has opposed the motion, arguing that the defendant lacks standing to sue and that the plaintiff did not instruct the non-party SPINE CARE & ORTHOPEDIC PHYSICIANS (SCOP) to refuse production. The defendant has responded by arguing that SCOP has not opposed the motion and that the plaintiff was not required to file a motion to quash. The Court finds that there is good cause for enforcing the subpoena's document requests, as the deposition subpoena seeks information relevant to the action. The defendant has a compelling interest in obtaining discovery relating to the plaintiff's mental condition, as such information is directly relevant to the defendant's defense and disclosure is essential to a fair resolution of the action. The Court grants the motion to compel compliance with subpoena duces tecum to non-party SCOP, ordering SCOP to produce all documents responsive to the subpoena within 10 days of the date of this order.
