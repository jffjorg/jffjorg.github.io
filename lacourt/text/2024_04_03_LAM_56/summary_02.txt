```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court has considered the papers filed by the parties and has made a tentative ruling on the application for contempt of court citation. The Court finds that the evidence does not support the issuance of the OSC and therefore discharges the OSC and denies the application for contempt of court citation. The Court concludes that the Preliminary Injunction only prohibits activities that limit Plaintiff's right to speak at Board meetings, and that Plaintiff's evidence does not show that Defendants violated the Preliminary Injunction. The Court also finds that even if the Preliminary Injunction prohibited activity relating to the placement of items on the agenda, Plaintiff's evidence does not support her claims.
