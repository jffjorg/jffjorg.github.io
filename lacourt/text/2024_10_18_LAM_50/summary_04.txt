Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case. In support of the reply, the defendants submitted a supplemental declaration from Kymberly Gilpin, which the court has sustained as not relevant to the case. Even if the court were to consider the declaration, it does not find that it demonstrates "electronic assent" to the online enrollment form. The court notes that the declaration only surmises that the plaintiff would have completed the form if given the opportunity, but does not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. The court also notes that the defendants have not cited any language in the online enrollment form or the benefit booklet that would support their position on arbitrability. The court will consider these points further at the upcoming hearing.
