[1]As an initial matter, Plaintiff appears to object to
the Declaration of Mehgan Gallagher filed in support of the opposition on the
grounds that Ms. Gallagher’s firm, Theta Law Firm, LLP, did not substitute into
this case until April 17, 2024. (See Substitution of Attorney filed
April 17, 2024.) The Court does not find that this demonstrates that “Ms.
Gallagher…has zero personal knowledge upon which to support her declaration,”
as Plaintiff contends. (Reply, p. 2.) The Court declines to strike Ms.
Gallagher’s supporting declaration and Defendant’s opposition. The Court overrules
Plaintiff’s purported objections to “the entirety of MBUSA’s Counsel, Mehgan
Gallagher, Esq.….declaration, exhibits, and portions of MBUSA’s Opposition
papers.” (Reply at p. 1.) The Court notes that Plaintiff did not file any
separate evidentiary objections. 


[2]It appears that “TBLF” refers to “The Barry Law Firm.”



[3]Plaintiff asserts that “[r]egarding Plaintiff’s firm
specifically, the Court in Hanai, et al v Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, Case
No. 3:20-cv-06012-WHA (N.D. Cal. Mar. 10 2022)…reduced the reasonable billing
rate for Mr. Barry to $525/hour in this similar lemon law action involving
Plaintiff’s counsel.” (Opp’n at p. 7:2-5.) The Court notes this non-binding
federal case was decided over two years ago, in March 2022. 


[4]The Court notes that
Defendant’s counsel’s spreadsheet indicates “[n]o reduction of hours” next to many
of the billing entries. (Gallagher Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. I.) The Court also notes the spreadsheet attached as
Exhibit I to Defendant’s counsel’s declaration does not contain page numbers. (Ibid.)
