  ORDER RE: 
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS PURSUANT TO CIVIL
  CODE SECTION 1794(d)
 



 
Background    
Plaintiff
Marco Duran (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on June 20, 2022 against Defendant Mercedes-Benz
USA, LLC (“Defendant”). The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) breach
of implied warranty of merchantability and (2) breach of express warranty. 
Plaintiff
indicates that he accepted an Offer to Compromise in this action on May 23,
2024. (Barry Decl., ¶¶ 11, 12, Ex. 4.) Paragraph 5 of the Offer to Compromise
provides that “MBUSA will pay Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees, expenses and costs
in the amount of $10,000.00 in full satisfaction of any attorney’s fees,
expenses and costs owed to Plaintiff in this action. Alternatively, should the
$10,000.00 be refused, MBUSA will allow the Court to determine, in a noticed
motion filed pursuant to Civil Code Section 1794(d)
and/or by Plaintiff’s filing of a memorandum of costs, the attorney’s fees,
costs, and expenses recoverable under Civil Code
Section 1794(d). There is no admission of liability by this Offer. However,
if this Offer is accepted, MBUSA will stipulate that Plaintiff is the
prevailing party for purposes of any motion for attorney’s fees, expenses and
costs and/or memorandum of costs.” (Barry Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. 4.) Page 4 of the Offer
to Compromise provides, inter alia, that “[f]or fees, costs and
expenses, I hereby elect to file a motion and/or a memorandum of costs pursuant
to paragraph 5.” (Ibid.) 
Plaintiff now moves for an order awarding him attorney fees, costs, and expenses. Defendant
opposes.[1]
Discussion
The
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act grants car buyers the right to sue a manufacturer
or retail seller for failure to comply with implied or express warranties. (Civ. Code, § 1794, subdivision (a).) “If the buyer
prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the
court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of
costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794, subdivision (d).) 
“[T]he
fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate….The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for
similar work. The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration
of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market
value for the legal services provided.” ((PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 [internal
citations omitted]); (see
Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 818 [applying
the lodestar method to determine attorneys’ fees in Song-Beverly action].)
The
Hourly Rate of Counsel
In
his supporting declaration, Plaintiff’s counsel David N. Barry states that “[a]
total of Five (5) attorneys were involved at various junctures in this case:
Logan Pascal Esq., Elizabeth Quinn, Esq., Otis R. Hayes III, Esq., Debora
Rabieian, Esq., and myself. Attorney Logan Pascal, Esq., an associate at TBLF[2]
billing at $400 per hour, was the primary handling attorney in this matter.”
(Barry Decl., ¶ 17, emphasis omitted.) Mr. Barry seeks an hourly rate of
$675.00/hour. (Barry Decl., ¶ 22.) Mr. Barry’s background and experience is
discussed in his supporting declaration. (Barry Decl., ¶¶ 23-25.) In addition,
Mr. Pascal’s background and experience is discussed in his supporting
declaration. (Pascal Decl., ¶¶ 3-5.) 
Ms.
Quinn seeks an hourly rate of $600 per hour. (Quinn Decl., ¶ 11.) Mr. Hayes III
and Ms. Rabieian seek hourly rates of $500 per hour. (Hayes III Decl., ¶ 5; Rabieian
Decl., ¶ 5.) The background and experience of Ms. Quinn, Mr. Hayes III, and Ms.
Rabieian are set forth in their respective supporting declarations. (Quinn
Decl., ¶¶ 4-11; Hayes III Decl., ¶¶ 3-5; Rabieian Decl., ¶¶ 3-5.)  
In
the opposition, Defendant asserts that Mr. Barry’s claimed rate of $675/hour is
excessive. The Court disagrees and finds that the hourly rate requested for Mr.
Barry is reasonable and commensurate with rates charged by attorneys with
comparable skill and experience.[3] Defendant
also states that it “suggests…a rate of $250/hr for Mr. Pascal and $300/hr for
all other attorneys on this case.” (Opp’n. at p. 7:5-6.) However, the Court
finds that the hourly rates requested for Mr. Pascal, Ms. Quinn, Mr. Hayes III,
and Ms. Rabieian are reasonable and commensurate with rates charged by
attorneys with comparable skill and experience. Thus, the court declines to
reduce these attorneys’ requested hourly rates. 
 
Reasonableness
of the Requested Fees
“[T]he
court’s discretion in awarding attorney fees is … to be exercised so as to
fully compensate counsel for the prevailing party for services reasonably
provided to his or her client.” ((Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State
University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 395.) The trial court may reduce the award
where the fee request appears unreasonably inflated, such as where the
attorneys’ efforts are unorganized or duplicative. ((Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635, fn. 21.) “[T]he
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.” (Horsford v. Bd. of Trustees
of California State Univ., supra, 132 Cal.App.4th
at p. 396.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel attaches as Exhibit 5 to his supporting declaration a “copy of [his]
firm’s time entries.” (Barry Decl., ¶ 19, Ex. 5.) The time entries show that Plaintiff
seeks $69,030.00 in attorney’s fees for a total of 156.7 hours billed. (Barry
Decl., ¶ 19, Ex. 5.) 
In
her declaration in support of the opposition, Defendant’s counsel states that “[a]ttached
hereto as Exhibit I, is a spreadsheet setting forth MBUSA’s objections to and
positions on Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing, addressing every billing entry made
and recommending a reasonable adjustment for each.” (Gallagher Decl., ¶ 11, Ex.
I.)[4] 
In
the spreadsheet, Defendant’s counsel objects to certain billing entries based
on the asserted use of templated documents. (Gallagher Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. I.) However,
the Court does not find that the entries Defendant objects to reflect excessive
or unreasonable amounts of time for the particular tasks specified. Although
the use of forms and templates help with efficiency, counsel is still expected
to review and modify each document for each individual case, and time spent to ensure
that each document is appropriately modified is reasonable.
Defendant
also objects to billing entries from 11/07/22, 7/17/23, 7/27/23, 7/28/23, 7/31/23,
8/01/23, 8/24/23, 2/16/24, 3/12/24, 3/21/24, and 4/08/24, which concern time
spent by Plaintiff’s counsel to draft and revise memos “to the file” “re case
status.” (Gallagher Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. I.) Defendant asserts that such entries
are “clerical work” and “internal comms,” and that the fees incurred for such
work is thus “not recoverable.” (Gallagher Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. I.) The Court notes
that Defendant does not appear to cite any legal authority to support this
proposition. Defendant does not appear to request that the Court deduct any
portion of the time requested for these tasks. 
 
In
addition, Defendant objects to a billing entry from 1/27/23 to “[r]eview file
in preparation for the deposition of MBUSA’s Person(s) Benz USA, LLC - Pascal
Most Knowledgeable” (2.50 hrs.); a billing entry
from 4/4/23 to “Review File: in preparation for Telephonic Meet and Confer re:
MBUSA’s Discovery Responses” (0.40 hrs); a billing
entry from 7/13/23 to “Review File: in preparation of further telephonic meet
and confer re: MBUSA’s discovery responses in advance of IDC” (0.70 hrs); a billing entry from 7/20/23 to “Review
File: in preparation for Plaintiff’s deposition” (1.40
hrs); a billing entry from 7/26/23 to “Review file in preparation for
Informal Discovery Conference” (1.50 hrs.); a billing
entry from 8/04/23 to “Review file in preparation for deposition of Armando
Recinos” (0.60 hrs.); a billing entry from 8/22/23
to “Review file in preparation for deposition of A. Recino” (1.00 hr.); a
billing entry from 9/11/23 to “Review file in preparation for the deposition of
Mercedes-Benz of Los Angeles’ Person Most Knowledgeable” (1.50 hrs); a billing entry from 9/25/23 to “Review
file in preparation of telephonic meet and confer re MBUSA’s Supplemental
responses and document production” (0.40 hrs.); a
billing entry from 2/15/24 to “Review file in preparation of hearing on
Plaintiffs Ex Parte…” (0.70 hrs.); a billing entry
from 3/11/24 to “Review file in preparation for Status Conference re ADR” (0.50 hrs.); a billing entry from 3/20/24 to “Review
file in preparation for hearing on MBUSA’s Motion for Summary Adjudication” (1.60 hrs.); and a billing entry from 4/05/24 to “Review
file in preparation for hearing on Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application for an
Order Shortening Time for hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions” (0.50 hrs.). (Gallagher Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. I.) Defendant’s
counsel argues that “there is no reason the handling attorney needs to review
the file he has been consistently working on.” (Gallagher Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. I.) However,
the above-referenced billing entries pertain to time spent by Plaintiff’s
counsel to review the file in preparation for certain specified events. The Court
does not find that the above-referenced billing entries are excessive or
unreasonable. 
Defendant
also objects to certain billing entries as “exaggerated,” “not necessary,” and
“duplicative.” (Gallagher Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. I.) The Court does not find that
Defendant has shown that the billing entries objected to on these grounds
reflect excessive or unreasonable amounts of time for the particular tasks
specified, or that tasks are “duplicative.” The Court also notes that Defendant
objects to time spent by Plaintiff’s counsel to review the file in preparation
for depositions of Mercedes-Benz of Los Angeles Technicians as duplicative. (Gallagher
Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. I; see billing entries from 09/11/23.) However, these
billing entries appear to refer to multiple Mercedes-Benz of Los Angeles
Technicians with different numbers assigned to each technician. (Ibid.) Thus, the Court does not find that
Defendant has shown that the time spent preparing for each deposition is
duplicative. 
Defendant
also objects to a billing entry from 7/25/23 to “[r]eview MBUSA’s Notice of
Change of Attorney,” on the grounds that “[t]here is no record of any such
document filed at this time.” (Gallagher Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. I.) However, the
Court notes that on July 25, 2023, Defendant filed a “Notice of Change of
Handling Attorney” in this case. 
In
addition, Defendant asserts that “Plaintiff’s counsel also billed 8 hours of
anticipated time for tasks related to fee motion and bills for tasks that have
not been performed, billing hours for their anticipated reply and attendance at
fee motion hearing. Only fees actually incurred are recoverable and because it
has not yet occurred, this anticipated work is not recoverable.” (Opp’n at p.
5:8-11, emphasis omitted.) But Defendant does not appear to cite to any legal
authority to support this proposition. In the motion, Plaintiff cites to McKenzie v. Ford Motor Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 695, 703, where the Court of Appeal
noted that “[t]he fees incurred in preparing a motion for fees are properly
includable in the award. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1133 [104 Cal. Rptr. 2d 377, 17 P.3d 735] [‘an attorney
fee award should ordinarily include compensation for all the
hours reasonably spent, including those relating solely to the fee’].).”
(Emphasis omitted.) 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court declines to reduce or strike the time billed by
Plaintiff’s counsel as requested by Defendant. 
Lastly,
the Court notes that Defendant argues that “Plaintiff is not entitled to a
lodestar multiplier.” (Opp’n at p. 7:9.) However, Plaintiff does not appear to
seek a lodestar multiplier. Thus, the Court does not see why Defendant’s
opposition includes this argument. 
Costs

Plaintiff
seeks reimbursement for costs in the amount of $10,801.88. (Barry Decl., ¶ 21,
Ex. 7.) In the opposition, Defendant states that it “intends to challenge
Plaintiff’s costs via a properly noticed motion, which will be filed based on
the time allowed per statute.” (Opp’n at p. 8:1-2.) Defendant “requests the
Court to decline to award any costs until MBUSA’s motion to strike/tax costs is
heard.” (Opp’n at p. 8:2-3.) 
In
the reply, Plaintiff asserts that “MBUSA did not file a timely motion to tax
costs, pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(4), the Court should award all costs sought in Plaintiffs Motion.”
(Reply at p. 9:20-22.) Pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1700, subdivision (b)(1), “[a]ny notice of motion to strike
or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost
memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended
as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013.
If the cost memorandum was served electronically, the period is extended as
provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6
(a)(4).” On October 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Proof of Service (CCP 1011)” indicating that the “Motion for Attorneys’
Fees and Costs; Memorandum of Costs; Proposed Order/Judgment” was served on
September 25, 2024. The Court notes that 15 days after September 25, 2024 is
October 10, 2024. The docket does not appear to show that Defendant has filed
any motion to strike and/or tax costs. 
In
light of the foregoing, the Court denies Defendant’s request that the Court “decline
to award any costs until MBUSA’s motion to strike/tax costs is heard.” (Opp’n
at p. 8:2-3.) Defendant does not indicate that it filed any motion to strike
and/or tax costs. Defendant does not appear to otherwise challenge Plaintiff’s
claimed costs. The Court finds that the $10,801.88 in requested costs is
reasonable. (Barry Decl., ¶ 21, Ex. 7.)  
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney’s fees and costs is granted in the total amount of $79,831.88
($69,030.00 in attorney’s fees
+ $10,801.88 in costs.) 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
