[1]In support of the reply, Defendants submit a
Supplemental Declaration of Kymberly Gilpin in support of the petition. As set
forth above, the Court sustains Plaintiffs’ evidentiary objections to Ms.
Gilpin’s supplemental declaration. But even if the Court were to consider the
supplemental declaration, the Court does not find that such declaration
demonstrates Plaintiffs’ “electronic assent” to the subject online enrollment
form. Ms. Gilpin still surmises that “Ms. Stevens…would have completed the
online enrollment form by selecting her chosen health benefits plan. To submit
the form, Ms. Stevens would then click ‘Submit’ as found on page 12 of Exhibit
A.” (Suppl. Gilpin Decl., ¶ 4.)
 


[2]Plaintiffs allege
that “Nathaniel was eventually referred to Dr. Kenneth Park, Co-Director of
Bariatric Endoscopy at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. Dr. Park reviewed Nathaniel’s
history and recommended that he undergo gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy,
also known as G-POEM.” (FAC, ¶ 22.) 


[3]In addition,
Defendants do not appear to cite any language in the online enrollment form or
the arbitration provision of the Benefit Booklet providing that “gateway
questions of arbitrability…are for the arbitrator, and not the courts, to
decide.” (Pet. at p. 8:25-27.)
