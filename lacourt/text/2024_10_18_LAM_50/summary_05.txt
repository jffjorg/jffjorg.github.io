And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Beaudet discloses that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck 24 years ago, which developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer eventually refunded the purchase price. Judge Beaudet believes that this experience will not cause her to be biased in favor of or against either party. However, she is providing an opportunity for parties to file a verified statement of disqualification under CCP 170.3(c)(1) by January 2, 2025. If a party does not file a statement, grounds for recusal will be deemed waived. The hearing on the Status Conference re Mediataion/ADR is continued to January 8, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. in Department 50, unless both parties waive the right to file a statement.
