And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is addressing several issues related to a court hearing. First, the judge notes that the plaintiff objects to a declaration filed by Mehgan Gallagher, counsel for the defendant, on the grounds that her firm did not substitute into the case until April 17, 2024. The judge finds that this does not demonstrate that Ms. Gallagher has zero personal knowledge to support her declaration, and therefore declines to strike the declaration and related exhibits. The judge also notes that the plaintiff did not file any separate evidentiary objections. Second, the judge notes that the plaintiff references a non-binding federal case decision from March 2022 in an attempt to support its arguments, but the court finds that this decision is now over two years old and is not relevant to the current case. Finally, the judge notes that the defendant's counsel's spreadsheet indicating "no reduction of hours" for many billing entries, and that the spreadsheet does not contain page numbers.
