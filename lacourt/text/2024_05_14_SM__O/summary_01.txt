English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to quash service of process due to lack of personal jurisdiction. The court finds that the defendant, Fred Gsell, has not purposefully availed himself of the benefits and protections of California law, and that it would be unreasonable for California courts to exercise jurisdiction over him. The court concludes that the plaintiff, Aaron Celious, has not provided persuasive evidence to substantiate his claims, and that Gsell's contacts with California are insufficient to establish specific jurisdiction.
