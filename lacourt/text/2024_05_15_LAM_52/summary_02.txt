The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 920 Everett Street, LLC, Victoria Vu, and Jerome Fink vs. Saran Phiraphittayaphong, Naomi Tran, and Sokchi Yi. The defendants have moved to strike all causes of action brought by the plaintiffs. However, the court has lost jurisdiction to rule on the motion due to the plaintiffs' voluntary dismissal of the action without prejudice on April 19, 2024. The court cannot rule on the special motion to strike, but may consider the merits of the motion to award attorney fees and costs to the successful defendants. The defendants' motion is moot.
