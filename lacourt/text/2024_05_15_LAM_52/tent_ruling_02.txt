 Case Number:  24STCV01838    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendants Saran Phiraphittayaphong, Naomi
Tran, and Sokchi Yi’s Special Motion to Strike
Under Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16, defendants Saran Phiraphittayaphong, Naomi Tran, and Sokchi Yi specially
move to strike all causes of action alleged against them by plaintiffs 920
Everett Street, LLC, Victoria Vu, and Jerome Fink.  
The court has lost jurisdiction to rule on
this motion.  “[I]f a plaintiff
voluntarily dismisses the case prior to the hearing on the anti-SLAPP motion,
the court loses jurisdiction to rule on the anti-SLAPP motion, but retains the
limited jurisdiction to consider the merits of the motion in order to decide if
attorney fees and costs should be awarded the successful defendants.  [Citation.] 
In short, the dismissal is given effect, but the defendant does not lose
its anti-SLAPP right to recover fees if its motion would have been
successful.”  (Dickinson v. Cosby (2017)
17 Cal.App.5th 655, 679.)  On April 19,
2024, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice as against
the three moving defendants.  The court
therefore cannot rule on the motion.  
The
notice of motion states defendants Phiraphittayaphong, Tran, and Yi move for an
order “awarding Defendants’ attorney’s fees and costs in an amount to be
determined by subsequently noticed motion.” 
(Notice of Motion, p. 2.)  The
moving defendants have
not yet sought attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16(c).  
Defendants Saran Phiraphittayaphong, Naomi
Tran, and Sokchi Yi’s special motion to strike is moot.
