 Case Number:  23PSCV03334    Hearing Date:   August 8, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE
NAME:  Marvin
Hodges v. Ford Motor Company, et al. 
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees for Time Actually Expended and Reasonably Incurred 
TENTATIVE
RULING 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees for time
actually expended and reasonably incurred in the reduced amount of $15,337.50,
plus costs of $786.80, for a total of $16,124.30. 
            Plaintiff is ordered to give notice
of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order. 
BACKGROUND 
This is a lemon law case. On October 27, 2023, plaintiff Marvin
Hodges (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Ford Motor Company
(Ford), Performance Ford, and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of action for Violation
of Song-Beverly Act – Express Warranty, Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach
of Implied Warranty, Violation of the Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2(b), and
Violation of the Song-Beverly Act section 1796.5. 
On June 20, 2024, Plaintiff moved for attorney’s fees. On July 26,
2024, Ford opposed the motion. On August 1, 2024, Plaintiff replied. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
If the buyer prevails in an action under [the
Song-Beverly Act], the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part
of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,
including attorney's fees based on actual time expended, determined by the
court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the
commencement and prosecution of such action. 
(Civ. Code, §1794, subd.
(d).) 
            The
prevailing party has the burden of showing that the requested attorney fees are
reasonable. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817-818 (Robertson).) The party seeking attorney
fees “is not necessarily entitled to
compensation for the value of attorney services according to [his] own notion
or to the full extent claimed by [him].” (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc.
(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816, brackets in original and internal citations
omitted.) “’A trial court may not rubber stamp a request for attorney fees, but
must determine the number of hours reasonably expended.’ [Citation.]” (Morris
v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 38.) 
            The lodestar approach is the
prevailing method for calculating attorney fees under Song-Beverly Act claims.
(Robertson, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at pp. 818-819.) “The
reasonableness of attorney fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to
be determined from a consideration of such factors as the nature of the
litigation, the complexity of the issues, the experience and expertise of
counsel and the amount of time involved. [Citation.] The court may also
consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative
work. [Citation.]” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443,
448.) “The courts repeatedly have stated that the trial court is in the best
position to value the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her
courtroom [citation], and this includes the determination of the hourly rate
that will be used in the lodestar calculus. [Citation.]” (569 E. Cnty.
Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th
426, 436–437.) 
DISCUSSION 
Summary of Arguments 
            Plaintiff seeks an award of attorney
fees in the amount of $17,020.50 and costs in the amount of $786.80. Plaintiff
contends the parties have agreed Plaintiff is the prevailing party for purposes
of the present fee motion per the terms of the settlement agreement, and
therefore Plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs per Civil
Code section 1794, subdivision (d). Plaintiff contends his counsel achieved his
litigation objective by getting the vehicle repurchased under California law. Plaintiff
contends that a settlement offer refusal does not factor into the
reasonableness of fees and the fact that the parties could not agree on the
amount of attorney fees should not reduce the award sought here. 
Plaintiff contends his counsel’s fees and costs should be awarded
in full, and that the rates his counsel charged are commensurate with the
experience and skill of attorneys in Los Angeles. Plaintiff’s counsel charges
$695.00 for Michael Saeedian, $525.00 for managing attorney Christopher Urner,
and $350.00 per hour for Jorge L. Acosta. Plaintiff cites the Laffey Matrix for
contingency attorney rates to support the reasonableness of the fees requested.
Plaintiff contends it is improper to tie an award of attorney fees to
Plaintiff’s damages, and that the time required for a fee motion is
recoverable. Plaintiff also references the memorandum of costs filed in
conjunction with this motion to support the request for costs. 
In opposition, Ford contends that all fees should be cutoff after
November 29, 2023, when Ford made a settlement offer to buyback the subject
vehicle, and that the result achieved here is ultimately no better than what
Ford offered back then. Ford contends Plaintiff over-litigated this case and
that, based on the billing records, Plaintiff’s counsel does not appear to have
communicated the November 29, 2023, settlement offer to Plaintiff. Ford notes
another case in Los Angeles County Superior Court before Judge Kalra (LASC Case
No. 22STCV00335 (Rocha)), in which Plaintiff’s counsel was criticized
for over-litigating the case and failing to communicate settlement offers with
the client. 
Ford contends the requested hourly rates for Plaintiff’s counsel
are unreasonable and that Plaintiff’s counsel does not explain how his rates
are set, other than citing the Laffey Matrix, which is used for assessing legal
fees in the Washington-Baltimore Area. Ford notes the rejection of Mr.
Saeedian’s rate in Rocha, which found that the matter was not complex
and that Mr. Saeedian lacked significant experience in lemon law cases. Ford also
notes Mr. Saeedian offered no additional statements here. Ford contends Mr.
Urner’s rate is too high, as he only graduated law school in 2016 and is a
junior attorney. Ford requests Mr. Saeedian’s and Mr. Urner’s rates be reduced
to $350.00 and $250.00, respectively, or alternatively that their billing
entries be deducted altogether, as this litigation was not one requiring
partner level involvement given the repurchase offer made just weeks after
service of the complaint. 
Ford further contends the number of hours Plaintiff’s counsel
charged are unreasonable given the routine nature of the case and Ford’s settlement
offers that obviated Plaintiff’s discovery efforts. Ford notes one entry for
1.6 hours searching the NHTSA database, arguing that is excessive and would
only require a minute or two of work. Ford notes there are no entries showing
Plaintiff’s counsel communicated the November 2023 settlement offer. Ford also
contends Plaintiff did not achieve his litigation objectives regarding civil
penalties by continuing to litigate this after the November 2023 repurchase
offer. Ford also argues Plaintiff improperly attempts to charge for work
related to the claims against the dealership defendant, who paid nothing in the
settlement and achieved a dismissal. 
In reply, Plaintiff contends Ford’s arguments about settlement are
actively deceptive, noting that Ford’s initial settlement offer in November
2023 was for $68,787.04, but the parties settled on $100,000.00 in response to
a Code of Civil Procedure section 998 offer. Plaintiff obtained at least
$30,000.00 more by continuing to litigate this matter. Plaintiff contends Ford’s
arguments that the result was essentially the same is false and misleading. 
Plaintiff then contends Ford cannot comply with the Song-Beverly
Act by making a post-litigation settlement offer, and that Ford’s claim that it
should not be liable for attorney fees because it made a settlement after the
lawsuit was filed is unsupported by legal authority. Plaintiff contends Ford
fails to acknowledge that it is ultimately the client who accepts or rejects
the settlement offer, not the attorney, which is what happened in connection
with the November 2023 offer. Plaintiff reiterates that his refusal to accept
an earlier offer does not factor into the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s
requested fees, and Ford’s arguments here effectively impose a higher legal
standard than that required by a section 998 offer. 
Plaintiff further contends absent a specific and direct challenge
to billing items in this case, Plaintiff does not have the legal burden to
prove again the items on the verified billing statement. Plaintiff contends
that contingency and delay of payment factors into the rate requested here. Plaintiff
also notes that, other than the rates charged for this fee motion itself,
Plaintiff’s blended rates equal $338.32 an hour since a substantial amount of
the work in this case was delegated to lower priced paralegals and attorneys.
Plaintiff contends Ford did not identify a single billing entry relating to the
motion that it disputes. Plaintiff then cites to various cases in Los Angeles
and San Diego in which Plaintiff’s counsel’s rates have been awarded. Finally,
Plaintiff argues Ford only made general complaints about the fees being
unreasonable when Ford was required to identify specific items to challenge
them, and only points out one or two items that it specifically disputed,
namely the NHTSA database billing entry and claims regarding legal work
relating to the dealership. 
Prevailing Buyer 
            To be a prevailing buyer in a lemon law case, there are
two approaches: (1) the buyer achieves a net monetary recovery vis-à-vis Civil
Code section 1032, subdivision (a)(4); or (2) the buyer achieves his or her
litigation objectives. (Duff v. Jaguar Land Rover N.
Am., LLC (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 491, 502-503.) 
The Court finds that Plaintiff is the prevailing
buyer here. Ford does not dispute that Plaintiff obtained a net monetary
recovery. Ford instead contends that Plaintiff did not achieve his litigation
objectives. (Opp., 6:27-7:8.) However, Ford also contends Plaintiff’s attorney
fees should be limited to $3,660.00. (Id., 2:24.) These are inherently
contradictory positions. If Plaintiff is entitled to any attorney fees in this
action, then Plaintiff must necessarily be the prevailing party. (See Civ.
Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) 
Moreover, Plaintiff obtained at least $30,000.00 more
than what Ford originally offered him for settlement in November 2023. (Reply,
1:9-20; Saeedian Reply Decl., ¶ 2.) Whether these were civil penalties is not
necessarily the point; the point is Plaintiff sought and ultimately obtained larger
damages than that which Ford originally offered. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 22; see Campos v. Ford Motor Co. (C.D. Cal. 2020) 2020 WL
256125, at *2 [“[W]hat was Plaintiffs' litigation objective? Ford's willingness
to repurchase the vehicle and pay a substantial amount of money in damages and
penalties, and Plaintiffs' repeated reluctance to accept that offer leads the
Court to conclude that Plaintiffs primary objective was to pursue larger
damages.”]) 
Furthermore, the Court notes Defendant does not dispute
Plaintiff’s contentions that the parties agreed Plaintiff is the prevailing buyer
per their settlement agreement. (Motion, 4:16-17; see generally, Opp.) The
Court construes this as a tacit admission that Plaintiff’s contention is
correct. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410;
C. Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro.
Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10; see also Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v.
Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 [““Contentions are waived
when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to
authority. [Citation.]”]) 
Therefore,
Plaintiff is the prevailing buyer here. 
Reasonableness
of Hourly Rate 
Plaintiff, as the prevailing buyer, bears the burden
of proving the reasonableness of the fees requested. (Robertson
v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc., supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at
pp. 817-818.) 
The Court finds the hourly rates of Mr. Saeedian and
Mr. Urner to be excessive. Mr. Saeedian’s declaration does not explain how long
he has been working in the field of lemon law. (See Saeedian Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) But,
Mr. Saeedian does reference other lemon law cases in Los Angeles County
Superior court involving approval of his rates. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 15.) Notwithstanding,
the Court finds the rate of $695.00 in and of itself to be excessive for the
relevant legal community. (See 569 E. Cnty. Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry
Against the Dump, Inc., supra, 6 Cal.App.5th at pp. 436–437 [“The courts
repeatedly have stated that the trial court is in the best position to value
the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her courtroom [citation], and
this includes the determination of the hourly rate that will be used in the
lodestar calculus. [Citation.]”]) Mr. Urner, while having extensive experience
in lemon law cases, is not a partner. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 4.) $525.00 for a non-partner
attorney in this area is on the excessive side. Furthermore, the Laffey Matrix is
not sufficient to justify the hourly rates sought, as that does not address
rates in the Los Angeles area. “Just because the Laffey matrix has
been accepted in the District of Columbia does not mean that it is a sound
basis for determining rates elsewhere, let alone in a legal market 3,000 miles
away.” (Prison Legal News v. Schwarzenegger (9th Cir. 2010) 608
F.3d 446, 454.) 
Accordingly, the Court will reduce Mr. Saeedian’s hourly rate to
$525.00 and Mr. Urner’s hourly rate to $425.00. 
            Reasonableness
of Number of Hours 
“A verified fee bill is prima facie evidence that the
costs, expenses, and services listed were reasonable.” (Hadley v. Krepel
(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682). “In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged,
with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments
that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.
Failure to raise specific
challenges in
the trial court forfeits the claim on appeal…. [Citation.]” (Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn.
(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) 
            Plaintiff
presented a verified fee bill. (Saeedian Decl., Ex. A.) The only specific entry
that Ford challenged was the entry on November 10, 2023, for 1.6 hours
regarding research in the NHTSA database. (Saeedian Decl., Ex. A, p. 11 of
pdf.) The Court agrees that this seems excessive, even if Plaintiff was
purportedly searching for potential class actions. (See Reply, 10:11-19.) The
Court reduces this entry to 0.5 hours. Otherwise, given Ford’s lack of
challenges to other specific items in Plaintiff’s fee bill, the Court finds the
number of hours claimed to be reasonable. The fact that Plaintiff continued to
litigate this action after the initial settlement offer in November 2023 does
not mean Plaintiff acted unreasonably, especially considering the significantly
higher settlement amount obtained thereafter. (See Saeedian Reply Decl., ¶ 2; Reck
v. FCA USA LLC (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 682, 699-700.) 
            With respect to
Ford’s arguments regarding the continued litigation after the initial
settlement offer in November 2023, the Court finds these arguments unavailing. True,
the fee bill does not reflect Plaintiff’s counsel having immediately
communicated the settlement offer to Plaintiff. (Saeedian Decl., Ex. A, p. 12
of pdf.) However, the fee bill does depict subsequent communications to
Plaintiff regarding other settlement offers and communications, such as on
January 9, 2024, February 19, 2024, February 29, 2024, and March 29, 2024.
(Saeedian Decl., Ex. A, pp. 12-14 of pdf.) The absence of entries regarding
such communications is not necessarily proof that the communications did not
occur. (See Saeedian Reply Decl., ¶ 5.) Nevertheless, the Court admonishes Mr.
Saeedian to be more diligent in the future so as to avoid this problem going
forward, and more importantly to ensure compliance with his ethical obligations.
(See Cal. Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.4.1 [communication of
settlement offers].) 
            The Court notes
that Ford does not challenge the $786.89 in costs sought by Plaintiff. 
            Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion in part, and awards attorney
fees and costs in the reduced amount of $16,124.30, comprised of $15,337.50 in
attorney fees and $786.80 in costs. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees for time
actually expended and reasonably incurred in the reduced amount of $15,337.50,
plus costs of $786.80, for a total of $16,124.30. 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of
this order.
