And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Qi Zhu v. CA Fan Tuan Inc., denying without prejudice the motion to be relieved as counsel for the Defendant CA Fan Tuan Inc. The motion was filed by Richard Liu, Esq. and Edward Wells, Esq. of Innovative Legal Services, P.C. on July 8, 2024. The motion is unopposed. The Court finds that the grounds for withdrawal, including irreconcilable differences and a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, are proper. However, the Court notes several issues with the forms presented, including the lack of confirmation of the Defendant's current address and the failure to complete certain sections of the proposed order. The Court also notes that the proof of service of the moving papers was only served on the counsel for the Plaintiff, and not on the Defendant. As a result, the Court denies the motion without prejudice, and orders counsel to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service within five calendar days.
