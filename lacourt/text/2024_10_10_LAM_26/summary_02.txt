And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The cross-defendant, Ketter Design, Inc., has filed a demurrer to the cross-complaint of Nova Homes, Inc. The judge has reviewed the arguments presented by Ketter and has found that each of the four bases for the demurrer lacks merit. Ketter argues that Nova has not sufficiently alleged that Ketter owed Nova a duty of care, but the judge finds that Ketter's own acknowledgment of its role as the "project architect" supports the conclusion that Ketter owed Nova a duty of care. Ketter also argues that the claim is barred by the economic-loss rule, but the judge finds that this rule does not apply because Nova does not have a claim for breach of contract. Ketter further argues that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations, but the judge finds that this issue cannot be resolved on this demurrer. Finally, Ketter argues that the cross-complaint is uncertain with respect to whether the parties had a contractual relationship and whether Nova's damages are purely economic, but the judge finds that these issues are immaterial to the demurrer. The judge has therefore overruled the demurrer and the case will proceed to the next stage.
