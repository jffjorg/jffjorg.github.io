 Case Number:  23STCV06189    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2024    Dept:  26 TENTATIVE RULING:
Cross-Defendant Ketter Design, Inc’s (“Ketter”) Demurrer to the
Cross-Complaint of Nova Homes, Inc. (“Nova”) is overruled.  Ketter asserts four bases for the Demurrer,
each of which lacks merit.
First, Ketter argues that Nova has not sufficiently alleged
that Ketter owed Nova a duty of care.  As
Ketter acknowledges (Demurrer at p. 4, l. 13-14), Nova alleges that Ketter was
the “project architect.”  As such, Ketter
owed Nova a duty of care.  See Beacon
Residential Community Assoc. v. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP (2014)
59 Cal.4th 568; Huber, Hunt & Nichols, Inc. v. Moore
(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 278.  Ketter relies
principally on Weseloh Family Ltd. Partnership v. K.L. Wessel Const. Co.
(2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 152, a decision the relevance of which is
thoroughly undermined by the discussion of it in Beacon Residential.  See Beacon Residential, 59 Cal.4th
at 586-587.  
Second, Ketter argues that Nova’s claim is barred by the economic-loss
rule.  That rule bars a claimant from
seeking economic damages in tort, when the claimant is in privity with the
defendant and has a claim for breach of contract.  See Aas v. Superior Court (2000) 24
Cal.4th 627, 643 (“A person may not ordinarily recover in tort for
the breach of duties that merely restate contractual obligations.  Instead, “[c]ourts will generally enforce the
breach of a contractual promise through contract law….”).  Here, as Ketter acknowledges (Demurrer at p.
4, l. 15-16), Nova does not allege that it was in privity with Ketter and has
no claim for breach of contract.  The economic-loss
rule does not apply.
Third, Ketter argues that Nova’s claim is barred, in its
entirety, by the statute of limitations. 
It does not appear affirmatively from the face of the Cross-Complaint
that, as a matter of law, Nova’s claim is barred.  It may or may not be, but the issue cannot be
resolved on this Demurrer.
Finally, Ketter asserts that the Cross-Complaint is uncertain
with respect to whether the parties had a contractual relationship and whether
Nova’s damages are purely economic.  As
to the former, there is no uncertainty: Nova does not allege any contractual
relationship, as Ketter acknowledges (Demurrer at p. 4, l.15-16).  As to the latter, it is immaterial to the
Demurrer, given that the economic-loss rule does not apply.
