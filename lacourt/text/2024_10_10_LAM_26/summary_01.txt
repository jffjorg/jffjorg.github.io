And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to disqualify the Plaintiff's counsel, Reisner & King LLP. The Judge found that the Defendant lacks standing to seek counsel's disqualification, as there is no attorney-client relationship between the Defendant and the attorney sought to be disqualified. Even if the Court were to apply a minority view on standing, the Defendant has not shown an ethical breach that would warrant disqualification. The Defendant has not shown that the Plaintiff's counsel's representation of Mr. Decuir in this matter is materially adverse to the interests of the Defendant's former client, Mr. Davoudi. The Judge also found that the Defendant's delay in bringing the motion, nearly two years after learning about the potential conflict, destroys any credibility of the Defendant's purported concerns about counsel's knowledge of "confidential information."
