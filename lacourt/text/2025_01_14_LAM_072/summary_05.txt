Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for a preliminary injunction brought by Plaintiffs Glenda Anderson and Ranita Nichole Jackson against Defendants Jerrhonda Shewayn Holman and Deborah Elaine Holman. The dispute centers around the Property located at 15413 S. Pannes Avenue, Compton, California 90221, which Anderson acquired in 2007. Anderson fell behind on her mortgage payments in 2023, and on November 7, 2023, she and Defendants attempted to enter into a number of agreements regarding the Property. Anderson claims that Defendants promised to give her a loan of $9,036.06 to help stop the foreclosure, but Plaintiffs allege that Defendants presented Anderson with two documents to sign, which Defendants represented to be short-term loan documents to take care of the mortgage. However, Plaintiffs allege that the document that Defendants represented to be a deed of trust was actually a grant deed transferring ownership of the Property to Defendants.

Anderson declares that she did not agree to sell the Property to Defendants and claims that the quitclaim deed recorded in their favor is invalid. Anderson also claims that she has suffered financial elder abuse and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress at the hands of Defendants.

Defendants deny Anderson's allegations and claim that they have suffered substantial hardship as a result of being unable to move into the Property. They also request that an undertaking be posted to protect them from past and future harm in the amount of $18,000.00.

The judge will discuss the issues raised in the motion at the hearing and will consider two factors in determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction: (1) the reasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial, and (2) a balancing of the "irreparable harm" that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction. The judge will also consider whether monetary relief would not afford adequate relief or whether it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the amount of damages.
