And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Erika Jasmin Anaya, moves to compel the defendant, General Motors, LLC, to produce certain documents. The court has considered the parties' papers and rules as follows. The court orders the defendant to produce further responses and documents within 30 days for certain requests for production of documents (RFPs). Specifically, the court grants the plaintiff's requests for RFPs 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 39, 40, 15, 16, 61, 62, 67, 68, 71, 72, 73, 74, 118, 119, and 29, 30, 114, 115. However, the court denies the plaintiff's requests for RFPs 23, 24, 83, 84, 89, 93, 100, 116, 117, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, and 136, finding them to be overbroad. The court also grants RFPs 50, 51, and 52, but limits the scope of the requests to exclude "comparable analyses" and internal emails of the defendant.
