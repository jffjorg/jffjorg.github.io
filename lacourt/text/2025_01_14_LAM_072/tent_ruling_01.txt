             Plaintiff Juan Morales (“Plaintiff”) moves to
compel certain requests for production of documents (“RFP”) served on defendant
Kia America, Inc. (“Defendant”).  Plaintiff
also seeks $3,255 in sanctions.
 
The Court has considered the parties’ papers and rules as
follows:
 
RFP 3, 6,7, 8, 11, 33, 34: 
Granted. Defendant shall within 30 days serve
further responses and all responsive documents.  The Responses shall be code-compliant and not
rewrite the request for production. If there are privileged documents,
Defendant shall provide a privilege log.

 
RFP 45:  Granted. Defendant
shall within thirty days serve further responses and all responsive
documents.  The Responses shall be
code-compliant and not rewrite the request for production. If there are
privileged documents, Defendant shall provide a privilege log.  The response may be limited to complaints
within California.
 
RFP 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32:  Denied. 
The requests are overly broad. 
The responses are sufficient.  The
Court would have sustained a complete objection to the requests.
 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s request for sanctions.  As noted, while the Court grants the motion
as to certain request, it denies the motion as to many others.
