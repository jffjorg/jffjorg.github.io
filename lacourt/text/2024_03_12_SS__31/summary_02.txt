The Judge, Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling on a case involving Anahit Grigoryan, the Plaintiff, and Gucci America, Inc., the Defendant. The Defendant propounded special interrogatories and request for production of documents (RPDs) on the Plaintiff on October 3, 2023, but the Plaintiff failed to respond. The Defendant sent a meet and confer email requesting responses by December 1, 2023, but the Plaintiff still failed to respond. The Defendant is seeking an order compelling the Plaintiff to respond to the outstanding discovery and is also seeking sanctions.

The Judge has granted the unopposed motions to compel, ordering the Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the Defendant's special interrogatories and RPDs without objections within 20 days. The Judge has also awarded sanctions to the Defendant in the amount of $795, which includes attorney fees and motion filing fees.

The Judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement before the hearing on March 12, 2024. If a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court by March 11, 2024. If no parties submit, they should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
