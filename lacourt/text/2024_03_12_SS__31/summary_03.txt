And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff William Harmon's attorney, Karabed Mikaelian, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in communication between Plaintiff and Counsel, making it impossible for Counsel to effectively represent Plaintiff. Counsel declared that they mailed the papers to Plaintiff, but the envelope was returned unopened due to Plaintiff's mailbox being full. The Judge has ordered Counsel to file a satisfactory declaration confirming the electronic service address of Plaintiff as current prior to the hearing. If the declaration is filed, the motion will be granted, and the ruling will be effective upon filing proof of service of the final order. If not, the motion will be denied without prejudice. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if no agreement is reached, they should appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
