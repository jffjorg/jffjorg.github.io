BACKGROUND Plaintiff Maria Cecilia Triminio Guardado (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“LACMTA”), et al. for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident.  The complaint alleges that Plaintiff was a passenger on defendants’ bus, when defendant John Doe suddenly applied the brakes while the bus was in motion, causing Plaintiff to fall off her seat. The complaint sets forth two causes of action for (1) motor vehicle and (2) general negligence.  LACMTA now demurs to the complaint arguing that it fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against it, and that the complaint is uncertain. Further, LACMTA move to strike allegations that it entrusted the vehicle to John Doe.   Plaintiff opposes the motions, and LACMTA filed its replies.   II. DEMURRER Meet and Confer  Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.  (CCP § 430.41(a).)   The Court finds LACMTA has fulfilled this requirement prior to filing the demurrer.  (Dem. Yehoshua Decl. ¶ 2.)  Legal Standard  A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings.  It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint).  (CCP §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can be considered.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].) A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.)  The “face of the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action.  (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]). A demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action.  (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)  Discussion - Motor Vehicle and General Negligence Except as otherwise provided by statute, “[a] public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.”  (Gov. Code § 815(a).)  “[T]his section ‘abolished all common law or judicially declared forms of liability for public entities, except for such liability as may be required by the federal or state Constitution. Thus, in the absence of some constitutional requirement, public entities may be liable only if a statute declares them to be liable’ [Citation.]”  (Becerra v. County of Santa Cruz (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1450, 1457; accord, Tuthill v. City of San Buenaventura (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1088.) The complaint alleges in relevant part:   “On or about December 21, 2022, Plaintiff was a lawful passenger on Defendants’ LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY....bus (Bus No. 8819, Line 66) on 8th St. near Alvarado St.. Defendant JOHN DOE, suddenly and without warning, abruptly applied the brakes as the bus was in motion and caused Plaintiff to fall off her seat and sustain serious injuries and damages. The actions of the Defendants and/or its employees was below the standard of care and was the cause of Plaintiff’s injuries.  …  This claim is brought pursuant to Government Code Section 815.2; Vehicle Code Section 17001.  Therefore, Defendants LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY….are statutorily liable for the negligent acts of the Defendants’ employee while he/she was operating the subject vehicle.  Defendants, LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY; and DOES 1 through 50, were served with a claim for damages pursuant to Government Code Section 911.2 on or about June 9, 2023 and has not been rejected by an agent for Defendants LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY.”  (Compl. at p. 7.) LACMTA argues that the complaint fails to identify a statutory liability against it, or plead with particularity any factual allegations as to what exactly its employees did wrong. Indeed, there is no common law tort liability for public entities in California, including negligence. (Becerra v. County of Santa Cruz (1998) 68 Cal. App. 4th 1450, 1457.) However, contrary to LACMTA’s assertions, Plaintiff does plead the statutory basis against LACMTA, which are Gov. Code § 815.2 and Veh. Code § 17001. Gov. Code § 815.2 provides that a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by its employee within the scope of his employment, except where the employee is immune from liability. Veh. Code § 17001 provides that a public entity is liable for the negligent operation of any motor vehicle by an employee acting within the scope of his employment. The factual premise is that LACMTA’s employee John Doe abruptly applied the brakes of the bus, thereby causing Plaintiff to fall. Complainants are not required to identify employees in order to specifically allege vicarious liability against a governmental entity. (Tom Jones Enterprises, Ltd. v. County of L.A. (2013) 212 Cal. App. 4th 1283, 1292-93.) Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the existence of a claimed duty and liability arising from an identified statute. (Searcy v. Hemet Unified School Dist. (1986) 177 Cal. App. 3d 792, 802.) In terms of LACMTA’s argument that the pleading is uncertain, "A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures."  (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  "A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the complaint is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond –i.e., he or she cannot reasonable determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or her."  (Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group) § 7:85 (emphasis in original).) For the purposes of the demurrer, the complaint adequately alleges facts that LACMTA is vicariously liable for the actions of its bus driver, John Doe. Accordingly, the demurrer is OVERRULED.   III. MOTION TO STRIKE LACMTA moves to strike the allegation that it entrusted the motor vehicle on the grounds that LACMTA is not liable for the negligence of its employees. However, as already analyzed above, a public entity may be held vicariously liable for the acts or omissions of its employees committed within the scope of employment. The complaint specifies the statutory grounds for the causes of action and provides that the factual basis of liability is LACMTA’s employee applying the bus brakes suddenly and without warning. At the pleading stage, LACMTA has not demonstrated that the factual allegation is irrelevant, false, or improper.  (CCP §§ 435; 436(a); see also Duffy v. Campbell (1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 662, 666 [noting that courts must resolve all reasonable doubts in favor of the pleading when considering a motion to strike].)    Accordingly, the motion to strike LACMTA from the first cause of action, and to strike the word “entrusted”, is DENIED.   IV. CONCLUSION LACMTA’s demurrer is overruled, and the motion to strike is denied.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 11th day of March 2024      Hon.
