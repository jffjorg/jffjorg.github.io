And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to bifurcate the trial without prejudice. The court finds that it is appropriate for the trial judge to determine whether bifurcation is warranted, given that the case will be tried by a different judicial officer than the one ruling on this motion. The court orders that the bifurcation briefing be included in the trial binders along with any motions in limine filed in the case. The court acknowledges that CRC Rule 3.57(c) prohibits using a motion in limine to seek an order to try an issue before the trial of another issue or issues, and thus this order should not be construed in a way that contradicts this rule. The moving party is ordered to give notice, and parties may submit to this tentative ruling by emailing the court with the required information. If all parties do not submit, they will need to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
