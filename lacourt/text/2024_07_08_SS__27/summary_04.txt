Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff's Counsel, Khashayar Eshraghi, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Jorge Hernandez. The motion is based on an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Judge finds that this is a proper ground for allowing the attorney to withdraw, citing Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.

However, the Judge denies the motion because Counsel has not confirmed Plaintiff's current address within the past 30 days and has only made one effort to notify Plaintiff, which was by mailing motion papers to Plaintiff's last known address with return receipt requested, but no return receipt was attached to the motion. The Judge finds that Counsel's current effort in notifying Plaintiff is insufficient.

The Judge notes that Counsel has filed the required forms (Judicial Council Form MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053) and has cited the relevant legal standards (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 and Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915, and People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407).
