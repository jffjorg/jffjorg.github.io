Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to deem requests for admissions admitted, compel form interrogatories, compel supplemental requests for productions, and requests for sanctions. The Defendant, Maria Penaloza, served requests for admissions, form interrogatories, and supplemental demand for production on the Plaintiffs, Carol Daniels and Alvin Daniels, on March 22, 2024. The Plaintiffs failed to serve timely discovery responses, and the Defendant's counsel sent a meet and confer letter on April 15, 2024, requesting verified responses without objections by April 22, 2024. The Plaintiffs failed to respond, and the Defendant now moves to compel responses and deem the requests for admissions admitted.

The Court finds that the Plaintiffs' failure to serve timely discovery responses justifies the Deemed Admitted status of the requests for admissions. The Court orders the Plaintiffs to provide complete and verified responses to the Defendant's requests for production and form interrogatories without objection within 30 days of the ruling.

The Court also imposes sanctions on each Plaintiff in the amount of $1,500.00, for a total of $3,000.00, due to the Plaintiffs' failure to comply with the discovery requests. The Court orders each Plaintiff and their counsel to pay the sanctions within 30 days of the ruling.
