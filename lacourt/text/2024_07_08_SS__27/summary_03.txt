And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Shaun Bauman, counsel for the plaintiff, to be relieved as counsel. Bauman seeks to withdraw due to an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client communication. The court notes that Bauman has filed the necessary forms and has cited proper grounds for withdrawal. However, the court finds that Bauman's effort to notify the plaintiff of the motion was insufficient, as no return receipt was attached to the motion and the court is unsure if the plaintiff received notice. Therefore, the court denies the motion. The parties are advised to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person at the hearing date. If the parties do not submit or appear, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
