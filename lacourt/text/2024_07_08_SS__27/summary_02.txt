And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to seal the Train Image Recorder (TIR) video, which recorded a train versus pedestrian accident on November 10, 2021. The Court finds that the contractual obligation not to disclose certain information constitutes an overriding interest, and that sealing the video is narrowly tailored to achieve this interest. The Court also notes that the motion is unopposed, and that the parties have agreed to a stipulated protective order. Therefore, the Court grants the motion to seal the video.
