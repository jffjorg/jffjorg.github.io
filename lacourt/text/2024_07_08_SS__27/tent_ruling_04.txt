Hearing Date: 7/8/2024 at 1:30 p.m.  
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV36909 JORGE HERNANDEZ, AN
INDIVIDUAL vs LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY
Moving
Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel Khashayar Eshraghi
Responding
Party: Unopposed  
Notice:
Insufficient  
  
Ruling:
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL IS DENIED. 
  
Background 
 
Attorney Khashayar Eshraghi represents
Plaintiff. Eshraghi moves to be
relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard  
  
The Court has discretion to allow an attorney
to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
  
A motion to be relieved as counsel must be
made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052
(Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,
subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on
all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362,
subd. (d).) 
  
Analysis and Conclusion  
  
Eshraghi has filed Judicial Council Form
MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). Eshraghi seeks to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship. The Court finds
this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. (See Estate of Falco
(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw).)
 
However, the Court notes that counsel has not
confirmed Plaintiff’s current address within the past 30 days. Furthermore,
counsel’s only effort to locate Plaintiff’s address was mailing motion papers
to Plaintiff’s last known address with return receipt requested. No return
receipt was attached to the motion. Plaintiff did not file an opposition or any
other filing, and the Court is unsure if Plaintiff received notice of the
motion. The Court finds counsel's current effort in notifying Plaintiff
insufficient. Thus, the Court denies this motion.
