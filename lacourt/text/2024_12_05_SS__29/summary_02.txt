Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion by the plaintiff, Maria Teresa Franco, to modify an earlier court order. The order required the defendant, Jose Soto Plasencia, to appear for a deposition and answer questions under oath on October 30, 2024. However, the plaintiff was unable to serve the order on Plasencia before the deadline. The plaintiff is now asking the court to set a new date for the deposition. The court has granted the motion and set the deposition for December 18, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
