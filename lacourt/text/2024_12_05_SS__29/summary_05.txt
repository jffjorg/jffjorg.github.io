And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the Defendant's motion to continue trial in part and denies it in part. The Judge grants the request to continue the trial, but denies the request to advance the hearing on the motion for summary judgment. The trial is continued to a date on or after July 29, 2025. The Judge exercises discretion to consider the Plaintiff's untimely opposition to the motion. The Judge holds that a party who files a timely motion for summary judgment has a right to have the motion heard before trial, and that there is no available summary judgment hearing date that is at least 30 days prior to trial. Therefore, the Judge grants the motion to continue trial for good cause shown.
