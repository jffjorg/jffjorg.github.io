Background
On March 1, 2023, John William Babakitis (“Plaintiff”) filed
his complaint against Al Malaikah Auditorium Company (“Auditorium”); The
Anschutz Corporation; Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc.; AXS; Allied Universal
Executive Protection and Intelligence Services, Inc.; Staff Pro; and Does 1
through 100, asserting causes of action for negligence and premises liability
arising from an injury that occurred at a Judas Priest concert at the Shrine
Auditorium on March 15, 2022, when an unidentified person gained access to the
stage, jumped into the crowd, and struck Plaintiff.
On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff amended his complaint to name
Goldenvoice LLC (“Goldenvoice”) as Doe 26.
On April 6, 2023, the Court, at the request of Plaintiff,
dismissed The Anschutz Corporation; Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc.; and
AXS.
On May 4, 2023, Goldenvoice filed an answer to the complaint
and a cross-complaint against Staff Pro, Inc. dba Allied Universal Event
Services (“Staff Pro”) and Roes 1 through 50.  Goldenvoice
subsequently filed an amended answer to the complaint.
On May 12, 2023, Auditorium filed an answer to the complaint
and a cross-complaint against AXS; Allied Universal Executive Protection and
Intelligence Services, Inc.; Staff Pro; and Moes 1 through 50. On May 19, 2023,
Auditorium filed an amended cross-complaint, this time against only Staff Pro
and Moes 1 through 50.  Auditorium subsequently filed an amended
answer to the complaint.
On June 5, 2023, Staff Pro, Inc. (on its own behalf and as
erroneously sued as Allied Universal Executive Protection and Intelligence
Services, Inc.) filed an answer to the complaint.  On July 17, 2023,
Staff Pro filed answers to the cross-complaints of Goldenvoice and Auditorium.
On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff amended his complaint to name
AEG Presents LLC (“AEG Presents”) as Doe 1.
On November 22, 2023, AEG Presents filed an answer to the
complaint and a cross-complaint against Staff Pro and Zoes 1 through 50. 
On April 19, 2024, Plaintiff amended his complaint to name
A-One Security Services, Inc as Doe 51, and INEED Staffing Events LLC as Doe
52.
On May 29, 2024, Staff Pro filed an answer to the
cross-complaint of AEG Presents.  The same day, Staff Pro filed a
cross-complaint against AEG Presents and Foes 1 through 50.
On June 28, 2024, AEG Presents filed an answer to Staff Pro’s
cross-complaint.
On October 28, 2024, Staff Pro filed a First Amended
Cross-Complaint.
As it relates to the matters set for hearing on Decembre 5,
2024, Plaintiff served Request for Production of Documents (Set Four) on
Goldenvoice and Request for Production of Documents (Set Two) on AEG Presents
on May 3, 2024.  (Nokes Decls., ¶ 3 &
Exhs. 1.)  Goldenvoice and AEG Presents
served written response on June 18. 
(Id., ¶ 4 & Exhs. 2.)
Plaintiff contended that some of the objections were not
meritorious and that the responses were in other respects not code
compliant.  Counsel met and conferred and
participated in an Informal Discovery Conference on September 23, 2024, but the
disputes were not resolved.  (Id., ¶¶ 5-6
& Exhs. 3-5.)
On October 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed these two motions to
compel further responses.  In each
motion, Plaintiff also requests sanctions.
On November 12, 2024, Goldenvoice and AEG Presents each served
verified amended responses to the documents requests.  (Glinka Decls., ¶ 6 & Exhs. A.) 
On November 20, 2024, Goldenvoice and AEG Presents each filed
oppositions to the motions to compel.  On
November 26, Plaintiff filed replies.
Legal Standard
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the
following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.  (2) A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  (3) An objection in the response
is without merit or too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(a).)
Notice of a motion to compel further responses must be given
“within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Id.,
subd. (c).)
A motion to compel further responses must set forth specific
facts showing good cause for the discovery and must be accompanied by a
meet-and-confer declaration and a separate statement or, in the discretion of
the Court, a “concise outline of the discovery request and each response in
dispute.” (Id., subd. (b)(1)-(3); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345.)
“[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves to compel Goldenvoice to provide a further
response to Requests for Productions Nos. 58, 59, and 62.  Plaintiff moves to compel AEG Presents to
provide a further response to Requests for Production Nos. 23, 24, and 27.  Plaintiff also seeks sanctions.
No. 58 to Goldenvoice and No. 23 to AEG Presents
Request No. 58 to Goldenvoice and Request No. 23 to AEG
Presents read as follows:
“Any and all incident reports from 2017 - 2022 regarding
injuries to any person or persons resulting from stage diving for all music
concerts promoted by YOU. For the purposes of this request, “stage diving” is
defined as any person accessing the stage and leaping, jumping, falling, being
pushed or handed into the crowd.” 
In the initial responses, Goldenvoice and AEG Presents each
objected that the request was vague, ambiguous, overbroad, violated attorney-client
privilege, violated the work product doctrine, was unduly burdensome,
oppressive, and harassing, violated the privacy rights of third parties, and was
not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  Goldenvoice and AEG Presents further stated
that subject to the objections, and limiting the response to the Shrine
Auditorium:
“Responding Party has conducted a diligent search and a
reasonable inquiry in an effort to comply with this demand but cannot comply
because Responding Party has not found any responsive documents in its
possession, custody or control. Investigation and discovery continue.”
In Goldenvoice’s amended responses, served after the motion
was filed, Goldenvoice begins by restating its objections.  Goldenvoice then states:
“Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections,
Responding Party responds as follows: See Incident Report #0024, dated 12/4/22,
attached hereto as Exhibit A, and Incident Report #0004, dated March 15, 2022,
attached hereto as Exhibit B. Investigation and discovery continue.”
Goldenvoice’s objections are overruled.  Among other things, the objections based on
burden, privilege, work product, and privacy are not supported by sufficient
evidence to establish a basis for withholding responsive documents.  
Goldenvoice’s substantive response is not code compliant.  Goldenvoice does not state that it will comply
with the demand in whole or in part. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.210, subd. (a) & 2031.220.)
In AEG Presents’s amended responses, served after the motion
was filed, AEG Presents begins by restating its objections.  AEG Presents then states:
“Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections,
Responding Party responds as follows: After conducting a diligent search and
making a reasonable inquiry in an effort to respond to this demand, Responding
Party has no responsive incident reports in its possession, custody or control
and does not believe any responsive incident reports currently exist or have
ever existed. Investigation and discovery continue.”
AEG Presents’s objections are overruled.  Among other things, the objections based on
burden, privilege, work product, and privacy are not supported by sufficient
evidence to establish a basis for withholding responsive documents.  
AEG Presents’s substantive response, however, is code
compliant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.)
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Goldenvoice to provide a further
response to this request for production is granted. 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel AEG Presents to provide a further
response to this request for production is denied.
No. 59 to Goldenvoice and No. 24 to AEG Presents
Request No. 59 to Goldenvoice and Request No. 24 to AEG
Presents read as follows:
“Any and all incident reports from 2017 - 2022 regarding
injuries to any person or persons resulting from stage diving for all music
concerts promoted by YOU and regarding which you contracted with Staff Pro or
Allied Universal. For the purposes of this request, “stage diving” is defined
as any person accessing the stage and leaping, jumping, falling, being pushed
or handed into the crowd.”
In the initial responses, Goldenvoice and AEG Presents each
objected that the request was vague, ambiguous, overbroad, violated attorney-client
privilege, violated the work product doctrine, was unduly burdensome,
oppressive, and harassing, violated the privacy rights of third parties, and was
not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  Goldenvoice and AEG Presents further stated
that subject to the objections, and limiting the response to the Shrine
Auditorium:
“Responding Party has conducted a diligent search and a
reasonable inquiry in an effort to comply with this demand but cannot comply
because Responding Party has not found any responsive documents in its
possession, custody or control. Investigation and discovery continue.”

was filed, Goldenvoice begins by restating its objections.  Goldenvoice then states:
“Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections,
Responding Party responds as follows: See Incident Report #0004, dated March
15, 2022, attached hereto as Exhibit B. Investigation and discovery continue.”
Goldenvoice’s objections are overruled.  Among other things, the objections based on
burden, privilege, work product, and privacy are not supported by sufficient
evidence to establish a basis for withholding responsive documents.  
Goldenvoice’s substantive response is not code compliant.  Goldenvoice does not state that it will comply
with the demand in whole or in part. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.210, subd. (a) & 2031.220.)

compliant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.)
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Goldenvoice to provide a further
response to this request for production is granted. 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel AEG Presents to provide a further
response to this request for production is denied.
No.62 to Goldenvoice and No. 27 to AEG Presents
Request No. 62 to Goldenvoice and Request No. 27 to AEG
Presents read as follows:
“Any and all SHOW STOP CRITERIA regarding unauthorized persons
gaining access to the stage and/or persons stage diving. (“SHOW STOP CRITERIA”
is defined as any joint criteria that describe communications and actions to
stop the show/artist in the event of an incident. For the purposes of this
request, “stage diving” is defined as any person accessing the stage and
leaping, jumping, falling, being pushed or handed into the crowd.) Any response
may be produced pursuant to the protective order signed by the judge in this
case.”
In the initial responses, Goldenvoice and AEG Presents each
objected that the request was vague, ambiguous, overbroad, violated attorney-client
privilege, violated the work product doctrine, and was unduly burdensome,
oppressive, and harassing.  Goldenvoice
and AEG Presents further stated that subject to the objections, and limiting
the response to the Shrine Auditorium:
“Responding Party has conducted a diligent search and a
reasonable inquiry in an effort to comply with this demand but cannot comply
because Responding Party has not found any responsive documents in its
possession, custody or control. Investigation and discovery continue.”
In Goldenvoice’s amended responses, served after the motion
was filed, Goldenvoice begins by restating its objections.  Goldenvoice then states:
“Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections,
Responding Party responds as follows: After conducting a diligent search and
making a reasonable inquiry in an effort to respond to this demand, Responding
Party has no responsive documents in its possession, custody or control and
does not believe any responsive documents currently exist or have ever existed.
Investigation and discovery continue.”
Goldenvoice’s objections are overruled.  Among other things, the objections based on
burden, privilege, and work product are not supported by sufficient evidence to

and does not believe any responsive documents currently exist or have ever

burden, privilege, and work product are not supported by sufficient evidence to
establish a basis for withholding responsive documents.  
AEG Presents’s substantive response, however, is code
compliant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.)
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Goldenvoice to provide a further
response to this request for production is denied. 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel AEG Presents to provide a further
response to this request for production is denied.
Sanctions
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against AEG Presents is
denied.  AEG Presents has not
unsuccessfully opposed the motion to compel. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against Goldenvoice is
granted.  Goldenvoice has, in part, unsuccessfully
opposed the motion to compel.  (Ibid.)  Goldenvoice has not acted with substantial
justification in making unmeritorious objections to discovery and in providing
responses to discovery that are not code compliant.  There are no other circumstances that would
make the imposition of sanctions unjust.
Given the relatively straightforward nature of this motion to
compel, as well as the economies of scale associated with preparing multiple,
parallel motions, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $1,660, based on
four hours of attorney time, multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate of $400 per
hour for work of this nature, plus the $60 fee for filing a discovery
motion.  (See Nokes Decl., ¶ 11.)

The Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Plaintiff’s motion
to compel Goldenvoice to provide further responses to requests for production
of documents.
The Court ORDERS Goldenvoice to serve further written,
verified, code-compliant responses, without objection, to Plaintiff’s Requests
for Production Nos. 58 and 59 within 15 days of notice.

provide further responses to requests for production of documents.
