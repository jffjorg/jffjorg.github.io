v. First Southern Baptist Church of Sylmar
22STCV04480
Plaintiff’s Motion to Modify Order
Tentative
The
motion is granted.
Background
On February 4, 2022, Plaintiff Maria Teresa Franco,
individually and as successor-in-interest to Arturo Franco Melendez
(“Plaintiff”) filed her complaint against First Southern Baptist Church of
Sylmar, Jose Soto Plasencia (“Soto Plasencia”), and Does 1 through 50 for motor
vehicle negligence, premises liability, general negligence, and survival action.
On May 31, 2022, Sylmar First Southern Baptist Church Sylmar,
California (erroneously sued as First Southern Baptist Church of Sylmar)
(“First Southern”) filed an answer to the complaint.  On the same day,
First Southern also filed a cross-complaint against Soto Plasencia, Iglesia
Cristiana Altar De Dios (“Iglesia Cristiana”), California Southern Baptist
Convention (“California Convention”), United Bethany Baptist Bible Church of
California (“United Bethany”), and Roes 1 through 50. 
On December 15, 2022, First Southern amended its
cross-complaint to name Henry Meza (“Meza”) as Roe 1.
Subsequently, the Court, at the request of First Southern,
dismissed without prejudice all causes of action in First Southern’s
cross-complaint against Iglesia Cristiana, California Convention, United
Bethany, and Meza.  The only remaining cross-defendants on First
Southern’s cross-complaint are Soto Plasencia and Roes 2 through 50.
On May 24, 2023, default was entered against Soto Plasencia on
First Southern’s cross-complaint.
On Plaintiff’s ex parte application heard on January 23, 2024,
the Court continued the trial date from February 22, 2024, to June 25,
2024.  At that time, the Court did not make an order extending any
discovery deadlines but ruled that either party could seek such relief through
a noticed motion.
On February 27, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to
reopen discovery in part and ruled that the deposition of Soto Plasencia could
be taken up until 30 days before the June 25 trial date.
On May 23, 2024, the Court approved the stipulation of the
parties and continued the trial date to January 23, 2025.  Discovery
remained closed, except as to the deposition of Soto Plasencia and expert
discovery.
On October 4, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s motion to compel and ordered Soto Plasencia to appear for
deposition and answer questions under oath on October 30, 2024. 
On November 13, 2024, Plaintiff field
this motion to modify the Court’s order of October 4.
No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128(a) states, in relevant part: 
“Every
court shall have the power to do all of the following:
…
(2) To
enforce order in the proceedings before it, or before a person or persons
empowered to conduct a judicial investigation under its authority.
(3) To
provide for the orderly conduct of proceedings before it, or its officers.
…
(8) To
amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and
justice….”
Discussion
Plaintiff seeks to modify the Court’s
order of October 4, 2024 (the “Order”). 
In the Order, the Court ordered Soto Plasencia to appear for deposition
and answer questions under oath on October 30, 2024, but Plaintiff was unable (despite
diligent efforts) to effect service of the Order on Soto Plasencia before the October
30 date.  (Leonardo Decl., ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff seeks to set the deposition on
December 18, 2024.
Plaintiff has shown good cause for the
requested relief.  The motion is granted.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to modify
the Court’s order of October 4, 2024.
The Court ORDERS Jose Soto
Plasencia to appear for deposition and answer questions under oath on December
18, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., at 1122 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California,
90017.
