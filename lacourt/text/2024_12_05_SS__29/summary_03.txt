And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Rodolfo Sanchez v. David Dingwall, Valerie Dingwall, Echo, Inc., and Doe defendants. The case involves an accident that allegedly occurred on October 7, 2019, while Plaintiff Sanchez was attempting to trim trees on Defendant Dingwall's property. Sanchez filed a Complaint on March 14, 2022, and Dingwall filed an answer on October 21, 2022. Dingwall then filed a motion for trial preference on November 6, 2024, citing her age and health as reasons for the request.

The Judge granted the motion, finding that Dingwall satisfied the requirements for a trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36. The Judge noted that Dingwall's age and health made it necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The Court set the trial date for February 27, 2025, within 120 days of the order, and denied any modification of the trial date.
