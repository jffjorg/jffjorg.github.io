Although the Plaintiff followed up with the defense, they still did not receive a response. As a result, the Judge grants the motion to compel. The Plaintiff is required to serve verified responses and documents within 14 calendar days of the ruling. If a privilege objection is made, a privilege log must also be served. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff did not request sanctions in a show of goodwill.
