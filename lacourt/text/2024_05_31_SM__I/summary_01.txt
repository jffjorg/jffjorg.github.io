And here is the English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The case is about a lien sought by judgment creditors against Vivera, alleging that any money paid by the defaulted defendants should be paid to them as a credit against the judgment rather than to Vivera. The second reason the case is before the court is for the default prove-up. The court is taking the unusual step of requiring a live prove-up because the judgment seeks $7.5 million in damages against Girardi. The court has several problems with the case. First, it is not inclined to believe that Los Angeles will simply award contracts to whoever former Mayor Villaraigosa endorses. The evidence of the defamatory comments is not well established. The court is not sure that there is any actual admissible evidence that the statements even were made. The court is aware that the default essentially admits the truth of the accusations, but even so, the court takes this with a box of salt. The court also notes that the alleged damages are not proven. The court will award damages as appropriate if the matter is proven up. The lien sought is proper, and when the prove-up occurs, the motion will be granted. However, the court notes that plaintiffs' counsel has filed a request to withdraw, and the matter will be continued until late July or August to allow the withdrawal motions to be heard and for plaintiffs to find new counsel.
