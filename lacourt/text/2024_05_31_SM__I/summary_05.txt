Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most knowledgeable and to produce documents at the deposition. The defendant has failed to provide a witness for the deposition, claiming that it has already provided a date for the deposition in November. However, the court finds that the plaintiff sent the initial notice of deposition in November 2023, and therefore the motion is not moot. The defendant must provide 10 options for deposition dates, and the plaintiff may choose from among those dates. If the defendant fails to provide the dates, the plaintiff may set the date unilaterally. The court also orders the defendant to produce documents 10 court days before the deposition, except for those withheld for privilege and for which there is a privilege log. The defendant may move for a protective order if it believes production is unduly burdensome, but must make a real showing based on evidence.
