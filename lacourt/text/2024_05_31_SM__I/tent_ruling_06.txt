 Case Number:  23SMCV06028    Hearing Date:   May 31, 2024    Dept:  I On May 29, 2024, plaintiff filed a notice of an attempt to
file joint materials.  Plaintiff asserts,
without detail, that it attempted to obtain defendant’s cooperation in filing
the FSC materials required but got no assistance and therefore it has lodged
unilateral documents.  That is not
sufficient and the case is NOT READY FOR TRIAL. 
If diligent efforts were made starting after the last hearing and
defendant simply went radio silent, that would be enough, but there is no
evidence to that effect.  Fortunately, it
appears that the parties have settled the matter.  According to plaintiff, a deal has been cut
and all that remains is to obtain proof of property insurance as to a leasehold
that defendant has.  Plaintiff therefore
requests that the matter be continued to allow the settlement to finalize.  The court will therefore CONTINUE the matter
and will discuss the new date with counsel. 
The court STRONGLY urges the parties to resolve this matter.  It is not fair to the court or to other
litigants to keep pushing the matter out further, taking up the court’s Friday
afternoon trial slot.  This will be the
last continuance.  At the next hearing,
the trial will go forward unless the parties have actually settled, or at least
settled possession.  It sounds like the
parties are very, very close, so the court expects the matter to be buttoned up
over the weekend.
 
Both parties are ORDERED to appear personally in court at
the next hearing and every hearing thereafter. 
That means not just through counsel. 
Counsel and the parties themselves (meaning the person in charge of the
company) will be present in court at all future hearings unless specifically
excused.
