 Case Number:  23SMCV01646    Hearing Date:   May 31, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to compel is GRANTED.  Plaintiff filed a Song-Beverly action against
defendants.  Discovery was served on
August 2, 2023 by plaintiff to the defense. 
No responses were received.  Plaintiff
followed up but still got no responses. 
The motions are therefore GRANTED.  
Verified responses without objection other than privilege will be served
within 14 calendar days of today, and documents will be served at the same
time.  If a privilege objection is made,
a privilege log will be served at the same time as the responses (as to the
RFP’s) and the response will be plain as to what information is being withheld
on the basis of the objection (as to the interrogatories).  In a show of goodwill, plaintiff did not
request sanctions.
