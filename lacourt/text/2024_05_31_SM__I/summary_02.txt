And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has reviewed the proposed judgment and objections. The court agrees that the jury's verdict was remitted due to an obvious error. However, the defendant did not agree that the verdict was correct or waive their right to challenge it. The court agrees that prejudgment interest started to run on July 12, 2024, at a rate of 10% simple. The court will ask the parties to calculate the amount of prejudgment interest. The court also agrees that the defendant has the right to challenge the amount of costs or move to strike costs if a ground exists. The court proposes a new form for the parties to calculate the amount of prejudgment interest and will need it by Tuesday, June 4, 2024. The judge also suggests some changes to the proposed judgment form.
