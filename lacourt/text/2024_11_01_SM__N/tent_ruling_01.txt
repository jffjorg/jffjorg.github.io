  Case Number:  23SMCV01522    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULINGDefendant Larry Moore’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $27,200. Costs shall be awarded per code.Defendants Geronimo Perez and Daniels, Fine, Israel, Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP’s Motion for Attorneys [sic] Fees and Costs Pursuant to Cal. Code Civil Proc. Section 425.16(c) is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $21,860.00. Costs shall be awarded per code.Moving parties to give notice. REASONINGOn May 8, 2024, the Court granted Defendants Geronimo Perez (“Perez”) and Daniels, Fine, Israel, Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP and Defendant Larry Moore (“Moore”) (collectively “Defendants”)’s special motions to strike pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. The Court entered an order granting the motions on that date and entered judgment in Defendants’ favor on June 24, 2024. Defendants now move for awards of attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c), which provides that “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.” Perez and Daniels, Fine, Israel, Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP moved for an award of $37,453.35 in fees and costs, which consists of $37,070 in fees and $383.35 in costs, while Moore moved for an award of $68,371.80, which consists of $67,365.50 in fees and $1,006.30 in costs. These motions came on for hearing on August 7, 2024, and the Court found that Defendants had not sufficiently set forth the bases for their fee requests, i.e., the Court could not conclude that 81.4 hours of work and 149.7 hours of work are reasonable amounts as to a single motion and related matters where the parties provided only block billing descriptions for the work performed and counsel billed at a high rate per hour, thereby implying that the time spent working on the special motions to strike and related matters could have been done in less time given counsel’s years of experience. The parties have now filed supplemental declarations and briefs for the Court’s review. Perez and Daniels, Fine, Israel, Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP has amended their request with this supplemental briefing to seek $49,625.00 in attorney fees and $383.35 in costs, thereby increasing the amount sought, while Moore has decreased his request to seek $60,707.50 in attorney fees and $1,006.30 in costs.The Court notes that in its prior order continuing the hearing on these motions the Court concluded that it had jurisdiction to rule on Defendants’ motions because Plaintiffs Susan Jeffers and 2444 Fourth Street, LLC (“Plaintiffs”)’s appeal of the Court’s order granting the Defendants’ special motions to strike only stayed proceedings on the merits of the causes of action affected by the special motions to strike, and the determination of whether Defendants are entitled to recover attorney fees does not affect or modify the order granting Defendants’ special motions to strike that is now subject to the appeal.The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[A] computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin v. Reg’l Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The Court has reviewed the billing sheets provided by the parties and rules as follows:Defendant Larry Moore seeks compensation for 136 hours of work at varying rates between $300 and $575, with most work performed at a rate of $425 or higher. First, the Court will not award supplemental fees for work performed after August 7, 2024, because that work is the result of counsel’s own error in failing to provide the necessary information at the first hearing. The Court also finds it unreasonable to research and draft the anti-SLAPP motion or the reply brief to take so many hours when counsel was billing at a rate of $425 or $495. The Court exercises its discretion to reduce the hourly rate to $200 for all attorneys because much of the drafting of the motion could have been done by an associate billing at a lower rate, i.e., it is reasonable for an attorney billing at a rate of $200 per hour to spend 136 hours on work related to an anti-SLAPP motion, but it is unreasonable for an attorney billing at a rate of $425 or more to spend that much time on such a motion. The Court does not omit the work performed relating to “Research and analyze authorities re demurrer costs and attorney’s fees recoverable under anti-SLAPP statute and prepare additional argument for motion for attorney’s fees” because the work related to an attorney fees motion can be accomplished, even if a demurrer is mentioned, in a reasonable 0.9 hours. Thus, Defendant Larry Moore’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $27,200. Costs shall be awarded per code.Defendants Perez and Daniels, Fine, Israel, Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP seek compensation for 104.9 hours of work performed at a rate of $450 per hour and 4.4 hours of work performed at $500 per hour. The Court is not convinced that the time spent on the work identified in the billing sheets is warranted given the hourly rate employed by the attorneys. For example, the Court finds it unreasonable for a partner to spend more than three hours drafting an ex parte application to file a late anti-SLAPP motion or nearly three hours reviewing documents already familiar to counsel in preparation for oral argument. The Court exercises its discretion to reduce the hourly rate to $250 for both attorneys because, again, much of the drafting of the motion could have been done by an associate billing at a lower rate, i.e., it is reasonable for an attorney billing at a rate of $250 per hour to spend 109.3 hours on work related to an anti-SLAPP motion, but it is unreasonable for an attorney billing at a rate of $450 or more to spend that much time on such a motion. Thus, Defendants Geronimo Perez and Daniels, Fine, Israel, Schonbuch & Lebovits, LLP’s Motion for Attorneys [sic] Fees and Costs Pursuant to Cal. Code Civil Proc. Section 425.16(c) is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $21,860. Costs shall be awarded per code.
