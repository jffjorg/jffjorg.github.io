Summary:

The Court's tentative ruling grants Intervenor Paul Haines Living Trust's motion to intervene and continue the trial in this action. The Court finds that Intervenor has a direct and substantial interest in the property that is the subject of this litigation and that its interests are not adequately represented by Defendant, who no longer has any interest in the property. The Court grants a 90-day continuance of the trial, final status conference, and related deadlines, and orders the trial to be continued to April 29, 2024. The Court also orders Intervenor to file and serve its Answer (In Intervention) on or before November 22, 2023.
