And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to Defendant's demurrer to the second and third causes of action in the fifth amended complaint (5AC). The 5AC alleges medical malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and intentional misrepresentation by various defendants, including Defendant Dinh, for failing to disclose risks of surgery after abstaining from blood thinner medication and for concealing the cause of Plaintiff's stroke. The Judge has converted the demurrer to a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and denied the motion in its entirety. The Judge finds that the 5AC adequately pleads ultimate facts that Defendant Dinh knowingly made false representations in connection with Plaintiff's falsified medical records and to obscure the cause of Plaintiff's stroke.
