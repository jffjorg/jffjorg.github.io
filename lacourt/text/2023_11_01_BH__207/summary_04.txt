And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the plaintiff's complaint and has determined that the ultimate facts alleged are sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge notes that ultimate facts are those that constitute the cause of action or those upon which liability depends, such as a duty of care, breach of the duty, and causation (damages). The judge also notes that evidentiary facts do not need to be alleged at the pleading stage, and that the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge is relying on various California court decisions to support this ruling, including Doe v. City of Los Angeles, C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist., Central Valley General Hosp. v. Smith, and Rodriguez v. Parivar, Inc.
