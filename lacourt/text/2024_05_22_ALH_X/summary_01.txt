And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted in part plaintiff Ruben Yepez's motion to compel the deposition of defendant General Motors LLC's person most qualified. The court finds that defendant failed to appear for deposition and did not provide an explanation for the non-appearance. The court orders defendant to produce its person most qualified for deposition and to produce responsive documents. The court also denies plaintiff's request for sanctions. Defendant is to produce its person most qualified on a mutually agreeable date within 30 days of this order.
