And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Inland Valley Humane Society v. Noriega, et al. The Petitioner, Inland Valley Humane Society, on behalf of the City of Pomona, has filed a Petition to Declare Dog Vicious against Respondent Martin Noriega. The Petition is supported by the declaration of Animal Control Officer Stephanie Aldaco, which describes an incident in which Quimbo, a dog owned by Noriega, bit Joe Gonzales, causing severe injuries.

The judge finds that Quimbo falls within the definition of a "vicious dog" under California Food & Agriculture Code section 31603, subdivision (a), as it attacked Gonzales without provocation and caused severe injuries. The judge adopts the Petitioner's recommendations for the conditions for Quimbo's release to Noriega, which include keeping Quimbo in a secure kennel, muzzle, and Vicious Dog collar when off the property, posting a sign warning of the presence of a vicious dog, obtaining a liability insurance policy, and enrolling Quimbo in obedience training classes.

The judge also orders Noriega to pay $2,369.00 in expenses, fines, and fees incurred, and to pay all related fees for impound, food, and care. The judge grants the Petition and orders Noriega to file and serve a proposed order within 20 days of the ruling.
