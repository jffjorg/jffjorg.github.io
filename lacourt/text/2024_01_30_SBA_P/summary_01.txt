And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to conduct limited discovery filed by the plaintiff, Christine McCaslin. The motion was filed in response to the defendant's anti-SLAPP motion, which seeks to strike the plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The judge has granted the motion in part, allowing the plaintiff to conduct limited discovery to oppose the anti-SLAPP motion. Specifically, the judge has allowed the plaintiff to conduct a two-hour deposition regarding screenshots posted by the defendant, as well as to obtain documents and information about social media posts attributed to the plaintiff.

However, the judge has also denied the plaintiff's request to conduct broader discovery, finding that the plaintiff has failed to show that the discovery sought is necessary to support her claim. The judge has emphasized the need for plaintiffs to demonstrate "good cause" before taking any discovery after the filing of an anti-SLAPP motion, and has noted that the plaintiff has failed to identify specific items of evidence that would be relevant to her prima facie case.

The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for a subpoena to Telegram for relevant messages from the plaintiff and defendant, finding that this discovery would be relevant to the issues raised by the parties.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a mixed decision, granting the plaintiff limited discovery while also emphasizing the need for plaintiffs to demonstrate a strong showing of "good cause" before taking any discovery in response to an anti-SLAPP motion.
