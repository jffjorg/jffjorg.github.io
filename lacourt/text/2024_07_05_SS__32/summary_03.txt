And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, County of Los Angeles, moves for summary judgment, arguing that it owed no duty of care, no dangerous condition existed, and there is no evidence of a wrongful or negligent act by its employee. The plaintiff, Nina Renee Richardson, opposes the motion, alleging that the intersection where the incident occurred was a dangerous condition of public property.

After reviewing the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the court denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court finds that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the intersection was a dangerous condition of public property. Specifically, the plaintiff has presented evidence that the physical characteristics of the street created a substantial risk that a driver using due care while traveling would be unable to see a pedestrian using due care while crossing. Therefore, Government Code section 830.4 does not apply to this allegation.

The court concludes that the case should proceed to trial to resolve the disputes between the parties. The defendant is directed to provide notice of this ruling and file a proof of service of such.
