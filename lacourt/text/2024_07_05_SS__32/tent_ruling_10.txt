[1] Although
Defendant characterizes this as an “application”, presumably under Code of
Civil Procedure section 877.6(a)(2), he also “moves” the Court for an order, has
reserved a hearing date, and given notice to all the parties in this action.
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6(a)(1) [“Any party to an action in which it is
alleged that two or more parties are joint tortfeasors or co-obligors on a
contract debt shall be entitled to a hearing on the issue of the good faith of
a settlement entered into by the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more
alleged tortfeasors or co-obligors, upon giving notice in the manner provided
in subdivision (b) of Section 1005.”].) Therefore, the Court will treat this as
a motion under section 877.6(a)(1).
