And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a motion for an order determining the good faith of a settlement agreement between Defendant Dorian Lopez and Plaintiffs Delia Caballeros and Jayden Velasquez. The settlement agreement was for $15,000 and $10,383, respectively, and each side will bear their own fees and costs. Defendant argues that the settlement exceeds Plaintiffs' claimed damages and reflects her entire insurance policy limit, and that it was negotiated at arm's length and contained no collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct. Since there is no opposition to the motion, the Court grants the motion and finds that the settlement was made in good faith.
