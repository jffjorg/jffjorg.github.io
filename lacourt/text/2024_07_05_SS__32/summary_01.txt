And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a personal injury case involving Plaintiff Matthew Morgan and Defendant Adan Villareal. The Defendant has moved to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories and Request for Production, which the Plaintiff opposes. The judge notes that no Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) has taken place, as required by the Court's standing order. Therefore, the judge continues the motions to July 22, 2024 and sets the matter for an IDC on July 8, 2024. The parties are ordered to meet and confer by telephone to attempt to resolve their issues before the IDC. The judge also orders the Defendant to provide notice of the Court's orders and file a proof of service of such.
