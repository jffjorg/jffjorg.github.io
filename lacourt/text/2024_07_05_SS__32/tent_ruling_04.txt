[1] Though
Plaintiff asserts in Opposition that Defendant’s Separate Statement fails to
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1350, the Court excuses the
defect and declines to deny based on procedural grounds. (See Opp., 12.) 


[2] Although
Defendant has set forth evidence that Lozoya saw Plaintiff prior to the impact
(UMF 19), Defendant has not set forth evidence regarding when Lozoya saw
Plaintiff and the impact of the alleged physical characteristics of the street
on Lozoya’s ability to timely see Plaintiff in order to stop.


[3] Absent
this evidence regarding the physical condition of the street, however,
Plaintiff does not explain how the allegations regarding the lack of
installation of in-roadway lighting and additional warnings (see Opposition at
p. 17) would not be covered by Government Code section 830.4 or otherwise fall
within the County’s general lack of duty to provide lighting. Moreover, none of
the other expert declarations appear to discuss the physical condition of the
street. Nonetheless, Defendant has not presented evidence or argument regarding
causation in this motion for summary judgment (other than as discussed infra
in footnote 2) and the Court does not weigh the evidence.


[4] Defendant’s
reply brief raises for the first time arguments regarding the lack of notice of
the alleged dangerous condition and design immunity pursuant to Government Code
section 830.6. The Court declines to consider arguments raised for the first
time in reply. Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of Plaintiff’s Third
Cause of Action relies on the same evidence and argument as to Plaintiff’s
Second Cause of Action. Therefore, the Court also denies the motion for summary
adjudication.
