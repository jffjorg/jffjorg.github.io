And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment/adjudication filed by the Defendant. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant's Separate Statement fails to comply with California Rules of Court, but the Court excuses the defect. The Defendant has presented evidence that Lozoya saw the Plaintiff prior to the impact, but has not shown how the physical condition of the street affected Lozoya's ability to timely see the Plaintiff. The Court notes that the Plaintiff does not explain how the allegations regarding the lack of installation of in-roadway lighting and additional warnings would not be covered by Government Code section 830.4 or otherwise fall within the County's general lack of duty to provide lighting. The Defendant's reply brief raises new arguments regarding lack of notice and design immunity, which the Court declines to consider. The Court denies the motion for summary judgment/adjudication.
