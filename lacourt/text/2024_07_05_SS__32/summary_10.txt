And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling by the Judge addresses a motion submitted by the Defendant, which the Court will treat as a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6(a)(1). The Defendant has reserved a hearing date and given notice to all parties. The issue at hand is the good faith of a settlement entered into by the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more alleged tortfeasors or co-obligors. The Judge notes that the Defendant's motion is characterized as an "application", but also includes elements of a motion, and therefore will be treated as a motion under the relevant statute.
