Significant Statements:

```

Summary:

The Judge has denied both of Avalon's motions for summary judgment/adjudication (MSJ/MSA) without prejudice. The MSJ/MSA as to Plaintiffs' complaint is denied because Avalon did not adequately address all theories of liability, including its failure to conduct repairs after September 1, 2020. The MSJ/MSA as to Avalon's cross-complaint is denied because Avalon failed to address the indemnification provision in the Addendum to the Management Agreement.
