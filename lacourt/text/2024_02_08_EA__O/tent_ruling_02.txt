[1] Due to the numerous
filings in this case, the procedural background only provides the pertinent
filings. 


[2] According to
CCP 473 (q), “In granting or
denying a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, the court need
rule only on those objections to evidence that it deems material to its
disposition of the motion. Objections to evidence that are not ruled on for
purposes of the motion shall be preserved for appellate review.” As for both
motions the burden did not shift the opposing party, the court is not ruling on
any evidentiary objections.

Fidelity National Title Co. (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 486, 493 [“The pleadings
play a key role in a summary judgment motion. The function of the pleadings in
a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues and to
frame the outer measure of materiality.”]; see also Twaite v. Allstate
(1989) 216 Cal App 3d 239, 250 [“[A]allegations of the complaint frame the
issues which the moving party is obligated to refute in moving for summary
judgment.”].) 
 


[4] S & L
ASSOCIATION MANAGEMENT, INC. (“S & L”) was the former property management
company for the HOA before Avalon was hired by the HOA. (¶61.)


[5] But see Opp. p.
10:22-23 [“First, Avalon has not presented any evidence that Avalon has
performed any deferred maintenance repairs to the Subject Property.”].) 
 


[6] Though this is a
disputed material fact. (See Opp. p. 15 [From October 2017, through the
present, the monthly HOA dues have been increased several times].) 
 


[7] As relevant here, section 800,
subdivision (b)(1) (section
800(b)(1)) provides: “No action may be instituted or maintained
in right of any domestic or foreign corporation by any holder of shares ...
unless ...:[¶] (1) The plaintiff alleges in the complaint that plaintiff was a
shareholder, of record or beneficially ... at the time of the transaction or
any part thereof of which plaintiff complains or that plaintiff's shares ...
thereafter devolved upon plaintiff by operation of law from a holder who was a
holder at the time of the transaction or any part thereof complained of....” 
 


[8] In opposition, the HOA largely argues
that the disagreement between the HOA and Avalon should have been sent to
arbitration. First, while a hearing is reserved for a petition to compel
arbitration, the court does not find a petition in the docket. Second, the
Addendum (section 9.8) does not require arbitration in all circumstances.
Instead, arbitration is limited to disputes “which cannot be amicably resolved
in a timely manner.” (Avalon’s Evidence, p. 51 of 68 of PDF.) The meaning of
“timely manner” is unclear from the plain language. Third, it appears that the
HOA has waived its right to arbitration because it has been a part of the
litigation since 6/26/23 (as to the cross complaint) but has still participated
in litigation. To just now argue arbitration should be compelled after
the filing of an MSJ is prejudicial to Avalon.  
 


[9] All
Avalon states in its motion is that “To the extent that the Association cited
plaintiffs’ accusations of “gross negligence” as a reason to deny Avalon a
defense, the Association (and its attorney) plainly erred because that limiting
language doesn’t appear in the S&L agreement – and of course because the
standard is “potential” liability, such language would not excuse the
Association from defending Avalon anyway.” (Motion p. 11:8-12.)
