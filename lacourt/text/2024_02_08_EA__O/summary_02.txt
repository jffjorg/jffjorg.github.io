And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the numerous filings in this case and has found that the HOA's motion for summary judgment is premature due to the disputed material facts. The court notes that the HOA has failed to present evidence that Avalon has performed any deferred maintenance repairs, and that the HOA's allegations of gross negligence are unfounded. The court also finds that the HOA has waived its right to arbitration by participating in the litigation since 6/26/23. The court reserves its ruling on the petition to compel arbitration.
