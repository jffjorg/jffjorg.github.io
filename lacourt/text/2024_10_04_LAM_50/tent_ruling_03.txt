[1]The Romano
Court noted that “[i]t is alleged that in 1941 a Peruvian corporation named
‘Industrial Pesquera, S.A.’ executed a written contract with plaintiff and one
Reed, copartners, for the exclusive right for the period of 10 years to sell
its fish and fish products. In June 1942, the partnership of appellant and Reed
was dissolved. Appellant took over the entire business and with the oral
consent of Pesquera, the written contract was continued in force, and appellant
continued the business under the old partnership name having duly filed a
certificate for that purpose. In June, 1943, defendants falsely represented to
Pasquera that appellant was not fit or qualified to represent them, that
Pesquera could deal more profitably and advantageously with defendants if it
would discontinue its contractual relations with plaintiff and deal solely
through defendants, and persuaded them to cancel their contract with appellant
and to refuse to pay him the agreed commissions as agent.” (Romano v. Wilbur Ellis & Co., supra, 82 Cal.App.2d at pp. 671-672.)
