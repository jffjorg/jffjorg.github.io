And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the allegations made by Romano against Wilbur Ellis & Co. It appears that in 1941, Romano and Reed, copartners, executed a written contract with Industrial Pesquera, S.A. for the exclusive right to sell its fish and fish products for 10 years. When the partnership was dissolved in June 1942, Romano took over the business and continued the contract with Industrial Pesquera, S.A. However, in June 1943, defendants falsely represented to Industrial Pesquera, S.A. that Romano was not fit or qualified to represent them, and persuaded them to cancel the contract and deal solely with defendants instead. The court will consider whether these actions were justified and whether Romano has a legitimate claim against Wilbur Ellis & Co.
