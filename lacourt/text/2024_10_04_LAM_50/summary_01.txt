And here is a summary in English text:

The court's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the County of Los Angeles (Defendant) in response to the First Amended Verified Complaint (FAC) filed by LA Live Theatre, LLC (Plaintiff). The FAC alleges that the County over-assessed the value of a performing arts theater venue and seeks a refund of property taxes paid. The Defendant demurs to the FAC, arguing that it is uncertain and fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Defendant also moves to strike portions of the FAC, claiming that they are irrelevant, false, or improper.

The court overrules the Defendant's demurrer, finding that the FAC is sufficient to state a cause of action. The court also denies the Defendant's motion to strike, finding that the allegations at issue are not irrelevant, false, or improper.

The court orders the Defendant to file and serve its answer to the FAC within 10 days of the date of the order.
