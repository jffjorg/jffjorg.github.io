And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Yasin Kucuk to the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC) filed by Cross-Complainants WK CK Sherman Oaks Venture, L.L.C. and Waterton Residential, L.L.C. The demurrer challenged the sufficiency of the allegations in the FAXC regarding the causes of action (COAs) for express indemnity, equitable indemnity, apportionment of fault and contribution, and declaratory relief.

The court disagrees with Cross-Defendant's argument that the allegations are insufficient to plead any of the COAs, citing the allegations of wrongful conduct and breach of duty against Cross-Defendant. The court finds that the allegations of tortious conduct, including blocking the driveway and causing an accident, are sufficient to support all four COAs.

As a result, the demurrer to the FAXC is overruled in its entirety. An answer to the FAXC is due within 10 days.
