23VECV00995
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Cross-Defendant Yasin Kucuk’s Demurrer to the
First Amended Cross-Complaint is OVERRULED in its entirety.  Answer due within 10 days.
Introduction 
Cross-Defendant Yasin Kucuk
(Cross-Defendant) demurred to Cross-Complainants WK CK Sherman Oaks Venture,
L.L.C. (Venture) and Waterton Residential, L.L.C.’s (Waterton) (collectively,
Cross-Complainants) First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC).  The demurrer placed into issue the first
cause of action (COA) for express indemnity, the second COA for equitable
indemnity, the third COA for apportionment of fault and contribution, and the
fourth COA for declaratory relief.
Discussion 
Cross-Defendant argued that the
allegations of the FAXC are insufficient to plead any of the COAs because there
are no allegations to plead any wrongful conduct and thus insufficient
allegations as to duty, breach, causation, damages owed to Plaintiff.  However, the Court disagrees with
Cross-Defendant because Cross-Defendant’s arguments appear to be based upon a
mis-reading of the allegations.  At
minimum, Cross-Defendant is alleged to have blocked the driveway causing
Defendant Bharath Kandasamy to enter the opposing lane of traffic and strike
Plaintiff.  The tort or duty alleged
against Cross-Defendant is to operate his vehicle in a safe manner and/or not
block/impede the flow of traffic.  This
allegation of tortious conduct is sufficient to support all four COAs.  
The demurrer to the FAXC is
OVERRULED.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
