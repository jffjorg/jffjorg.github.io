And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to file a second amended complaint, but with certain conditions. The plaintiff must file and serve the entire second amended complaint with all exhibits attached by April 16, 2024. If the plaintiff fails to do so, the complaint may be stricken by an ex parte application. The court will not address the merits of the case at this stage, but will instead focus on ensuring that the plaintiff complies with the filing and service requirements.
