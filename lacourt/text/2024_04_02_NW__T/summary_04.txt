And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to expunge the lis pendens, which was recorded by the plaintiffs. The court finds that the claims alleged in the complaint do not affect title or possession of the property, and therefore do not support a real property claim. The court also grants the defendants' request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,875.00, to be paid jointly and severally by the plaintiffs. Additionally, the court reduces the amount of attorney fees awarded to $1,875.00, which will be paid from the client trust account of Scheer Law Group, LLP.
