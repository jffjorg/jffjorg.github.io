Defendants’ motion to compel plaintiff to respond to RFP Set No. 2 and sanctions: Grant.  The parties were sent an email on 3/18/2024 which directed plaintiff’s counsel to serve Code compliant responses. Plaintiff's counsel claims to have served the responses but no responses were provided to the court. Plaintiff is ordered to serve Verified Code Compliant written responses and document production without objection -- except for attorney client privilege as there is no evidence that it has been knowingly waived by plaintiff -- by 4/19/2024.  Plaintiff's counsel states the error is hers so Estrada Law Group APC only is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the sum of $760 to the Client Trust Account of Bretoi, Lutz & Stele, P.O. Box 10790, Santa Ana, CA 92711 by 5/2/2024 pursuant to CCP section 2031.310 for discovery abuse without substantial justification.
