  Case Number:  23VECV00891    Hearing Date:   April 2, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV00891 LORI MURPHY vs SHERMAN OAKS HOSPITAL
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: Plaintiff's Motion to File Second Amended Complaint
Defense counsel to confirm receipt of the entire Exhibit package.  If not, it needs to be re-served on defense counsel immediately and the court will continue the hearing.  If is has been received by defense counsel, then the motion is granted because the court will give effect to the obvious intent of the motion, and plaintiff is ordered to file and serve the entirety of the Second Amended Complaint WITH THE EXHIBITS ATTACHED BY 4/16/2024. The court will not address the merits of the case at this stage.   
Failure by plaintiff to serve and file the entirety of the Second Amended Complaint WITH THE EXHIBITS ATTACHED BY 4/16/2024 will result in any Second Amended Complaint served and filed later than 4/16/2024 subject to being stricken by ex parte application.
It is so ordered, Clerk (only) to give notice.
