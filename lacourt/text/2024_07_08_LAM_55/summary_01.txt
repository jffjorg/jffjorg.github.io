Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is as follows: The Court denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in regards to the Second Cause of Action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Defendant argued that it cannot be liable for a bad faith claim because it denied coverage based on a genuine dispute about coverage, and relied upon experts' opinions indicating the car was in motion when damaged. However, the Court found that the Defendant may have unreasonably relied upon automobile data in denying Plaintiffs' claim for damage to a parked car. The Court determined that a factfinder reasonably could find that the Defendant unreasonably and with malice denied Plaintiffs' claim, and therefore the bad faith claim survives summary adjudication. As a result, Plaintiffs' request for punitive damages and attorneys' fees also survives summary adjudication.
