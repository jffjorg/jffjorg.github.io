Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions: a motion to quash service of summons and First Amended Complaint by Defendant Redpoint, and a motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint by Plaintiff. The Judge grants the motion to quash service of summons and dismisses the action as to Defendant Redpoint, citing direct estoppel and the lack of personal jurisdiction. The Judge also grants leave for Plaintiff to file a Second Amended Complaint, but only if it omits Defendant Redpoint. The Judge strikes the First Amended Complaint, which was filed without leave to amend, and orders the Plaintiff to file a new Second Amended Complaint within 10 days.
