And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the dispute between Leland and CDF regarding the interpretation of Section 4 of the Purchase Agreement. Leland argues that the contingencies are automatically removed if CDF does not affirmatively do so. However, the judge finds that an email exchange between counsel does not support Leland's position. The email exchange, which was introduced as extrinsic evidence, does not contain language stating that the contingencies are automatically removed if CDF does not affirmatively act. The judge concludes that the email exchange does not help Leland's cause and that the court should not consider extrinsic evidence in this case.
