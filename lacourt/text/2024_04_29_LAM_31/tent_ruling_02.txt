[1] Bold and Italics added. 


[2] The Purchase Agreement was signed
by the parties on March 8, 2023, which is the Effective Date.


[3] Force majeure clause omitted.


[4] If the court were to consider
extrinsic evidence, Leland’s submission does not help its cause.  In support of its “automatic removal”
interpretation, Leland submits an email from its counsel Aaron Iskowtiz
(“Iskowtiz”) and counsel at Marcus & Millichap who negotiated the Purchase
Agreement and Counter Offer with CDF.  In
an email sent from Iskowitz to Leland’s counsel, Iskowitz states, “Let’s add to
the counter that they must accept by 5pm pacific today and open escrow tomorrow
as a condition with no contingencies.” 
(Iskowitz Decl., Ex. C.)  Contrary
to Leland’s position, however, this evidence does not support their
interpretation of Section 4.  There is no
language in this email that states the contingencies are automatically removed
if CDF did not affirmatively do so.
