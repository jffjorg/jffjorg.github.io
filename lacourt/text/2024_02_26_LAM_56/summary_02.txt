And here is the English summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion to compel arbitration in this employment dispute case. The Defendant, JMG Investments, Inc. dba Harmony Place, argued that a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties and that the Plaintiff, John Nicolas Marsic, refuses to arbitrate the controversy. The court found that the arbitration agreement is valid and that the Plaintiff's filing of a lawsuit against the Defendant and the Plaintiff's refusal to stipulate to arbitration establish his refusal to arbitrate. The court concluded that the Motion to Compel Arbitration is granted, and the parties are ordered to arbitrate their disputes.
