And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to Plaintiff Jinhee Kim's motion to strike Defendant Brandon Kim's entire cross-complaint. The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers. The Court finds that the cross-complaint was filed four days after the answer to the SAC was filed, which violates CCP ยง 428.50(c)'s requirement to obtain leave from the court. Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff's motion to strike the entire cross-complaint, without prejudice to Defendant's seeking leave to file his cross-complaint by motion. The Court also grants Plaintiff's request for judicial notice and sets the matter for a hearing on February 26, 2024.
