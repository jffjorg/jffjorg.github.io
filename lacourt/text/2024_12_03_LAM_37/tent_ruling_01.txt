Background
 
On July 10, 2024, Nomi
Abadi (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Daniel Elfman (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 to 10, alleging a single cause of action for defamation per se. The
Complaint alleges that famed film and music composer, Defendant Elfman, defamed
Plaintiff in a July 29, 2023, Rolling Stone article in which Defendant
painted Plaintiff as a spurned lover who retaliated against Defendant by making
false sexual misconduct allegations against him. 
 
Defendant Elfman has
filed a motion to strike several allegations in Plaintiff’s Complaint.
Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
The court notes
that “ ‘[t]aking judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting the
truth of its contents or accepting the interpretation of its meaning.’
[Citation.] While courts take judicial notice of public records, they do not
take judicial notice of the truth of matters stated therein. [Citation.] ‘When
judicial notice is taken of a document,…the truthfulness and proper
interpretation of the document are disputable.’ [Citation.]” (Herrera v.
Deutsche National Trust Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375
 
Defendant Elfman seeks judicial
notice of the following: 
 
Exhibit 1: An article by Rolling Stone, dated July 10, 2024, entitled “Danny
Elfman Sexual Misconduct Accuser Sues Film Composer for Defamation” which
is available at https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/danny-elfman-sued-for-defamation-over-sexualabuse-denial-1235056742/#. 
 
Exhibit 2: An article by Rolling Stone, dated July 19, 2023, entitled “Danny
Elfman Settled a Sexual-Harassment Allegation for $830,000” which is
available at https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/danny-elfman-nomi-abadi-sexual-harassmentallegation-1234791842/#. 
 
The court grants Defendant
Elfman’s request for judicial notice of Exhibit 2 because it is the publication
at issue in the Complaint and while the truthfulness of the statements is
disputed, the contents of the publication are not disputed. The court may only
judicially notice the existence of the record, not that its contents are the
truth. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) 
 
The court fails to see the
relevance of Exhibit 1 and denies the request for judicial notice as to Exhibit
1. “Although a court may judicially notice a variety of matters (Evid. Code,
§¿450 et seq.), only relevant material may be noticed.” (American Cemwood
Corp. v. American Home Assurance Co. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 431, 441, fn.
7.)  
 
MOtion to strike[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP, § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
B.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
The Complaint alleges that
Defendant Elfman engaged in sexual misconduct against Plaintiff and that he
destroyed Plaintiff’s credibility, reputation, and career by denying the
allegations in a July 19, 2023, Rolling Stone article entitled “Danny
Elfman Settled a Sexual-Harassment Allegation for $830,000.” (Compl, ¶¶ 3, 4,
10, 25, 70; RJN Ex. 2.) 
 
In the Rolling Stone article,  Defendant Elfman alleged that Plaintiff’s
allegations were “ ‘vicious and wholly false’ ”, the “ ‘intention was to break
up [his] marriage and replace [his] wife,’ ” and as a spurned lover,
Plaintiff  retaliated via “fabricated
sexual harassment allegations to make him ‘pay for rejecting her,’ and that
‘[Defendant has] ‘done nothing indecent or wrong.’ ” (Compl., ¶ 11; RJN Ex. 2
at pp. 3-4.) Defendant Elman moves to strike various allegations in Plaintiff’s
Complaint on the basis that the allegations are irrelevant, false, and improver
and not essential to a claim or defense. (CCP, §§ 436; 431.10(b)(1).) 
 
The specific allegations
Defendant Elfman seeks to strike are the following: 
 

Paragraph 3:7-10:
     ““Defendant Daniel Elfman (“Elfman”) peddled appalling lies for
     publication to Rolling Stone about Nomi, who had previously, truthfully
     relayed facts corroborating his penchant to sexually abuse women. Why? As
     part of a harebrained ‘zero sum’ scheme by Elfman to prop up his checkered
     reputation by destroying Nomi’s credibility.”
Paragraph 10:8-9:
     “ – fearful that Elfman’s career would be finished if the public knew the
     truth about his own perversions –”
Paragraph 42:17-19:
     “Initially, Elfman feigned embarrassment about his nudity, but reiterated
     to Nomi that nudity was an essential part of his writing routine and
     enhanced his creativity.”
Paragraph 53:24-27:
     “Each time Elfman masturbated in front of Nomi, he increased the gravity
     of his tone to make Nomi keep his misbehavior a secret, sometimes towering
     over Nomi and pointing a finger in her face while he made his demands.
     Nomi was intimidated and petrified and obliged.”
Paragraph 54:2-4:
     “Nomi tried every way to protect herself from Elfman and establish
     boundaries while trying to resume the professional relationship they had
     started out with when Elfman, Nomi’s childhood musical hero, first invited
     her to his studio.” 
Paragraph 55:8-11:
     “All her efforts to wear more layers of clothing, to stop wearing makeup,
     to appear as professionally as possible, to be less friendly, to make
     fewer jokes, to try to focus all conversations on music and scoring and
     visiting less frequently and for shorter durations of time, were futile in
     thwarting Elfman’s conduct.”
Paragraph 56:13-16:
     “On at least one occasion, while he and Nomi were talking in his studio
     compound living room, Elfman interrupted Nomi and told her to ‘keep
     looking at him like that.’ Nomi did not know what Elfman meant but
     realized that he was masturbating. Nomi was not only blindsided, but
     mortified and humiliated.”
Paragraph 59:2-5: “Nomi felt uncomfortable with Elfman’s nudity and scared when
     he masturbated in front of her and coerced her into taking nude photos she
     did not want to take, forcing her hand on herself when she showed no
     sexual desire toward Elfman, and felt ashamed each time Elfman would
     manage to gain, break, regain her trust, and betray her again.”
Paragraph 61:17-22:
     “Nomi felt disgusted, belittled, isolated, and scared. A visibly upset
     Elfman hastily placed the glass of semen ejaculate back in his
     refrigerator. Nomi recalls the air in the room being tense and unsafe. Elfman
     opened up his laptop and made a comment about Donald Trump to break the
     silence. When Nomi responded by expressing her support for Bernie Sanders,
     Elfman told Nomi that ‘We can’t have a Jew running our country.’ Nomi was
     stunned and pushed back on Elfman’s antisemitic comment.” 
Entirety of Paragraphs
     18-19, 35, 37-40, 43-44, 46-47, 50-51, 58, and 62.


 
“The elements of a defamation
claim are (1) a publication that is (2) false, (3) defamatory, (4)
unprivileged, and (5) has a natural tendency to injure or causes special
damage.” (Jackson v. Mayweather (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 1240, 1259 (Jackson)
[internal citation omitted].) “In general, leaving aside certain qualifications
that are not relevant in this case, a written communication that is false, that
is not protected by any privilege, and that exposes a person to contempt or
ridicule or certain other reputational injuries, constitutes libel.” (Shively
v. Bozanich (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1230, 1242.) 
 
The Complaint alleges that
Defendant Elfman’s denial of Plaintiff’s allegations and characterization of
Plaintiff as a spurned lover who retaliated against him by making false
allegations ruined her professional reputation as a composer and musician and harmed
her future job opportunities and career prospects of working in the film
composing industry. (Compl., ¶¶ 3, 4, 25, 28.) Per the Rolling Stone article,
Defendant Elfman is attributed as having stated that Plaintiff’s sexual
misconduct accusations were “vicious and wholly false” and that he and his
lawyers “stand ready to prove with voluminous evidence that these accusations
are false.” (RJN Ex. 2, pp. 3-4.) The court finds that the nature of the sexual
relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant Elfman, as well as the specific
sexual misconduct allegations Plaintiff made about Defendant Elfman, are
relevant to this action and it is not improper for Plaintiff to reiterate and
elaborate on them in her Complaint. “In passing on the correctness of a ruling
on a motion to strike, judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a
motion to strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their
truth.” (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.) 
 
While Defendant’s Motion seeks
to strike allegations about Defendant Elfman masturbating in front of
Plaintiff, exposing himself, taking nude photos of Plaintiff, and presenting
Plaintiff with a martini glass that contained semen, those allegations are repeated
in the Rolling Stone article and the truthfulness of those allegations
remains disputed. (See RJN Ex. 2 at pp. 8-10.) 
The trier of fact determines
whether Plaintiff’s allegations were truthful. Moreover, Plaintiff as a public
figure or semi-public figure must prove that Defendant Elfman acted with malice
when asserting that Plaintiff’s sexual misconduct allegations were wholly
false. “Where, as here, the plaintiff is a limited public figure, he must prove
both that the challenged statement is false, and that the defendant made the
libelous statement with ‘actual malice.’ ” (Edward v. Ellis (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 780, 790.) “ ‘If the person defamed is a public figure, he cannot
recover unless he proves, by clear and convincing evidence ..., that the
libelous statement was made with actual malice—that is, with knowledge that it
was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.’ ” (Jackson,
supra, 10 Cal.App.5th at p. 1260 [internal citations omitted].) 
 
Plaintiff asserts that the
Complaint’s detailed allegations of sexual misconduct show that Defendant
Elfman knew his statements to Rolling Stone were false and contradicted
Plaintiff’s sexual misconduct allegations against Defendant. Plaintiff
maintains that striking Plaintiff’s Complaint would render the Complaint
defective as it would fail to show the falsity of Defendant Elfman’s
statements. Plaintiff further asserts that allegations are an effort to prove
actual malice by circumstantial evidence. (See Billauer v. Escobar-Eck (2023)
88 Cal.App.5th 953, 978; Reader's Digest Assn. v. Superior Court (1984)
37 Cal.3d 244, 257.) 
 
According to the Rolling
Stone article “Elfman painted their relationship as platonic, claiming that
Abadi had attempted to pursue Elfman romantically and retaliated against him
after he spurned her advances.” (RJN, Ex. 2 at p. 3) However, Plaintiff’s
Complaint illustrates her relationship with Defendant Elfman as her being
“groomed, coerced, and manipulated.” (Compl., ¶ 35.) The nature of Plaintiff
and Defendant Elman’s relationship—whether it was consensual or the product of
coercion—remains a disputed issue of fact. Moreover, the nature of their
relationship is relevant to assessing whether Elfman’s statements to Rolling
Stone were knowingly false and made with actual malice or were made up by
Plaintiff with the intent to retaliate and exhort money from Defendant Elfman,
as alluded to by Elfman in the Rolling Stone article. Matters essential
to a cause of action should not be stricken and it is error to do so. (See Clements
v. T.R. Bechtel Co. (1954) 43 Cal.2d. 227, 242.) “ ‘Where a motion to
strike is so broad as to include relevant matters, the motion should be denied
in its entirety.’ ”  (Triodyne, Inc.
v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 536, 542
[internal citation omitted].) 
 
Accordingly, the court denies
the motion to strike Plaintiff’s Complaint as Plaintiff’s characterization of
her relationship with Defendant Elfman and his alleged sexual misconduct toward
her are relevant to proving Plaintiff’s defamation claim. However, the court
agrees that Paragraph 61, lines 20-22 alleging that Defendant Elfman made an
antisemitic comment, is irrelevant and entirely superfluous to Plaintiff’s
defamation claim. Therefore, the court grants the request to strike lines 20 to
22 from Paragraph 61 of the Complaint. Defendant Elman’s motion to strike is
otherwise denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Elfman’s motion to
strike the Complaint is granted as to lines 20 to 22 of Paragraph 61 without
leave to amend and is otherwise denied.
