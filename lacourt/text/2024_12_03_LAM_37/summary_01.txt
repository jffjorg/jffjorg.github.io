Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge has granted Defendant Elfman's motion to strike the Complaint as to lines 20-22 of Paragraph 61 without leave to amend, but has denied the motion otherwise. The Judge has also denied Defendant Elfman's request for judicial notice of Exhibit 1, but has granted the request for judicial notice of Exhibit 2. The Judge has found that the allegations in Paragraph 61, lines 20-22, are irrelevant and superfluous to Plaintiff's defamation claim and have therefore struck them from the Complaint.
