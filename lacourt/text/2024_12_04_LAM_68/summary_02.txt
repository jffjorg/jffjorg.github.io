And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion filed by Alfredo Garcia, the plaintiff, for the reassignment of the collection assignment from Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC to himself. The motion is based on the suspension of Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC by the California Secretary of State due to nonpayment of taxes to the California State Franchise Tax Board. The court found that there is no evidence of a noticed assignment of the judgment and ability to undertake collection efforts. The plaintiff cited Civil Code section 954 and 954.5, but the court concluded that these sections do not provide a basis for relief. The court requires more evidence and thorough address of applicable authority before granting relief. The motion is denied without prejudice, and the judgment creditor is ordered to give notice to all parties.
