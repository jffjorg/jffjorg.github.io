And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to vacate the default judgment without prejudice. The motion was filed by Gredale LLC, which claimed that it was unable to afford an attorney and that the default judgment was the result of extrinsic mistake. The judge found that the motion was not timely filed, as it was filed five months and 27 days after the entry of the default judgment, which is beyond the six-month time limit for granting statutory relief. The judge also questioned the veracity of Gredale LLC's financial hardships and inability to pay legal fees, and found that Judgment Debtor (Plaintiff) had not denied notice of the stricken answer and entry of default, nor explained the delay in filing the motion. The judge concluded that the motion was denied without prejudice, meaning that Gredale LLC may refile the motion if it can demonstrate that it has a meritorious case and can articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action.
