And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of Plaintiff Annabella Gutman's Complaint. The motion, filed by Defendant Barrington Pacific, LLC, seeks to strike Plaintiff's references to and demands for injunctive relief and punitive damages.

The Court disagrees with Defendant's argument that Plaintiff failed to adequately plead what specific injunctive relief she seeks. The Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that Defendant's failure to repair and maintain the property has created a nuisance, and therefore denies Defendant's motion to strike the requests for injunctive relief.

However, the Court grants Defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the Complaint. The Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations do not specifically plead Defendant's prior knowledge of the alleged defects, and that Plaintiff's allegations of oppression, fraud, or malice are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

The Court also rules that Plaintiff has failed to meet the burden of showing how the Complaint could be amended to state a cause of action for punitive damages, and therefore denies Plaintiff's request for leave to amend.

The Court orders that the prayer for punitive damages be stricken from the Complaint without leave to amend, but denies Defendant's motion to strike Plaintiff's request for injunctive relief.
