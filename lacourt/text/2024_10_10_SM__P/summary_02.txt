And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a complaint filed by plaintiff Guo against defendant Amazon Web Services (AWS). The complaint alleges that Guo was scammed out of $197,935 by a fake cryptocurrency investment website hosted by AWS. The defendant argues that the complaint is uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible, and that plaintiff has failed to allege a theory of fraud or identify when, with whom, or other details.

The judge agrees with the defendant and sustains the demurrer, but grants the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The judge notes that a complaint must allege ultimate rather than evidentiary facts, and that plaintiff must identify the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written.
