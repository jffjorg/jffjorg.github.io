Beverly Hills Properties v. Sanai,
Case no. 24SMCV03301
Hearing date October 10, 2024
Defendant
Sanai’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
Plaintiff
filed this unlawful detainer following defendant’s failure to pay rent from
11/1/2023 through 7/31/2024 and failure to comply with the resultant 3-day notice.
Defendant moves for judgment on the pleadings.
A
defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings per Code Civ. Proc §438(c)(1)(B)
if either the court has no jurisdiction, or the complaint does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
Defendant
argues plaintiff is not the owner or lessee of the property, so cannot maintain
the action. Plaintiff is not the landlord but is the property management
company. The complaint alleges a management contract between the landlord and plaintiff
authorizing plaintiff to bring suit in its name. The complaint alleges
plaintiff is authorized to bring this suit, which is sufficient. 
Defendant
argues the court is obligated to use CACI 4302, which states plaintiff must own
or lease the property. CACI are general jury instructions intended to be
modified to fit the case and are not binding authority. 
Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §369(a) states “a person with whom, or in whose name a contract
is made for the benefit of another, is a trustee of express trust, within the
meaning of this section.” Plaintiff does not need to be the landlord to bring
this action. Defendant merely needs to have entered into a lease with plaintiff
for the benefit of the landlord, which is the case as the landlord receives the
benefit of defendant’s rent. Plaintiff has standing. DENIED.
