Guo v. Amazon Web Services, Case
no. 24SMCV01056
Hearing date October 10, 2024
Defendant’s
Demurrer to Complaint
Plaintiff
Guo, in pro per, sues defendant Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) for fraud, using a
form complaint, alleging he was scammed out of $197,935 by a fake cryptocurrency
investment website, hosted by AWS, and run by an unnamed third party. Defendant
demurs.
“The
function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter
of law.” Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th
1413, 1420. A complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than
evidentiary facts” Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
550, but plaintiff must set forth the essential facts of the case “with
reasonable precision and with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the]
defendant with the nature, source and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim. Doheny
Park Terrace Homeowners Ass’n., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099. 
Defendant
argues the complaint is uncertain, ambiguous and unintelligible. The totality
of the alleged facts are: “[n]ot known a suspected person who ordered the
website hosting service from Amazon.” Compl. FR-1. Plaintiff fails to allege a
theory of fraud or identify when said fraud occurred, with whom, or any other
details. Plaintiff has not stated the name of the entity he was using to conduct
business. There is no allegation regarding jurisdiction or the date of the
alleged fraud.
Damages
and a vague allegation of fraud alone are not sufficient to survive demurrer.
Plaintiff must identify the theory of fraud and allege specific facts to
satisfy each element. As plaintiff is suing a corporate entity, the complaint
must identify “the names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent
representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said
or wrote, and when it was said or written.” Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto
Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.
In
opposition plaintiff alleges the perpetrator of the alleged fraud was Lena/Shi
Yang, who is not named in the complaint. Defendant argues plaintiff should not
be given leave to amend. As this is a demurrer to an initial complaint, the
court will SUSTAIN with 20 days leave to amend.
