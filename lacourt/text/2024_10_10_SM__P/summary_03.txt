And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant argued that the plaintiff, Beverly Hills Properties, does not have standing to bring the unlawful detainer action because it is not the owner or lessee of the property. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff is only a property management company and therefore cannot maintain the action. The Judge found that the complaint alleges a management contract between the landlord and the plaintiff, authorizing the plaintiff to bring suit in its name. The Judge also rejected the defendant's argument that the court is obligated to use CACI 4302, which states that plaintiff must own or lease the property. The Judge noted that CACI instructions are not binding authority and that Cal. Code Civ. Proc. ยง369(a) states that a person with whom a contract is made for the benefit of another is a trustee of express trust. The Judge concluded that the plaintiff has standing to bring the action and denied the defendant's motion.
