  Case Number:  23TRCV00192    Hearing Date:   April 4, 2024    Dept:  P Moving Party: Defendant Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama LLC aka HMMAResponding Party: Plaintiff Jae S. KimMOTION FOR TRIAL SETTINGThe court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers.RULINGThe MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT is GRANTED. The default entered on December 18, 2023, against defendant Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama LLC aka HMMA is hereby set aside. The defendant’s proposed answer is deemed filed and served on April 4, 2024.BACKGROUNDOn 1/20/2023, plaintiff Jae S. Kim (“Plaintiff”) filed this action.On 1/24/2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC” ") against Defendants South Bay Hyundai LLC aka Hyundai Dealer, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama LLC aka HMMA (“HMMA”), Hyundai Motor Company (“HMC”) and Does 1 through 50, inclusive, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of oral contract, (2) breach of written warranty contract, (3) conversion, (4) negligence, (5) negligent misrepresentation, and (6) unfair competition.The FAC alleges (among other things) that Plaintiff leased and later purchased a 2018 Hyundai Genesis G8, the vehicle subsequently experienced problems, and the defendants not only failed to repair the vehicle successfully despite the applicable warranties, but they also misrepresented and refused to disclose the vehicle’s condition. (FAC, ¶¶ 9-17.)On 10/3/2023, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Service of Summons, indicating that he served HMMA via substituted service.On 12/14/2023, Plaintiff filed another Proof of Service of Summons, indicating that he served HMMA via substituted service. The Court has compared that proof of service with the one filed on 10/3/2023 and notes that they are identical.On 12/18/2023, default was entered against HMMA.On 2/16/2024, HMMA filed the instant motion to set aside the default pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 473.5 (“Section 473.5”) and 473, subdivision b (“Section 473(b)”), arguing that (1) the service of summons was deficient and did not result in actual notice to HMMA, and (2) alternatively, the default was entered as a result of HMMA’s mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. To the extent statutory relief is not applicable, HMMA also moves to set aside the default based on equitable relief on the ground of extrinsic mistake.On 3/18/2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition to the motion.On 3/27/2024, HMMA filed its reply.LEGAL STANDARD“It is … well established that it is the policy of the law to bring about a trial on the merits whenever possible, so that any doubts which may exist should be resolved in favor of the application, to the end of securing to a litigant his day in court and a trial upon the merits.” (Frank E. Beckett Co. v. Bobbitt (1960) 180 Cal.App.2d Supp. 921, 928.)Section 473(b) provides for two distinct types of relief—commonly differentiated as “discretionary” and “mandatory”—from certain prior actions or proceedings in the trial court. (Luri v. Greenwald (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1119, 1124.) “Under the discretionary relief provision, on a showing of ‘mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect,’ the court has discretion to allow relief from a ‘judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against’ aparty or his or her attorney. Under the mandatory relief provision, on the other hand, upon a showing by attorney declaration of ‘mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,’ the court shall vacate any ‘resulting default judgment or dismissal entered.’” (Ibid., internal citations and quotation marks omitted.)An application for relief under Section 473(b) must be made no more than six months after entry of the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) In addition, the application “shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed herein, otherwise the application shall not be granted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)According to Section 473.5, “[w]hen service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or default judgment has been entered against him or her in the action, he or she may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)Relief under Section 473.5 must be brought “the earlier of:¿(i) two years after entry of a default judgment against him or her;¿or (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has been entered.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)Finally, “’a trial court may ... vacate a default on equitable grounds even if statutory relief is unavailable.’ [Citation.]” (Sakaguchi v. Sakaguchi (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 852, 862.) “The moving party carries the burden of proving that he or she is entitled to equitable relief.” (Ibid.)Equitable relief may be based on “extrinsic fraud” or “extrinsic mistake.” Extrinsic fraud occurs when “the unsuccessful party has been prevented from exhibiting fully his case, by fraud or deception practiced on him by his opponent, … or where the defendant never had knowledge of the suit, being kept in ignorance by the acts of the plaintiff.” (Luxury Asset Lending, LLC v. Philadelphia Television Network, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 894, 911, internal quotation marks removed (“Luxury Asset”).) On the other hand, extrinsic mistake involves the excusable neglect of a party. (Ibid.)“‘To set aside a judgment based on extrinsic fraud or extrinsic mistake, the moving party must satisfy three elements: ‘“First, … demonstrate that it has a meritorious case. Secondly, … articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action. Lastly, … demonstrate diligence in seeking to set aside the default once it had been discovered.” [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Luxury Asset, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at p. 911.)REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICENo requests for judicial notice were filed.EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONSNo evidentiary objections were filed.DISCUSSIONAs an initial matter, the Court finds the instant motion timely under Section 473(b) because it is brought within six (6) months of the entry of default, and Section 473.5 because it is brought within 180 days from the entry of default.“A summons may be served on a corporation by delivering a copy of the summons and the complaint by any of the following methods:(a) To the person designated as agent for service of process as provided by any provision in Section 202, 1502, 2105, or 2107 of the Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303, inclusive, or Sections 6500 to 6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in effect on December 31, 1976, with respect to corporations to which they remain applicable).(b) To the president, chief executive officer, or other head of the corporation, a vice president, a secretary or assistant secretary, a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a controller or chief financial officer, a general manager, or a person authorized by the corporation to receive service of process.(c) If the corporation is a bank, to a cashier or assistant cashier or to a person specified in subdivision (a) or (b).(d) If authorized by any provision in Section 1701, 1702, 2110, or 2111 of the Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303, inclusive, or Sections 6500 to 6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in effect on December 31, 1976, with respect to corporations to which they remain applicable), as provided by that provision.(Code Civ. Proc., § 416.10; Corp. Code, §§ 1701 [delivery to an agent or corporate agent], 1702 [service upon secretary of state pursuant to a court order], 2110 [concerning foreign defendants], or 2111 [service upon secretary of state pursuant to a court order if the agent cannot be found].)“It is axiomatic that strict compliance with the code’s provisions for service of process is not required.” (Ramos v. Homeward Residential, Inc. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1434, 1442 (Ramos).) “[S]ubstantial compliance is sufficient.” (Ramos, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 1443.) “In general, substantial compliance with the code occurs when, although not properly identified in a proof of service, the person to be served in fact actually received the summons.” (Ramos, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 1443 [italics in original].)“‘[W]hen the defendant is a corporation, the “person to be served” is one of the individuals specified in section 416.10 [above].’” (Ramos, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 1443.)”’ Therefore, [a plaintiff] could be held to have substantially complied with the statute if, despite his failure to address the mail to one of the persons to be served on behalf of the defendants, the summons was actually received by one of the persons to be served.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)“[M]ere receipt of the summons by an unknown employee of the corporation who is not a person specified in section 416.10 does not necessarily establish substantial compliance.[Citation] Evidence that shows the name of the person who received the summons and complaint as well as the person’s title or capacity is required by statute (§ 417.10) and, without it, a trial court need not infer that a person specified in section 416.10 actually received the summons and complaint.” (Ramos, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 1443 [emphasis added].)Here, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden of showing that he served any of the persons specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 416.10 above or that he substantially complied with the service of process requirements. The proofs of service Plaintiff filed on October 3, 2023, and December 14, 2023, state that Plaintiff served HMMA through substituted service on Friday, September 1, 2023, at 1:15 p.m., at 700 Hyundai Blvd., Montgomery, AL 36105, by leaving the documents with “Carla Mosley, Person in Charge of Office.” (Proofs of Service of Summons, Items. 4, 5b(1).) However, the proofs of service also state that the person served on behalf of the entity was “SMITH, CHRISTOPHER N – Person Authorized to Accept Service of Process.” (Id. at Item 3b.) The person who served the papers was David Clements, who is not a registered California process server. (Id. at Item 7e.) HMMA’s counsel testifies (and Plaintiff has not submitted any evidence disputing) that HMMA’s proper Registered Agent for Service of Process is a company – CT Corporation System – located at 2 North Jackson Street, Suite 605, Montgomery, AL 36104. (Declaration of Elham Hassantash, filed February 16, 2024, ¶ 4; Exhibit B – a copy of the Statement of Information on file with the Alabama Secretary of State; Opposition, p. 4:17-18 [arguing that, without providing evidence or explaining why, Christopher N. Smith was a person authorized to accept service of process on HMMA’s behalf].) Plaintiff has not proven that Christopher N. Smith and Carla Mosley are among the individuals specified in section 416.10, or that any individuals specified in that statute actually received the summons.Therefore, the Court finds that HMMA is entitled to relief from default under Section 473.5. In light of that ruling, the Court does not need to discuss the other arguments raised in the parties’ papers regarding Section 473(b) and equitable relief.Accordingly, the motion to set aside the default entered on December 18, 2023, against HMMA is granted. That default is hereby set aside. HMMA’s proposed answer is deemed filed and served on April 4, 2024.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
