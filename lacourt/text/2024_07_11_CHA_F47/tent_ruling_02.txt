37 and 38.  Additionally,

RULING:  The
motion is granted, in part, and denied, in part, as set forth below.    
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a motor vehicle accident that
occurred on 5/24/22 between Plaintiff Edward Sandstrom (Plaintiff) and Defendant
William Peterson (Peterson), an employee of Defendant East Valley Towing, Inc.
(East Valley), while Peterson was driving East Valley’s tow truck.  Plaintiff claims to have suffered extensive
injuries as a result of the accident.  In
this action, among other things, Plaintiff has included a claim for loss of
income and loss of future earning capacity.
 
On 7/14/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Peterson
and East Valley alleging causes of action for: (1) Negligence against all
defendants, (2) Negligent Entrustment against East Valley and Does 1-50 and (3)
Negligent Hiring, Supervision, or Retention against East Valley and Does 1-50.
 
On 8/2/23, Plaintiff served East Valley with Requests for
Production, Set 1.  (Chichyan Decl. ¶3,
Ex.A).  After granting several extensions
of time to respond, East Valley served responses to the requests on
11/17/23.  (Id. ¶5, Ex.B).  Plaintiff found East Valley’s responses to
certain of the requests to be deficient. 
Id.  During the meet and
confer process, Plaintiff’s counsel extended the deadline for East Valley to
provide further responses to 1/10/24 and the deadline to file a motion to
compel further responses was extended to 2/9/24.  (Id. ¶¶6-7, Ex.C, D; Herme Decl.
¶6).  East Valley failed to serve further
responses by the 1/10/24 deadline due to a calendaring mistake.  (Herme Decl. ¶6).  As a result, on 1/16/24, Plaintiff filed (served
on 1/15/24) the instant motion seeking an order compelling  East Valley to provide further responses to
Plaintiff’s Request for Production, Set 1, Nos. 7, 12, 13, 17, 21, 22, 23, 31,
32, 33, 34, 37 and 38.  (Id.
¶¶6-7, Ex.C-D).  Additionally, Plaintiff
requests sanctions against East Valley and its counsel, Wood Smith Henning
& Berman LLP, in the amount of $2,161.65. 
East Valley has opposed the motion and Plaintiff has filed a reply to
the opposition.    
 
ANALYSIS
 
The opposition indicates that on 1/22/24, East Valley
served further responses to all of the requests at issue except number 33.  (See Herme Decl. ¶7, Ex.D; Reply,
generally).  The opposition also
indicates that after the service of the further responses, Plaintiff sent a
meet and confer letter regarding claimed deficiencies in the responses/further
responses to requests 23, 33 and 38. 
(Herme Decl. ¶8, Ex.E). 
Therefore, East Valley believed that the responses to those three
requests were the only responses which remained at issue.  (Herme Decl. ¶9).  The reply does not dispute that East Valley
served further responses to all but one of the requests (no.33) at issue in the
motion.  However, the reply indicates
that Plaintiff is still dissatisfied with the responses/further responses to
the all of the requests at issue in the motion, specifically, requests: 7, 12,
13, 17, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33, 34, 37, and 38. 
(See Reply, p.2:22-28, p.6:4-6). 
Plaintiff seems to believe that because the further responses were
served after the motion was filed, Plaintiff need not establish the
deficiencies in the further responses.  (See
Reply, p.2:22-28).  The Court does not
agree with Plaintiff’s position.    
 
CCP 2031.310(c) provides: 
 
“Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to the demand.”  (emphasis added)
 
CRC 3.1345(c) provides, in relevant part: 
 
“A separate statement is a separate
document filed and served with the discovery motion that provides all the
information necessary to understand each discovery request and all the
responses to it that are at issue. The separate statement must be full and
complete so that no person is required to review any other document in order to
determine the full request and the full response. Material must not be
incorporated into the separate statement by reference. The separate statement
must include--for each discovery request (e.g., each interrogatory, request for
admission, deposition question, or inspection demand) to which a further
response, answer, or production is requested--the following:
 
(1) The text of the request,
interrogatory, question, or inspection demand;
 
(2) The text of each response,
answer, or objection, and any further responses or answers. . .”
(emphasis added)
 
As such, once East Valley served further responses to
most of the requests at issue, Plaintiff was required to file a new motion
addressing the deficiencies in those responses, after making a good faith
effort to informally resolve the remaining discovery issues.  Plaintiff also fails to explain how East
Valley could know that Plaintiff was still dissatisfied with the responses to any
of the requests at issue other than requests 23, 33 and 38 as those are the
only requests addressed in Plaintiff’s meet and confer letter served after the
further responses were served.  (See
Opposition, Ex.E).  
 
In the reply, Plaintiff argues that he is entitled to
further responses because the information could support a claim for punitive
damages against East Valley.  However, the
complaint does not include a claim for punitive damages nor did Plaintiff
indicate in its meet and confer efforts or the moving papers that he was
seeking information to support such a claim. 
As such, East Valley did not have an opportunity to respond to this
argument.  
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff
has failed to establish why the further responses to Requests 7, 12, 13, 17,
21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 34, 37 and 38 provided by East Valley after the motion was
filed are deficient.  See CCP
2031.310(c); CRC 3.1345(c)(2).  
 
The Court further finds that sanctions are not
warranted.  Pursuant to the parties meet
and confer efforts, Plaintiff had until 2/9/24 to file a motion to compel
further responses.  (Chichyan Decl. ¶7,
Ex.D).  Plaintiff’s counsel gives no
indication that he contacted East Valley’s counsel after further responses were
not received by the 1/10/24 agreed upon deadline and filing the instant motion 3
court days later on 1/16/24, three and a half weeks before the agreed upon deadline
to do so.  
 
The Court finds that a further response to Request 33, to
which East Valley provided no further response, is warranted.  (See Herme Decl., Ex.D).  East Valley’s first objection to the phrase
“contractual or legal agreements” being vague, ambiguous, overly broad and
undefined does not even apply as that phrase is not contained in request 33.  East Valley has also failed to justify any of
the other objections asserted in response to this request.  Further, if any documents are being withheld
on the basis of privilege, a privilege log must be provided.  CCP 2031.240(c).
 
CONCLUSION 
  
 
The motion is granted as to Request 33.  A further response is due within 20
days.  The motion is denied as to
Requests 7, 12, 13, 17, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 34, 37 and 38.  Sanctions are denied.  
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff failed to electronically
bookmark the exhibits attached to the motion as required by CRC
3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel for the parties
are warned that failure to comply with this rule in the future may result in
matters being continued so that papers can be resubmitted in compliance, papers
not being considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
