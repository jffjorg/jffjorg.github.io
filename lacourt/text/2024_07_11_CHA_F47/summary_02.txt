Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Edward Sandstrom, against the defendant, East Valley Towing, Inc. The plaintiff is seeking further responses to certain requests that were served by East Valley on November 17, 2023. The judge has granted the motion in part and denied it in part.

The judge has ordered East Valley to provide a further response to request 33, which was not responded to by East Valley. The judge has denied the motion as to the other requests that were served by East Valley.

The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against East Valley and its counsel. The judge has noted that the plaintiff failed to establish why the further responses provided by East Valley are deficient and that the plaintiff did not make a good faith effort to informally resolve the remaining discovery issues.

The judge has also warned counsel for the parties that failure to comply with the rule requiring electronic bookmarking of exhibits may result in matters being continued or papers not being considered.
