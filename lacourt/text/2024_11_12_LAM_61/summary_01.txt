And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication of its first cause of action for partition. The plaintiff had argued that there was no dispute about the ownership shares in the real property at issue and that partition by sale would reduce prejudice to the parties and the property. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that summary adjudication cannot be granted on the partition claim because the plaintiff did not seek an interlocutory judgment of partition in the initial motion. The judge agreed with the defendant, finding that the evidence and grounds proffered by the plaintiff would only justify an interlocutory partition under Code of Civil Procedure § 872.720, not full adjudication of the first cause of action. The judge also set a trial date for April 8, 2025, and a final status conference for April 1, 2025.
