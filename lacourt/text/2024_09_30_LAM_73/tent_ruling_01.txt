PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO SET ASIDE THIS
COURT’S MAY 15, 2024 RULING TO DISMISS DOE DEFENDANTS (filed 05/23/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion.  The
Court amends its May 15, 2024 order dismissing all Doe Defendants to reinstate
Doe Defendants 1-50.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff Patricia Klein filed
this action against Defendant Lassens Natural Foods & Vitamins, LLC and
Does 1-50.
 
The Complaint alleges causes of action for:  
1.     
General Negligence
2.     
Premises Liability 
 
The Complaint alleges that on or about January
13, 2022, Plaintiff tripped and fell as a result of a dangerous condition on
Defendant’s property, that was created by Defendants, causing injuries and
damages in an amount to be proven at the time of trial.
 
On
May 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Set Aside, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff
moves for an order granting relief from this Court’s order dated May 15, 2024
order dismissing all Doe defendants. This request is made based upon Code of
Civil Procedure § 473(b), as the agreement to dismiss the Doe defendants was
due to inadvertence, mistake or excusable neglect of counsel for Plaintiff.
 
Defendant did not file an opposition. Plaintiff did not file a
reply.
 
II.
DISCUSSION 
 
Plaintiff moves for an order granting
relief from this Court’s order dated May 15, 2024 order dismissing all Doe
defendants.
 
A party may apply for an order
granting relief under § 473(b) “upon any such term as may be just…from a
judgment, dismissal, order or other proceeding taken against him or her through
his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect.”
 
On May 15, 2024, the Court held a Case
Management Conference in this matter. Plaintiff’s counsel, Sepideh Hersel,
submitted a declaration stating that she appeared for the hearing via
telephonic appearance. (Hersel Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s counsel states she was
asked by the Court whether all Defendants had been served, and whether the
Court could dismiss all Doe defendants. (Ibid.) Plaintiff’s counsel
agreed to dismiss all Doe defendants. (Ibid.) However, she states that
upon reflection, she had made a mistake to dismiss Doe defendants prematurely
as discovery is still underway and in the event that discovery reveals a liable
party, Plaintiff could be prejudiced if she is unable to add parties to the
case as a Doe defendant. (Hersel Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
The Court finds that amendment of the May
15, 2024 order is warranted. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 576,
“[a]ny judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the
furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the
amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order.” Additionally, “[t]he
court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow
a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name
of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake
in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or
demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the
adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 473,
subd. (a)(1).) In Santa Catalina, the court dismissed doe
defendants pursuant to a pretrial conference order. (Santa Catalina Island
Co. v. Superior Court, (1967) 248 Cal. App. 2d 729, 730-731.) Thereafter,
Plaintiffs and the named defendants obtained an order amending the pretrial
conference order to dismiss all doe defendants except Does 1 and 2. (Id.)
Petitioner, served as a doe defendant, moved to quash service for lack of
jurisdiction. (Id.) The motion was denied. (Id.) The Court of
Appeal held that Code of Civil Procedure section 576 authorized the trial court
to amend the original pretrial conference order dismissing all doe defendants
with the order reinstating does 1 and 2. (Id. at 731.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel filed this
motion on May 23, 2024, only eight days after the May 15, 2024 hearing.
Thus, Plaintiff pursued this motion with diligence. In addition, Plaintiff submitted
a declaration by her counsel indicating the dismissal was a mistake. The
Court finds that permitting amendment of the May 15, 2024 order to allow the
reinstatement of Doe Defendants 1-50 would be in the furtherance of justice.
 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion.  The
Court amends its May 15, 2024 order dismissing all Doe Defendants to reinstate
Doe Defendants 1-50. 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 

The Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion.  The Court amends its
May 15, 2024 order dismissing all Doe Defendants to reinstate Doe Defendants
1-50.
