And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants PennyMac Loan Services, LLC's Motion for Leave to Intervene to Expunge Lis Pendens. The lis pendens was recorded against the real property in December 2021, and PennyMac has an interest in the property. The Court finds that the Plaintiff failed to carry their burden of proof at trial, and therefore, the lis pendens can be expunged. The Court also grants PennyMac's request for judicial notice of various documents, including deeds of trust and assignments.

As for attorney's fees and costs, the Court is tentatively inclined to grant reasonable fees and costs to PennyMac, as there is no opposition to the motion and the Court finds no substantial justification for the Plaintiff's failure to release the lis pendens.
