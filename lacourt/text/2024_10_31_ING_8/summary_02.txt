And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration filed by 12 0 27 Protective Services, Inc. (Protective Services) against Superior Grocers (SCC). Protective Services seeks to compel arbitration of the cross-complaint filed by SCC, which alleges causes of action for equitable indemnity, express indemnity, breach of contract, contribution, and declaratory relief. The court finds that the arbitration clause in the security guard services contract between Protective Services and SCC is enforceable, but stays the arbitration pending the outcome of the underlying civil action.

The court notes that the parties may have conflicting interests in the outcome of the arbitration, and that the arbitration may not be necessary if the underlying civil action resolves the liability issues between the parties. The court also notes that SCC may have waived its right to arbitrate by failing to object to the arbitration clause in the security guard services contract.

Based on these factors, the court finds that it is in the interest of judicial efficiency and the parties' interests to stay the arbitration pending the outcome of the underlying civil action. The motion to compel arbitration is therefore denied without prejudice pending the outcome of the underlying civil action.
