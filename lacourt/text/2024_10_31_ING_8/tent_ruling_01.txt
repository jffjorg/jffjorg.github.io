I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
This case originates from a Complaint filed by
Plaintiff, Jiali Yan (“Plaintiff”) against Defendants, Michael Antony Forbes
dba Forbes Estates, LLC, and DOES 1 through 10. The Complaint alleges a cause
of action for: (1) Fraud.
 
A non-jury trial took place in this case between March
15, 2023 and March 17, 2023. A Statement of Decision was filed on April 18,
2023. The Court found that Mr. Forbes has not proved his breach of contract
claim, did not carry his burden to prove that he made a demand for payment of
any specific amount nor that Ms. Yan refused to pay. Further, as to the Fraud
claims, the Court found that Mr. Forbes did not prove that Ms. Yan acted in bad
faith or breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, but did
prove that Ms. Yan did not advertise or agree to sell the property. Lastly, the
Court held that neither party proved that the other committed any species of
fraud. 
 
On February 27, 2024, this court previously heard Movant,
PennyMac Loan Services, LLC’s (“PennyMac”) previously filed Motion to Expunge Lis
Pendens. This court DENIED the motion without prejudice on the grounds that
there was no proposed complaint-in-intervention or answer-in-intervention
submitted with the motion. 
 
Now, PennyMac files a Motion for Leave to Intervene to
Expunge Lis Pendens.
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On September 30, 2024, PennyMac filed its
Motion to Intervene to Expunch Lis Pendens. To date, no opposition brief has
been filed.

III. ANALYSIS¿¿ 
 
A.    Motion for Leave to Intervene to Expunge Lis Pendens 
 
Previously, in this Court’s February 27, 2024 minute order, it
noted that despite the Court finding that the notice of pendency of action was
recorded against the real property located at 4848 Blue Rose
Street, North Las Vegas, Nevada 89081, Assessor’s Parcel No. 124- 35-811-039,
on December 7, 2021, and despite finding that PennyMac has an interest in the
property at issue, PennyMac’s previous motion did not comply with Code of Civil
Procedure section 387, subdivision (c). Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 387, subdivision (c), “[a] nonparty shall petition the court for leave
to intervene by noticed motion or ex parte application. The petition shall
include a copy of the proposed complaint in intervention or answer in
intervention and set forth the grounds upon which intervention rests. “ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 387, subd. (c).) 
 
            The Court observes that in
PennyMac’s current motion, it has again set forth the grounds upon which
intervention rests pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 387,
subdivision (d)(1)(B), 405.30, and 405.32 as it claims that it has an interest
in the property, Plaintiff’s Lis Pendens is clouding title, and that there is
no action pending because the Court found that Plaintiff failed to carry their
burden of proof at trial. First, the Court holds that Plaintiff has
demonstrated that the lis pendens can be expunged because there is no action
pending as the court issued a Statement of Decision on April 18, 2023. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 405.30.) Moreover, this Court also finds that per the statement
of decision, Plaintiff failed to carry their burden of proof at trial, and
thus, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 405.32, this Court “shall
order that the notice be expunged [because it found] that the [Plaintiff]
failed to establish[] by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity
of the real property claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.32.) 
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 387, subdivision (d)(1)(B), “[t]he court
shall, upon timely application, permit a nonparty to intervene in the action or
proceeding if…(B) The person seeking intervention claims an interest relating
to the property…that is the subject of the action and that person is so
situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede that person’s
ability to protect that interest, unless that person’s interest is adequately
represented by one or more of the existing parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 387,
subd. (d)(1)(B).) Here, PennyMac has provided evidence that it has an interest
in the property at issue by submitting its own records that it became the
beneficiary of the Deed of Trust through assignments recorded in the Official
Records of the Recorder of Clark County, Nevada. (Declaration of Martha Aguayo
(“Aguayo Decl.”), ¶ 8, Exhibit 2, 3.) Further, PennyMac has evidenced that
Plaintiff’s lis pendens is clouding title. 
 
            Furthermore, the Court notes that
unlike with PennyMac’s previous motion, its current motion attaches, as Exhibit
2, a proposed complaint in intervention as required by Code of Civil Procedure
section 387, subdivision (c). (Motion, Exhibit 2.) As such, because PennyMac’s
moving papers comply with Code of Civil procedure section 387, et seq.,
the Court GRANTS PennyMac’s motion. 
 
B.    Attorney’s
Fees
 
PennyMac
moves under Code of Civil Procedure section 405.38 for reasonable attorney’s
fees. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 405.38, the court must
award the prevailing party “reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of making or
opposing the motion” unless the losing “party acted with substantial
justification or other circumstances make the imposition of attorney’s fees and
costs unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.38.) PennyMac asserts that more than four months
have passed since the Court ruled against Plaintiff after trial with respect to
Plaintiff’s claims and that Plaintiff’ failure to release the lis pendens is
without justification. This Court agrees. As there is no opposition brief, and
the court finds no substantial justification which would make the imposition of
attorney’s fees and costs unjust, the court is tentatively inclined to grant
reasonable attorney’s fees once they are provided by PennyMac on a notice motion.

 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
For
the foregoing reasons, PennyMac’s Motion for Leave to Intervene to Expunge Lis
Pendens is GRANTED. 
 
            PennyMac is ordered to provide
notice.
