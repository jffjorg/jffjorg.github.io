I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On August 7, 2023, Plaintiff, Katelyn Dow Stepanyan
(“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant, General Motors, LLC and DOES
1 through 20 (“GM”). On February 21, 2024, this Court SUSTAINED the previous
demurrer as to the original complaint and also ruled that the motion to strike
portions of the original complaint was mooted by the sustaining of the
demurrer. On March 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
alleging causes of action for: (1) Fraud – Concealment; (2) Business &
Professions Code § 17200; (3) Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty;
(4) Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act – breach of Implied Warranty; and (5)
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act – Civil Code § 1793.2(b). On April 22, 2024,
Defendant GM filed another demurrer and motion to strike the FAC. On August 9,
2024, this Court SUSTAINED, with leave to amend the demurrer. 
 
Per the moving papers, 0n February 8, 2024, Plaintiff
served Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One on Defendant, GM. On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff asserts that
GM served deficient and unverified responses. As such, on March 29, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel sent Defense counsel a detailed meet and confer letter
discussing Defendant’s responses and failure to produce a single document. In
the letter, Plaintiff’s counsel notes that he requested a response within seven
(7) days. 
 
On April 10, 2024, per the moving papers GM made their
first and only production of documents, which per Plaintiff was incomplete and
therefore inadequate to respond to Plaintiff’s propounded discovery.
Thereafter, Plaintiff’s counsel sent another meet and confer letter on May 15,
2024, discussing Defendant’s inadequate responses and failure to produce
documents. Plaintiff’s counsel again requested a response within seven (7)
days, and also signed Defendant’s stipulation and protective order. However,
Plaintiff’s counsel notes that Defense counsel never responded to the second
meet and confer letter. Thus, Plaintiff has brought these two Motions to Compel
GM’s further responses to both Special Interrogatories, Set One and Requests
for Production of Documents, Set One. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed its
Motions to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One and
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. On August 22, 2024, GM filed
opposition briefs to both. On August 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply briefs
to both oppositions. 
 
On September 5, 2024, when this case was
originally heard, this Court ordered further responses to Special
Interrogatories Nos. 14, 20, 23, 25, 26, 39, 41, and 43. This Court further
continued the motions ordering Plaintiff to provide code-compliant separate
statements by October 24, 2024. 
 
On October 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
amended separate statement of the items in dispute as to the Motion to Compel
Defendant’s Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One.

 
¿II. ANALYSIS¿ 
¿ 
A.   
Legal
Standard 
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting
party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also waives the right to make any
objections, including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories other than the cut-off on hearing discovery
motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a); Code
Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a
motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 41
“Unless otherwise limited by order
of the court in accordance with this title, any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in
that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) For discovery purposes, information is regarded as
relevant “if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case,
preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement thereof.” (City of Los
Angeles v. Superior Court (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 272, 288.)  
A motion to compel further
responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be
brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate,
evasive, or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or
overly generalized objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) A
motion to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court defined “good cause” as a showing
that there “a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and the
discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to
other evidence that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.” If the
moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden
is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.) ¿ 
"The court shall limit the
scope of discovery if it determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness
of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought
will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." (Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. § 2017.020(a).) Generally, objections on the ground of burden require the
objecting party to produce evidence of (a) the propounding party's subjective
intent to create burden or (b) the amount of time and effort it would take to
respond. (See West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Superior Court In
and For Los Angeles County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) However, no such
evidence is necessary where discovery is obviously overbroad on its face. (See Obregon
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)
B.    Discussion 
 
As this Court previously provided a ruling as to the Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, it only discusses the
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One below. 
 
Requests
for Production of Documents
 
            In Plaintiff’s amended notice of
Motion to Compel Defendant’s Further Responses to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One, Plaintiff states that she now has limited the remaining motion
to compel RFP Nos. 16 and 38-41. The Court rules on each as follows: 
 
RFP
No. 16: GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  Plaintiff’s request continues to seek not only
TSBs issued, or in the process of being issued for 2017 through 2022 model year
Chevrolet Bolt vehicles, but also ay document that refers or relates to or
concerns the TSBs. The Court finds that Technical
Service Bulletins and/or Recall Notices for vehicles purchased in California
for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle, whether mentioned in
the repair history of the subject vehicle or not are discoverable but not, at this
stage of discovery, any documents that refers or relates to an issued TSB such
as any internal email between GM employees that mentions any TSB.  However, Plaintiff’s RFP No. 16 is not
narrowly tailored as to time as the Court had previously indicated to the
parties. GM has offered to produce a list of TSBs and ISBs applicable for model
year 2020 Chevy Bolt vehicles.  The Court
so orders.  The Court also orders GM to
produce the list of TSBs for Chevy Volts that were issued in calendar years 2019
and 2020, which bears on the knowledge of GM as to technical issues experienced
in the two years prior to the alleged January 2021 sale or lease of the subject
Chevy Volt.  The Court rejects GM’s attempt
to limit produce to a “reasonable number of TSBs and ISBs.  The Court further orders GM to produce the
TSBs and ISBs themselves issued in calendar years 2019 and 2020 that discuss or
mention the battery, charging system, and/or fires in Chevy Volt vehicles, as
well all TSBs themselves applicable to a model year 2020 Chevy Volt that
discuss or mention the battery, charging system, and/or fires in Chevy Volt
vehicles.  These documents shall be
produced with a verified further written response on or before November 30,
2024.
 
RFP Nos. 38-40: GRANTED; RFP No. 41: DENIED. Each of
these requests seek all documents evidencing, relating, or referring to
complaints by owners and lessees of 2017 through 2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt
vehicles regarding the vehicles’ battery (RFP No. 38), vehicle fires (RFP No.
39), vehicles’ charging system (RFP No. 40), and loss of power (RFP No. 41). GM
has declined to produce any documents. 
The Court disagrees and will order GM to produce a list, chart, or spreadsheet
of customer complaints received by GM during calendar years 2019 and 2020, in
a sortable Excel spreadsheet that lists a compilation or summary of the customer
complaint documents.  The spreadsheet shall
contain the repair date, the VIN last 6 of the other customers’ vehicle, the
servicing dealer by name, location and/or dealer code, a description of the
customer’s complaint as listed in the warranty claim submission, the determined
cause if any of that complaint or whether no problem or cause was found, and
the correction, repair, or replacement performed if any.  The search terms for key words to be used in
a program for GM to run on its digitally stored records in GM’s customer care
center records and in its warranty reimbursement system records shall be “battery,”
“charging,” and “fire”.  The Court will
NOT order GM to identify the other customers by name, address, telephone number
or any other PII.  Any such compilation
will be subject to the signed Discovery Protective Order in this case, and the
custodian or other person who generates the compilation will need to be
identified if the parties cannot stipulate to the use and admissibility of the
chart.
 
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
For
the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for
Production of Documents is GRANTED in pat and DENIED in part. 
 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice.
