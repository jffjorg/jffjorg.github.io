  ORDER RE:  
 
MOTION OF
  PREVAILING DEFENDANT SEVAK AVAKIAN FOR AWARD OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY’S FEES IN
  THE AMOUNT OF $68,015.45
 




 
Background 
Plaintiff Albert Kirakosian (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on
December 11, 2013 against Defendants American Best Engineering, Inc. aka Avakian
Engineering, Inc., Sergik Avakian, and Sevak Avakian. 
On September 6, 2017, Plaintiff filed the operative Third Amended
Complaint (“TAC”) alleging causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2)
fraud, (3) conversion, (4) money due on an open book account, (5) money due on
an account stated, and (6) money had and received. 
On August 24, 2023, a Judgment was entered in this matter. The
Judgment indicates, inter alia, that the case was tried on February 15,
2023, and that Judgment is for defendants Avakian Engineering, Inc. and Sevak
Avakian. The Judgment indicates that Plaintiff is to receive nothing from
Avakian Engineering, Inc. and Sevak Avakian. (See Judgment, ¶ 6(b).) In
addition, the Judgment provides that “Defendants were the prevailing
party…Defendants may seek costs and attorney’s fees and, if awarded, file an
amended judgment.” (Judgment, ¶ 7.) 
Sevak Avakian moves for an order awarding him and against Plaintiff
attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $68,015.45. The motion is unopposed.

On May 24, 2024, the Court issued an Order continuing the hearing on
the instant motion to June 25, 2024. In the May 24, 2024 Order, the Court
noted, inter alia, that a copy of the invoices referenced in Sevak
Avakian’s counsel’s declaration did not appear to have be provided. (See
May 24, 2024 Order at p. 5:12-17.)  
The Court’s May 24, 2024 Order provides, inter alia, that “Mr.
Zreik will file and serve a supplemental declaration by May 31, 2024, and any
response thereto must be filed and served by June 7, 2024, with courtesy copies
of each delivered to Dept. 50. The evidence in the supplemental declaration is limited to the requested
additional information, as discussed above, and the response thereto is
limited to addressing the supplemental declaration.” (May 24, 2024 Order at pp.
5:24-6:5.) 
On May 28, 2024, a “Supplemental Declaration of Sammy Zreik in Support
of Prevailing Defendant Sevak Avakian’s Motion for an Award of Attorney’s Fees
in the Amount of $68,015.45” was filed. No response to the supplemental
declaration was filed. 
Discussion
A.    Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees
As discussed
in further detail in the Court’s May 24, 2024 Order on the instant motion, the
Court finds that Sevak Avakian
has demonstrated his entitlement to attorney’s fees here. 
B.   
The Hourly Rate of
Counsel and the Reasonableness of the Requested Fees
“[T]he fee
setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.
The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors
specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the
legal services provided.” ((PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 [internal citations omitted].) In determining
the reasonable hourly rate, the “burden is on the successful party to prove the
appropriate market rate to be used in calculating the lodestar.” ((MBNA America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006) 147 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 13.)
“[T]he
court’s discretion in awarding attorney fees is…to be exercised so as to fully
compensate counsel for the prevailing party for services reasonably provided to
his or her client.” ((Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State
University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 395.) With regard to the number of hours
reasonably expended, “the verified time statements of the attorneys, as
officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear
indication the records are erroneous.” ((Id. at p. 396.) The trial court may
reduce the award where the fee request appears unreasonably inflated, such as
where the attorneys’ efforts are unorganized or duplicative. ((Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635, fn. 21.) 
In the May 24, 2024 Order, the Court noted that
“Mr. Gilanians’s requested hourly rate and the rates for different staff
members are included in the copies of the bills from Mr. Gilanians. (Sevak
Avakian Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. 2.) Plaintiff does not oppose the instant motion and
does not challenge Mr. Gilanians’s hourly rate. The Court finds that the hourly
billing rate requested for Mr. Gilanians is reasonable.” (May 24, 2024 Order at
pp. 4:25-5:2.) 
In
addition, as noted in the Court’s May 24, 2024 Order, Sevak Avakian
states in his supporting declaration that that “[p]rior to being represented by
my current counsel I was represented by Alex Gilanians…and paid Mr. Gilanians
$44,441.49 in attorney’s fees. A true and correct copy of the Attorney’s fees
paid by me to Mr. Gilanians is attached to this declaration as ‘Exhibit #2.’”
(Sevak Avakian Decl., ¶ 9, emphasis omitted.) The billing records attached as
Exhibit 2 to Sevak Avakian’s declaration appear to indicate that services were
provided by Alex Gilanians, a Professional Law Corporation from August 2016
through September 2017. (Sevak Avakian Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. 2.) Plaintiff does not
oppose the instant motion, and thus does not assert that the requested
$44,441.49 in attorney’s fees is unreasonable. The Court finds that this amount
is reasonable. 
In addition, in his original declaration in
support of the motion, Sevak Avakian’s counsel Sam Zreik states that his
billing rate on this matter was and is $400.00 per hour. (Zreik Decl., ¶ 3.) In
the May 24, 2024 Order, the Court noted that “Plaintiff does not oppose the instant
motion and does not challenge Mr. Zreik’s hourly rate. The
Court finds that Mr. Zreik’s requested hourly billing rate is reasonable.”
(May 24, 2024 Order at p. 5:5-6.) 
As further noted in the May 24, 2024 Order, Mr.
Zreik states in his original declaration that “[o]n July 15, 2021, I agreed to
represent Defendant on this matter, and have continued to represent Defendant
to the date of writing this declaration. From the time my representation of
Defendant to the present, Defendant has accrued, and has paid, $23,573.96 in
legal fees and costs. Thus, from the onset of litigation to the present
Defendant incurred legal fees and costs in the amount of $68,015.45.” (Zreik
Decl., ¶ 11.)[1] 
In his original declaration in support of the
motion, Mr. Zreik states that “I have prepared invoices for each task performed
for Defendant with each entry being made at or near the time in which the tasks
it described were completed or incurred. The invoices reflect time reasonably
expended by me on the case. I prepared each of my time entries in the invoices
in the regular course of firm’s business.” (Zreik Decl., ¶ 12.) As noted in the
Court’s May 24, 2024 Order, a copy of the referenced invoices did not appear to
be provided in connection with Mr. Zriek’s original declaration. Mr. Zreik’s
declaration also referenced a redacted “Client Billing Statement,” but such a
statement did not appear to have been provided. (Zreik Decl., ¶ 14.) 
In his supplemental declaration, Mr. Zreik
states that “[o]n July 15, 2021, I agreed to represent Defendant on this
matter, and have continued to represent Defendant to the date of writing this
declaration. From the time my representation of Defendant to the present,
Defendant has accrued, and has paid, $23,573.96 in legal fees and costs. Please
see attached Exhibit #1 are my invoices.” (Suppl. Zreik Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. 1.) Plaintiff
does not oppose the instant motion, and thus does not assert that the requested
$23,573.96 in attorney’s fees and costs is unreasonable. The Court finds that
this amount is reasonable. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Sevak
Avakian’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs against Plaintiff in the amount
of $68,015.45 is granted. 
Sevak Avakian is to provide notice of this
ruling.¿¿
