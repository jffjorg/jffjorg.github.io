Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Christopher Castro, alleges that he was wrongfully terminated by his employer, Dongalen Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a Interstate Plastics, due to his disability and prior CFRA leave. The defendant is seeking to strike paragraphs 29, 30, 31, and 32 of the complaint, as well as paragraph 3 of the prayer for relief.

The judge finds that the defendant has not demonstrated that the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to demonstrate "malice," "oppression," or "fraud" for purposes of the plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has properly pleaded facts alleging that the defendant engaged in malicious or oppressive conduct, including denying the plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation, belittling and demeaning the plaintiff's need for accommodation, and ultimately terminating his employment due to his disability and prior CFRA leave.

The judge denies the defendant's motion to strike and orders the defendant to file and serve its answer within 10 days of the date of this order.
