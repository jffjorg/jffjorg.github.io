 Case Number:  23STCV18298    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  50       Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department  50       WM SUNSET &    VINE LLC,                          Plaintiff,             vs. HOVIK DZHURYAN, et al.,                         Defendants.   Case No.:   23STCV18298     Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024     Hearing Time:   10:00 a.m.         ORDER    RE:     PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT                    Plaintiff  WM Sunset & Vine LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment  against Defendant Hovik Dzhuryan. Plaintiff requests judgment in the total  amount of $12,378.83, comprising $3,155.00 in past-due rent, $8,412.80 in  holdover damages, $737.03 in attorney fees, and $574.00 in costs, acknowledging  a $500.00 security deposit credit.  Plaintiff  seeks $8,412.80 in “holdover damages.” (See Proposed Judgment, Item  6(a)(2).) In the memorandum of point and authorities in support of the instant  request, Plaintiff asserts that the Judicial Council Form Unlawful Detainer  Complaint (UD-100) filed in this action “includes an appropriate request for  holdover damages.” (Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities at p.  3:15.) Plaintiff points to paragraph 19(g) of the Complaint, which alleges that  Plaintiff requests “damages at the rate stated in item 13 from…08/01/2023.”  Paragraph 13 of the Complaint alleges that “[t]he fair rental value of the  premises is $105.16 per day.” Plaintiff asserts that “Defendant vacated the  Premises on October 19, 2023. As such, Plaintiff is entitled to holdover  damages for 80 days, which equates to $8,412.00.” (Plaintiff’s Memorandum of  Points and Authorities at p. 3:17-18.) The Court finds that Plaintiff has  sufficiently supported his request with the submitted memorandum, declarations  and evidence. Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s  request is granted, and the Court will sign the proposed judgment submitted on  March 28, 2024 and the proposed Order Admitting Copies of Documents in Lieu of  Originals.  No appearance at the  hearing is necessary.¿¿      DATED:  June 25, 2024                                 ________________________________ Hon.  Teresa A. Beaudet Judge,  Los Angeles Superior Court
