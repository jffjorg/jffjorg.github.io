[1]The Court notes
that on June 17, 2024, the Court issued a minute order continuing the hearing
on the instant motion to June 25, 2024. The Court noted that neither party
delivered to Department 50 the requisite courtesy copies of their briefs. On
June 20, 2024, Aaronoff filed an amended reply brief in support of the instant
motion. However, the Court’s June 17, 2024 minute order did not authorize the
parties to file amended briefs. Thus, the Court disregards Aaronoff’s amended
reply brief filed on June 20, 2024. 


[2]The Court notes
that on July 12, 2022, Aaronoff filed an “Appellant’s Notice Designating Record
on Appeal.” 


[3]As set forth above, on April 11, 2024, the Court
issued a minute order providing, inter alia, that “[p]ursuant to the
request of defendant, the Hearing on Application for Order for Appearance and Examination
scheduled for 04/11/2024 is continued to 05/14/24…Ms. Aaronoff is ordered to
produce the remaining requested documents to Plaintiff on or before May 13,
2024 at noon.” 
 


[4]The Court also
notes that for the first time in the reply, Aaronoff states that “[a]lthough
this Court has previously denied Defendant Aaronoff’s claim of exemption,
Defendant requests this Court to reconsider allowing legal exemptions including
exempting her food stamps, medical funds, and clothing from Olson’s enforcement
of the money judgment.” (Reply at p. 10:12-17.) The Court notes that “[p]oints raised
for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be considered, because
such consideration would deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter
the argument.¿” (American Drug
Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992) 10
Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453¿.) Thus,
the Court declines to consider Aaronoff’s requests made for the first time in
the reply brief.
