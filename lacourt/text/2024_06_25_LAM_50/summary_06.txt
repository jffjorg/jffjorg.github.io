And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling regarding a pending court case. The case involves a dispute between Plaintiff and Defendant over a request to strike parts of the Plaintiff's Complaint. The judge notes that Defendant's counsel met with Plaintiff's counsel to discuss the matter, and that Plaintiff's counsel confirmed they would not amend their Complaint to remove a plea for punitive damages. The judge also notes that Plaintiff's amended opposition does not address a point raised in a previous case (Scott case). Defendant's counsel raised a new argument in their reply brief, but the judge declines to consider it as it was raised for the first time in the reply brief. The judge will consider further submissions before making a final ruling.
