And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge notes that the parties were required to file courtesy copies of their briefs, but neither party did. Aaronoff filed an amended reply brief, but this was not authorized by the court's previous order. Therefore, the court disregards the amended brief. The judge also notes that Aaronoff has requested reconsideration of the court's previous denial of her claim of exemption, but this is being raised for the first time in the reply brief and will not be considered.
