Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Loren DeShon, is seeking entry of default judgment against the defendant, Dayyon Drinkard aka Dayyon Alexander. The court has reviewed the proof of service filed on July 11, 2023, and finds that it does not contain any defects warranting its rejection. Therefore, the court is entering default against the defendant and will proceed with assessing the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment. The plaintiff is seeking judgment in the amount of $43,783.28, which includes damages, interest, attorney fees, and costs. The court finds that the plaintiff has submitted sufficient evidence to support the requested default judgment. However, the proposed judgment contains a typo, which will be corrected by the court. Based on these findings, the court is granting the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment and will correct and sign the proposed judgment.
