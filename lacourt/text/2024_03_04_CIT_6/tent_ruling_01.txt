  Case Number:  22PSCV00469    Hearing Date:   March 4, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Loren DeShon’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendant: Dayyon Drinkard aka Dayyon Alexander  COURT RULING             Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED. Court will correct and sign the Proposed Judgment.           BACKGROUND             This  is a breach of contract case. On May 17, 2022, plaintiff Loren DeShon  (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Dayyon Drinkard aka Dayyon  Alexander (Defendant) and Does 1 to 10. On January 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed the  operative First Amended Complaint, alleging causes of action for promissory  notes and quantum meruit. On January 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for  entry of default judgment.  The  Court notes that the Clerk’s office issued a Notice of Rejection for the  request for entry of default judgment on January 18, 2024, stating that the  proof of service was faulty. (Notice of Rejection (1/18/24).) However, upon the  Court’s review, the proof of service filed on July 11, 2023 does not contain  any defects warranting its rejection. Accordingly, the Court on its own motion  hereby enters default against Defendant, (see L.A. County Court Rules, rule  3.200, subd. (a)), and proceeds with assessment of Plaintiff’s request for  entry of default judgment.            LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a  proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment  is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil  Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)  exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by  statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800.)   ANALYSIS Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendant in the total amount of $43,783.28, including  $36,478.55 in damages, $5,316.87 in interest, $1,484.36 in attorney fees, and $503.50  in costs. The Court finds Plaintiff has submitted sufficient evidence to  support the requested default judgment. However, the Court also notes that the  proposed judgment states a total of $47,783.28, which conflicts with the total  stated in paragraph 2 of the request for entry of default judgment, i.e.  $43,783.28. (See JUD-100, ¶ 6, subd. (a)(6); CIV-100, ¶ 2, subd. (c).) This  appears to have been a typo, which will be corrected by the Court.  CONCLUSION               Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED. Court will correct and sign the Proposed Judgment.
