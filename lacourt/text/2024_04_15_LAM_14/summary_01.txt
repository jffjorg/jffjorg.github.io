And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling concerns a lawsuit between Wilbur A. Williams, Jr. M.D. and Wilbur Williams, M.D., Inc. (the "Plaintiffs") against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Hovanes Tonoyan, Sevana Petrosian, Salina Ranjbar, Vana Mehrabian, Staforde Palmer, and DOES 1-100 (the "Defendants"). The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants embezzled millions of dollars from a set of medical clinics. The court has previously ordered the claims against the Petrosian Defendants to arbitration and has sustained the demurrer of the Wells Fargo Defendants. The Plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal of the Wells Fargo Defendants.

The court has granted the motion of the Wells Fargo Defendants to bifurcate the trial of the seventh cause of action for Unfair Competition and the third cause of action. The court will first try the Unfair Competition claim to the court, and if there are any factual issues remaining, the third cause of action will be tried to a jury. If the jury returns a verdict requiring the court to proceed to trial on the amount of punitive damages, the court will do so. The court's ruling is based on statutory and case law.
