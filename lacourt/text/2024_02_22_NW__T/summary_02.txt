And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted Cross-Complainant Aurel Bunduchi's motion for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint (PFAXC) against Cross-Defendant Svetlana Strashko. The PFAXC seeks to add three new causes of action for partition, accounting, and fraud, as well as factual allegations in support of the new claims and a request for punitive damages. The Judge found that the motion sufficiently complied with the procedural requirements and that the proposed amendments were grounded upon facts discovered through document production. However, the Judge noted that the delay in filing the motion was unreasonable, but did not find that it was sufficient grounds to deny the motion. The Judge also denied Cross-Defendant's request to condition the granting of the motion on the current trial date remaining as scheduled.
