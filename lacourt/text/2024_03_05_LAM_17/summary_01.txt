And here is the English text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to delete allegations of disability discrimination and add allegations of race/ethnic discrimination. The Plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to sexual harassment, sexual battery, retaliation, failure to prevent discrimination, and failure to accommodate during her employment with the County of Los Angeles. The Judge found that the Plaintiff has shown facts that could support allegations of race/ethnic discrimination, including an email sent to her supervisor in 2020 complaining about her refusal to approve her time card and stating "you must really hate Armenians". The Defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the proposed amended claim is time-barred under Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b), but the Judge found that the cases cited by the Defendant are not relevant to this issue. The Judge also found that there will be insufficient prejudice to deny the motion, given that the trial has been continued and will not take place until September 2024.
