```

And here is a brief English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration, finding that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable due to unconscionability. The agreement is deemed substantively unconscionable because it allows the defendant to recover costs and fees, requires confidentiality, and includes illegal non-solicitation provisions. The Court also finds that the agreement is procedurally unconscionable due to its adhesion nature and lack of notice. The ruling concludes that the interests of justice would not be served by severing the unconscionable terms from the agreement, and therefore, the motion to compel arbitration is denied.
