COUNTY

 Case No.: 
  22STCV11119
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  March 5, 2024



 
Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to amend to file an SAC is GRANTED.  
 
On 4/1/2022,
Plaintiff Hasmik Yaghobyan (Plaintiff) filed suit against County of Los Angeles
and Fermando Lemus, alleging: (1) sexual harassment; (2) sexual battery; (3)
retaliation; (4) failure to prevent discrimination; (5) disability
discrimination; (6) failure to accommodate; and (7) failure to engage in the
interactive process. 
 
            On
12/14/2023, Plaintiff moved to file a Second Amended Complaint (SAC).
 
Discussion  
 
            Plaintiff
seeks to leave to amend to delete his allegations regarding disability
discrimination, and to add allegations of race/ethnic discrimination. 
 
The
policy favoring leave to amend is so strong that it is an abuse of discretion
to deny an amendment unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice. (Atkinson
v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) Here, no prejudice will result from Plaintiff’s deletion
of disability related causes of action. While there will be some prejudice by
Plaintiff’s new allegations of race discrimination, this claim is supported by
facts which could show race discrimination. For example, on
4/1/2020, Plaintiff allegedly sent her supervisor an email complaining about
her refusal to approve her time card, which Plaintiff viewed as veiled
discrimination. Plaintiff concluded her email with, "you must really hate
Armenians." (Motion, 3: 19-20.) As such, Plaintiff has alleged facts which
could show that she complained of racial discrimination during her employment. 
 
In
opposition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s motion is untimely: 
 
Plaintiff’s
DFEH complaint (which was conveniently not attached to the Motion for Leave)
includes allegations that the County discriminated against, and harassed
Plaintiff based on her race and national origin. Plaintiff was thus required to
file her civil claims for discrimination based on race/ethnicity, if at all, no
later than March 22, 2023. Plaintiff failed to do so. Accordingly, her proposed
amended claim for discrimination on the basis of race/ethnicity is time-barred
under Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b), and her Motion must
therefore be denied as this Court has no jurisdiction to permit the amendment
 
(Opp., 2:
9-16.)
 
However, the
cases cited to by Defendant like Hall
v. Goodwill Industries of Southern California (2011) 193 Cal. App. 4th 718 and Acuna v. San Diego Gas &
Electric Co., 217 Cal. App. 4th 1402 address a
failure to timely file a FEHA lawsuit, not the issue of later amendment of a
timely filed Complaint. 
 
Given that
the motion to continue trial was granted, and trial is now not until 9/9/2024,
the Court finds insufficient prejudice to deny this motion. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend to file an SAC is
granted.  
 
 
It is so ordered.
