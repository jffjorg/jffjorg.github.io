Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendants and the opposition and reply filed by the plaintiff. The court grants the defendants' motion as to the intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, hostile work environment, retaliation in violation of public policy, and wrongful termination claims. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations do not support the claims and that the defendants have shown that the plaintiff's claims are meritless. The court gives the plaintiff 30 days to amend its complaint.
