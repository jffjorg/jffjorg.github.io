Mark Madnick  and Kramar Madnick LLP (“Counsel”)  RESPONDING PARTY: None  NOTICE: ok    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order relieving counsel H. Mark Madnick as counsel for Plaintiff James Hoseini  (“Plaintiff”)   TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is GRANTED.   BACKGROUND   This action stems from alleged fraud by joint venture  partners.      On March 8, 2023, Plaintiff initiated this action against  Defendants Reza Abad, Aiden Bohloul, Teza Products, Inc. (collectively,  “Defendants”), and Does 1-50. Subsequently, on March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed  the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against all Defendants, alleging  the following causes of action: (1) fraud, (2) breach of written contract, (3)  breach of fiduciary duty, (4) elder abuse, (5) accounting, and (6) constructive  trust.   On April 24, 2023, Defendants filed their Answer to the FAC.  On the same day, April 24, 2023, Defendants filed their Cross-Complaint against  Plaintiff.    Subsequently, on September 1, 2023, Defendants, and Teza  Doors, Inc. (collectively, “Cross-Complainants”) filed their operative First  Amendment Cross-Complaint (“FACC”).   On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff’s Counsel filed the instant  Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the “Motion”)               No opposing papers have been  received by the Court.   ANALYSIS The court may  order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after  judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and  after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The  determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies  within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,  1133.) An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel  Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053  (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)             In  addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 subsection (d) requires that  the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on  the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal  service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must  be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either:             (A) The service address is the current residence or  business address of the client; or (B)  The service address is the last known residence or business address of the  client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after  making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the  motion to be relieved.               (Cal. Rules of  Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (1)(A) & (2).)   Plaintiff’s Counsel has filed Judicial Counsel Forms MC-051  and MC-052. Additionally, Counsel lodged Judicial Counsel Form MC-053 with the  Court. Counsel has provided a declaration stating that the Motion is  necessitated by a “James Hoseini aka Jim Hoseini failed to comply with the  terms of the written engagement letter entered into by him and Kramar Madnick,  LLP[.]” Counsel further declares that his withdraw is due to confidential  information, citing California Rules of Professional Conducts Rule 1.16 and Manfredi  & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128. (MC-052, ¶ 2.)    The Court finds Counsel’s reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory.  Counsel states in his declaration that the Motion was served by mail at  Plaintiff’s last known address which has been confirmed within the past 30 days  that the address is current (Id., ¶ 3.) Counsel has also filed a copy of  the proof of service, demonstrating proper service on Plaintiff and the counsel  representing all Defendants/Cross-Complainants.   The next hearing scheduled for this action is a Mandatory  Settlement Conference set for January 21, 2025, at 10:30 a.m. in Department F49  at 9425 Penfield Ave. Chatsworth, CA 91311. A trial is set for March 10, 2025  (MC-053, ¶¶ 7, 9.)   Consequently, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Motion  to be Relieved as Counsel.   CONCLUSION   Plaintiff’s Counsel H.  Mark Madnick’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED.   Plaintiff’s Counsel to give notice.
