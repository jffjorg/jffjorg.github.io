And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the Demurrer filed by the defendant, General Motors LLC, is moot and taken off the calendar. This is because the plaintiff, Mary E. Meraz, filed a Third Amended Complaint (TAC) after the defendant filed the Demurrer, and the joint stipulation and order to file the TAC was granted by the court. As a result, the Demurrer, which was addressing the superseded Second Amended Complaint (SAC), is no longer relevant and is taken off the calendar. The judge notes that the filing of an amended complaint renders a demurrer moot, citing a previous court decision. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
