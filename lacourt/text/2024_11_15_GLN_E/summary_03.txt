And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Xiaozhu Sun's motion to compel arbitration. The motion is based on the agency exception and equitable estoppel. The Judge notes that the arbitration agreement between Uber and Plaintiff does not appear to be attached, but it was looked at from a prior motion to compel arbitration. The Judge is concerned about the agreement's scope, as it only covers "you" and Uber Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers, and directors, and does not explicitly include agents. The Judge will have questions about the agreement at the hearing.
