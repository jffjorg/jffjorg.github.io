And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two motions by the plaintiff, Ana Gonzalez, in her case against Ford Motor Company. The first motion seeks to compel the defendant to provide a PMK deposition related to examination 1-118 and responses to request for production of documents 1-122. The second motion seeks to compel further responses to the plaintiff's request for production of documents, set two, request numbers 1-155. The judge notes that the plaintiff failed to comply with the meet and confer requirement, as required by CCP § 2016.040, and also failed to contact the deponent about a nonappearance for a deposition. Therefore, the judge orders the parties to further meet and confer on both motions.
