Monte’s Application for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff City of El
Monte’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of
$183,543.53.
BACKGROUND
This
is a nuisance abatement action. On January 9, 2020, the El Monte Police
Department was executing a search warrant at a property in El Monte when they
discovered large-scale and illegal indoor cultivation of marijuana.
On
May 7, 2021, the City of El Monte (the City) filed a complaint against
Defendants Timothy Tung, Hsue Fu Tung, and Suan Cheng Tung as well as Does
1-100 alleging the following causes of action: (1) narcotics abatement, (2)
public nuisance, (3) violation of El Monte municipal code, (4) violation of
Unfair Competition Law, and (5) violation of MAUCRSA. On September 28, 2021,
the City filed proofs of service claiming the City’s registered process server
served the Tungs via substitute service in El Monte on July 1, 2021.
On
June 24, 2022, the court entered default against the Tungs after they failed to
timely file an answer. On December 12, 2022, the City filed an application for
default judgment. On December 14, 2022, the court denied the City’s application
and set aside the entry of default, noting the City’s proofs of service failed
to include declarations of diligence.
On
January 12, 2023, the City submitted updated proofs of service. On January 13,
2023, default was entered against Suan Cheng Tung. On January 23, 2023, default
was entered against Timothy Tung and Hsue Fu Tung. At the court’s direction,
the City resubmitted an application for default judgment on February 15, 2023.
On March 1, 2023, the court denied the City’s application and vacated the entry
of default, noting their proofs of service demonstrated insufficient due
diligence before effecting substitute service.
On
March 11, 2024; March 18, 2024; March 25, 2024; and April 1, 2024, the City
served the Tungs by publication. On June 6, 2024, the Court entered default
against Timothy Tung and Hsue Fu Tung after they failed to file a timely
answer. On the same day, the Court rejected the City’s request to enter default
against Suan Cheng Tung as the proof of publication misspelled Suan Cheng
Tung’s name. On June 20, 2024, the City filed another application for
default judgment against Timothy Tung and Hsue Fu Tung. On June 24, 2024, the
court denied the City’s application as they failed to seek a default judgment
against Suan Cheng Tung. On September 13, 2024, the court entered default
against Suan Cheng Tung after Suan Cheng Tung failed to timely answer.
On
September 20, 2024, the City filed the present application for default
judgment. An OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for September 25, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
The
City seeks default judgment against the Tungs in the total amount of $183,592.56,
including $175,000.00 in damages, $3,689.03 in attorney fees, and $4,903.53 in
costs. Because the court finds the City has submitted sufficient evidence, the court
GRANTS the City’s application for default judgment with the following
modification. While the City requests attorney fees of $3,689.03, the court
calculates reasonable attorney fees at $3,640.00 pursuant to Local Rule 3.214 ($2,890
+ $750 or 1% of $75,000.00).
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the
City’s application for default judgment is GRANTED
in the reduced amount of $183,543.53.
