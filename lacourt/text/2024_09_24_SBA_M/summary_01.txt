And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted, in part, and denied, in part, MCT Group's Motion for Leave to Amend Judgment. The motion is granted in that the stipulated judgment is set aside, allowing MCT Group to file a proposed First Amended Complaint. However, the motion is denied in that MCT Group has failed to provide legal authority for the order to amend the judgment and has failed to provide competent evidence to establish grounds to amend the judgment to add Edsel Rodas as a judgment debtor. The judge has also ordered MCT Group to file the proposed First Amended Complaint and serve it upon Maribel Vasquez within ten days of the date of the ruling. Additionally, the judge has set an OSC re: dismissal for failure to file proof of service and case management conference and has ordered MCT Group to serve notice of the ruling.
