significant_statements:
  - "The anti-SLAPP procedures are designed to shield a defendant's constitutionally protected conduct from the undue burden of frivolous litigation."
  - "The anti-SLAPP statute does not insulate defendants from any liability for claims arising from the protected rights of petition or speech. It only provides a procedure for weeding out, at an early stage, meritless claims arising from protected activity."
  - "By referring to a 'cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of' the protected rights of petition and speech, the Legislature indicated that particular alleged acts giving rise to a claim for relief may be the object of an anti-SLAPP motion."
```

Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the anti-SLAPP motion in part, finding that the Defendant's acts of filing a small claims court action and making defamatory statements to the judge and building owners are protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not established a probability of prevailing on the merits, as the alleged statements are privileged under Civ. Code § 47(b). The Judge grants the anti-SLAPP motion to strike the allegations related to the protected activity, but denies the motion as to the entirety of the Complaint and each cause of action.
