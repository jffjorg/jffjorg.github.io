And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to set aside the default and vacate the default judgment without prejudice. The defendants, Nathan's Towing LLC, Frank Fuentes, and Alondra Sulay Yuriko Padilla, filed the motion claiming that the entry of default is void on its face because they were not served with the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The judge found that the defendants' motion is based solely on the conclusory and self-serving declaration of their counsel, which does not constitute grounds for setting aside the default based on CCP § 473(d). The judge also noted that the proof of service attached to the FAC shows that the service was valid and executed under penalty of perjury. As a result, the judge denied the defendants' motion.
