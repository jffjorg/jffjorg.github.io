```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to set aside the entry of default and vacate the default judgment without prejudice. The motion was based solely on CCP § 473(d), which allows a court to set aside a judgment that is void as a matter of law. The defendants argued that the entry of default was void because they were not served with the First Amended Complaint. However, the proof of service attached to the FAC shows that the service was valid and executed under penalty of perjury. The judge found that simply denying service of a facially valid proof of service does not constitute grounds for setting aside a default under CCP § 473(d). The judge ordered plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
