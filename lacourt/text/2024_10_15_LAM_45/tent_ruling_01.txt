Motion to Compel
Deposition and Production of Documents       
The Court considered the moving papers and opposition. No reply was
filed.
The court orders Defendant to attend deposition on November 11, 2024, and
to produce documents responsive to Plaintiff’s requests. 
Background 
On June 28, 2023, Plaintiff Ricky Thorstensen (“Plaintiff”) filed a
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendants J.J. Murphy (“Defendant”);
City of Palmdale; Keith Kang; and Does 1 to 100, inclusive. The SAC alleged six
causes of action: (1) discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and
Housing Act (“FEHA”); (2) harassment in violation of the FEHA; (3) retaliation
in violation of the FEHA; (4) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment,
and retaliation; (5) violation of Labor Code section 1102.5; and (6) intentional
infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiff alleges he was discriminated
against, harassed, and wrongfully terminated due to his age. Defendant filed
his Answer and a Cross-Complaint against Defendant City of Palmdale on May 1,
2024.
            On September 13, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Compel Deposition of Defendant. 
Legal Standard 
Any party may obtain discovery … by taking the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)
Code of Civil Procedure,¿section¿2025.450, subdivision (a),
provides:¿“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . .
. , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any
document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order¿compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document . . . described in the deposition
notice.”¿
Where a party objects to the deposition, the proper remedy is an
objection under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410. If such an objection
is made within three calendar days before the deposition date, the objecting
party must make personal service of that objection. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.410, subd. (b).)  
Code of Civil Procedure,¿section¿2025.450, subdivision (b), provides:¿“A
motion under subdivision (a) . . . shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”
Discussion 
Motion to Compel Deposition
On October 17, 2022, Plaintiff served on Defendant a Notice of Taking
Deposition and Request for Production of Documents by personal service.
(Declaration of Sophie Mangan, ¶ 2, Exhibit 1.) The deposition was scheduled
for December 5, 2022, to be conducted by video conference and telephone.
(Declaration of Sophie Mangan, ¶ 2, Exhibit 1.) Defendant contends that he
never received personal service of this notice, and that he did not reside at
the proof of service address. (Opposition to Motion to Compel, p. 2, fn. 1.) 
Plaintiff did not receive a response and served deposition subpoenas on
Defendant’s past employer on January 24, 2023 and March 15, 2023. (Declaration
of Sophie Mangan, ¶ 3, Exhibits 2, 3.) These depositions were scheduled for February
22, 2023, and April 24, 2023, respectively. (Declaration of Sophie Mangan, ¶ 3,
Exhibits 2, 3.) Defendant argues that these notices were sent to Defendant City
of Palmdale’s counsel, who never represented Defendant. (Opposition to Motion
to Compel, p. 2, fn. 1.) 
Plaintiff served another deposition notice on Defendant’s counsel on
April 17, 2024, for deposition scheduled for June 5, 2024. (Declaration of
Sophie Mangan, ¶ 5, Exhibit 4.) Defendant does not contest that it was served
on his counsel, but he argues that at the time of service, he had not yet
appeared in the action, rendering mail service on counsel ineffective.
(Opposition to Motion to Compel, p. 2, fn. 1.) 
Defendant argues that his first appearance in the case was on May 1,
2024, when he filed his Answer, even though he was never served with
Plaintiff’s Complaint. (Opposition to Motion to Compel, p. 2.) Plaintiff’s
counsel testifies through Declaration that since May 1, 2024, she has requested
Defendant’s availability for deposition from his counsel eight times.
(Declaration of Sophie Mangan, ¶ 6.) Defendant concedes that Plaintiff’s
counsel requested dates in early May 2024. (Opposition to Motion to Compel, p.
2.) 
Defendant’s counsel testifies through Declaration that Defendant resides
in Florida, so arranging his deposition is more difficult. (Declaration of Kevin
I. Shenkman, ¶ 3.) Defendant’s counsel informed all other counsel that
Defendant would be available for deposition on the week of August 12, 2024. (Declaration
of Kevin I. Shenkman, ¶ 5, Exhibit B.) Defendant contends Plaintiff’s counsel
never served a deposition notice for that week or any other time. (Declaration
of Kevin I. Shenkman, ¶ 6.)
On September 5, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel requested available dates for
deposition again. (Declaration of Kevin I. Shenkman, ¶ 7, Exhibit D;
Declaration of Sophie Mangan, ¶ 14, Exhibit 12.) 
On September 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. On September
25, 2024, Defendant provided two more available dates, one of which Plaintiff’s
counsel agreed with, but Plaintiff refused to withdraw the instant motion. (Declaration
of Kevin I. Shenkman, ¶ 9, Exhibit F.)
The court finds that parties have reached a mutually agreeable date for
deposition, rendering the present motion unnecessary.
Motion to Compel Production of Documents
Code Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (b)(1) requires the
moving party to “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” As demonstrated by
previous deposition notices, Plaintiff intends to demand production of various
documents. The court finds good cause to compel production of these documents
as they relate to Defendant’s interactions with Plaintiff, complaints Plaintiff
made, and the subject of Plaintiffs complaints. (Motion to Compel, p. 3.) The
Court also notes that the discovery cutoff date will have already passed at the
time of this hearing, and obtaining discovery later may prejudice Plaintiff’s
ability to present his case. As such, the court grants Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Production of Documents.
Sanctions
The court finds that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence of his
efforts to meet and confer and declines to grant sanctions against Plaintiff. “Notwithstanding
the outcome of the particular discovery motion, the court shall impose a
monetary sanction ordering that any party or attorney who fails to confer as
required pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020.) Plaintiff’s
counsel has testified through Declaration that she has attempted to meet and
confer to resolve this discovery dispute informally. (Declaration of Sophie
Mangan, ¶ 6.) As such, the court declines to grant sanctions.
Conclusion
Based on the evidence presented, the court orders Defendant’s attendance
at the deposition scheduled for November 11, 2024. The court also grants
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Production of Documents.
It is so ordered.
