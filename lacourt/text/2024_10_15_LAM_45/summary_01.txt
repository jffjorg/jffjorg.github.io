And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to compel deposition and production of documents filed by Plaintiff Ricky Thorstensen. The motion was filed on September 13, 2024, and the hearing was held on October 15, 2024. The court has reviewed the moving papers and opposition.

The court finds that the parties have reached a mutually agreeable date for deposition, rendering the present motion unnecessary. The court grants Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Production of Documents, ordering Defendant to produce documents responsive to Plaintiff's requests. The court also orders Defendant's attendance at the deposition scheduled for November 11, 2024.

The court declines to grant sanctions against Plaintiff, finding that Plaintiff's counsel has attempted to meet and confer to resolve the discovery dispute informally. The court notes that the discovery cutoff date will have already passed at the time of this hearing, and obtaining discovery later may prejudice Plaintiff's ability to present his case.

In conclusion, the court orders Defendant's attendance at the deposition and grants Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Production of Documents.
