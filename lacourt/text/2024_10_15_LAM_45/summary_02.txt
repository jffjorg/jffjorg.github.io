And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Sergio Bent's motion to be relieved as counsel for the defendants, Pelv-Ice LLC and Jill Bigelow. The judge found that although Bent has shown a proper basis for withdrawal, such as the defendants' failure to pay his invoices and Jill Bigelow's lack of responsiveness, he has not provided a sufficient explanation for why he did not seek the defendants' consent to be relieved as counsel. The judge notes that the defendants have not been current on their invoices and that there has been a breakdown in communication regarding fees and costs. However, the judge believes that the defendants' lack of cooperation in paying Bent's invoices and responding to communication is not a sufficient reason to allow him to withdraw as counsel. The judge also notes that the trial is still a year away and that there is no reason to believe that Bent's withdrawal would prejudice the defendants.
