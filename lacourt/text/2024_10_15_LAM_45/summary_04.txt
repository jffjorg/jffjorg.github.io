The defendant alleged that the plaintiff had failed to appear for multiple deposition sessions and had not provided the requested medical records.

The Judge found that the defendant had made a good faith attempt to resolve the issue informally by scheduling multiple deposition sessions, and that the plaintiff had failed to provide any substantial justification for not participating in the depositions or producing the requested documents. The Judge granted the defendant's motion and awarded sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $847.50. The Judge also ordered the plaintiff to appear for a deposition with all responsive documents within 30 days of the order.
