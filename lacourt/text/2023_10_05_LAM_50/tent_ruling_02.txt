[1]The Court notes
that Gibson states in his response to the instant motion that he “incorporates
by reference the statements and arguments set forth in his Motion to Quash
Service of the Motion to Amend Judgment and the Declaration of Gibson submitted
to support his Motion to Quash, both filed concurrently with this Response.” (Response
at p. 2:10-13.) Gibson does not cite to any legal authority demonstrating that
this approach is appropriate. Moreover, pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1113,
subdivision (d),
“[e]xcept in a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or
responding memorandum may exceed 15 pages.” Incorporating
Gibson’s motion to quash filed on September 25, 2023 into Gibson’s response to
the instant motion would result in the response exceeding 15 pages. For the
foregoing reasons, the Court declines to consider Gibson’s separate motion to
quash herein. 


[2]The Court notes
that Plaintiff’s counsel’s reply declaration indicates that “[a]ttached hereto as Exhibit 5 is a true and correct copy of relevant
excerpts of the March 9, 2023, debtor’s examination of Kandypens, Inc., which
designated James Zender as its witness.” (Crowell Reply
Decl., ¶ 6.) 
 


[3]Plaintiff also asserts in the reply that “Gibson is
the alter ego of Kandypens, over which jurisdiction is undisputed.” (Reply at
p. 2:9.) Plaintiff cites to Sheard v. Superior Court (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d
207, 210, where the Court
of Appeal noted that “it has been held in this state that if a subsidiary
corporation acts as an agent of the parent corporation or is so controlled by
the parent as to justify disregard of the separate entity jurisdiction over the
subsidiary will support jurisdiction over the parent. Upon analogy we are persuaded that where a corporation is
the alter ego of the stockholders so as to justify
disregard of the corporate entity jurisdiction over the corporation will
support jurisdiction over the stockholders.” (Internal citations omitted.)
