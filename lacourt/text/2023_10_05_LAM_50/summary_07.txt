And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants 360 Capital's motion to compel further responses to its Amended Demand for Site Inspection, which was filed on July 27, 2023. The motion was opposed by Plaintiffs Daniel Wang and Grace Lee. The Amended Demand for Site Inspection was served on December 13, 2022, and Plaintiffs responded on December 15, 2022. The judge finds that 360 Capital has demonstrated good cause for the requested site inspection, and that Plaintiffs' response was inadequate.

The judge also denies Plaintiffs' request for sanctions against 360 Capital and denies 360 Capital's request for sanctions against Plaintiffs. The judge orders Plaintiffs to provide a further response to 360 Capital's Amended Demand for Site Inspection within 30 days.

The dispute in this case centers around 360 Capital's request to inspect the property, which is alleged to be nonconforming in construction. Plaintiffs have limited the scope of the inspection, and 360 Capital asserts that this is an inadequate response. The judge finds that 360 Capital has demonstrated good cause for the requested site inspection and grants the motion to compel further responses.
