And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service. The motion was filed by Gibson, who incorporates by reference his previous motions to quash service and amend judgment. However, the Court finds that Gibson's response exceeds the 15-page limit set by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subdivision (d). Therefore, the Court declines to consider Gibson's separate motion to quash.

The Court also notes that Plaintiff's counsel has submitted a reply declaration, which includes excerpts from a debtor's examination of Kandypens, Inc. The Court finds that Plaintiff's assertion of alter ego jurisdiction is supported by the case law, citing Sheard v. Superior Court (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 207.
