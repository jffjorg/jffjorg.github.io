And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add new causes of action for tort of deceit and cancellations of instruments, as well as to add a new defendant, Peggy Muse. The defendants oppose the motion, citing the plaintiff's failure to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, which requires that a motion to amend a pleading before trial specify what allegations are proposed to be deleted or added, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted or added allegations are located. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not adequately complied with this rule and denies the motion without prejudice. The judge also notes that the defendants have incurred significant attorney fees as a result of the plaintiff's discovery refusals and delays, and that the depositions are still pending.
