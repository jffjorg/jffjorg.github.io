Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to amend the judgment to add Graham Gibson as a judgment debtor under Code of Civil Procedure Section 187. The motion is based on the fact that Kandypens Inc. failed to make payments and defaulted on its debt. The court finds that it has personal jurisdiction over Gibson based on his activities directed towards California, including his role as CEO of Kandypens Inc. and his purposeful availment of California benefits. The court also finds that specific jurisdiction is proper as the case is substantially connected to Gibson's California activities. The court orders Gibson to file and serve a surreply on or before November 1, 2023, to address the evidence submitted by the plaintiff in connection with the reply.
