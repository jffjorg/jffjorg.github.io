And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants ANDREW P. SCOTT's motion for an order determining good faith settlement. The motion is unopposed and the court finds that the settlement was reached as a result of arm's length negotiations between the parties. The settlement resolves a nearly decade-long dispute and takes into account the costs of settlement versus the costs of continuing with the cases. The court notes that the evaluation of whether a settlement was made in good faith must be made on the basis of information available at the time of settlement. The court also cites California Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, which provides for the determination of good faith settlements and the bar to claims of other joint tortfeasors or co-obligors. The court orders SCOTT to provide notice of this ruling.
