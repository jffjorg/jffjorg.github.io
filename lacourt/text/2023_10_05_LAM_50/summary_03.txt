**Summary**

The Honorable Judge Rolf M. Treu issued a tentative ruling on October 5, 2023, in the case of Richard Meng and Vivian Meng (Plaintiffs) vs. Leon Richard Mays and Daniels (Defendants). The case revolves around a motion to expunge notices of lis pendens recorded against a property located at 402 Randolph St, Pomona, CA 91768.

Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants misappropriated funds and recorded a notice of lis pendens against the property. The Defendants, led by Leon Richard Mays as Trustee of the 402 Randolph Trust, moved to expunge the notice of lis pendens.

The Court found that the Plaintiffs did not meet their burden to show the existence of a real property claim in the FAC. The Court ruled that the notice of lis pendens was expunged, and the Defendant is ordered to provide notice of this ruling.

The Court also denied Plaintiffs' request for sanctions and declined to award sanctions against the Defendant, finding that the Plaintiffs acted with substantial justification in presenting their position.
