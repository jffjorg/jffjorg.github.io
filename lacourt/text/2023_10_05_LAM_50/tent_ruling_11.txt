TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:
 
MOTION FOR LEAVE
  TO FILE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
 



 
 
 
Background
On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff Melinda Marie Cruz (“Plaintiff”) filed
this action against Reblando LLC, asserting causes of action for (1) failure to
produce personnel documents and records, and (2) failure to produce payroll
documents and records. 
Plaintiff now moves for leave to file a first amended complaint. The
motion is unopposed. 
Discussion
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
 section 473(a)(1), “[t]he court
may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a
party to amend any pleading.”
Amendment may be allowed at any time before or after commencement of trial. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 576.)  “[T]he court’s
discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit amendment of the
pleadings. The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it is a rare case in
which denial of leave to amend can be justified.”
(Howard
v. County of San Diego (2010) 184
Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428 [internal citations omitted].) “If the motion
to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the
opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend….”   (Morgan v.
Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in
trial, loss of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit v. Tokai Bank (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.)
A motion to amend a pleading before
trial must include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which
must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or
amendments. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd.
(a).) The motion must also state what
allegations are proposed to be deleted or added, by page, paragraph, and line number. (Ibid.) Finally, “[a] separate declaration must accompany the motion and must
specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2)
Why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to
the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) The reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd.
(b), emphasis added.)
Plaintiff’s counsel
attaches to her declaration a copy of the proposed First Amended Complaint. (Guzmán
Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. B.) Plaintiff provides a redline comparison of the proposed First Amended Complaint compared to the
original Complaint. (Ibid.) 
The proposed First
Amended Complaint shows that Plaintiff seeks to amend the Complaint to add
additional causes of action for (1) hostile work environment, (2) failure to
take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment, discrimination and
retaliation, (3) retaliation in violation of Labor Code
section 1102.5(b), (4) wrongful termination in violation of public policy,
(5) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (6) failure to pay overtime,
(7) failure to provide rest periods, (8) failure to provide meal periods, (9)
failure to pay earned wages, (10) failure to furnish compliant wage statements,
(11) waiting time penalties, (12) unfair/unlawful/fraudulent business
practices, and (13) civil penalties under the Private Attorneys General Act. (Guzmán
Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. B.) The proposed First Amended Complaint also adds a number of
factual allegations. (Ibid.) 
However, Plaintiff’s
counsel’s declaration in support of the motion does not discuss “[t]he effect of the amendment,” “[w]hy
the amendment is necessary and proper,” “[w]hen the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered,” and “[t]he reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd.
(b).) As set forth above, the requirements of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivision (b) are mandatory. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion is denied without
prejudice.   
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
