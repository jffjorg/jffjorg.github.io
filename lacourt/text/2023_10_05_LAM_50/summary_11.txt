And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Rolf M. Treu has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by plaintiff Melinda Marie Cruz to file a first amended complaint. The motion is unopposed, but the judge has denied it without prejudice. The proposed amended complaint adds new causes of action to the original complaint, including hostile work environment, failure to take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment, and wrongful termination in violation of public policy. However, the judge has denied the motion because the declaration in support of the motion failed to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivision (b), which requires the declaration to specify the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
