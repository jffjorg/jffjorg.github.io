Despite significant efforts to search for the file, it was only found in a subdirectory of a closed case. The court finds that the plaintiff's motion is timely and that the failure to appear was due to counsel's inadvertence and error. As a result, the court grants mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) and sets aside the dismissal. The court also orders the plaintiff's attorney to pay $250 to the State Bar Client Security Fund.

## English Summary:

The judge granted the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of their case. The judge found that the Plaintiff's attorney's failure to appear for the trial was due to inadvertence and error in managing the case. The attorney had misplaced the case file, which led to the missed hearing.  

The judge noted that this case falls under a mandatory relief provision of California law, requiring the dismissal to be set aside.  Because the Defendant was not present, no fees were awarded to them. However, the judge did order the Plaintiff's attorney to pay $250 to the State Bar Client Security Fund for their error.  

The judge scheduled future hearings for service of process on the Defendant and a trial setting conference.
