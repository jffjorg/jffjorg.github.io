```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff's counsel, Alexander E. Gilburg, inadvertently misplaced the digital case file, which resulted in the failure to appear at the non-jury trial on July 27, 2022. Despite significant efforts to search for the file, it was only found in a subdirectory of a closed case. The court finds that the plaintiff's motion is timely and that the failure to appear was due to counsel's inadvertence and error. As a result, the court grants mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) and sets aside the dismissal. The court also orders the plaintiff's attorney to pay $250 to the State Bar Client Security Fund.
