 Case Number:  22STCV16408    Hearing Date:   September 27, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE


The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion and continues the trial
date.
 
Legal Standard
 
A motion for summary judgment must be heard no later than
30 days before the date of trial, unless the court for good cause considers
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(a)(3).) A court may not refuse to hear a
summary judgment motion filed within the time limits of Code Civ. Proc. § 437c.
(Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918, 919.) 
 
Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the court has
the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice. The power to determine when a continuance should be
granted is within the discretion of the trial court. (Color-Vue, Inc. v.
Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) A trial court has wide latitude
in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of
continuances. (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  Nonetheless, a court “may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Super. Ct. (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Super. Ct.
(2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)  
 
Each request for a continuance must be considered on its
own merits according to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c). The
court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause
requiring the continuance.  (Cal. Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1332(c).) California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets
forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be analyzed when determining whether
good cause for a trial continuance is present. A court considers factors such
as: (1) the proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party; (3) the
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;
(4) the length of the continuance requested; (5) the court’s calendar and the
impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; (6) whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; and (7) any other fact or
circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).) 
 
 
Discussion
 
In support
of the motion, Defendant’s counsel, Christopher Mosier (“Mosier”) declares
that: (1) Defendant timely filed and e-served his MSJ on July 28, 2023 with an
April 5, 2024 hearing date which falls after the current trial date (Mosier
Decl., ¶ 2 and Exhibit A); (2) the April 5, 2024 MSJ hearing date was the first
available hearing date on the Court’s reservation website on July 10, 2023 (Id.,
¶ 3); (3) Plaintiff’s complaint was filed on May 17, 2022 and Defendant
answered on July 12, 2022 (Id., ¶ 4); (4) Defendant has been diligently
conducting discovery and there have been no prior trial continuances (Id.);
(5) given that liability remains hotly contested, Defendant will be severely
prejudiced if forced to expend additional time and money, engage experts for
expert discovery, and proceed to trial on November 14, 2023 without having his
timely filed MSJ heard (Id., ¶ 5); and (6) he believes good cause exists
to continue the trial for at least a period of six months (Id., ¶ 6). 
 
Here, the
Court finds that Defendant has made a showing of good cause. Mosier has
indicated that Defendant’s motion for summary judgment was timely filed but,
due to the Court’s calendar, the earliest hearing date available was after the
current trial date.  Counsel for
Defendant has stated that discovery is continuing and that proceeding to trial
on the current trial date would prejudice Defendant. Given the Court’s
substantial calendar, the Court finds it appropriate to continue the trial date
in this action.  Exercising its
discretion under Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens, supra, 49
Cal.App.3d 12, 18, and following the directive of cases such as Sentry Insurance, supra, 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529, the Court elects to continue trial in
this matter.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion and
continues the current trial date of November 14, 2023 to mid September
2024.  Final Status Conference and all deadlines
are reset based on the new trial date.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
