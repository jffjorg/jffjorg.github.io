Summary:

The judge has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by Public Storage and Public Storage Pickup and Delivery, Inc.

The plaintiff had filed a complaint alleging that he tripped and fell on a raised portion of the sidewalk on two occasions, and that the PS Defendants were responsible for maintaining the sidewalk in a safe condition. The PS Defendants argued that they did not own or control the sidewalk and therefore had no duty to maintain it. The judge found that the evidence showed that the PS Defendants did not create the hazard and did not exercise dominion and control over the public property, and that the unsafe condition caused by the tree was attributable to the City of Los Angeles, not to the PS Defendants.
