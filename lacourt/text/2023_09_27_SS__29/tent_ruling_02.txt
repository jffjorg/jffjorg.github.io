 Case Number:  20STCV27370    Hearing Date:   September 27, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
The motion is denied without prejudice.
 
Background
 
On July 21, 2020, Plaintiff Irma Susana
Hernandez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Jeannie Acdan,
Dennis Malabanan, Alexus Malabanan, and Rita Flora Matillano (“Defendants”) for
damages arising from a motor vehicle accident. 
 
On August 17, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
Daniel F. Jimenez filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
The court may order that an attorney
be changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted
to withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it
unreasonable to continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof.
Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion
to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be
served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the
case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay
effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy
of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
On August 17, 2023, the Court denied the motion without prejudice finding
that counsel had not lodged MC-053 form with the Court and had not provided
proof of service reflecting that the notice of motion, motion, declaration, and
proposed order had been served on the client and all of the other parties who
appeared in the case. 
 
Counsel has now filed the requisite forms pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362,
including MC-053. The basis for the motion is a breakdown of communication.
This is a valid reason for withdrawal. (See Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16.) 
 
Although these documents were filed with the Court on August 17, 2023,
however, Plaintiff was not served until September 23 – just four calendar days
before the hearing.  That is not
sufficient notice for a motion.  (The
Court also notes the Defendants were served on August 22.)  
 
Consequently, the Court must deny the motion, without prejudice, for
failure to comply with the service requirements. 
 
Additionally, the Court notes that Jury Trial is scheduled for September
27, 2023. As such, the Court is concerned about whether Plaintiff will suffer unfair
prejudice as a result of the relief requested.  
 
Conclusion
 
The motion to
be relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.  
 
Moving party to give notice.
