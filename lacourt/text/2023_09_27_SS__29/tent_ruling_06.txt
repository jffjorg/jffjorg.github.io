 Case Number:  21STCV33629    Hearing Date:   September 27, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE   The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion in part and continues  the trial date.    Legal Standard   Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the court has  the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make them  conform to law and justice. The power to determine when a continuance should be  granted is within the discretion of the trial court. (Color-Vue, Inc. v.  Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) A trial court has wide latitude  in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of  continuances. (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)     Each request for a continuance must be considered on its  own merits according to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c). The  court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause  requiring the continuance.  (Cal. Rules  of Court, Rule 3.1332(c).) California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets  forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be analyzed when determining whether  good cause for a trial continuance is present. A court considers factors such  as: (1) the proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous  continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party; (3) the  prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;  and (4) any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of  the motion or application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).)      Discussion   In support  of the motion, Defendant’s counsel, Danielle D. Mittskus (“Mittskus”) declares  that: (1) her office reserved a hearing date of June 13, 2023 for Defendant’s  Motions to Compel, which was the first available hearing date at the time of  reservation (Mittskus Decl., ¶ 3); (2) Defendant’s Motions to Compel were mail  and electronically served on August 1, 2023 (Id.); (3) as of the date of  filing and service of this motion, Plaintiff has not served any responses to  the propounded discovery (Id., ¶ 4); (4) the discovery Defendant seeks  is reasonably necessary to Defendant to prepare for trial (Id.); and (5)  Plaintiff’s refusal to provide any responses to the propounded discovery has  and will unreasonably hamper Defendant’s ability to prepare for trial (Id.).     Mittskus  further declares that: (1) trial of this matter is currently scheduled for  December 11, 2023 (Mittskus Decl., ¶ 5); (2) the hearing on Defendant’s Motions  to Compel, scheduled on June 13, 2024, is approximately six months after the  current trial date (Id.); and (3) should the Court’s impacted calendar  not allow for Defendant’s Motions to Compel to be heard prior to the December  11, 2023 trial date, Defendant requests that the trial of this matter be  continued to September 2024 to allow for completion of discovery (Id., ¶  6).   Plaintiff  has not filed any opposition to this motion.   Accordingly, it does not appear that Plaintiff would suffer any unfair  prejudice if the requested relief were granted.,   Here, the  Court finds that Defendant has made a showing of good cause. Mittskus has  indicated that the discovery that has been requested from Plaintiff is  necessary for trial preparation.  Given  the Court’s substantial calendar, the Court finds it appropriate to continue  the trial date in this action.   Exercising its discretion under Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens,  supra, 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18, the Court elects to continue trial  in this matter. Conclusion The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion and  continues the current trial date of December 11, 2023 to mid September  2024.  Final Status Conference and all  discovery deadlines are reset based on the new trial date. Final Status Conference is continued to 09/04/2024 at 10:00 AM in Department 29 at Spring 
Street Courthouse. Non-Jury Trial is continued to 09/16/2024 at 08:30 AM in Department 29 at 
Spring Street Courthouse.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.
