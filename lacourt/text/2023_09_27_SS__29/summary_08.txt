And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to continue the trial date. The Defendant's motion for summary judgment was timely filed, but the earliest hearing date available was after the current trial date. The Judge considered the Defendant's declaration and found that the Defendant has made a showing of good cause for a continuance. The Judge has exercised its discretion to continue the trial date, taking into account the Court's substantial calendar and the potential prejudice to the Defendant if forced to proceed to trial without having its motion heard. The trial date is continued to mid-September 2024.
