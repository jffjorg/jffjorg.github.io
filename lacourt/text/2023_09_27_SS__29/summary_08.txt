## English Summary:

The judge has granted the Defendant's motion to continue the trial date. 

The Defendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ) which, due to the court's calendar, could not be heard before the original trial date of November 14, 2023.

The judge finds that the defendant has shown good cause for a continuance, as the earliest hearing date available was after the current trial date, and proceeding to trial on the current date would prejudice the defendant. The judge also notes that the court's calendar is substantial, making it appropriate to continue the trial date. The final status conference and deadlines are reset based on the new trial date, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
