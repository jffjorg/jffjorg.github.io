And here is a summary in English text:

The tentatively ruling Judge denies the County's motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for Admission (Set Two) because the plaintiff has now served responses that are substantially in compliance with the Civil Procedure Code. The Judge grants the County's motion to compel initial responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Two) because the plaintiff has not served a response. The Judge also grants the County's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $720, which is calculated as two hours of attorney time per motion multiplied by counsel's billing rate of $180 per hour. The Judge orders the plaintiff and his counsel to pay the sanctions within 30 days of notice of the order.
