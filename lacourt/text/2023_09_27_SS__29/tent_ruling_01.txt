The Court DENIES County’s motion to deem admitted the
truth of the matters specified in the Requests for Admission (Set Two).  
The
Court GRANTS County’s motion to compel initial responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set Two).  
The Court GRANTS in part County’s request for monetary
sanctions.  Plaintiff and his
 
Background  
Plaintiff
Juan Ramon Valdez (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on November 14, 2018, he was
struck by a moving train, causing him to sustain severe and permanent injuries.  On
September 5, 2019, Plaintiff filed a complaint against
Defendants City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, State of California, Union Pacific
Railroad, and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for negligence,
premises liability, and dangerous condition of public property. 
Between
October 24 and November 6, 2019, Defendants City of Los Angeles, County of Los
Angeles, The People of the State of California (erroneously sued as State of
California), and Union Pacific Railroad Company filed answers to the complaint.
On July
23, 2020, by stipulation, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
against the same defendants.  In July and
August 2020, Plaintiff dismissed his claims, with prejudice, against Defendants
City of Los Angeles, The People of the State of California, and Los Angeles
County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
On August
20 and 24, 2020, Defendants County of Los Angeles (“County”) and Union Pacific
Railroad filed answers to the FAC.
On
August 2, 2022, County served Requests for Admission (Set Two) and Special
Interrogatories (Set Two) on Plaintiff. 
(Ekpezu Decls., ¶ 4 & Exhs. A.) 
As of the date of the filing of this motion, Plaintiff had not
responded.  (Id., ¶ 7.)
On August 25, 2023, County filed: (1) a motion for an order deeming
admitted the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admissions (Set Two);
and (2) a motion to compel  responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set Two).  In both
motions, County also requests sanctions.
 
On September 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed what is described as a “non-opposition”
to County’s motion relating to the Requests for Admission.  Plaintiff attached a copy of a verified
response to the Requests for Admission served on September 5, 2023.  (Reyes Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. 1.)  
 
Plaintiff did not file any opposition (or non-opposition) to the County’s
motion relating to the Special Interrogatories.
 
Legal Standard 
 
A party must respond to requests for admission within
30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to
whom requests for admission are directed does not provide a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order that the truth of the matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id., § 2033.280, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts
are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall” make the order that the truth of the
matters specified in the request be deemed admitted unless the court “finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St.
Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated this motion [to deem admitted the matters contained in
the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil
Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion 
 
Request for Admissions (Set Two)
 
County served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission (Set Two) on August
2, 2022. (Ekpezu Decl. ¶ 4 & Exh. A.) 
More than a year later, and only after County had filed and served the
motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the Requests for
Admission did Plaintiff finally serve a response.  (Reyes Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. 1.) 
 
As Plaintiff has now served
responses that are substantially in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.220, the Court must DENY the motion to deem admitted the truth of
the matters specified in the Requests for Admission.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
Special
Interrogatories (Set Two)
 
County served Plaintiff with Special Interrogatories (Set Two) on August
2, 2022. (Ekpezu Decl. ¶ 4 & Exh. A.) 
It is now more than a year later, and Plaintiff has not served a
response.  (Id., ¶ 7.)  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the motion to
compel initial responses to the Special Interrogatories. 
 
Sanctions
 
The Court
also GRANTS County’s request for sanctions on both motions.  As to the Request for Admission motion, the
Court finds that Plaintiff’s failure to serve a
timely response necessitated the motion. 
As to the Special Interrogatories motion, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s
failure to respond was not substantially justified, and there is evidence
in the record to support a determination that the imposition of sanctions would
be unjust.
 
Given the
relatively straightforward nature of these motions, as well as the economies of
scale associated with filing parallel discovery motions, the Court awards
sanctions in the amount of $360 per motion, calculated as two hours of attorney
time per motion multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of $180 per hour.  (See Ekpezu Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.) 
 
Conclusion 
The Court DENIES County’s motion to deem admitted the
truth of the matters specified in the Requests for Admission (Set Two).  
The
Court GRANTS County’s motion to compel initial responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set Two).  Plaintiff is ORDERED
to provide verified, code-compliant responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Two),
without objection, within 30 days of notice of this order.
The
Court GRANTS in part County’s request for monetary sanctions.  Plaintiff and his counsel of record David Azizi,
Esq., are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to County
under the Civil Discovery Act in the total amount of $720 ($360 per motion,
multiplied by two motions) within 30 days of notice of this order.
Moving
party is ORDERED to give notice.
