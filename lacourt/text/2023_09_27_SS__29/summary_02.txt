Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was denied due to the counsel's failure to lodge the required forms (MC-053) with the Court and provide proof of service to the client and other parties. Although the counsel filed the required forms after the initial denial, the Plaintiff was not served until four days before the hearing, which is not sufficient notice for a motion. The Judge is concerned about whether the Plaintiff will suffer unfair prejudice as a result of the relief requested, particularly given the upcoming Jury Trial scheduled for September 27, 2023.

## English Summary 

The Judge issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's attorney, Daniel F. Jimenez's, motion to withdraw from the case without prejudice.  The reason for denial is that Mr. Jimenez did not properly serve the necessary legal documents to the Plaintiff and the other parties involved in the case until very close to the scheduled hearing date (just 4 days before).  

Although the Judge acknowledged that a breakdown in communication between the attorney and client is a valid reason for withdrawal, the late service of documents does not meet the court's requirements. The Judge is also concerned about the potential unfair prejudice to the Plaintiff if the attorney is allowed to withdraw so close to the scheduled Jury Trial.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Daniel F. Jimenez, to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown of communication with the client. The motion was originally denied without prejudice on August 17, 2023, due to failure to comply with service requirements. The requisite forms were subsequently filed with the court, but not served on the client and other parties until September 23, 2023, which is not sufficient notice for a motion. The judge is concerned that Plaintiff may suffer unfair prejudice as a result of the relief requested, particularly given that a jury trial is scheduled for September 27, 2023. Therefore, the motion to be relieved as counsel is denied without prejudice.

significant\_statements:
- "The motion is denied without prejudice."
- "Counsel has now filed the requisite forms pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362, including MC-053. The basis for the motion is a breakdown of communication."

- "The Court is concerned about whether Plaintiff will suffer unfair prejudice as a result of the relief requested."
- "The motion to be relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice. Moving party to give notice."

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion of plaintiff's counsel, Daniel F. Jimenez, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was denied because counsel had not lodged MC-053 form with the Court and had not provided proof of service reflecting that the notice of motion, motion, declaration, and proposed order had been served on the client and all of the other parties who appeared in the case. Although the required forms were filed with the Court on August 17, 2023, plaintiff was not served until September 23, which is not sufficient notice for a motion. The court is also concerned about whether plaintiff will suffer unfair prejudice as a result of the relief requested, as the jury trial is scheduled for September 27, 2023.
