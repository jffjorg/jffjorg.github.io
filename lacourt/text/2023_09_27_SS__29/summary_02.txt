Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was denied due to the counsel's failure to lodge the required forms (MC-053) with the Court and provide proof of service to the client and other parties. Although the counsel filed the required forms after the initial denial, the Plaintiff was not served until four days before the hearing, which is not sufficient notice for a motion. The Judge is concerned about whether the Plaintiff will suffer unfair prejudice as a result of the relief requested, particularly given the upcoming Jury Trial scheduled for September 27, 2023.
