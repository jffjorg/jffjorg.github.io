And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to attend an independent mental examination (IME). The IME will be conducted by Dr. Kyle B. Boone, Ph.D, and will consist of two parts: a history taking and observation of the plaintiff, and the administration of standard, validated psychological and neuropsychological tests. The plaintiff will have the right to record the examination by audio technology.

The defendants must provide the raw test data and testing materials to the plaintiff's counsel, subject to a protective order to maintain the confidentiality of the materials. The protective order will require the parties to maintain the security of the raw data and testing materials, and will allow the materials to be disclosed to the parties for use in the case.

The court has considered the plaintiff's arguments and has found that the defendants have shown good cause for the examination and that the plaintiff has the right to access the raw test data and testing materials. The court has also considered the relevant statutes and case law, including California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2032.310, 2032.320, 2032.530, and 2032.610, and Evidence Code section 721.

The court's decision is based on the principles of broad and mutual pre-trial disclosure, and the need to allow the plaintiff to effectively scrutinize the defendants' expert witnesses and cross-examine them on the basis of the raw test data and testing materials.
