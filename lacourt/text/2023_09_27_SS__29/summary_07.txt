And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to attend an independent mental examination (IME). The IME will be conducted by Dr. Kyle B. Boone, Ph.D, and will consist of two parts: a history taking and observation of the plaintiff, and the administration of standard, validated psychological and neuropsychological tests. The plaintiff will have the right to record the examination by audio technology.

The defendants must provide the raw test data and testing materials to the plaintiff's counsel, subject to a protective order to maintain the confidentiality of the materials. The protective order will require the parties to maintain the security of the raw data and testing materials, and will allow the materials to be disclosed to the parties for use in the case.

The court has considered the plaintiff's arguments and has found that the defendants have shown good cause for the examination and that the plaintiff has the right to access the raw test data and testing materials. The court has also considered the relevant statutes and case law, including California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2032.310, 2032.320, 2032.530, and 2032.610, and Evidence Code section 721.

The court's decision is based on the principles of broad and mutual pre-trial disclosure, and the need to allow the plaintiff to effectively scrutinize the defendants' expert witnesses and cross-examine them on the basis of the raw test data and testing materials.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff, Charlotte Vieira, to attend an independent mental examination (IME) with Dr. Kyle B. Boone, Ph.D, ABPP-ABCN.

The judge has also ordered that the raw data and testing materials from the examination be provided directly to the plaintiff's counsel, subject to a protective order.

The judge has based this decision on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Evidence Code, which provide for the disclosure of raw data and testing materials in certain circumstances. The judge has also considered the recent case of Randy's Trucking v. Superior Court (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 818, which held that a plaintiff has a right to access raw data and testing materials in order to effectively scrutinize the way the data was collected and to cross-examine the neuropsychologist on the basis and reasons for the neuropsychologist's opinion.

English summary:
The tentative ruling is granting the defendant's motion for an order compelling the plaintiff, Charlotte Vieira, to attend an independent mental examination with Kyle B. Boone, Ph.D, ABPP-ABCN. The conditions for this are that the plaintiff must be permitted to record the examination by audio technology and that the defendants must provide the plaintiff's counsel with the raw test data and testing materials. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants, City of Los Angeles, Erasmo Hernandez, Rosa Hernandez, and EC & RC Hernandez Trust on February 22, 2022, alleging that she sustained injuries after falling on a cracked, uneven, and degraded sidewalk. The defendants filed a motion for an order compelling the plaintiff to attend an independent mental examination on March 30, 2023. The plaintiff filed an opposition on September 13, stating that she does not object to the examination itself but seeks an order that will allow her to record the examination by audiotape, that will require the defendant's examiner to produce the raw test data to her counsel, and that will identify the specific tests to be administered. The defendants filed a reply on September 20. The court has discretion to consider it despite it being filed one day late due to an intervening court holiday on September 22. The court will grant the motion for good cause if the party produces specific facts justifying discovery and that the inquiry is relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. A mental examination is appropriate only when a plaintiff alleges continuing emotional distress or mental injury and so places his or her mental or emotional condition “in controversy” in the action. The court order must specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will perform the examination. An order granting a physical or mental examination shall specify the person or persons who may perform the examination, as well as the time, place, manner, diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination. A plaintiff submitting to a mental examination has the right to demand that the defendant deliver to the plaintiff a “copy of a detailed written report setting out the history, examinations, findings, including the results of all tests made, diagnoses, prognoses, and conclusions of the examination.”
