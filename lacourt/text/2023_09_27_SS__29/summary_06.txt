And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Defendant's motion for continuance in part, continuing the current trial date of December 11, 2023 to mid-September 2024. The Court found that the Defendant has shown good cause for the continuance, as the discovery requested from the Plaintiff is necessary for trial preparation and the Plaintiff has not provided any responses to the propounded discovery. The Court also considered the proximity of the trial date, whether there was any previous continuance, extensions of time, or delays, and the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance.
