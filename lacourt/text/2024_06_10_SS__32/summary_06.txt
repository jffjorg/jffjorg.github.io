Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants in part Plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena. The court denies the request for a blanket protective order. The court orders the parties to meet and confer. The court modifies the subpoena by striking "7. Any other documents pertaining in any way to the individual identified above." The court finds that the subpoena does not violate Plaintiff's privacy and that the information sought is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The court also finds that the defendant has not shown a compelling interest or need to justify the subpoena.
