English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to reclassify the case as limited jurisdiction. The court finds that the defendant has not shown that the plaintiff cannot recover at least $35,000 in damages. The plaintiff has alleged future medical expenses and general damages, which the defendant has not adequately addressed. The defendant's motion was also brought after the time to file the initial pleading, and the defendant has not shown good cause for not seeking reclassification sooner.
