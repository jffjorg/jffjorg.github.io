Motion
  to Appoint Decedent’s Successor in Interest




MOVING PARTIES

  Edward Casillas 




OPPOSING PARTY


None



 
MOTIONS
 
Plaintiff Edward Casillas (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure Section 377.31, appointing Theresa Casillas,
Plaintiff’s mother, in her capacity as successor in interest to the deceased
Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff originally filed this as an ex parte application. However,
the Court on its own, set this matter as a motion. (Min. Order, 6/5/24.) No
opposition has been filed. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
California Code of Civil Procedure
section 377.31 provides that the decedent’s personal representative or, if
none, the decedent’s successor in interest may continue a decedent’s pending
action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.30; see Adams v. Superior Court (2011)
196 Cal.App.4th 71, 78-79.) A successor in interest is the beneficiary of the
decedent’s estate or other successor in interest who succeeds to a cause of
action or to a particular item of the property that is the subject of the cause
of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.11.) Section 377.33 provides that the court
in which an action is continued may make any order concerning parties that is
appropriate to ensure proper administration of justice, including the
appointment of the decedent’s successor in interest as a special administrator
or guardian ad litem.  
 
Section 377.32 provides that a
person who seeks to commence such an action as the decedent’s successor in
interest must file an affidavit or declaration providing certain information,
including the decedent’s name, date and place of decedent’s death, and
statements regarding whether the estate has been administered and that the
affiant or declarant is the successor in interest on decedent’s claim. (Id.,
§ 377.32(a).) A certified copy of the decedent’s death certificate must also be
attached to the affidavit or declaration. (Id., § 377.32(c).)
 
            Plaintiff filed the complaint on
December 11, 2023. Plaintiff passed away on January 8, 2024. A certified copy
of Plaintiff’s death certificate has been attached. (Casillas Decl. ¶ 4–5, Exh.
1.) The Court finds that Theresa Casillas has filed a declaration, under
penalty of perjury, that she is Plaintiff’s successor in interest to
Plaintiff’s interest in this action. Therefore, the motion to substitute is
granted. 
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants the motion to appoint Theresa Casillas as
successor in interest to Edward Casillas, deceased. 
 
Moving Party shall give notice of the Court’s order, and file a proof
of service of such.

MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Quash Service of Summons




MOVING PARTY:


Specially Appearing Defendant Globe Life
  Insurance Agency, Inc.




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On December 11, 2023, Plaintiff Edward Casillas (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Joseph Sandoval, Globe Life Insurance Agency,
Inc., Globe Life Liberty National Division, Liberty National Life Insurance
Company, and Does 1 to 100 for negligence surrounding a motor vehicle accident.

 
Specially Appearing Defendant Globe Life Insurance Agency, Inc. (“Defendant”)
now moves to quash service of the summons under Code of Civil Procedure section
418.10, arguing the Court lacks jurisdiction. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“A defendant . .
. may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following
purposes:¿ (1) To quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him
or her. . . .”¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).)¿“[C]ompliance with the
statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal
jurisdiction. [Citation.]”¿(Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24
Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.)¿“[T]he filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that
the service was proper” but only if it “complies with the statutory
requirements regarding such proofs.”¿(Id. at 1441-1442.)¿When a defendant
moves to quash service of the summons and complaint, the plaintiff has “the
burden of proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that is the
facts requisite to an effective service.”¿(Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245
Cal.App.2d 866, 868.)¿ 
 
California’s long-arm statute
authorizes California courts to exercise jurisdiction on any basis not
inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of
California.¿(Code Civ. Proc., section 410.10.) Accordingly,
a California court’s assertion of personal jurisdiction over a non-resident
defendant who has not been served with process within the State comports with
the requirements of the due process clause of the United States Constitution if
the defendant has such minimum contacts with the State that the assertion of
jurisdiction does not violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial
justice. (Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 444-45; International
Shoe Co. v. Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316.) 
 
California recognizes two ways in which the constitutional
“minimum contacts” requirement may be satisfied. General jurisdiction exists when a defendant’s contacts with
the forum state are so systematic and so continuous as to make it consistent
with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice to subject the
defendant to the jurisdiction of the forum, even if the cause of action is
unrelated to the contacts.¿(Vons, supra, 14 Cal.4th at 445-46; International
Shoe Co. v. Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310; Worldwide Volkswagen Corp.
v. Woodson (1980) 444 U.S. 286, 291.)  
 
The relevant period for determining the existence of
minimum contacts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction is that which existed
when the cause of action arose. (Boaz v. Byle & Co. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th
700, 717.) “For an individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of general
jurisdiction is the individual’s domicile.” (Daimler AG v. Bauman (2014)
571 U.S. 117, 137.) A domicile is the place where one resides with the intent
to remain indefinitely. (DeYoung v. DeYoung (1946) 27 Cal.3d 521, 524.)
Due to the intent requirement, a person may only have one domicile at a time. (Marriage
of Tucker (1991) 226 Cal.App.2d 1249, 1258.) 
 
A nonresident
may be subject to specific jurisdiction if: (1) the nonresident has
purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protections of the state’s
laws; (2) the controversy arises out of the nonresident’s contacts with the
state; and (3) it would be fair and just to assert jurisdiction. (Burger
King Corp. v. Rudzewicz (1985) 471 U.S. 462, 472; Pavlovich v. Superior
Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 262, 268.) 
 
A court may consider factors including: 
 
1.      The extent to which the lawsuit relates to defendant’s
activities or contacts with California 
2.      The availability of evidence and the location of witnesses 
3.      The availability of an alternative forum in which the claim
could be litigated  
4.      The relative costs and burdens to the litigants of bringing
or defending the action 
5.      State policy in providing a forum for this particular
litigation 
 
Where personal jurisdiction is challenged, “the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that
all necessary jurisdictional criteria are met. (Thomas J. Palmer, Inc. v. Turkiye Is
Bankasi A.S., 105 Cal.App.3d 135, 148.) The burden is established by
competent evidence in affidavits and authenticated documentary evidence.” (Ziller
Electronics Lab Gmbh v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222,
1232-1233; Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426,
1439–1440.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant argues it is a Texas corporation with its principal place of
business in Texas. (Zorn Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant argues it does not maintain any
employees or offices in California, does not own or lease any vehicles in
California, and does not contract with individual sales agents who reside in
California. (Id. ¶ 2–5.) 
 
Because Defendant challenges personal jurisdiction, Plaintiff has the
burden to show the jurisdictional criteria are met. Plaintiff does not oppose
this motion and therefore has failed to meet his burden. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to quash service of the summons is
GRANTED. 
 
Specially appearing Defendants shall provide notice of the Court’s
ruling and file a proof of service of such.
