And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to relieve counsel for Plaintiff Kimberlie Harwood's Counsel, Neil Steiner. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, making it impossible for Counsel to prepare for trial. However, the Court finds that the motion lacks sufficient information and proper service of the motion to the Plaintiff. Additionally, Counsel failed to correct errors in prior motions, including incorrect information on future proceedings. Therefore, the Court denies the motion to relieve Counsel.
