And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is for a case number 21STCV46421, where Plaintiffs David L. Yen and Rosa Yen are seeking to strike Defendant Josue Valerio's answer and enter default due to his failure to comply with a discovery order. The Court finds that terminating sanctions are not appropriate at this time, as Plaintiffs have not shown that Defendant has willfully declined to participate in discovery. The Court notes that Defendant attended his deposition but failed to produce documents, and that Plaintiffs did not request lesser sanctions. As a result, the motion for terminating sanctions is denied.
