And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case and reinstate the action. The plaintiff failed to appear at a hearing for an Order to Show Cause re Failure to File Proof of Service on November 6, 2023, resulting in the dismissal of the case without prejudice. However, the plaintiff asserts that he did not receive notice of the OSC hearing because it was sent to an outdated address. The judge finds that the notice of the OSC hearing was indeed sent to an outdated address and returned to the court as undeliverable, and that the lack of notice deprived the plaintiff of the opportunity to address the OSC and file the proof of service. The judge notes that the plaintiff has demonstrated diligence in seeking relief by filing multiple motions to vacate the dismissal order and that reinstating the case would not prejudice the defendant. The judge orders the plaintiff to serve the summons and complaint on the defendant once again and to serve notice of this order, and sets an Order to Show Cause re: Failure to File Proof of Service for March 26, 2025.
