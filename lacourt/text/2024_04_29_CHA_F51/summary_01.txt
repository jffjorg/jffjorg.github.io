And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted in part the motion for terminating and monetary sanctions filed by Plaintiff Marlene Moretti against Defendants Ruben Romero and Del Sur Corporation dba Camino Real Mortgage Bankers. The Court has imposed monetary sanctions against Defendants in the amount of $900.00. The Court finds that Defendant Ruben Romero engaged in the misuse of the discovery process by deleting relevant company emails without notice to Plaintiff. The Court also finds that Defendants failed to comply with the electronic filing requirements. The Court declines to issue terminating sanctions against Defendants due to their misconduct. The Court notes that Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the total amount of $4,560.00 is excessive and reduces the amount to $900.00.
