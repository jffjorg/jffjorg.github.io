ANALYSIS
Discussion
Motion To Compel Further Responses Special
Interrogatories, Set One
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to special interrogatories, set one, and requests sanctions.
(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party
may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party
deems that any of the following apply:
 
(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
 
(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate.
 
(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.
 
(b)
 
(1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
 
(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under the California
Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a concise
outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.
 
(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response,
or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the interrogatories.
 
(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.
 
(e) If a party then fails to obey an order compelling further response
to interrogatories, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of, or in
addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).

     (Code
Civ. Proc § 2030.300 [bold emphasis added].)
            Here, it
appears that Defendant did not serve verified responses. (Motion, Exh. B.) Because
verifications were not served at the time this motion was filed (Weidmann
Decl., ¶ 10), the 45-day time limit did not begin to run, as that time limit
only begins to run upon service of a verified responses or supplemental
verified response.  (Civ. Proc. Code, §
2030.300(c).)  To harmonize the fact that
objections need not be verified (Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 657 – 58) with § 2030.300(c),
the timely service of unverified responses containing
objections preserves the objections only, but does not trigger the 45-day limit
in which to bring a motion to compel further responses.  As such, this motion is timely, but the
objections served in the timely responses have not been waived. 
            However, the
Declaration of Tro Krikorian does not reflect any meet and confer effort as
required by Civ. Proc. Code, § 2030.300(b)(1).
            Nor is the
motion accompanied by a separate statement, nor a Court-permitted concise outline of the discovery request and
each response in dispute. (Civ. Proc. Code, § 2030.300(b)(2).)
            As
such, Plaintiff has not met the requirements of Civ. Proc. Code, § 2030.300.
            The
motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, set one and
request for sanctions is DENIED.
