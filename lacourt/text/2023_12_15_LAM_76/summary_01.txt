And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, set one, and request for sanctions filed by Plaintiff Berj Parseghian. The motion was filed due to the Defendant's failure to serve verified responses, but the Plaintiff did not meet the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, which includes filing a meet and confer declaration and a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. The Court does not desire oral argument on the motion and the parties must contact the staff in Department 76 to inform the Court whether they wish to submit on the tentative or argue the matter. If no notice of intention to appear is given, the Court may adopt the tentative ruling as the final ruling.
