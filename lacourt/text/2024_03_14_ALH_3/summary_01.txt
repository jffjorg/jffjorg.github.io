And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel further responses from the defendant, Mazda Motor of America, Inc., regarding a request for production of documents. The plaintiffs, Yesenia Loera Casas and Oscar Casas, are seeking sanctions in the amount of $5,597.50 against the defendant and its counsel for failing to provide adequate responses. The defendant argued that the motion is moot because it has already provided further responses, and that the plaintiffs' complaints about the scope of the protective order are unfounded. The judge denies the motion, finding that the defendant's supplemental responses are Code-compliant and that the plaintiffs did not sufficiently meet and confer in good faith. The judge also denies both parties' requests for sanctions.
