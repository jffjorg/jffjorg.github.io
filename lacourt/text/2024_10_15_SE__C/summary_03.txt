And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Leslie M. Lopez's tentative ruling continues the hearing on Plaintiffs Lesile M. Lopez and Francisco Lopez's Motions to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production, Set Two, to January 28, 2025. The Plaintiffs are suing American Honda Motor Co., Inc. under the California Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, alleging that the Defendant failed to repair or repurchase their 2020 Honda Passport, which contained or developed numerous defects during the warranty period. The Plaintiffs served their second set of Requests for Production of Documents in October 2023 and received verified responses from the Defendant in December 2023, but the Plaintiffs contend that the responses are insufficient. The Court has ordered the parties to make further efforts to resolve their discovery disputes, including meeting and conferring, and has given them instructions on how to proceed. If the parties are unable to resolve their disputes, they will be required to submit a joint statement outlining the remaining disputed issues and will have the opportunity to argue the merits of their claims at the continued hearing.
