And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a breach of contract case between Kendra Olivera and Evelyn Castillo. Olivera claims that Castillo failed to deliver tickets to Disneyland, Oogie Boogie, and Knotts Scary Farm, worth $27,861.00, and is seeking to recover the remaining balance of $25,291.40. Castillo claims an exemption for the insurance settlement she received from a car accident, which she argues is necessary to support herself and her two daughters. The court finds that the insurance settlement is exempt to the extent necessary to support Castillo's dependents, and that Castillo must pay the remaining judgment of $24,291.40.
