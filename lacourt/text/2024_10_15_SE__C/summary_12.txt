```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel arbitration and/or stay proceedings filed by Defendant Marat Dreicer. The motion was based on a provision in the purchase agreement that requires any disputes arising from the sale of the home to be decided by neutral, binding arbitration. However, the judge found that Defendant Marat Dreicer is not a signatory to the purchase agreement and therefore has no entitlement to enforce the arbitration agreement. The judge also noted that the parties to the purchase agreement (Defendants 1800 Dorothea Lane, LLC and Uzi Levy) have not stipulated to or moved to compel arbitration. As a result, the court has no grounds to stay the action and the motion is denied.
