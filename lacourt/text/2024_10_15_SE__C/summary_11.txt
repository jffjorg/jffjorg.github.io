And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the distribution of surplus funds from a trustee's sale. The surplus funds, amounting to $318,642.89, were generated from the sale of a real property located at 2512 Deerford Street, Lakewood, CA. The Trustee, Quality Loan Service Corp., claimed fees and expenses in the amount of $3419.86, and the Court approved the Petition and ordered discharge of the Trustee upon depositing the sum of $315,223.03 with the Clerk.

The United States of America, on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service, filed a claim for surplus funds based on a federal tax debt owed by Samuel Sanchez, the former owner of the property. The Court finds that the claim is timely and the Internal Revenue Service is entitled to surplus funds in the amount of $49,922.00.

Samuel Sanchez, as the owner of the property prior to foreclosure, is entitled to the remaining surplus funds in the amount of $265,301.03. The Clerk is ordered to distribute the surplus funds according to the Court's order, and each claimant must file a proposed order stating their name and address and the amount to be distributed.
