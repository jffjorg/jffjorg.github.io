Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff
Christian Delgado’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED in part. The Court
awards attorneys’ fees in the amount of $47,589.00, and costs in the amount of
$4,969.84 for a total of $52,558.84.   
Plaintiff
to give notice. 
 
Background 
On September 1, 2022, Plaintiff Christian Delgado
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Ford Motor Company
(“Defendant”) alleging breach of express and implied warranty obligations under
the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act arising out of Plaintiff’s purchase of a
2018 Ford Mustang. 
On October 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement
of Entire Case.  As the prevailing party,
Plaintiff moves for an award of attorneys’ fees in the amount of $50,249.00 and
costs and expenses in the amount of $4,969.84, for a total award of fees and
costs in the amount of $55,218.84.  
Legal Standard 
Pursuant to Civil Code section 1794(d), “[i]f the buyer
prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the
court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of
costs and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” 
The statute requires the trial court to make an initial
determination of the actual time expended; and then to ascertain whether under
all the circumstances of the case the amount of actual time expended and the
monetary charge being made for the time expended are reasonable. These
circumstances may include, but are not limited to, factors such as the
complexity of the case and procedural demands, the skill exhibited and the
results achieved. If the time expended or the monetary charge being made for the
time expended are not reasonable under all the circumstances, then the court
must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount. A
prevailing buyer has the burden of ‘showing that the fees incurred were
“allowable,” were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation,” and
were “reasonable in amount.” (Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC
(2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 462, 470.) However, “[t]he lodestar method is applicable
to calculating attorney fees under section 1794, subdivision (d).” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 997.) The Court cannot
tie the attorney fee award to the amount of plaintiff’s recovery. (Warren v.
Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 37 (“it is inappropriate
and an abuse of a trial court's discretion to tie an attorney fee award to the
amount of the prevailing buyer/plaintiff's damages or recovery in a
Song-Beverly Act action.”).)  
“The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the
discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such
factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved.  The
court may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary
or duplicative work.”  (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th
443, 448.) “The basis for the trial court's calculation must be the actual
hours counsel has devoted to the case, less those that result from inefficient
or duplicative use of time.” (Horsford v. Board Of Trustees Of California
State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395.)  
“The law is clear . . . that an award of attorney fees may
be based on counsel's declarations, without production of detailed time
records. (Raining Data Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363,
1375.)  “In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours
of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the
specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the
evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or
unrelated do not suffice.” (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) 
Discussion
Pursuant to the Offer to Compromise signed by Plaintiff on
October 10, 2023, Defendant agreed (1) to pay Plaintiff $15,000 cash with
Plaintiff retaining possession of his vehicle (2) that Plaintiff is the
prevailing party, (3) and that the attorneys' fees and costs incurred by
Plaintiff would be resolved informally or decided by this Court under The
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. (Barry Decl., ¶22; Ex. 5.) 
Hourly Rates
Plaintiff
seeks recovery for work performed by six different attorneys handling this
action: 
 
1.    David
Barry, attorney practicing for 23 years with an hourly rate of $625.00. (Barry
Decl., ¶¶32-33.) 
1.   
Elizabeth Quinn,
attorney practicing for 23 years with an hourly rate of $550.00. (Quinn Decl.,
¶¶1, 11.) 
2.   
Anna Galaviz, attorney
practicing for 6 years with an hourly rate of $475.00. (Galaviz Decl., ¶¶6, 7.)

3.    Otis
Hayes, III, attorney practicing for 8 years with an hourly rate of $350.00.
(Hayes Decl., ¶¶4, 5.) 
4.   
Logan Pascal, attorney
practicing law for 5 years with an hourly rate of $350.00. (Pascal Decl., ¶¶4,
5.) 
5.   
Richard Lara, attorney
practicing law for 1 year with an hourly rate of $285.00. (Lara Decl., ¶¶4, 6.)

 
“The reasonable hourly rate is
that prevailing in the community for similar work.”  (PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The experienced trial judge is the
best judge of the value of professional services rendered in [her] court.” (Ibid.)
Plaintiff’s counsel provide evidence that their rates have been previously
approved in other cases in the Los Angeles Superior Court. [R]ate
determinations in other cases, particularly those setting a rate for the
plaintiffs' attorney, are satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market rate.”
(Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972,
1009.)   
In opposition, Defendant
broadly challenges the attorneys’ hourly rates arguing that the matter is not complex,
it did not go to trial, and much of the work was routine, unnecessary, and
could have been handled by an individual at a lower billing rate. 
The Court finds the hourly rates as claimed in
the attorney declarations are reasonable based upon the experience of counsel
and the Los Angeles legal market.   
However, for Anna Galaviz and
Otis Hayes, III, there is a discrepancy between the hourly rates as stated in
their declarations, and the hourly rates as stated in the Motion for Attorneys’
Fees and Costs.  Whereas Galaviz declares
that her hourly rate is $475.00, the motion states that her hourly rate is
$515.00. (Motion, p. 11.) Hayes declares that his hourly rate is $350.00 per
hour, but the motion states that his hourly rate is $450.00. (Ibid.) In
calculating the attorney fee award, the Court will use the hourly rates as stated
in the declarations of counsel.  
Hours Expended
Plaintiff provides declarations from counsel and billing
records to support the fees claimed. (Barry Decl., ¶29, Ex. 6.) Plaintiff seeks
recovery for 101.3 hours of attorney time as follows:  
·       
11.6 hours by Barry; 

21.2
     hours by Quinn; 


45.0
     hours by Galaviz; 


1.6
     hours by Hayes; 


18.5
     hours by Pascal; and  


3.4
     hours by Lara. 

In opposition, Defendant contends that hourly fees should
be lower for three reasons: (1) Plaintiff’s attorneys billed an unreasonable
amount of time for “telephonic conferences” with Plaintiff; (2) Plaintiff’s
attorneys billed an exorbitant amount of time for unnecessary review of
Plaintiff’s files; (3) David Barry, the name partner of the firm, billed for
work that should have been performed by a paralegal or junior associate.
“In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice.” (Premier, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at 564.) 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s attorneys
billed an unreasonable amount of time for “telephonic conferences” with
Plaintiff.  Defendant does not point to
specific entries it believes are objectionable. 
The Court finds that these communications
with the client are within the statutory mandate of providing recovery for fees
“in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civil
Code section 1794(d).) 
Defendant
also argues that Plaintiff’s firm overstaffed the case with six attorneys.   Again, Defendant does not point to specific
entries it believes are objectionable. 
In any event, the Court
finds that most of the work was performed by only four attorneys, and each of
these attorneys performed substantive work. 
Finally,
the Court turns its attention to the claim that David Barry billed time for
work that should have been performed by a paralegal or junior associate.
Defendant contends that Barry
reviewed repair orders, drafted Plaintiff’s Representation Agreement,
standardized Summons and Complaints, Plaintiff’s Notice of Posting Jury Fees,
Preservation of Evidence Letter, Consumer Legal Remedies Act Letter, multiple
Case Management Conference Statements, and the “Memorandum of Costs.”  In making these claims, Defendant does not
cite to the specific entries at issue. 
In any event, upon reviewing the entries, the Court finds that
relatively short amounts of time were spent on these tasks.  As such, they do not appear to be
excessive.  
Plaintiff
seeks attorney’s fees for Anna Galviz in the amount of $23,175.00 for 45 hours
of work at the rate of $515.00 per hour. 
As discussed above, the Court will calculate her fees based upon an
hourly rate of $475 as stated in her declaration.  Thus, attorney’s fees for Anna Galviz are
awarded in the amount of $21,375.00.  

Plaintiff seeks attorney’s
fees for Otis Hayes, III in the amount of $720.00 for 1.6 hours of work at the
rate of $450.00 per hour.  As discussed
above, the Court will calculate his fees based upon an hourly rate of $350 as
stated in his declaration.  Thus,
attorney’s fees for Otis Hayes, III are awarded in the amount of $560.00.  
Because no
reply brief has been filed, the Court will deduct two hours of anticipated work
billed by Logan Pascal, or $700.00.  
Accordingly,
the Court awards Plaintiff attorneys’ fees in the amount of $47,589.00. 
Costs
Plaintiff also seeks costs in the amount of $4,969.84
pursuant to the memorandum of costs. (Memorandum of Costs, Barry Decl., p. 1.) A prevailing
plaintiff in a Song-Beverly action may recovery all costs and expenses
“reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of [this] action.” (§ 1794, subd. (d).)” (Jensen v. BMW of North
America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 138.) Courts interpret this
language to require fees and costs to be reasonably necessary to the conduct of
litigation. (See e.g. Hanna v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (2019) 36
Cal.App.5th 493, 507.) 
There
are no objections to the costs filed in the opposition. 
Accordingly,
the Court awards costs in the amount of $4,969.84.
