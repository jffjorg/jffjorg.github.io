Clerk to give notice.  
 
Background 
On September 7, 2023, the real property located at 2512
Deerford Street. Lakewood, CA 90712 sold at a trustee sale for $610,000.00,
leaving a surplus in the amount of $318,642.89.  On February 9, 2024, Quality Loan Service
Corp. (“Trustee”) filed a Petition and Declaration Regarding Unresolved Claims
and Deposit of Undistributed Surplus Proceeds of Trustee’s Sale.  Trustee claimed fees and expenses in the
amount of $3419.86. (Petition, ¶¶15-16.) On April 24, 2024, the Court approved
the Petition and ordered discharge of Trustee upon depositing the sum of
$315,223.03 with the Clerk of the Court. (4/24/24 Order.) The Clerk
subsequently gave notice of hearing scheduled for October 15, 2024. (7/10/24
Minute Order.)
Claims to Surplus Funds were filed by The United States of
America, on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service, on June 12, 2024, and by Samuel
Sanchez, the former owner of the subject property, on July 17, 2024.  
Legal
Standard 
 
Civil
Code § 2924j provides in part:
  
“(d)¿Before
the trustee deposits the funds with the clerk of the court pursuant to
subdivision (c), the trustee shall send written notice by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, to all persons described in subdivision (a) informing them
that the trustee intends to deposit the funds with the clerk of the court and
that a claim for the funds must be filed with the court within 30 days from the
date of the notice, providing the address of the court in which the funds were
deposited, and a telephone number for obtaining further information. 
 
Within
90 days after deposit with the clerk, the court shall consider all claims filed
at least 15 days before the date on which the hearing is scheduled by the
court, the clerk shall serve written notice of the hearing by first-class mail
on all claimants identified in the trustee’s declaration at the addresses
specified therein. Where the amount of the deposit is twenty-five thousand
dollars ($25,000) or less, a proceeding pursuant to this section is a limited
civil case. The court shall distribute the deposited funds to any and all
claimants entitled thereto.” 
 
Discussion 
The United States, on behalf of the Internal Revenue
Service, claims a portion of the surplus funds based upon a federal tax debt
owed by Samuel Sanchez.  As of October
15, 2024, the total balance due is approximately $49,922.00 for tax years 2012
and 2013.  Interest continues to accrue
as allowed by law. (6-12-24 Claim of United States of America on Behalf of the
internal Revenue Service to Surplus Funds, Ex. A.)  The Court finds that the claim is timely
under Civil Code § 8460(a.) and the Internal Revenue Service is entitled to
surplus funds in the requested amount of $49,922.00.  
Samuel Sanchez filed a claim for surplus funds as the owner
of the subject property prior to the foreclosure. (Sanchez Decl., ¶¶ 3, 6.) As
there are no other claimants, Sanchez is entitled to the remaining surplus
funds in the amount of $265,301.03.  
Within 5 days of the issuance of the Court’s order, each
claimant shall file a proposed order stating the name and address of the
claimant and the amount to be distributed per the Court’s order.  The Clerk shall distribute the remaining
surplus funds within 30 days of the issuance of the Court’s order.
