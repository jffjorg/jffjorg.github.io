And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant AHMC Whittier Hospital Medical Center, LP. The Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiff's claim is time-barred. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendants' negligence caused her injuries and emotional distress during a hysterectomy performed on November 18, 2021. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff's complaint was filed more than one year after the date of injury, which is beyond the statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5. The Plaintiff's argument that the amendment adding the Defendant was timely is unavailing, as the complaint was already time-barred when it was filed. The Judge also declined to grant leave to amend, as the Plaintiff failed to plead specific facts showing the discovery of the injury and the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.
