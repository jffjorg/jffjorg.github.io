Tentative Ruling 
Defendants Beverly Town Centre, LLC, Khajak
Harootun, and Janet Harootun’s Motion to Reclassify is DENIED. 
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background 
 
Plaintiff Molly Marie Ramos (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on July 6,
2023, at approximately 10:37 p.m., she was walking in the parking lot of the
Beverly Town Center when she “stepped on the non-visible, sharp, metal rods
protruding up from the concrete of the poorly lit parking lot of the Premises,
slicing her foot and causing her to sustain a large laceration on her foot.” (Complaint,
p. 4.) Plaintiff’s discovery responses as of December 21, 2023, stated that her
medical expenses were less than $8,000.00.
Defendants Beverly Town
Centre, LLC, Khajak Harootun, and Janet Harootun (“Defendants”) move for an
order to reclassify the case from unlimited jurisdiction to limited
jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 403.040.
Legal Standard 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 403.040 allows a defendant to file a motion for reclassification of an
action within the time allowed for that party to respond to the initial
pleadings. (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).)¿“A party may amend its
pleading once without leave of court at any time before an answer, demurrer, or
motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed if
the amended pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an
opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd.
(a).) If the motion is made after the time for the defendant to respond to the
pleading, the motion may only be granted if (1) the case is incorrectly
classified; and (2) the plaintiff shows good cause for not seeking
reclassification earlier.¿(Code Civ. Proc.,¿ § 403.040, subd. (b).)¿¿¿ 
In Walker v. Superior Court
(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 262, the California Supreme Court held that a matter may
be reclassified from unlimited to limited only if it appears to a legal
certainty that the plaintiff's damages will necessarily be less than $25,000. (Walker
v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257.) If there is a possibility that the
damages will exceed $25,000.00, the case cannot be reclassified. (Ibid.)¿This
high standard is appropriate in light of “the circumscribed procedures and
recovery available in the limited civil courts.” (Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005)
129 Cal.App.4th 266, 278.)¿¿¿ 
Discussion 
Defendants
contend that the Court should reclassify this matter from unlimited
jurisdiction to limited jurisdiction because the evidence shows that a verdict
in this case cannot exceed $35,000.00.  
 
Defendants
have failed to establish that the case is incorrectly classified because from
the evidence it is not clear and certain that Plaintiff’s claim will not exceed
$35,000.00. Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot obtain more than $35,000.00
because her adjusted medical bills are $7,456.00. Plaintiff contends that the
figure does not include the noneconomic damages she suffered from her injuries.
While an award for general damages of more than five times the amount of the
medical bills would be unusual, it is not clear and certain that such an award
cannot occur.  Additionally, Plaintiff
states that she continues to experience residual dull pain. (Mnatsakanian
Decl., ¶ 5.) Thus, Defendants have failed to establish that the case is
incorrectly classified.  
 
Defendants’ motion to reclassify is DENIED.
