And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Leticia Hernandez's Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment. The Court has granted the motion, ordering Defendant to file and serve the proposed Answer within 10 days. The Court found that Defendant's failure to timely answer was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Defendant's former attorney, Abraham Apaku, was retained to represent her in connection with her bodily injury claims, but was unaware of the lawsuit against her until June 10, 2024. The Court exercised its discretion to consider the amended motion, which was filed late, and determined that Defendant's version of events was credible. The Court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง 473(b) and CCP ยง 1005, as well as the case law of Mink v. Superior Court (1998) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338.
