And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to reclassify the case from unlimited jurisdiction to limited jurisdiction. The defendants argued that the case should be reclassified because the evidence shows that a verdict in this case cannot exceed $35,000.00. However, the judge found that the defendants failed to establish that the case is incorrectly classified because it is not clear and certain that the plaintiff's claim will not exceed $35,000.00. The judge noted that while the plaintiff's adjusted medical bills are $7,456.00, the plaintiff may be entitled to additional damages for her injuries, including noneconomic damages. Therefore, the judge concluded that the defendants have not met the high standard required to reclassify the case under Code of Civil Procedure section 403.040.
