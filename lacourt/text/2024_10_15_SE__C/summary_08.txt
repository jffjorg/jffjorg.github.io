And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment in the case of Sunrun Installation Services, Inc. v. Rosa Rodriguez. The Plaintiff had argued that there were no triable issues of material fact regarding whether the Defendant breached the contract and was liable for damages. The Defendant, on the other hand, had raised a triable issue of material fact by presenting evidence that she did not sign the contract and was unaware of the installation of solar panels on her property. The judge found that the Defendant had presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact and therefore denied the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The case will proceed to trial.
