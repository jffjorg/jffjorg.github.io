Summary in English text:

The Judge, C. Martin, has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's Motion for Leave to Amend Answer. The Defendant, Van De Nguyen, seeks to amend his answer to include affirmative defenses related to the Plaintiff's lack of automobile insurance, which would preclude the Plaintiff from recovering non-economic damages. The Judge has granted the motion, finding that there is good cause for the amendment and that the Plaintiff would suffer no prejudice from the amendments. The Judge notes that the affirmative defenses and their underlying facts have been at issue since early in the lawsuit and little or no additional discovery is required.
