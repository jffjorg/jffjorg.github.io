And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion ex parte, allowing the cross-defendant Wilbert Ernesto Flores Vizcarra to advance the motion for determination of good faith settlement earlier than scheduled. The motion was originally set for May 21, 2025, but the judge has advanced it to November 13, 2024, and will continue it to that date at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C. The judge's decision is based on the statutory basis for granting relief ex parte, which requires an affirmative factual showing of irreparable harm or immediate danger.
