And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees and costs. The defendants, Simon & Schuster, LLC and Forefront Books, LLC, moved for mandatory attorneys' fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 after successfully defending against the plaintiff's anti-SLAPP motion. The plaintiff, Patrick Wizmann, opposed the motion, arguing that the time spent was unreasonable.

The court found that the defendants' counsel spent a reasonable amount of time on the case, and that the hourly rates requested were below market and very reasonable. The court also found that the defendants' counsel provided detailed and organized presentations of information, which helped the court in its decision.

The court awards the defendants a total of $116,531.25 in attorneys' fees and $15,996.23 in costs. The plaintiff is ordered to pay these amounts on or before October 18, 2024.
