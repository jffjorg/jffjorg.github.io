And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the dispute regarding attorney's fees in the case. The judge notes that if regular hourly rates were used, the estimated attorney's fees would be $138,776. The judge also rejects the plaintiff's argument against block billing, stating that it can be a legitimate method of accounting for legal services. The judge reviews the entries in the bills and finds that the work was primarily related to the anti-SLAPP motion, with only a few minor issues regarding phone conversations that were de minimis and therefore not adjusted. Overall, the judge is not making any adjustments to the fees.
