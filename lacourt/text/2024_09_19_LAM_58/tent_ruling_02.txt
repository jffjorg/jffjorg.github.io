Case No.:                    24STCV00462
Matter:                        Motions
for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
Moving Party:             Defendants
Simon & Schuster, LLC and Forefront Books, LLC
Responding Party:      Plaintiff
Patrick Wizmann 
 

Tentative Ruling:      The motion
for attorneys’ fees and costs is granted.

 
 
            After
successfully moving to strike Plaintiff’s complaint under the anti-SLAPP
statute (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16), Defendants Simon & Schuster, LLC and
Forefront Books, LLC move for mandatory attorney’s fees and costs under Code of
Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c).  Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the
time spent was unreasonable. The Court grants the motion and orders Plaintiff to
pay, as attorneys’ fees and costs, Simon & Schuster $116,531.25, and to pay
Forefront Books $15,996.23.
 
Procedural and factual history
This
case arises from a feud between Plaintiff and his brother-in-law. In January
2024 Plaintiff Patrick Wizmann (“Plaintiff”) sued publisher Defendants for: (1)
Violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, et seq.; (2)
Violation of Business and Professions Code section 17500, et seq.; and
(3) Declaratory Relief. 
Plaintiff
alleged that in 2023 Defendant Forefront published Dreams Don’t Die: The
Story of A Man on a Mission to Inspire a Generation of Dreamers, by Izek
Shomof (the “Book”). Defendant Simon & Schuster is the Book’s distributor. 
Plaintiff
claimed that he read the promotional materials included on the Book’s dust
jacket and on Defendants’ websites and purchased the Book. Plaintiff alleges
that the dust jacket contains the following sentence describing the author:  
 “It is the memoir of a man who had every
opportunity to take unethical and often-illegal shortcuts but who instead chose
the lesser-trod path of honesty and integrity.” (Summary Sentence). 
Plaintiff alleged
that in 1989, Shomof was charged with receipt of stolen property. Therefore, Plaintiff
claims, the Summary Sentence is “deceptive advertising,” by which he was
“induced into purchasing the Book and the general public is being led to
believe that Izek Shomof aka Izek Shlomof is an upstanding businessman based on
a false and/or misleading depiction of his history.”  (Complaint ¶ 14.)
In March and April 2024, Defendants filed
Special Motions to Strike under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, (“anti-SLAPP
motions”), which Plaintiff opposed. In May 2024 the Court granted the motions,
finding that Plaintiff failed to show that the commercial speech exemption
under section 425.17 applied.  The Court
also found, regarding the first step in the anti-SLAPP analysis, that Plaintiff’s
suit arose from Defendants’ exercise of the right of free speech in connection
with a public issue or issue of public interest. On the second step, the Court found
that Plaintiff had failed to meet his burden of demonstrating a probability of
prevailing.  Accordingly, the Court
granted the special motion to strike the Complaint.
 
            On July 24,
2024 both Defendant Simon & Schuster and Defendant Forefront Books moved
for attorneys’ fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c). On
September 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed opposition memoranda, and Plaintiffs replied.  
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16, subdivision (c)(1) provides that “a prevailing defendant on a special
motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney’s fees and
costs.” As
the moving party, the prevailing defendant seeking fees and costs bears the
burden of establishing entitlement to an award and documenting the appropriate
hours expended and hourly rates. (Christian Research. Inst. v.
Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321 (Christian
Research).)
 
To assess the fees and costs, the
trial court begins with a lodestar figure based on the compilation of the time
spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney who worked on the
case. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131–1132.)
The court tabulates the attorney fee touchstone by multiplying the number of
hours reasonably expended by the reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the
community for similar work. (Id. at p. 1134; Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)
The court may increase or decrease the lodestar figure depending on a variety
of factors, including
(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill
displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award. (Ketchum, at
p. 1132.) The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair
market value for the particular action. (Id.) 
 
For
that purpose, the court may require a party to produce records to provide a
proper basis for determining how much time was spent on particular claims. The
court also may reduce compensation because the attorney did not maintain
appropriate time records. (ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson (2001)
93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1020.) The party that seeks payment must “keep
records in sufficient detail that a neutral judge can make a fair evaluation of
the time expended, the nature and need for the service, and the reasonable fees
to be allowed.”  (Hensley v. Eckerhart (1983) 461 U.S. 424, 441
(conc. opn. of Burger, C.J.).)  The evidence should allow the court to
consider whether the case was overstaffed, how much time the attorneys spent on
particular claims, and whether the hours were reasonably expended. (ComputerXpress, supra, 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1020.)
 
Contemporaneous time records in
support of an attorney fee motion are often the most useful evidence, but are
not indispensable.  A detailed
declaration describing the legal work done is acceptable.  (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095, n. 4 [fee claim based on detailed
reconstructed records upheld; noting that contemporaneous records facilitate
accuracy]; Taylor v. County of Los Angeles (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th
205, 207 [contemporaneous time records are the best evidence of lawyer’s hourly
work; they are “not indispensable”]; People v. Kelly (2020) 59 Cal.App.5th
1172, 1182 [“no legal requirement that an attorney supply billing statements to
support a claim for attorney fees”; attorney declarations acceptable].)
 
In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, the opposing party must point to the specific items
challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence. (Premier
Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. Cal. Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564 [“General arguments that
fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice”].)
 
Parties’ contentions
 
Moving party Defendants 
 
            Defendants argue
that Plaintiff’s suit was both frivolous and an extreme assault on free speech.
They correctly note that the award of attorney’s fees to a prevailing defendant
on an anti-SLAPP motion is mandatory.  (Ketchum
v. Moses, supra, 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131.)  Defendants maintain that the fees requested
are reasonable and properly include “fees on fees,” i.e., fees incurred in
litigating the award of attorney’s fees. (Id. at p. 1141 [“award of fees
may include not only the fees incurred with respect to the underlying claim,
but also the fees incurred in enforcing the right to mandatory fees under Code
of Civil Procedure section 425.16”].) 
 
The motions describe several of the
complex First Amendment issues that required research and briefing, the reasonableness
of the time spent, the experience of counsel, and their hourly rates.  Forefront’s attorney Mr. Aronoff normally
bills $790 per hour, but agreed to discount his rate to $550 for this matter,
and Mr. Bornstein reduced his rate from $600 to $450.  The discounted rates are low for the Los
Angeles market for media/First Amendment litigation and more than reasonable. In
their motion, Forefront seeks attorney’s fee of $101,855[1]
and costs of $506.25. As evidenced by attached receipts, the costs requested
are solely for court-mandated filing and transaction fees.
 
Simon & Schuster joins Forefront’s
motion.  It emphasizes that it sought to
avoid duplicative work, which the Court agrees it largely did.  Simon & Schuster also offered evidence of
the experience of its counsel.  The hourly
rate requested for Mr. Gehring of $525 and for Mr. Sparks of $495 are also
below market. In their motion, Simon & Schuster seeks an order for
$15,122.25 in attorneys’ fees and $461.48 in costs. 
 
            Defendants
supplemented their declarations with their Reply papers.  They agreed to reduce their fee request for
time spent on the Answer and submitted further requests for work done on the
fee motion and the Reply.  
 
Plaintiff’s opposition
 
            Plaintiff does
not dispute that Defendants prevailed on their anti-SLAPP motions and are
entitled to fees.  They urge, however,
that the amount of fees be capped.  There
is no authority for this position.  
 
            Plaintiff argues
that Simon & Schuster’s fees should be denied or reduced because, it
contends, it did little to strengthen Forefront’s motion.  Plaintiff argues that Mr. Gehring submitted
block billed items.  He also seeks
removal of work done on other than the anti-SLAPP motion, such as on the
Answer.  In his attack on Forefront’s fee
request, Plaintiff concedes defense counsel’s expertise, but contends that
given that, the time expended was excessive and reflected duplicative billing.  Plaintiff urges that no more than 50 hours be
compensated.
 
Discussion
 
            The
maximum hour cap Plaintiff proposes is contrary to law.
 
            Relying on Maugham
v. Google Technology, Inc. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1242, plaintiff
argues that fifty hours “is a reasonable amount of time for experienced litigations
such as Forefront’s counsel to spend on the instant anti-SLAPP motion.”  (Oppos. at p. 5.)  This one size fits all approach is contrary
to the way courts must evaluate fee requests. 
As our Supreme Court stated with respect to a fee motion under the anti-SLAPP
statute, the lodestar includes a “‘careful compilation of the time spent.’”  The purpose is to  “fix a fee at the fair market value for the
particular action.”  (Ketchum, supra, 24
Cal.4th at pp. 1131-1132.)
            Plaintiff is
correct that attorney time spent on issues other than the anti-SLAPP motion are
not compensable under section 425.16.  In
their reply submissions, Defendants concede that.  The Court rejects Plaintiff’s other critiques
of the fee motions.
 
            The Court
notes that the hourly rates requested by parties are on the lower end of the
market, and the Court would likely have approved a higher rate.  Accordingly, the Court finds that quibbles over
a few hours are inconsequential to the reasonableness of the fee motion.
 
            Reasonableness
of fee request
 
            Defendants’
attorneys submitted detailed declarations and timesheets in support of the motion.  The Court reviewed every entry of the time
sheets.  The Court found no instances of
unnecessary billing, block billing, overstaffing, or other issues that
sometimes affect the reasonableness of a fee request.[2]  Indeed, the Court finds that given the
complexity of this area of the law and the limited timeframe needed to file the
motion to strike, counsel for Defendants ran a lean and focused operation.  The Court also finds that based on the attorneys’
experience, the hourly rates requested are below market and very reasonable.  In this Court’s experience, such a
circumstance is highly unusual.  
 
            Forefront
agreed to reduce the fees claimed in its initial motion by $1,825 for 3.9 hours
for drafting the Answer to the Complaint, and thus not involved in the
anti-SLAPP motion.  Similarly, Simon
& Schuster agrees to reduce the total fees claimed by $918.75 for work by
Mr. Sparks and $742.50 for work by Mr. Gehring on the Answer and other matters
unconnected with the anti-SLAPP motion.  
 
Attorneys for both parties redacted
certain entries.  In the Forefront
billing, the name of the person with whom the attorney communicated was given,
though not what was discussed.  That is
appropriate when attorney-client communications and attorney work product are
involved.  On the Simon & Schuster timesheets,
Mr. Sparks’s entries for March 21, March 26, March 27 and April 1, 2024
included neither the identity of the person communicated with nor the subject
of the communication. In the Court’s view, redaction of both does not provide
the Court with sufficient information to determine that the time expended was reasonable
and necessary.  The Court therefore
deducts 0.55 hours, or $288.75 from Simon & Schuster’s request. 
 
            Based on the
initial motion, therefore, as to attorneys’ fees, the Court approves Forefront’s
request in the amount of $100,030.00 ($101,855 – $1,825), and Simon &
Schuster’s for $13,172.25  (15,122.25 – [288.75
+ 918.75 + 742.50]).
 
            Defendants
also request fees in conjunction with legal services incurred after the last
date of the billing statements included with the motions.  Forefront seeks additional fees of $15,995,
roughly half of which was for work on the fee motion after May 31, 2024, and
the other half for preparing the Reply.  The
Court appreciated the detailed and well-organized presentation of information
in the fee motion. Thus the time spent on the fee motion and declaration were
helpful to the Court. The Court awards Forefront an additional $15,995.  Accordingly, Forefront Books is entitled to an
award of attorney’s fees of $116,025 ($100,030 + 15,995).  Simon & Schuster’s counsel expended an
additional 4.5 hours on the Reply and fee motion for a further $2,362.50.  This sum is reasonable.  Thus, Simon & Schuster is entitled to an
award of attorneys’ fees in the amount of $15,534.75  ($13,172.25 + $2,362.50.)
 
Conclusion
            
            Plaintiff Wizmann
is ordered to pay the following amounts to Defendant’s counsel as and for
attorneys’ fees and costs:
 
            To Fox Rothschild
LLP, attorneys for Forefront Books, the sum of $116,531.25  ($116,025 fees + 506.25 costs);
 
            To Sparks
Law Firm and Thomas G. Gehring & Associates the combined amount of $15,996.23
($15,534.75 fees + 461.48 costs)
 
            Plaintiff is
ordered to pay these amounts on or before October 18, 2024.
