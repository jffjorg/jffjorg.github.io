And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the County of Los Angeles' demurrer and sustains the demurrer. The court concludes that the plaintiff, Nancy Cardenas, does not have standing to bring this action because she does not have been appointed as the personal representative of the decedent's estate. The court also finds that the pleadings are insufficient to support the causes of action for neglect, negligence, wrongful death, and survival action. The court grants leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to file a new complaint if and when she is appointed as the personal representative of the decedent's estate. The court will discuss with counsel various other concerns regarding the current version of the complaint.
