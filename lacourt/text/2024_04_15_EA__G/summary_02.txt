And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Fleet Capital's motion for summary judgment in this unlawful detainer action. The court finds that Fleet Capital established that it acquired ownership of the Covina property through a properly conducted nonjudicial foreclosure sale and that title was perfected by the recording of the trustee's deed on January 25, 2023. The court also finds that Fleet Capital carried its burden of establishing that there are no disputed or triable issues of material fact regarding its ownership of the Covina property. The court rejects Keene's objections to Fleet Capital's evidence and notes that Keene failed to introduce any evidence establishing how the sale of the Covina property was noncompliant with statute.
