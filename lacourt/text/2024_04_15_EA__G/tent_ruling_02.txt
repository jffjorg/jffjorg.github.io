 Case Number:  23PSCV03719    Hearing Date:   April 15, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Fleet Capital, Inc.’s Motion for Summary
Judgment
Respondent: Defendant Gwendolyn Keene
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Fleet Capital, Inc.’s Motion for Summary
Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is an unlawful detainer action. In October 2022, Plaintiff Fleet Capital, Inc.
(Fleet Capital) acquired ownership of real property in Covina through a
nonjudicial foreclosure sale. Fleet Capital alleges the former owner of the
Covina property, Defendant Gwendolyn Keene, continues to reside at the Covina
property. On November 8, 2023, Fleet Capital served Keene with a three day
notice to quit. Subsequently, Fleet Capital alleges Keene failed to vacate the
Covina property.
On
November 30, 2023, Fleet Capital filed a complaint against Keene; all unknown
occupants, tenants, and subtenants, and Does 1-10, alleging a cause of action
for unlawful detainer.
On
February 27, 2024, Fleet Capital filed the present motion. A hearing on the
motion is set for April 15 with a case management conference on May 30.
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
Keene’s
evidentiary objections are OVERRULED as to Nos. 1, 2, and 3.
REQUESTS
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Fleet
Capital asks the court to take judicial notice of five documents: (1) a notice
of delinquent assessment recorded May 18, 2022; (2) a notice of default
recorded June 23, 2022; (3) a notice of trustee’s sale recorded September 19,
2022; (4) a certificate of sale recorded November 10, 2022; and (5) a trustee’s
deed upon sale recorded January 25, 2023. The existence and factual contents of
recorded documents including notices of default and trustee’s sale and
trustee’s deeds upon sale can be noticed pursuant to Evidence Code sections
452, subdivisions (c) and (h), and 453. (Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage
Corp., 62 Cal.4th 919, 924, fn. 1.) Thus, the court GRANTS Fleet
Capital’s request.
ANALYSIS
Fleet
Capital moves for summary judgment on their unlawful detainer action. For the
following reasons, the court GRANTS Fleet Capital’s motion.
Legal Standard
Summary Judgment
With
five days’ notice at any time after the filing of an answer in an unlawful
detainer action, a motion for summary judgment may be made pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1170.7. The motion “shall be granted or denied on the
same basis as a motion under Section 437c.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1170.7.) A
motion for summary judgment provides “courts with a mechanism to cut through
the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) It must be granted
“if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from
the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119, quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
To establish a triable issue of material fact, the opposing party must produce
substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of
the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence
in favor of that party.”¿ (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39
Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Unlawful Detainer
When
a party has obtained property through a trustee’s sale and title has been
perfected, that party may bring an unlawful detainer action against any person
who continues possession of the property after a three-day written notice to
quit has been served. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161a, subd. (b)(3).) To establish
grounds for removal, “plaintiff need only prove a sale in compliance with the
statute and deed of trust, followed by purchase at such sale.” (Cheney v.
Trauzettel (1937) 9 Cal.2d 158, 160 (Cheney).) Plaintiff must also
establish that title was perfected which occurs “when all steps have been taken
to make it perfect, i.e., to convey to the purchaser that which he has
purchased, valid and good beyond all reasonable doubt.” (Stephens, Partain
& Cunningham v. Hollis (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 948, 953, quoting Kessler
v. Bridge (1958) 161 Cal.App.2d Supp. 837, 841.)
Discussion
In
this case, the following facts are undisputed. On May 18, 2022, California HOA
Collection Services (CHCS) recorded a notice of delinquent assessment against
the Covina property on behalf of Covina Townhomes HOA. (Plaintiff’s Separate
Statement (PSS), ¶ 1; RJN, Ex. 1.) CHCS then commenced foreclosure proceedings
against the Covina property by recording a notice of default for nonpayment of
the assessment on June 23. (PSS, ¶ 2; RJN, Ex. 2.) On September 19, CHCS
recorded a notice of trustee’s sale that set October 25 as the date for the
foreclosure sale. (PSS, ¶ 3; RJN, Ex. 3.) On November 10, CHCS recorded a
certificate of sale that noted Fleet Capital as the successful bidder and provided
that the Covina property could be redeemed within ninety days of the sale.
(PSS, ¶ 4-5; RJN, Ex. 4.) On January 25, 2023, CHCS recorded a trustee’s deed
upon sale that conveyed title of the Covina property to Fleet Capital. (PSS, ¶
6; RJN, Ex. 5.) The deed also includes recitals stating that all notice
requirements for the notice of default and notice of trustee’s sale have been
complied with. (PSS, ¶ 7; RJN, Ex. 5.)
A
recital that the notice requirements for a nonjudicial foreclosure were
complied with in the trustee’s deed is “prima facie evidence of compliance with
these requirements and conclusive evidence thereof in favor of bona fide
purchasers and encumbrancers for value and without notice.” (Civ. Code, § 2924,
subd. (c).) Based on the undisputed facts and recital noted above, Fleet
Capital established that Fleet Capital acquired title to the Covina property
through a properly conducted nonjudicial foreclosure sale. Title has also been
perfected by CHCS’s recording of the trustee’s deed on January 25, 2023. Thus, the
court finds that Fleet Capital carried its burden of establishing there are no
disputed or triable issues of material fact with regards to its ownership of
the Covina property.
In
opposition, Keene argues Covina Townhomes HOA failed to notify Keene of lien
enforcement procedures by certified mail pursuant to Civil Code section 5660, failed
to provide an itemized statement by certified mail pursuant to Civil Code
section 5660, failed to offer dispute resolution pursuant to the Covina
Townhomes HOA’s meet and confer program pursuant to Civil Code sections 5660
and 5670, failed to offer alternative dispute resolution pursuant to Civil Code
section 5660, and recorded a notice of delinquent assessment without notice by
certified mail as required by Civil Code section 5675. (Opp., p. 2:19-26.)
But
in the present summary proceeding, the court is limited to determining if Fleet
Capital purchased the Covina property as a sale in compliance with statute and
properly perfected the title. (Cheney, supra, 9 Cal.2d at p. 160.)
Keene “may raise objections only on that phase of the issue of title. Matters
affecting the validity of the trust deed or primary obligation itself, or other
basic defects in the [Fleet Capital’s] title, are neither properly raised in
this summary proceeding for possession, nor are they concluded by the judgment.”
(Ibid.) Here, Keene fails to introduce any evidence establishing how the
sale of the Covina property itself was noncompliant with statute and instead
focuses on the validity of the underlying lien.
Accordingly,
Fleet Capital’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the
court GRANTS Fleet Capital’s motion for summary judgment.
