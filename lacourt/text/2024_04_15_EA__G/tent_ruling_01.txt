BACKGROUND
 
On November 16, 2023, Plaintiff Roberto Lopez filed a
complaint against Defendant Aurora Charter Oak – Los Angeles, LLC (Aurora),
alleging general negligence, medical negligence, and intentional torts.
 
On December 4, 2023, Aurora filed the present demurrer and
motion to strike. Prior to filing, Aurora’s counsel attempted to meet and
confer by sending a letter to Lopez on November 28. (Charles Decl., ¶ 3.) On January 24, 2024, the court continued the hearing on the
present demurrer and motion to strike in order for parties to further meet and
confer. On January 31, Aurora’s counsel met and conferred telephonically with
Lopez. (Anderson Decl., ¶ 4(C).)
 
A
hearing on the present demurrer and motion to strike is set for April 15, 2024,
along with a case management conference. A hearing on a motion to compel is
also set for June 24.
 
ANALYSIS

Aurora demurs to Lopez’s entire Complaint on
the grounds that (1) Aurora is immune from liability pursuant to Welfare and
Institutions Code section 5278, (2) Lopez’s negligence claims are duplicative,
(3) the intentional tort claim fails to state a cause of action, (4) the prayer
for punitive damages is improper, (5) the Complaint is insufficiently pled and
uncertain, and (6) the Complaint improperly states the amount demanded. For the
following reasons, the court SUSTAINS
Aurora’s demurrer as the Complaint
is uncertain and ambiguous.
 
Legal Standard

A party may demur to a complaint on the
grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering demurrers, courts accept
all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
430.10, subdivision (f), a party may demur to a pleading on the grounds that it
is “uncertain” which requires the pleading to be “ambiguous unintelligible.”
But “demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored, and are granted only if the
pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond.” (Lickiss
v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125,
1135.)
 
Discussion

In this case, Aurora argues the Complaint is
uncertain and inadequately pled. The court agrees. While Lopez alleges causes
of action for general negligence, medical negligence, and intentional torts,
the court finds Lopez fails to allege specific facts in support of each cause
of action and provide those facts in a separate attachment as instructed in
paragraph ten of the Complaint’s template. Without those facts, the court finds
the Complaint is uncertain and ambiguous.
 
Accordingly, Aurora’s demurrer to the
Complaint is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION

Based on the
foregoing, Aurora’s demurrer to Lopez’s Complaint is SUSTAINED with twenty
(20) days leave to amend.
 
Aurora’s motion
to strike is DEEMED MOOT.
