And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which argued that the city of Gardena is immune from liability for a car accident involving Officer Steve Kim. The judge found that there are triable issues of material fact regarding whether Officer Kim acted negligently and failed to provide a reasonable opportunity for other cars to yield. The judge noted that Officer Kim's actions, including slowing down and turning on lights and sirens, may have created a reasonable opportunity for other cars to yield, but that the expert accident reconstructionist's testimony and other evidence raise questions about whether Officer Kim's actions were negligent. The judge concluded that the case should proceed to trial to determine the facts and liability.
