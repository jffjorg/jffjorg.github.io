```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Defendant's motion to compel further responses from the Plaintiff. The Defendant had requested that the Plaintiff provide documentation to support the Plaintiff's claims for lost wages and future earnings capacity. The Plaintiff failed to respond to these requests, and the Defendant filed a motion to compel further responses. However, the judge found that the motion was untimely, as it was filed more than four years after the Plaintiff's verified discovery responses were served. As a result, the judge denied the motion.
