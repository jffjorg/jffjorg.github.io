And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff's request for default judgment, citing several issues with Plaintiff's claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. Specifically, the Judge finds that Plaintiff has not adequately pled his claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, and that he has not provided sufficient evidence to support his damages and interest requests. The Judge also notes that Plaintiff's proposed form of judgment includes inconsistent attorney's fees, which are excessive in any event. The Judge orders Plaintiff to correct his damages and interest requests and to re-file his proposed form of judgment.
