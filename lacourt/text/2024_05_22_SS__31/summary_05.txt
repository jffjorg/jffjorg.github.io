And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants defendant City of Los Angeles' motion to compel responses to supplemental discovery propounded on February 16, 2024. The motion was unopposed, and plaintiffs Luis Ramirez and Cole Hershon have failed to serve responses. The court finds that the defendant was properly served with discovery and failed to respond, and therefore grants the motion. The court orders plaintiffs to serve verified responses to the supplemental interrogatory without objections within 15 days. Additionally, the court imposes sanctions on plaintiffs, including $250 in attorney fees and $250 in monetary sanctions, to be paid jointly and severally. The court also awards attorney fees to the defendant.
