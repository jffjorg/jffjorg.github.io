Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to compel the second deposition of the plaintiff, Stacey A. Sterbcow. The plaintiff had previously appeared for a deposition on January 27, 2023, but did not appear for a subsequent deposition session on November 29, 2023. The defendants re-noticed the plaintiff's second deposition for March 29, 2024, but the plaintiff did not appear. The court finds good cause for the subsequent deposition of the plaintiff. The court also denies the request for production of documents, as the defendants did not set forth specific facts showing good cause for the production of documents.

The court imposes sanctions on the plaintiff in the amount of $110 for the plaintiff's continual delay in prosecuting this matter and participating in the discovery process. The court orders the plaintiff to pay the sanctions to the defendants within 20 days.
