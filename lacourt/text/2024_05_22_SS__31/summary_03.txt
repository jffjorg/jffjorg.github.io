```

And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has decided to continue the demurrer hearing to allow the parties to resolve their issues through meet and confer efforts. The judge has found that the plaintiff did not properly meet and confer with the defendant before filing the demurrer, and therefore will not consider the merits of the demurrer until the parties have properly met and conferred. The parties are ordered to file a brief detailing their meet and confer efforts and whether the demurrer has been rendered moot. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement and avoid the need for a hearing. If a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
