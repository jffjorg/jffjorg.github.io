```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint and reinstates the action. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' counsel's failure to effectuate service on the defendants and failure to appear at the FSC and trial hearings were due to mistake, surprise, inadvertence, and/or excusable neglect. However, the judge notes that no proof of service of the summons and complaint has been filed on the defendants and sets an Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal for Failure to File Proof of Service. The plaintiffs' counsel is required to appear at the OSC and provide evidence showing that the defendants have been served with the summons and complaint or why such service has not occurred. If the counsel fails to appear and provide proof of service, the plaintiffs risk the court dismissing the action.
