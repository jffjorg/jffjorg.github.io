BACKGROUND On January 30, 2024, defendant Los Angeles Community College District (“Defendant”) propounded supplemental request for production of documents, set one, on plaintiff Graham Kaye (“Plaintiff”). (Skelton Decl. ¶ 4; Exh. A.) To date, Plaintiff has not served responses. (Id. at ¶ 6.) Defendant therefore moves the Court for an order compelling Plaintiff to provide responses to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions. As of May 9, 2024, no opposition has been filed.   II.  MOTION TO COMPEL SUPPLEMENTAL DISCOVERY A party may propound a supplemental interrogatory or supplemental demand for production of documents to elicit any later acquired information bearing on all answers previously made by any party.  (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.070, subd. (a), 2031.050, subd. (a).) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff was properly served with discovery and failed to respond, Defendant’s unopposed motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to defendant Los Angeles Community College District’s supplemental request for production of documents, set one, without objections, within fifteen (15) days. (CCP § 2031.300(a),(b).)   III. SANCTIONS Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §2031.300(c).)¿ Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Defendant seeks $4,500 in monetary sanctions. A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)        Defendant is awarded 1 hour to prepare the motion to compel at a reduced rate of $200 per hour, for a total of $200 in attorney fees.  Sanctions are sought and imposed against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney of record, jointly and severally. Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Los Angeles Community College District, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $200, within fifteen (15) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 21st day of May 2024      Hon.
