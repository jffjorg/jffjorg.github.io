And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies without prejudice an application by Sara E. Abston to appear as counsel pro hac vice to represent plaintiff Shannon Jaworski in the case against Royce Hugh Worden. The application was previously denied due to failure to comply with court rules, but the applicant cured the defect by providing proof of service on the State Bar. However, the motion is denied due to insufficient notice, as the required 16-day statutory notice was not provided. The court finds that the proof of service states the State Bar was served on April 29, 2024, but the required notice was not given. The ruling encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and provides guidance on the procedures for submitting comments on the tentative ruling.
