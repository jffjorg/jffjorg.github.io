And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to reclassify the matter to limited jurisdiction. The defendants did not correctly account for the over $9,000 in attorneys' fees that the plaintiff incurred in his underlying efforts to recover his escrow funds. The court ruled that these attorneys' fees are potentially recoverable as a separate element of damages under the principle of "tort of another." The judge also denied the defendants' claim- and issue-preclusion arguments, leaving them for another day.
