 Case Number:  23STCV24167    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  74 Henn v. Ehrlich,
et al.
Defendants Matt Ehrlich and NAI
Capital Commercial, Inc.’s Motion to Reclassify Matter to Limited Jurisdiction.
 
The court denies defendants’
“Walker” motion because they have not correctly accounted for the over $9,000
in attorneys’ fees plaintiff incurred in plaintiff’s underlying efforts to
recover his escrow funds. (See Mtn p. 4 fn. 2.) Code of Civil Procedure section
85 upon which defendants rely states that attorneys’ fees (and interest and costs)
incurred in this action (were self-represented plaintiff to hire an
attorney to pursue plaintiff’s lawsuit against defendants) do not count toward
calculating the $35,000 jurisdictional threshold. But attorneys’ fees plaintiff
paid the law firm Gaines & Stacey LLP in the underlying action are potentially
recoverable as a separate element of damages under the principle of “tort of
another.” The “expense
of previous litigation, including attorneys’ fees, may be recovered.” In fact,
“[a] person who through the tort of another has been required to act in the
protection of his interests by bringing or defending an action against a third
person is entitled to recover compensation for the reasonably necessary loss of
time, attorney’s fees, and other expenditures thereby suffered or incurred.” (Prentice
v. N. Am. Title Guar. Corp., Alameda Div. (1963) 59 Cal.2d 618, 620; see
also 6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (11th ed. 2024) Torts § 1832.) Based on the
foregoing incompleteness of defendants’ analysis, the court denies their
motion.
            The court leaves for another day defendants’
claim- and issue-preclusion arguments because those arguments are not properly
before the court in defendants’ motion.
            Defendants shall give notice.
