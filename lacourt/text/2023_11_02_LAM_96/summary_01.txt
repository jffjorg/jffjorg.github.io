And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to tax costs, finding that the defendant's 998 (costs) was valid. The court has also denied the plaintiff's motion for costs of proof, finding that the defendant had a reasonable ground to believe she would prevail on the issue of whether she caused the accident. The court's ruling is based on the fact that the jury did not find the defendant was the sole cause of the accident, the timing of the request for admissions, and the credible evidence provided by the defendant's expert. The court cites Brooks v. American Broadcasting Co. (1986) in support of its decision.
