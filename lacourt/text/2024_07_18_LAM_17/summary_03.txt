And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer is overruled. The plaintiff, Vig Private Lending, Inc., filed an unlawful detainer action against the defendant, Ilan Kenig, and his wife, Avivit Kenig. The plaintiff alleges that Avivit Kenig is an occupant of the Premises and has refused to deliver up possession of the Premises despite being served a notice to quit. The judge finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a claim for unlawful detainer against Avivit Kenig, and therefore, the defendant's demurrer is denied. The judge will adopt this tentative ruling as the final order unless a party submits written opposition or agreement.
