And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), is seeking leave to amend its answer to add an affirmative defense under Education Code section 44808. The plaintiff, M.M., alleges negligence, negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. The defendant claims it was not aware of the facts supporting this affirmative defense at the time the answer was filed. The court finds that granting the defendant's motion for leave to amend would not result in meaningful prejudice to the plaintiff, as no trial date has been set and the plaintiff has plenty of time to prepare for trial. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion for leave to amend.
