And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has ruled on the demurrer filed by LAMDC and Andrew Yao to TCS's Cross-Complaint. The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the contract on which TCS's Cross-Complaint is based is illegal because TCS does not have licensed architects or engineers. The Court has overruled the demurrer, stating that the demurrer exceeds the boundaries of the Cross-Complaint and that the Court's previous decision overruling the Defendants' demurrer to LAMDC's First Amended Complaint did not hold that the contract is illegal. The Court has also ruled that the common count claims in the Cross-Complaint are sufficient to withstand the demurrer.
