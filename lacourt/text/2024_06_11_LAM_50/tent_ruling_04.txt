Case No.:   23STCV25159     Hearing Date:   June 11, 2024     Hearing Time:   10:00 a.m.     ORDER RE:     PLAINTIFF’S    MOTIONS TO COMPEL RESPONSES BY DEFENDANT LOPEZ TO PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR    PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND FORM INTERROGATORIES AND TO HAVE MATTERS IN    PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION DEEMED ADMITTED.        Plaintiff San  Saba, LLC moves for an order compelling Defendant Julian Lopez to respond to  Plaintiff’s requests for production of documents and form interrogatories and  to have matters in Plaintiff’s requests for admission deemed admitted. Plaintiff’s motions will be continued to a  new date as set forth below. NO HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON JUNE 11, 2024.      Pursuant to the  Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them  conform to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court  orders the parties in this case to participate in a meet and confer with the  Court in the form of an informal discovery conference (“IDC”). Lead or  other designated counsel for Plaintiff with full authority and Defendant are  ordered to participate in the IDC. After consulting with Defendant regarding  available dates, Plaintiff must make a prompt  reservation for the IDC using the Court’s online reservation system. Plaintiff must file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC form in the department  seven days prior to the IDC, and Defendant may file the same form in the  department setting forth a response three days prior to the IDC.  Courtesy copies are to be delivered to Dept. 50. Once Plaintiff has  confirmed an IDC date, Plaintiff must use the  Court’s online reservation system to continue the motions to a post-IDC  discovery hearing date. The parties are ordered to have with them whatever  materials are needed to make the IDC session productive and successful. Prior  to the IDC date, lead or other designated counsel for Plaintiff with full  authority and Defendant, are to meet and confer, in person or via  telephone in a further attempt to resolve as many of the  issues as possible before the IDC. (See CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).)  If the parties resolve their discovery disputes before the IDC date, Plaintiff is ordered to take both the IDC and the motions off  calendar as soon as possible.  Additionally, the Court notes that no courtesy copies of the motions were provided to the Court.  Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this Order.    DATED:  June 11, 2024                                 ________________________________ Hon.
