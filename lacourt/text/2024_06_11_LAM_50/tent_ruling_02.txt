[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PETITIONER’S PETITION FOR APPROVAL OF TRANSFER OF STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT
  PAYMENT RIGHTS
 



            
            Background
On July 12, 2023, Petitioner 1737 Recovery
Associates, LLC (“Petitioner”) filed the Petition for Approval of Transfer of
Structured Settlement Payment Rights (“Petition”). 
On March 26, 2024, the Court and Petitioner’s
counsel conferred regarding a new date for the Petition. The Court advanced the
hearing date from November 7, 2024, and continued it to June 11, 2024.
Legal Standard
            Insurance Code, §
10139.5 (a) states that “[f]actors that the trial court shall consider in
determining whether the transfer is fair and reasonable and in the best
interest of the payee include the reasonable preference and desire of the payee
to complete the proposed transaction, taking into account the payee's age,
mental capacity, legal knowledge, and apparent maturity level; the stated
purpose of the transfer; the payee's financial and economic situation; and the
terms of the transaction, including whether the payee is transferring monthly
or lump sum payments or all or a portion of his or her future payments. 
Ins. Code, § 10139.5 (b). 
            Pursuant to Insurance
Code, section 10139.5(f)(2), at least 20 days prior to the hearing on this
Petition, Petitioner shall file with the Court and serve on all interested
parties a notice of the proposed transfer and the petition for its
authorization. Included with that notice will be following: 
            A. A copy of this
Petition; 
            B. A copy of the
Transfer Agreement and disclosure form required by therein; 
            C. A listing of each
of the Payee’s dependents, together with each dependent’s age; 
            D. A copy of the
Disclosure Statement; E. A copy of the annuity contract, if available; 
            F. A copy of the
qualified assignment agreement if available; 
            G. A copy of the
underlying structured settlement agreement, if available; 
            H. If applicable due
to unavailability of the underlying structured settlement documents described
in subparagraphs 24 (E)-(G) above, a statement of the reasonable efforts to
locate the same and a description of the payments due and owing to the Payee. 
            I.  Proof of service showing compliance with the
notification requirements of Insurance code, section 10139.5(f)(2); 
            J. Notification that
any interested party is entitled to support, oppose, or otherwise respond to
the Petition, either in person or by counsel, by submitting written comments to
the court or by participating in the hearing; 
            K. Notification of
the time and place of the hearing and notification of the manner in which and
the time by which written responses to the Petition must be filed, which may
not be less than 15 days after service of the notice, in order to be considered
by the court; and 
            L. If the Payee
entered into the structured settlement agreement at issue within 5 years prior
to the date of the Transfer Agreement, then the Petitioner shall provide notice
to the Payee’s attorney of record at the time the structured settlement was
created, if the attorney is licensed to practice in California, at the attorney’s
address on file with the State Bar of California, in the form prescribed by
Insurance Code, section 10139.5(f)(L).
            Discussion
A.    Merits
The Court notes that Petitioner failed to
comply with Insurance Code, section 10139.5, because Petitioner failed to
include any supporting declaration(s)  and documentation such as the Transfer
Agreement, Disclosure Statement, Proof of Service, and any other supporting
evidence. There also is no proof of service.
Conclusion
The Court continues the hearing to _______________
to allow Petitioner to file the requisite declaration(s) and documentation and
to file a proof of service. Petitioner is ordered to file the requested
documents within 20 days of this Order. 
 
Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of
this Order.
