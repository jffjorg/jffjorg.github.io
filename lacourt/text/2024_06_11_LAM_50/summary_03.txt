Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has ruled in favor of Plaintiff Tax Resolution Plus's request for default judgment against Defendants Reza Momeni and Cyrus Services Inc. The court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently supported its request with submitted declarations and evidence. The court notes that the error in the date of filing the Complaint is not sufficient to deny entry of judgment. The court will grant the request and sign the judgment. The hearing scheduled for June 11, 2024, is unnecessary.
