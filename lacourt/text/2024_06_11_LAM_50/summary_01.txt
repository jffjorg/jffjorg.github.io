And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiffs' motion to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of investigating Defendant's "Water Loss Initiative" and "Water Loss Forum" and its policies, procedures, related documents, and training concerning residential water loss claim handling. The court finds that the first factor (necessity and reasons for the discovery) weighs in the plaintiffs' favor. The second factor (diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the discovery) also weighs in the plaintiffs' favor. The third factor (likelihood that permitting the discovery will prevent the case from going to trial) weighs in the defendant's favor. The fourth factor (length of time that has elapsed between any date previously set and the date presently set for the trial of the action) also weighs in the plaintiffs' favor.
