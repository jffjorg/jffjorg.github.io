 Case Number:  23STCV14945    Hearing Date:   June 11, 2024    Dept:  50       Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department  50       TAX RESOLUTION    PLUS,                          Plaintiff,              vs. REZA MOMENI, an    individual, CYRUS SERVICES INC., and    DOES 1 through 20, inclusive,                         Defendants.   Case No.:   23STCV14945     Hearing Date:   June 11, 2024     Hearing Time:   10:00 a.m.        ORDER    RE:   PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT (2)                    Plaintiff  Tax Resolution Plus requests entry of default judgment against Defendants Reza  Momeni and Cyrus Services Inc. in the total amount of $54,993.56, comprising $54,389.34  in damages and $604.22 in costs. The Court notes that  Plaintiff still has not corrected the date of filing the Complaint on the Form  CIV-100.  Nevertheless, the error is not  enough to deny entry of judgment.  The  Court simply notes that the Complaint was filed on June 23, 2023, not June 28,  2023. The Court finds that Plaintiff has otherwise sufficiently supported its  request with the submitted declarations and evidence. Therefore, Plaintiff’s  request is granted, and the Court will sign the judgment. No appearance at the  hearing is necessary.¿¿    DATED:  June 11, 2024                                 ________________________________ Hon. Teresa A. Beaudet  Judge,  Los Angeles Superior Court
