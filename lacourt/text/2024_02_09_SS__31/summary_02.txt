The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Alexander Olshansky's motion to compel compliance with subpoena, requesting the production of business records from First Knight Financial, Inc. (FKF). The Plaintiff served FKF's custodian of records on March 14, 2023, seeking documents related to Summitridge Enterprise, LLC and Mikhail Cheban from 2016 to 2018. However, FKF withheld production of documents due to objection, and the Plaintiff must resolve the issue of service before proceeding. The Judge denies the motion without prejudice, citing California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1346, which requires non-parties to be served with the moving papers by personal service, unless they agree to accept service by mail or electronic service. The Judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and sets a hearing date for February 9, 2024.
