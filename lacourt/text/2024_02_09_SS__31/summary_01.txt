And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' request for default judgment against defendant DAVID ASSOULINE. The Plaintiffs' request is denied due to several defects in their submission. Firstly, they used an outdated form (CIV-100, Rev. January 1, 2007) and must use the correct form (CIV-100, Rev. January 1, 2023). Secondly, they have not dismissed all other parties against whom judgment is not sought. Thirdly, they have not filed declarations under penalty of perjury or provided admissible evidence in support of the amount of damages sought. The Judge requires the Plaintiffs to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. If the Plaintiffs fail to do so, the Court may impose sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC (Order to Show Cause) is continued to a later date.
