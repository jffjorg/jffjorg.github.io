And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Elecnor Belco Electric, Inc. and Elecnor Inc. defendants have moved for summary judgment on the third cause of action against them for negligence. The plaintiffs, Jose Sierra and Jessica Sierra, have not opposed this motion. The undisputed material facts show that Belco installed new traffic signals at the subject intersection in February, but they were not activated until after Sully Miller and the City performed additional work on the road at the subject intersection. The Elecnor Defendants argue that they did not breach a duty of care to the plaintiffs and that no act or omission on their part caused or contributed to Decedent’s injury. The court finds that the Elecnor Defendants have met their prima facie burden and that the plaintiffs have not raised a triable issue of material fact. Therefore, the Elecnor Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.
