  Case Number:  18STCV08330    Hearing Date:   February 9, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  02/09/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  18STCV08330 JESUS CRUZ, et al. vs DAVID ASSOULINE, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  DAVID ASSOULINE RECOMMENDATION:  DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  This is Plaintiffs’ first request for default judgment. The request for default judgment submitted on February 1, 2024 is DENIED for the following reasons:  First, Plaintiffs use an outdated CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2007]. Plaintiffs must use CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023]. Additionally, Plaintiffs are to submit a proposed judgment using JUD-100 [Rev. January 1, 2024] instead of JUD-100 [New January 1, 2002].   Second, Plaintiffs seek default judgment against David Assouline only. However, Plaintiffs have not yet dismissed all other parties against whom judgment is not sought (including all unnamed Doe defendants). (CRC, rule 3.1800(a)(7).)  Third, Plaintiffs have not filed their declarations under penalty of perjury or provided admissible evidence in support of amount of damages sought. (CRC 3.1800(a)(2).) Plaintiffs submit only the declaration of their attorney. Plaintiffs’ counsel did not personally incur any medical bills or medical treatment, and thus does not have the requisite personal knowledge to attest to Plaintiffs’ injuries or to authenticate any records in relation thereto.   Although a defaulting defendant admits only the well pled facts concerning liability, not damages, Plaintiff must still introduce admissible prima facie evidence of damages. (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361.) Plaintiffs must substantiate the amounts sought with evidence. The Court will not grant any unsupported requests for damages.  No later than _______, Plaintiffs are to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to ____.
