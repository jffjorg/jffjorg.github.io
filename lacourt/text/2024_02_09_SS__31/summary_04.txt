```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial as to liability and damages. The motion, which was opposed by the plaintiff, sought to separate the trial into two phases: one for liability and another for damages. The judge found that the trial judge should make the decision on whether bifurcation is warranted, rather than the court ruling on the motion. The judge noted that the defendants had properly sought a bifurcation order in advance of the trial date and that the logic of having the trial judge determine the issue is similar to the court's role in ruling on motions in limine. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the defendants can raise the issue again at the trial judge's discretion. The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and provides instructions for submitting to the tentative ruling.
