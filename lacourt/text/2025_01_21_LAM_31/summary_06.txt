The judge has granted the unopposed Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Andrea Pearce, counsel for Plaintiff Josue Alberto Maldonado. The Motion was filed on November 20, 2024, and states that the Plaintiff's conduct has rendered it unreasonably difficult for the law firm Lawyers for Employee and Consumer Rights to carry out their legal representation effectively. The judge finds that the Motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and that the law firm's request for withdrawal should be granted absent a showing of resulting prejudice. The Motion is granted and effective upon the filing of the proof of service of this signed order upon the Plaintiff.
