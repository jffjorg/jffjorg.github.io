Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, et al. CASE NO.:                 24STCV09111  MOTION FOR STAY OF PROCEEDINGS MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Anthony Espino RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant The Regents of the University of California  I.         FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND             Plaintiff On April 11, 2024, Plaintiff Anthony Espino filed a Complaint against defendant The Regents of the University of California (erroneously sued as Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, hereafter The Regents or Defendant).  On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint (FAC) against The Regents for (1) disability discrimination in violation of FEHA, (2) failure to engage in the interactive process in violation of FEHA, (3) harassment in violation of FEHA, (4) retaliation in violation of FEHA, (5) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation in violation of FEHA, (6) failure to accommodate in violation of FEHA, and (7) and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  On October 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion for Stay of Proceedings.  Plaintiff seeks an order staying Plaintiff’s deposition until after January 21, 2025.  On January 7, 2025, Defendant filed an opposition. On January 14, 2025, Plaintiff replied. II.        DISCUSSION            Plaintiff is not entitled to an order staying Plaintiff’s deposition.  Without citation to any authority, Plaintiff argues a stay is warranted because Plaintiff’s counsel’s office is short-handed, and the parties have not come to an agreement regarding the terms and conditions of the deposition.  These are not grounds to issue a stay.  If Plaintiff takes issue with the deposition notice, Plaintiff’s recourse is to serve a written objection and seek a protective order.  There is no evidence before the court that Plaintiff has taken either course of action.             Defendant requests that the court order Plaintiff to appear for deposition on January 22, 2025.  However, a motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is not before the court.  In the absence of such a request by noticed motion, the court declines to rule on Defendant’s request.III.      CONCLUSION           Plaintiff’s Motion for Stay of Proceedings is DENIED. Defendant to give notice.   Dated:   January 21, 2025                                     Kerry Bensinger    Judge of the Superior Court
