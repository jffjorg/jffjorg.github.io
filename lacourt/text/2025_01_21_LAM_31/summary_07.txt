And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has denied the plaintiff's motion to stay the deposition. The plaintiff, Anthony Espino, had requested a stay of his deposition until after January 21, 2025, citing that his counsel's office is short-handed and the parties have not agreed on the terms and conditions of the deposition. The judge found that these reasons do not warrant a stay and that the plaintiff should have taken alternative measures, such as serving a written objection and seeking a protective order. The defendant, The Regents of the University of California, had requested that the court order the plaintiff to appear for deposition on January 22, 2025, but the judge declined to rule on this request since it was not made by noticed motion.
