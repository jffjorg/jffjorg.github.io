 Case Number:  20STCV15305    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  31 Tentative Ruling Judge Kerry Bensinger, Department 31  HEARING DATE:     January 21, 2025                   TRIAL DATE:  April 1, 2025                                                          CASE:                         Randi Winter v. El Camino Community College District, et al. CASE NO.:                 20STCV15305  MOTION TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF RANDI WINTER TO PROVIDE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO DEFENDANT’S SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET TWO, AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS MOVING PARTY:               Defendant El Camino Community College District RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Randi Winter  I.         INTRODUCTION             On April 4, 2024, Defendant, El Camino Community College District, filed this Motion to Compel Plaintiff Randi Winter to Provide verified responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set Two, without objections.  Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his attorney.              The motion was heard on August 14, 2024.  In advance of the hearing, the court issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant’s motion.  Plaintiff argued the discovery requests improperly sought information protected by attorney-client privilege.  Thereafter, the parties stipulated to continue the hearing to September 23, 2024, and again, to December 6, 2024.  Additionally, the court set a briefing schedule directing the parties to address the issues raised by Plaintiff.              The motion came on for hearing on December 6, 2024.  The parties did not submit supplemental briefing but nonetheless continued the hearing to January 21, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. due to Plaintiff’s counsel’s health issues.  The parties were directed to file a status report by December 20, 2024, apprising the court of the status of discovery and the status of Plaintiff’s counsel’s health.             On December 20, 2024, the parties filed a status report.  As relevant here, the report indicates Plaintiff’s counsel has been cleared to return to full-time practice as of February 2025.  Further, Plaintiff’s counsel maintains Defendant’s discovery requests invade the attorney-client privilege as to Plaintiff and other Defendant’s employees who have consulted with Plaintiff’s counsel over the past ten years.  Plaintiff’s counsel intends to seek an in-camera inspection.  Defendant disagrees an in-camera inspection is warranted and requests the court rule on its motion.             The court now rules as follows. II.        LEGAL STANDARD If a party to whom interrogatories were directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order to compel responses without objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) ¿¿ A party moving to compel discovery responses under these statutory provisions is not required to meet and confer prior to filing the motion.¿ (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b); 2031.300, subd. (b); see also Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411 [citing Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906 for the proposition that “meet and confer” requirement “did not apply when propounding party sought order compelling responses to interrogatories and sanctions for responding party's failure to respond ‘within the statutorily permitted time’”].)¿¿¿¿¿ ¿ ¿           Monetary Sanctions¿¿ ¿¿ Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿¿¿ ¿¿¿ If sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿¿ ¿¿¿ If the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel responses to interrogatories, the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)¿  Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings) noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿¿¿ ¿¿¿¿ By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section 2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the ‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,” the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni, at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿  III.      DISCUSSION It is undisputed that Defendant properly served Plaintiff with the at-issue interrogatories on December 1, 2023 by electronic service.  It is further undisputed that Plaintiff did not provide timely responses.  (Pitts Decl., ¶¶ 3-9.)  Rather, despite objections having been waived, Plaintiff served objection-only responses on May 28, 2024.  (See Wise Decl., Ex. B.)  For this reason, Defendant seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to provide verified, objection-free responses.  In opposition, Plaintiff argues the motion should be denied because (1) Counsel for Plaintiff misplaced the interrogatories and requested Defense Counsel to furnish a copy of the same and Defense Counsel refused; (2) Counsel for Plaintiff was overextended with matters in other cases; (3) Counsel for Plaintiff was not able to provide timely responses because her laptop was being repaired; and (4) Defendant did not engage in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) in lieu of filing this motion.   Each of the foregoing grounds lacks merit.  On January 10, 2024—after the deadline to provide responses had passed—Counsel for Plaintiff requested a copy of the interrogatories from Defense Counsel.  Plaintiff’s Counsel did not provide any reason for not providing discovery responses.  Counsel did not explain that she was engaged in other matters, that she had misplaced the interrogatories, or that her laptop was being repaired. (See Wise Decl., Ex. A, 1/10/24 Email.)  Rather, the correspondence makes clear that Counsel for Plaintiff was aware of the discovery requests and failed to provide a timely response.  Given that Plaintiff did not timely respond, and served unverified, objection-only responses despite waiving objections, Plaintiff effectively did not serve responses at all.  “Unsworn responses are tantamount to no responses at all.”¿ (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)¿ Therefore, Defendant was not required to engage in an IDC in lieu of filing of this motion.  Moreover, the objections lack merit.  The interrogatories at issue seeks the identity of the persons who informed Plaintiff or his counsel about Mr. Blada’s medical condition. (See Pitts Decl., Ex. A.)  Plaintiff fails to demonstrate how a response to the interrogatory seeking the identity of such witnesses invades the attorney client privilege.  Generally, the identity of witnesses is not privileged nor are facts provided, albeit under some circumstances the information may be protected by the work product privilege.  For example, “the objecting party may be entitled to protection under the work product privilege if it can make a preliminary or foundational showing that identifying the nontestifying expert ‘would reveal the attorney's tactics, impressions, or evaluation of the case, or would result in opposing counsel taking undue advantage of the attorney's industry or efforts.’” (Curtis v. Superior Court (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 453, 472, quoting Coito v. Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th 480, 502.)  That does not appear to be this case.  Moreover, Plaintiff  fails to tender any argument in support of the assertion of attorney-client or work product privilege.  Similarly, Plaintiff fails to demonstrate sufficient basis for an in-camera inspection.  Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff to provide verified, objection-free responses. Monetary Sanctions  Defendant requests sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel of record.  The court declines to impose sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)¿  IV.       CONCLUSIONThe Motion to Compel is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified, objection-free responses within 30 days of this order.  The request for sanctions is DENIED.  Moving party to give notice.     Dated:   January 21, 2025                                     Kerry Bensinger    Judge of the Superior Court
