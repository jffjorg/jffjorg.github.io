The motion was filed on April 4, 2024, and the court heard the motion on August 14, 2024. The parties stipulated to continue the hearing, and the court set a briefing schedule. Plaintiff's counsel claimed that the discovery requests invaded attorney-client privilege, but the court found that the identity of witnesses is not privileged. The court granted the motion to compel and ordered plaintiff to provide verified, objection-free responses within 30 days. The request for sanctions was denied.
