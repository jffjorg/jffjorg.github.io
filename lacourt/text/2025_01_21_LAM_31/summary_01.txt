Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Michael Quillen v. Car City Inc., et al. (Chase Bank Finance). The case involves a dispute over a judgment entered in favor of the Plaintiff, Michael Quillen, against Car City and Chase Bank Finance. The Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Chase Bank Finance to provide verified, objection-free responses to special interrogatories, and Chase Bank Finance filed a motion for relief from waiver of objections.

The Judge found that Chase Bank Finance failed to provide timely responses to the special interrogatories and waived its right to object to the requests. The Judge also found that Chase Bank Finance's belatedly served responses were not code-compliant, as they were not verified and were incomplete and evasive.

The Judge granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel and ordered Chase Bank Finance to serve verified, objection-free responses within 20 days. The Judge also granted the Plaintiff's request for sanctions and ordered Chase Bank Finance to pay sanctions in the sum of $1,647.

Finally, the Judge denied Chase Bank Finance's motion for relief from waiver of objections. The Judge's tentative ruling will be effective unless a party files an objection or request for reconsideration within the time allowed by the Court's rules.
