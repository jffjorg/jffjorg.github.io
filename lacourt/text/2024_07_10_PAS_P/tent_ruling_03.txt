INTRODUCTION            This is a
lemon law case.On October 9, 2018, Plaintiff Jose
Garcia Ruiz (“Plaintiff”) purchased a new 2019 Honda Pilot (the “Vehicle”),
which was subject to a warranty by Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.,
(“Defendant”).On September 26, 2023, Plaintiff initiated
this lawsuit by filing a complaint alleging causes of action for (1) violation
of Song-Beverly Act – breach of express warranty, and (2) fraudulent
concealment.            On October
30, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).             On November
29, 2023, Defendant demurred to the second of cause of action as articulated in
the FAC pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure §§ 430.10 (e), (f), and
concurrently filed with notice, a proposed order, and the declaration of
Defendant’s counsel, Patrick J. Raue (“Decl. of Raue”). Plaintiff filed an
opposition on June 26, 2024. Defendant filed a reply on June 3, 2024.            The hearing
is scheduled for July 10, 2024.                        
II.         
PROCEDURAL MATTERSA.   
Timeliness of FilingsPer California Code of Civil
Procedure §¿430.40, subdivision (a), a demurrer to a complaint should be filed
within 30 days after service of the complaint. Similarly, per California Code
of Civil Procedure §¿435, subdivision (b)(1), a motion to strike should be
filed “within the time allowed to respond to a pleading,” which is 30 days.
(See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿412.20, subd. (a)(3).)Per California Code of Civil
Procedure §¿1005, subdivision (b), moving papers should be filed at least 16
court days before they are set for hearing, oppositions thereto should be filed
at least nine court days before the set hearing, and replies to any oppositions
should be filed at least five court days before the set hearing. Judges have
discretion as to whether to consider or strike an untimely demurrer or
pleading. (McAllister v. County of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253,
281; Tuck v. Thuesen (1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 193, 196, disapproved on other
grounds by Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6
Cal.3d 176.)¿Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint
was filed on October 30, 2023, and Defendant’s Demurrer with Motion to Strike
was filed on November 29, 2023. We are satisfied that all filings made in
connection with the Demurrer and Motion are timely. B.   
The Meet and Confer RequirementCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure
§¿430.41, subdivision (a) and §¿435.5, subdivision (a) requires parties to
“meet and confer” in good faith before the filing of a demurrer or a motion to
strike, respectively, to attempt to informally resolve the objections raised in
the demurrer or the motion to strike. Each section requires that such meet and
confer be done “in person or by telephone.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§¿430.1,
subd. (a), 435.5, subd. (a).)¿¿¿Defendant submits with the Demurrer and the
Motion a declaration by its counsel, which confirms that parties spoke about
the issues raised in the Demurrer and the Motion on October 16, 2023, and
November 17, 2023, but were unable to resolve their dispute before their
filings. (Raue Decl., ¶ 3.)Therefore, the Court is satisfied that this
requirement has been met.                     
III.         
LEGAL STANDARDA.   
DemurrerCode Civ. Proc. §430.10(e) provides
for a demurrer on the basis that a complaint fails to state a cause of action.A demurrer admits, provisionally
for purposes of testing the pleading, all material facts properly pleaded. Tindell v. Murphy (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th
1239, 1247.A demurrer is treated as “admitting
all material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth of “contentions,
deductions or conclusions of law.” Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.The general rule on demurrer is
that the pleadings are “deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.” Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials
Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th 593, 604.Questions of plaintiff’s ability to
prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp.
(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 213-214.A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.  A plaintiff’s allegations must be accepted as
true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable” they are. Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials
Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del
E. Webb). Allegations need not be accepted as true if they are contradicted
by judicially noticeable facts. Cansino
v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474. Pleadings are to be broadly
construed (Code Civ. Proc. §452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the
facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. Quelimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.A demurrer challenges defects
appearing on the face of the complaint or in judicially noticeable material but
cannot be based on evidence. “Speaking demurrers” are not permitted. Weil &
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023),
§7.8.Code Civ. Proc. §430.10(f) provides
for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain.Demurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible a
defendant cannot reasonably respond. A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.

ANALYSISA.   
Demurrer as to Fraudulent Concealment                                                                       
i.     Elements
of Fraudulent Concealment are MetDefendant demurs on the ground that
Plaintiff’s cause of action falls below the pleading standard. (Demurrer, p.
11.) Each element must be pleaded with particularity. (Glaski v. Bank of
America (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1090; Heritage Pacific Financial,
LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 989.) Fraud actions are subject
to “strict requirements of particularity in pleading. . . . Accordingly, the
rule is followed everywhere that fraud must be specifically pleaded. The effect
of this rule is twofold: (a) General pleading of the legal conclusion of
‘fraud’ is insufficient; the facts constituting the fraud must be alleged. (b)
Every element of the cause of action for fraud must be alleged in the proper
manner (i.e., factually and specifically), and the policy of liberal
construction of the pleadings ... will not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a
pleading defective in any material respect.” (Committee on Children’s
Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216,
superseded by statute on other grounds.) A fraud cause of action must contain:
“(1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent to
deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and (4)
resulting damages.” (Service by Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816.) Fraud based on concealment requires
that “(1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2)
the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the
plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed
the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have
been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of
the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or
suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” (Bigler-Engler
v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276, 310-311.) Less specificity is
required to plead fraud by concealment. (Ibid.) “Even under the strict rules of
common law pleading, one of the canons was that less particularity is required
when the facts lie more in the knowledge of the opposite party.” (Alfaro v.
Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 1256, 1384.Plaintiff alleges that Defendant knew
as early as 2012 that the transmission was defective because Defendant began
issuing technical service bulletins to dealers regarding the same transmission
defects that Plaintiff’s vehicle experienced. (FAC, ¶¶ 61-62.) These defects allegedly
caused a sudden violent jerking or shaking of the vehicle, creating dangerous
driving hazards and serious safety risks. (FAC, ¶¶ 13-14.) Plaintiff was
unaware about these defects and reasonably expected that the vehicle would not
experience these defects. (Id.) Further, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant had
superior knowledge of the transmission issues and had a duty to disclose such
information because the information was confidential and no amount of
Plaintiff’s diligence could have led to the discovery of these facts. (Id.
at ¶¶ 69-71.) As a result, Plaintiff alleges he has suffered diminution in
the vehicle’s value, damages to the difference between the value of the vehicle
equipped with a defective transmission and the value of the vehicle if it had
been equipped as warranted, reliance damages, and expenses relating to the vehicle’s
maintenance. (Id. at ¶ 122.)                                                                     
ii.     Transactional
Relationship is Sufficiently AllegedDefendant argues that the FAC does not adequately plead
facts sufficient to establish the existence of a legal duty to disclose because
Plaintiff has not alleged a direct transactional relationship or fiduciary duty.
(Demurrer, p. 10.)  A duty to disclose does not exist in all
circumstances. “There are ‘“four circumstances in which nondisclosure or
concealment may constitute actionable fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a
fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive
knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant
actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the
defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses some material
facts. [Citation.]”’ (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326,
336.) Where
there is no fiduciary relationship, a duty to disclose exists only where the
parties are in a direct transactional relationship. (CACI 1901; Hoffman v.
162 North Wolfe, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1178, 1187.); Dhital v.
Nissan North America, Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 828, 844 (allegations that
plaintiff bought the vehicle from defendant’s authorized dealership is
sufficient to prove the existence of a transactional relationship).
Specifically, the Court in Dhital held that the fraudulent concealment
cause of action was not barred by failure to plead a buyer-seller relationship,
as the plaintiffs alleged in that case that they bought the car from an
authorized dealership; an express warranty accompanied the vehicle; and that
the dealerships were the authorized agents of the manufacturer. (Id.)  As
review has been granted, Dhital is not binding authority but may have
persuasive value. (CRC 8.1115(e)(1).)Here, the Complaint contains
identical allegations to the plaintiffs in Dhital, namely, that the car
was bought from an authorized dealership, that the dealership and its salesman
were agents of GM, and that there was an express warranty in place. (Complaint
¶ 6.)  The court in Dhital, supra
at 844, found that plaintiffs adequately pled the existence of a relationship
between themselves and the vehicle’s manufacturer because they alleged that (1)
they bought the vehicle from the manufacturer’s dealership, (2) the
manufacturer “backed the car with an express warranty,” (3) the manufacturer’s
“authorized dealerships [were] its agents for purposes of¿the sale of [the
manufacturer’s] vehicles to consumers.”Plaintiff’s FAC alleges that
Defendant “manufactured and/or distributed hundreds of thousands of 2014-2019
Honda Pilot vehicles throughout the United States equipped with defective
transmissions. (FAC, ¶ 11). In establishing a relationship between Plaintiff
and Defendant, Plaintiff alleges that: (1) Plaintiff purchased the vehicle on
October 9, 2018, from Defendant Goudy Honda in Alhambra, California, an
authorized American Honda dealership (Id., ¶ 49), (2) Defendant’s
express written warranty covered the vehicle and Defendant entered an express
written warranty contract with Plaintiff (Id., ¶ 96-97.), and (3)
Plaintiff relied on statements made during the sales process at Gouda Honda, an
agent of Defendant, Defendant’s agents and Defendant’s marketing materials. (Id.,
¶ 52.)           
Because the Complaint alleges the existence of a transactional relationship
between the parties that supports the existence of a duty to disclose,
fraudulent concealment is sufficiently alleged.            Therefore,
Defendant’s demurrer as to the second cause of action alleged is OVERRULED.                                                                   
iii.     TollingThe delayed discovery rule does not
apply to claims for breach of implied warranties. (Nguyen v. Nissan North
America, Inc. (2020) 487 F.Supp.3d 845, 854 fn.3.) In assessing the
sufficiency of the allegations of delayed discovery, the court places the
burden on the plaintiff to ‘show diligence’; ‘conclusory allegations will not
withstand demurrer.’ ((Ibid.)” Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 808. See also NBC Universal Media, LLC v. Superior
Court (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1222, 1232.)Here, the FAC alleges that the
statute of limitations is tolled under the delayed discovery rule and the doctrine
of fraudulent concealment. (FAC ¶ 67.) Plaintiff alleges that the vehicle was
equipped with a defective transmission, and Defendant’s dealerships made
inadequate repairs, incapable of addressing the root cause of the malfunctions.
(Id., ¶ 68. Plaintiff places the date of notice
of the concealed facts “on or about April 10, 2023” (FAC ¶ 67.)  The FAC further alleges
that Plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence  by always taking the vehicle in for service or repair when needed.      The Court
finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently pled the tolling of statute of limitation
under the delayed discovery doctrine.B.   
Motion to StrikeDefendant moves to strike the FAC’s
prayer for punitive damages. (Motion to Strike, p. 2.) Given that the demurrer
is overruled, the Defendant’s motion to strike is DENIED.IV.       ORDER            Defendant American
Honda Motor., Inc.’s demurrer is OVERRULED as to the second cause of action for
fraudulent concealment.Defendant American Honda Motor.,
Inc.’s motion to strike punitive damages from Plaintiff’s FAC is DENIED. Counsel for Plaintiff to give
notice of this order.                  Dated: July 10, 2024                                                                                JARED D. MOSES
