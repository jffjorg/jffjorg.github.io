Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to quash service of summons and to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by Defendant Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc. is GRANTED. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff, Chris Szajner, has not met his initial burden of submitting evidence to support the conclusion that the Court has jurisdiction over the Defendant. The Judge also finds that based on the evidence submitted, the Defendant is entitled to an order quashing service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Judge notes that while the Plaintiff argues that the Defendant has minimum contacts and/or systemic and continuous contacts in the State of California, the Plaintiff has not provided any evidence to support this claim. The Judge further notes that the Defendant is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Virginia, and that the Defendant's Vice President and Secretary have stated that the Defendant does not own, lease, occupy, manage, or control the hotel where the Plaintiff stayed. The Judge orders that the Defendant provide notice of this ruling.
