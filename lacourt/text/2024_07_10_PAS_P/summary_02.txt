And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to compel Caroline Bernstein, a non-party, to comply with a deposition subpoena. The subpoena was served on April 2, 2024, and required Bernstein to produce records by April 18, 2024. Despite no response being received, the motion is unopposed. The judge finds that the subpoena was properly served and that Bernstein has apparent knowledge of the situation and made claims that incriminate the plaintiff against the defendant. Therefore, the judge orders Bernstein to comply with the subpoena and grants the motion to compel.
