And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the judgment. The plaintiff had previously filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, which was also denied. The judge notes that the plaintiff failed to provide specific details about the events that allegedly prevented him from prosecuting his case, including the date of his father's death and the reasons for his failure to appear in court. The judge also finds that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate service of the motion on the defendant. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has not shown sufficient grounds to set aside the judgment and denies the motion.
