And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the second cause of action in the First Amended Complaint. The demurrer, filed by Defendant Hernan Hernandez, is sustained without leave to amend. The motion to strike the request for punitive damages is moot.

The second cause of action alleges fraud and conspiracy by Defendant Flores and Defendant Hernandez. However, the Judge finds that the allegations are insufficient to show fraud by Defendant Hernandez. The Judge also holds that the allegations do not support a claim of conspiracy to commit fraud.

The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for intentional misrepresentation and has failed to allege a conspiracy to commit fraud. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the motion to strike is moot. Defendant Hernandez is ordered to serve and file his Answer on or before November 30, 2023.
