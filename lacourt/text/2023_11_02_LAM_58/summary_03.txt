Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Dr. Koos, a physician who was investigated by UCLA and filed a Section 1278.5 action. UCLA is asserting issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) based on a previous decision, arguing that the court need not address the issue of whether a "mixed-motive" defense applies to the Section 1278.5 claim. The judge has determined that collateral estoppel applies and need not address the mixed-motive defense. The judge has also cited several previous court decisions to support its ruling, including Armin v. Riverside Community Hospital, Bogue v. Sharp Memorial Hospital, and Onkvisit v. Board of Trustees of California State University.
