reply, UCLA reiterates that it is asserting issue preclusion – not claim
preclusion. (Reply 3:1-5 [“Dr. Koos appears to be conflating res judicata with
collateral estoppel. UCLA is not suggesting res judicata (claim preclusion)
applies, but that collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) applies. (See Mot. at
p. 11.)”].)


[2]           In Armin
v. Riverside Community Hospital (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 810, 814, the court of
appeal held that a physician need not even complete the internal peer review
process prior to filing a section 1278.5 action.

v. Sharp Memorial Hospital (Cal. Ct. App., Apr. 19, 2022, No. D077195) 2022
WL 1165857, at *13 [applying claim preclusion under res judicata to a section
1278.5 claim]; Onkvisit v. Board of
Trustees of California State University
(Cal. Ct. App., July 25, 2012, No. H036735) 2012 WL 3029780, at *5 [[applying
issue preclusion to a California Whistleblower Protection Act under
Government code section 8547].) 


[4]           Based
on the foregoing, the Court need not address the final question of whether a
“mixed- motive” defense applies to Plaintiff’s Section 1278.5 claim. (Mot.,
16:14-17 [“For the reasons just discussed, collateral estoppel defeats Dr.
Koos’ entire claim. But even if the Court disagrees, collateral estoppel at the
very least affirmatively establishes UCLA’s “mixed motive” or “same decision”
affirmative defense; that is, UCLA would have made the same decision regardless
of any allegedly retaliatory motives for investigating him in the first
place.”) A determination on this issue would only limit Plaintiff’s available
remedies to injunctive relief and declaratory relief but would not dispose of
the entire claim. (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203,
241 [“If the employer proves by a preponderance of the evidence that it would
have made the same decision for lawful reasons, then the plaintiff cannot be
awarded damages, backpay, or an order of reinstatement.”].)
