And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for summary judgment filed by the Defendant, Regents of the University of California, in the case of Koos v. Regents of the University of California. The case involves an employment dispute between the Plaintiff, Brian J. Koos, M.D., Ph.D., and the Defendant, regarding the Plaintiff's discipline for violating HIPAA and UCLA Health's privacy policies.

The Judge holds that the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars the Plaintiff from relitigating the issue of whether the Defendant's discipline was wrongful, as it has already been finally adjudicated in a prior administrative proceeding and writ of mandamus petition. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity to present his case in the administrative proceeding and subsequently in the writ of mandamus petition, and that the same issue is being relitigated in this civil action.

The Judge also holds that the Plaintiff's allegations of retaliation are barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, as the same issue was raised in the prior administrative proceeding and writ of mandamus petition. The Judge concludes that the Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted, and a proposed Judgment will be submitted and served within 10 days.
