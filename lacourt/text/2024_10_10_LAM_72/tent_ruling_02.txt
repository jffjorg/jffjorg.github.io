 Hearing Date:  October 10, 2024
 Calendar Number:  9



 
 
 
Defendant UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company (“Defendant”)
demurs to the Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Emsurgcare and Emergency Surgical
Assistance (“ESA”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).
 
The Court OVERRULES the demurrer.
 
Background
 
            This
is a health insurance dispute. The following facts are taken from the
allegations of the Complaint, which the Court accepts as true for the purposes
of the demurrer.
 
            Plaintiffs
are medical companies that provide medical services to patients. Defendant is a
health insurance provider.
 
            Plaintiffs
allege that a patient to whom they provided emergency medical services (the
“Patient”) received health insurance through Defendant pursuant to an insurance
agreement (the “Plan”). Emsurgcare billed $65,000.00 to Defendant for services
rendered to the Patient. Defendant determined that $3,082.22 would be paid. ESA
billed $63,000.00, of which Defendant paid nothing.
 
            Plaintiffs
allege that Defendant satisfies the definition of a Health Care Service Plan
under Health & Safety Code, section 1345, subd. (f), which includes “[a]ny
person who undertakes to arrange for the provision of health care services to
subscribers or enrollees, or to pay for or to reimburse any part of the cost
for those services, in return for a prepaid or periodic charge paid by or on
behalf of the subscribers or enrollees.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 1345, subd.
(f).) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant meets this definition because all
issuances of payment for the medical services at issue in this case come from
Defendant.
 
            Plaintiffs
allege that they are entitled to the lesser of the actually billed charges or
the then-current usual, customary, and reasonable rate for the medical services
provided.
 
            Plaintiffs
filed this action on April 2, 2024, raising one claim for quantum meruit.
 
            Defendant
demurred to the Complaint on September 16, 2024. Plaintiffs filed an opposition
and Defendants filed a reply.
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
The Court grants the parties’ requests for judicial notice
and takes notice of the submitted public records. The Court solely takes
judicial notice of the existence of the records, and not the truth of any facts
contained therein.
 
Legal Standard
 
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has
been filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to
the pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
 
(a) The court has
no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.
(c) There is
another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is
uncertain. As used in this subdivision, “uncertain” includes ambiguous and
unintelligible.
(g) In an action
founded upon a contract, it cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the
contract is written, is oral, or is implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10.)
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Discussion
 
            Under
the Knox Keene Act, Health & Safety Code, sections 1340 et seq., “[a]
health care service plan, or its contracting medical providers, shall reimburse
providers for emergency services and care provided to its enrollees, until the
care results in stabilization of the enrollee[.]” (Health & Saf. Code, §
1371.4, subd. (b).) Where an insurance provider violates section 1371.4, the
medical service provider in question has an implied-in-law right to recover for
the reasonable value of its services. (Bell v. Blue Cross of California
(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 211, 221.)
 
Whether Defendant is a Health Care Service Plan
 
            Plaintiffs
allege that Defendant satisfies the definition of a Health Care Service Plan
under Health & Safety Code, section 1345, subd. (f), which includes “[a]ny
person who undertakes to arrange for the provision of health care services to
subscribers or enrollees, or to pay for or to reimburse any part of the cost
for those services, in return for a prepaid or periodic charge paid by or on
behalf of the subscribers or enrollees.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 1345,
subd. (f) [emphasis added].) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant meets this
definition because all issuances of payment for the medical services at issue
in this case come from Defendant.
 
Defendant argues that this definition is inapplicable due to
provisions of the Plan, provided in the Declaration of Jane Stalinski, stating
that Defendant does not provide medical services or make treatment decisions.
(See Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice, Stalinski Decl., A Ex. at p. 58.)
Notwithstanding the Court’s judicial notice of the fact that the plan was an
exhibit in a separate case, the Court is not able to rely on those filings to
establish the truth of the contents of the exhibit. Nor is external evidence
otherwise permitted in order to resolve a demurrer. Furthermore, even if the
Court were to take Defendant’s factual assertions as true, they do not disprove
Plaintiff’s allegation that Defendant undertook to reimburse the cost of the
Patient’s medical services.
 
Defendant argues that the Chief Counsel of the Department of
Managed Health Care (“DMHC”) confirmed in a letter that Defendant is not a
Health Care Service Plan, is not regulated by the DMHC, and is not subject to
the Knox-Keene Act. (See Slaught Decl. ¶ 3; Defendant’s Request for Judicial
Notice, Ex. 2.) These assertions rely on facts and nonbinding legal opinions
contained in the materials submitted for judicial notice – which the Court
cannot rely on as evidence.
 
“This chapter
shall not apply to:
 
“(1)
A person organized and operating pursuant to a certificate issued by the
Insurance Commissioner unless the entity is directly providing the health care
service through those entity-owned or contracting health facilities and
providers, in which case this chapter shall apply to the insurer's plan and to
the insurer.”
 
(Health & Saf. Code, § 1343,
subd. (e).)
 
Defendant argues that it is undisputed that Defendant is
organized and operating pursuant to a certificate issued by the Insurance
Commissioner. Again, however, Defendant relies on judicially noticed materials
to prove the truth of this matter.
 
Finally, Defendant cites a large number of unpublished
federal cases the courts indicated that Defendant or related entities were not
subject to the Knox-Keenes Act. (Demurrer at pp. 8:19-10:28; see Namdy
Consulting Inc. v. UnitedHealthcare Ins. Co. 2018 WL 6507890, at *3 (C.D.
Ca. Dec. 7, 2018); Ata Mazaheri, M.D., Inc. v. UnitedHealthcare Ins. Co. Inc.,
2023 WL 5167362, at *7-9 (C.D. Cal. July 10, 2023); Emsurgcare v.
UnitedHealthcare Ins. Co., 2024 WL 3742707, *6 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 8, 2024); Torres
v. United Healthcare Ins. Co., 2024 WL 3498861, *11 (C.D. Cal. June 28,
2024); Talbot v. Pyure Brands LLC (Talbot I), 2023 WL 8191127, * 3 (C.D.
Cal. Oct. 27, 2023); Talbot v. Pyure Brands Welfare Benefit Plan (Talbot II),
2024 WL 242468 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 4. 2024); Sanjiv Goel, M.D., Inc. v. United
Healthcare Servs., Inc. (Goel v. UHS), 2024 WL 1361800 (C.D. Cal. Mar 29,
2024); Emsurgcare v. UnitedHealthcare Ins. Co., 2024 WL 2892319, *6
(C.D. Cal. June 7, 2024).)
 
While those cases may be considered as persuasive authority,
they do not conclusively resolve the factual issues in this case. The Court
therefore finds that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Defendant is a
Health Care Service Plan.
While the Court concludes that it cannot decide this issue
at the demurrer stage, if Defendant believes this issue is clear, the Court
will entertain an early and focused summary judgment motion on the issue.
 
Failure to State a Claim
 
“Quantum meruit refers to the well-established principle
that the law implies a promise to pay for services performed under
circumstances disclosing that they were not gratuitously rendered. To recover
in quantum meruit, a party need not prove the existence of a contract, but it
must show the circumstances were such that the services were rendered under
some understanding or expectation of both parties that compensation therefor
was to be made.” (Chodos v. Borman (2014)
227 Cal.App.4th 76, 96, citations and quotation marks omitted.) Generally, “in
order to recover under a quantum meruit theory, a plaintiff must establish both
[1] that he or she was acting pursuant to either an express or implied request
for such services from the defendant and [2] that the services rendered were
intended to and did benefit the defendant.” (Day v. Alta Bates Medical Center (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 243, 248.)
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to allege that
Defendant requested that Plaintiffs perform the medical services at issue. The
Court disagrees that this is a requirement. “[T]he health care plans’ duty to
reimburse arises out of the providers’ duty to render services without regard
to a patient’s insurance status or ability to pay. … [T]he protection the
Legislature granted to the providers [requires that] the duty to reimburse must
be read as a duty to pay a reasonable and customary amount for the services
rendered.” (Bell v. Blue Cross of California (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 211,
220.) Thus, where the Knox Keene Act applies, the duty to reimburse arises out
of the emergency treatment of the insured patient – not out of the insurance
company’s request that the services be performed.
 
            Thus,
the failure to allege that Defendant requested the Patient’s treatment does not
defeat the quantum meruit claim.
 
ERISA Preemption
 
Defendant argues that the Employment Retirement Income
Security Act (“ERISA”) preempts Plaintiffs’ quantum meruit claim.
 
Under ERISA, “a state-law cause of action is completely
preempted if (1) ‘an individual, at some point in time, could have brought
[the] claim under ERISA § 502(a)(1)(B),’ and (2) ‘where there is no other
independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant's actions.’
[Citation.]” (Marin General Hosp. v. Modesto & Empire Traction Co.
(9th Cir. 2009) 581 F.3d 941, 946.) State law legal duties are not independent
of ERISA where “interpretation of the terms of respondents' benefit plans forms
an essential part of … [the] claim”, and “liability would exist … only because
of [the] administration of ERISA-regulated benefit plans.” (Aetna Health
Inc. v. Davila (2004) 542 U.S. 200, 213.)
 
Second, ERISA expressly preempts all state laws “insofar as
they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan” under ERISA. (29
U.S.C. § 1144.) “A law ‘relates to’ an employee benefit plan, … if it has a
connection with or reference to such a plan.” (Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.
(1983) 463 U.S. 85, 96–97.) “A state-law claim has a ‘ “reference to” an ERISA
plan’ if it ‘is premised on the existence of an ERISA plan’ or if ‘the
existence of the plan is essential to the claim's survival.’ [Citation.]” (Depot,
Inc. v. Caring for Montanans, Inc. (9th Cir. 2019) 915 F.3d 643, 665.)
 
To argue preemption, Defendant again rely on facts external
to the pleadings, arguing that “Plaintiffs strategically omit that the
Patient’s Plan is governed by ERISA.” (Demurrer at p. 14:7-8.) Defendants rely
on judicially noticed materials to prove this fact. Specifically, Defendant
asks the Court to rule in line with a court order sustaining Defendant’s
demurrer in Ventura County Superior Court Case No. 2023CUB010724, which found
that judicially noticed materials in that case showed that Defendant was
an ERISA plan. This string of judicial notice is too attenuated to justify
bringing in new facts for consideration on demurrer. The Court does not find
that Defendant has established, at the pleading stage, that the Plan at issue
was governed by ERISA.
 
The Court therefore overrules the demurrer.
