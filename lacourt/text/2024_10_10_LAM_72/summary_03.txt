**Summary in English text:**

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Megan Denkers Baca vs. Donna Stewart, Case No. 24STCV16765. The case is a landlord-tenant dispute regarding the condition of the property at 338 Orizaba Av., #2, Long Beach, California 90814.

The Defendant, Donna Stewart, has moved to strike the Plaintiff's demand for punitive damages. The Court has denied the motion, finding that the Plaintiff has adequately alleged malice and oppression. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to repair various leaks in the property, despite complaints, and that the repair company, Coastline, was instructed not to inform the Plaintiff of the progress on repairs when the apartment was flooded.

The Court has found that the facts, taken together, could allow a reasonable jury to make a finding of malice or oppression. The Plaintiff has alleged a pattern of the Defendant's failure to repair leaks and ignore tenant complaints, which could support an award of punitive damages.

The case is set for hearing on October 10, 2024.
