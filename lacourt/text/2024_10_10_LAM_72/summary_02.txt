Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, overruling the demurrer filed by UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company (Defendant) to the Complaint filed by Emsurgcare and Emergency Surgical Assistance (Plaintiffs). The Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Defendant is a Health Care Service Plan under Health & Safety Code, section 1345, subd. (f). The Court also finds that Defendant's argument that Plaintiffs' quantum meruit claim is preempted by ERISA is without merit, as the Court cannot determine at the pleading stage whether the plan at issue is governed by ERISA.

The Court notes that the Knox Keene Act requires health care service plans to reimburse providers for emergency services and care provided to their enrollees, and that Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendant has failed to reimburse them for the reasonable value of their services. The Court finds that Defendant's argument that it is not a Health Care Service Plan because it is organized and operating pursuant to a certificate issued by the Insurance Commissioner is unpersuasive, as the Court cannot rely on judicially noticed materials to prove the truth of this matter.

The Court will entertain an early and focused summary judgment motion on the issue of whether Defendant is a Health Care Service Plan.
