And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Daniel Moore, is seeking judgment against the defendant, Maria Litwin, for breach of an oral contract. Moore claims that Litwin borrowed $65,000 from him with an oral promise to repay within 60 days, and that Litwin has failed to repay the loan. Litwin argues that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations, which requires that a breach of contract claim be brought within two years of the breach.

The judge found that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the statute of limitations applies to this case. Moore did not provide any evidence of a written promise to repay, and Litwin denied making any verbal promises to repay. The judge also found that the equitable estoppel doctrine, which might revive a stale claim, is not applicable in this case.

The judge's decision means that the case will proceed to a trial, where the parties will present evidence and argue their positions in front of a jury.
