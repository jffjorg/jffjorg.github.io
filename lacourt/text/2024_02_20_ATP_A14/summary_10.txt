```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrers filed by AVHD are sustained, and the plaintiff is given leave to amend. The judge identifies several defects in the plaintiff's complaint, including:

* The complaint fails to state a cause of action for medical negligence.
* The complaint fails to state a cause of action for dependent adult neglect/abuse.
* The complaint fails to state a cause of action for survivor action.
* The complaint fails to state a cause of action for wrongful death.

The judge instructs the parties to meet and confer prior to filing any further pleadings and provides guidance on how to amend the complaint to cure the defects.
