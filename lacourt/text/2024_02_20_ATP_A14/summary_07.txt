And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion to vacate and set aside the December 12, 2023 order. The plaintiff alleges wrongful foreclosure and seeks to have the order set aside. The court has determined that the order on the demurrer is not void and that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to establish fraud or extrinsic fraud. The court has also taken judicial notice of certain documents and records and has considered the parties' filings and arguments. The court has ruled that the doctrine of res judicata applies and that the plaintiff's claims have been previously litigated and resolved. The court has denied the motion and has tentatively ruled that the order will stand.
