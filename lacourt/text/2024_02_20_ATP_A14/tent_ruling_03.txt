 Case Number:  22AVCV00740    Hearing Date:   February 20, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a lemon law action.
Plaintiff Maria C Medrano (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on about April 05, 2021,
in exchange for valuable consideration, Plaintiff purchased a 2021 Chevrolet
Silverado from Defendant General Motors LLC (“Defendant”) with Vehicle Identification
Number 3GCPWDED9MG238768 (the “Subject Vehicle”) and, in connection with the
purchase, Plaintiff received an express written warranty in which Defendant
undertook to preserve or maintain the utility or performance of the Vehicle or
to provide compensation if there is a failure in utility or performance for a
specified period of time. Plaintiff further alleges that during the warranty
period, the Subject Vehicle contained or developed defects, including but not
limited to, defective electrical system, defective engine, defective ignition
system, and “[a]ny additional complaints made by Plaintiff, whether or not they
are contained in the records or on any repair orders.” (Complaint ¶ 12(d).)
Plaintiff presents that the defects violate the express written warranties
issued by Defendant, as well as the implied warranty of merchantability, and
Plaintiff provided Defendant and its representatives the Subject Vehicle in a
state sufficient opportunity to service of repair the Subject Vehicle, and
Defendant and its representatives were unable and/or failed to service or
repair the Subject Vehicle within a reasonable number of attempts. Plaintiff
contends that the alleged defects have substantially impaired the safety, use,
and/or vale of the Subject Vehicle and that she will continue to be financially
damaged due to Defendant’s failure to comply with the provisions of the express
and implied warranties. 
 
On September 26, 2022, Plaintiff
filed her Complaint alleging five causes of action for: (1) Violation of
Subdivision (d) of Cal. Civ. Code § 1793.2; (2) Violation of Subdivision (b) of
Cal. Civ. Code § 1793.2; (3) Violation of Subdivision (a)(3) of Cal. Civ. Code
§ 1793.2; (4) Breach of Express Written Warranty Civ. Code § 1791.2 Subdivision
(a), Section 1794; and (5) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability
Cal. Civ. Code §1791.1, Section 1794.
On November 14, 2022, Defendant
filed its Complaint.
 
On August 28, 2023, the Court
continued Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) from August 28, 2023 to October
06, 2023. 
 
The parties attempted to meet and
confer and stipulated to move the IDC from October 06, 2023 a date two weeks
after October 31, 2023. The Court set the IDC for November 21, 2023.
 
On October 27, 2023, the Court
continued the IDC to December 20, 2023. 
 
On December 20, 2023, the Court
held the IDC. The Court gave permission to the parties to file Motions to
Compel to be set for hearing on February 20, 2024. 
 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff
filed her Motion to Compel Further.
 
On February 05, 2024, Defendant
filed its Opposition. 
 
On February 09, 2024, Plaintiff
filed her Reply.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Compelling Further Responses to
Requests for Production (“RFPs”) – “Unless otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with
this title, any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action or to the determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter
either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §
2017.010.)¿For discovery purposes, information is regarded as relevant “if it
might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or
facilitating settlement thereof.” (City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court¿(2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 272, 288.)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
A motion to compel further responses to a
demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought based
on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive, or
incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.¿ (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿2031.310(a).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿ 
Notice of the motion must be given within 45
days of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or
before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the responding
party have agreed in writing. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(c).)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
A motion to compel further production must
set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by
the inspection demand. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc., §¿2031.310(b)(1).) In¿Digital
Music News LLC v Superior Court¿(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the
Court defined “good cause” as a showing that there¿is¿“a disputed fact that is
of consequence in the action and the discovery sought will tend in reason to
prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove
or disprove the fact.”¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
If the moving party has shown good cause for
the requests for production, the burden is on the objecting party to justify
the objections. (Kirkland v.¿Sup. Ct¿(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92,
98.)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
“The court shall limit the scope of
discovery if it determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of that
discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Cal. Code of Civ.¿Proc. §
2017.020(a).) Generally, objections on the ground of burden require the
objecting party to produce evidence of (a) the propounding party’s subjective
intent to create burden, or (b) the amount of time and effort it would take to
actually respond. (See¿West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Superior
Court In and For Los Angeles County¿(1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) However,
where discovery is obviously overbroad on its face, no such evidence is
necessary. (See¿Obregon v. Superior Court¿(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th
424, 431.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Trial courts are vested with “wide
discretion” to allow or prohibit discovery. (Williams v. Superior Court¿(2017)
3 Cal.5th 531, 540.)¿¿¿¿

Discussion
 
Application – 
 
RFP No. 7: 
 
The Warranty
Policy and Procedure Manual published by YOU and provided to YOUR authorized
repair facility(s), within the state of California, from 2021 to the present.
[This request will be understood to include production of any and all versions
of such manual as distributed to YOUR dealerships during the relevant time
frame.
 
Response: 
 
GM objects to
this Request on grounds the terms “published” and “provided” are vague and
ambiguous. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it is overbroad and seeks
documents that are irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence as it is not limited to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at
issue in this action. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it is
burdensome and oppressive, and that compliance would be unreasonably difficult
and expensive considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and
the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. This is a simple,
individual lemon law case with limited issues and this request violates Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 61
Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically, whether Plaintiff is entitled to relief under
the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entirely unrelated and incommensurate
to the scope and breadth of this Request. GM also objects to this Request to
the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and trade secret information. GM
further objects to this Request to the extent it seeks information protected by
the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product doctrine. No documents will
be produced.
 
(Separate Statement 3:20-4:10.) 
 
The Court applies the plain
meaning of the words objected to by Defendant. Regarding privilege, “[i]n
general, when a party asserts the attorney-client privilege, that party has the
burden of showing the preliminary facts necessary to support the privilege…
After this burden is met, or where there is no dispute concerning the
preliminary facts, the burden shifts to the party opposing the privilege to
show either the claimed privilege does not apply, an exception exists, or there
has been an express or implied waiver. [Citation].” (Venture Law Group v.
Superior Court (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 96, 102 [internal citations
omitted].).” Defendant has failed to meet its initial burden of demonstrating
that the privilege of attorney-client relationship applies. Moreover, the
work-product doctrine is divided into two types – absolute privilege and
qualified protection – and work-product doctrine designed to protect writings
that reflect “an attorney's impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal
research or theories.” (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2018.030.) Work-product
privilege does not appear to be applicable to a request seeking published
documents (i.e., Warranty Policy and Procedure Manuals) that have been
distributed by Defendant. (See Code of Civ. Proc. § 2018.030.) Likewise, such
documents are published to the public and has been distributed, at a minimum,
to Defendant’s authorized repair facilities and its workers and does not appear
to fall under confidential communication between Defendant and its attorney.
(See Cal. Evid. Code § 954.) As to burdensome and oppressive, discovery burden
is “undue” only if the inconvenience and expense of responding clearly
outweighs the benefits likely to be obtained if the interrogatories are
answered. (Weil & Brown, CPG: Civ. Proc. Before Trial (TRG 2021)
§8:1475.13, citing Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2031.210(d).) The objecting party is
required to provide evidence to support its claim of undue or excessive burden
that shows the amount of work required, otherwise, the trial court has nothing
“upon which to base a comparative judgment that any responsive burden would be
undue or excessive, relative to the likelihood of admissible evidence being
discovered.” (Id. [citing Williams v. Sup. Ct. (Marshalls of CA, LLC)
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549-550].) Further, as held in West Pico Furniture Co.
v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, reiterated in Mead Reinsurance
Co. v. Superior Court (1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 313, 320-21, and incorporated
into CA Pretrial Civil Procedure: The Wagstaffe Group § 42-III, “[oppression]
must not be equated with burden [all discovery imposes some burden on the
opposition]. . . . to support an objection of oppression there must be some
showing . . . that the ultimate effect of the burden is incommensurate with the
result sought.” Defendant has not made no such showing. Additionally, the
request at hand is distinct from Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216 (“Calcor Space Facility”) The
requests in Calcor Space Facility read: “Request No. 1. [P] The Gun
Mounts, including but not limited to documents relating to the design,
modification, engineering manufacture, testing, rejection, revision,
modification, or acceptance of the Gun Mounts or any subassemblies or
components manufactured in connection with the Gun Mount Project. [P] Request
No. 2. [P] All purchase orders, amendments to purchase orders, engineering
change orders, drawings, specifications, invoices, rejection reports, accident
reports and Material Review Board ('MRB') authorization reports relating to the
Gun Mounts or the Gun Mount Project. [P] Request No. 3. [P] All requests for
quotation ('RFQ') or requests for proposal ('RFP') in connection with the Gun
Mounts or the Gun Mount Project. [P] Request No. 4. [P] All bid materials,
including but not limited to cost estimates, labor estimates, and production
time estimates prepared for and submitted by Calcor in connection with the Gun
Mount Project.” (Calcor Space Facility, supra, 53 Cal.App.4th at
219-220.) The Calcor Space Facility Court noted each of these 32
"requests" was expanded by 6 pages of definitions and instructions,”
and, although facially detailed and particularized, the demand, ordered Calcor
to “produce everything in its possession which has anything to do with gun
mounts (including the gun mount assemblies themselves).” (Id. at 220.)
This, on its face, is distinguished from documents that have been published and
disseminated by Defendant. Further, Calcor did not discuss RFPS, but
rather subpoenas to non-parties under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2020(d), now Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2020.010 – 2020.030. To the extent that this objection is to
protect trade secrets and/or proprietary information, whether information
constitutes a trade secret is a question of fact. (Amgen, Inc. v. California
Correctional Health Care Services (2020) 47 Cal.App.5th 716, 733.) The
party claiming the trade secret privilege has the burden of establishing that
the trade secret exists. (Ibid.) It must establish that the information
holds independent economic value because it is not generally known and is
subject to efforts to maintain its secrecy. (Ibid.) If the party meets
this burden, then the party seeking discovery of the trade secret must make a
prima facie, particularized showing that the information sought is relevant
and necessary to proof of a material element of one or more causes of action
presented in the case and that it is reasonable to conclude that the
information is essential to a fair resolution of the lawsuit. (Bridgestone/Firestone,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1393.) It is then up to
the court to balance the interests of both sides and consider a protective
order for the discovery sought. (Ibid.) Defendant has not met its burden
to establish that the trade secret exits. 
 
The Court does, however, find
that Defendant’s objection regarding overbroad contains merit. The RFP at issue
does not limit the publications by vehicle and, as such, encompasses all of
Defendant’s models of vehicles in the given time period. 
 
Accordingly, the Court limits
this request to vehicles with the same year, make, and model as the Subject
Vehicle (undisclosed in the Complaint) as the underlying issue that Plaintiff
seeks is the alleged engine issue (as presented by the motion in the
Introduction and Plaintiff’s Relevant Repair History sections). To the extent
Defendant raises objections based on privilege, Defendant must “provide
sufficient factual information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that
claim, including, if necessary, a privilege log.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.240(c).) 
 
RFP No. 10:
 
A copy of the
Workshop Manual or Electronic Service Manual specifying diagnosis and repair
procedures for vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT
VEHICLE.
 
Response:
 
GM objects to
this Request on grounds it is overbroad and seeks documents that are irrelevant
and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence,
as it is not limited in scope to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at issue in this action.
Subject to and without waiving these objections, GM responds that shop manuals
for various model years and vehicles are equally available to all parties, and
can be obtained by writing to: Helm, Incorporated, Publications Division, Post
Office Box 07150, Detroit, Michigan 48207, toll-free telephone (800) 782-4356.
No documents will be produced. 
 
(Separate Statement 9:12-22.)
 
The Court believes that the
request is calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence as it
seeks manuals for vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT
VEHICLE.
 
As to equal availability, under Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. section 2030.220(c) an objection on the ground of equal
availability can be made to an interrogatory, but such an objection is usually
limited to cases when a propounding party seeks to force another party to
search public records equally available to both. (See Alpine Mutual Water
Co. v. Superior Court (1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 45, 53.) However, this is an
RFP. Article 2 Response to Inspection Demand (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.210 -
2031.320) does not mention equal availability. This objection is improper. 
 
Accordingly, the RFP at issue
must be answered.  To the extent
Defendant raises objections based on privilege, Defendant must “provide sufficient
factual information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim,
including, if necessary, a privilege log.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.240(c).) 
 
 
RFP No. 16:
 
All DOCUMENTS,
including but not limited to electronically stored information and electronic
mails, concerning or relating to any internal analysis or investigation by YOU
or on YOUR behalf regarding the ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT in vehicles of the same
year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE. [This request shall be
interpreted to include, but not be limited to, any such investigation to
determine the root cause of such ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT, any such investigation
to design a permanent repair procedure for such ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT, any such
investigation into the failure rates of parts associated with such ENGINE
SYSTEM DEFECT, any cost analysis for implementing a proposed repair procedures,
any savings analysis not implementing a proposed repair procedures, etc.]
 
Response:
 
GM objects to
this Request on grounds the terms “concerning or relating to,” “internal
analysis,” “investigation,” and “ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT” are vague and ambiguous.
GM also objects to this Request on grounds it improperly assumes that there are
alleged defects with respect to the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or GM Vehicles, generally.
GM also objects to this Request on grounds it is overbroad and seeks documents
that are irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence as it is not limited to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at issue in
this action. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it is burdensome and
oppressive, and that compliance would be unreasonably difficult and expensive
considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and the
importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. This is a simple,
individual lemon law case with limited issues and this request violates Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 61
Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically, whether Plaintiff is entitled to relief under
the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entirely unrelated and incommensurate
to the scope and breadth of this Request. GM also objects to this Request to
the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and trade secret information. GM
further objects to this Request to the extent it seeks information protected by
the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product doctrine. No documents will
be produced.
 
(Separate Statement 16:22-17:20.)
 
Defendant’s objection to “ENGINE
SYSTEM DEFECT” is not well taken. The RFPs define the term on page three,
paragraph five. (See Decl. Iraida Gonzalez, Exh. 6 at p. 3 ¶ 5.) As to the
other terms, the Court applies the plain meaning of the words. As to this
objection – “GM also objects to this Request on grounds it improperly assumes
that there are alleged defects with respect to the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or GM
Vehicles, generally” – the basis of this Complaint is alleged defects within
the Subject Vehicle. Plaintiff seeks discovery to prepare her case. As to the
objections regarding burden; Calcor Space Facility; attorney-client and
work product privilege; and confidential, proprietary, and trade secret
information, the Court directs the parties to its discussion in RFP No. 7.
Defendant does not meet its initial burden. 
 
The Court believes that the
request is calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence as it
seeks electronically stored information and electronic mails, concerning or
relating to any internal analysis or investigation for vehicles of the same
year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
To the extent Defendant raises
objections based on privilege, Defendant must “provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c).) 
 
RFP No. 17:
 
All DOCUMENTS,
including but not limited to electronically stored information and electronic
mails, concerning or relating to any communications YOU have had regarding
ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT in vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the
SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
Response: 
 
GM objects to
this Request on grounds the terms “concerning or relating to,”
“communications,” and “ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT” are vague and ambiguous. GM also
objects to this Request on grounds it improperly assumes that there are alleged
defects with respect to the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or GM Vehicles, generally. GM also
objects to this Request on grounds it is overbroad and seeks documents that are
irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence as it is not limited to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at issue in this action.
GM also objects to this Request on grounds it is burdensome and oppressive, and
that compliance would be unreasonably difficult and expensive considering the
needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues
at stake in the litigation. This is a simple, individual lemon law case with
limited issues and this request violates Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 61 Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically,
whether Plaintiff is entitled to relief under the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act is entirely unrelated and incommensurate to the scope and breadth
of this Request. GM also objects to this Request to the extent it seeks
confidential, proprietary and trade secret information. GM further objects to
this Request to the extent it seeks information protected by the
attorney-client privilege and/or work-product doctrine. No documents will be
produced.
 
(Separate Statement 27:7-27.) 
 
The Court incorporates its
analysis for RFP No. 16 as for this RFP. The Court applies the plain meaning of
“communications.”
 
To the extent Defendant raises
objections based on privilege, Defendant must “provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c).) 
 
RFP No. 18:
 
All DOCUMENTS,
including but not limited to electronically stored information and electronic
mails, concerning or relating to any decision to issue any notices, letters,
campaigns, warranty extensions, technical service bulletins and recalls
concerning the ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT in vehicles of the same year, make, and
model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
Response:
 
GM objects to
this Request on grounds the terms “concerning or relating to,” “issue,” and
“ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT” are vague and ambiguous. GM also objects to this Request
on grounds it improperly assumes that there are alleged defects with respect to
the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or GM Vehicles, generally. GM also objects to this Request

seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or
work-product doctrine. 
 
Subject to and
without waiving these objections, GM will comply in part and produce the
following documents in its possession, custody and control: a list of Technical
Service Bulletins (“TSBs”) and a list of Information Service Bulletins (“ISBs”)
for vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE. After it
has produced the lists of TSBs and ISBs, GM will – at Plaintiff’s request –
search for and produce, if located, copies of a reasonable number of TSBs and
ISBs, if any, that Plaintiff has identified as relevant to the conditions
alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint.
 
(Separate Statement 37:12-38:11.)
 
The Court incorporates its
analysis for RFP No. 16 as for this RFP. The Court applies the plain meaning of
“issue.”
 
As to the second part of
Defendant’s response, “[t]he party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling has been directed shall respond separately to each item or
category of item by any of the following: (1) A statement that the party will
comply with the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling
by the date set for the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 2031.030 and any related
activities[;] (2) A representation that the party lacks the ability to comply
with the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of a particular
item or category of item[;] (3) An objection to the particular demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.210(a).) Defendant has stated that it will make a partial compliance. However,
part of Defendant’s response indicates that location of documents is at issue. In
enacting an application of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.220 and 2031.230, the
Court must look behind the words to intent as the statutory language is
ambiguous. The Legislature plainly meant that a demand could be made and a
forthright response given. If the demand was objectionable in part, then a
forthright response would be given to the extent that the demand was not
objectionable. Given that logic, it would make little sense for a party,
knowing that it once had additional responsive documents but that they are now
in someone else's possession or have been destroyed, to be able to hide that
fact by producing the documents that it does have but saying nothing about the
other documents. And while the propounding party could take the verifier's
deposition and ask the question, such a rule essentially dooms the propounding
party as a matter of routine and prudence either to asking an interrogatory as
to each document demand to elicit this information or taking depositions to
button down the mere possibility—both with the attendant expense and time
investment. That rule makes little sense and it is hard to fathom that the
Legislature had such an intent when it drafted the law. he better reading is
that a responding party who has some responsive documents but is unable to
comply in full must respond that way, setting forth a statement under section
2031.220 and also a statement under section 2031.230 to the extent that it is
unable to comply even in part because documents have been lost or destroyed.
This reading finds some support in the notion that the required response in
many cases must apply not only to categories, but also to items. The Court
acknowledges that this is not overwhelming support. Sometimes the statue does refer
only to categories, and the use of "item" really stems more from the
language in the statute governing the demand than it likely does as an attempt
to be more granular than a demand category. The Court also notes that nothing
in sections 2031.210(a)(1) or 2031.210(a)(2) suggests that the response must be
one or the other but not both, and the same is true for sections 2031.220 and
2031.230. Further, section 2031.220 speaks of compliance in full “or in part.”
Again, this last point is not completely satisfying, as the “in part” could
well be to deal with the situation where there is an objection to part of the
demand rather than where the “in part” is because some of the responsive
documents cannot be found. However, such an interpretation is supported by the
Court’s analysis of the Legislature’s intent. Thus, where compliance is
possible only in part because the responding party is unable to comply in full
(because it once had responsive documents but has them no longer), it must so
state and comply with both sections 2031.220 and 2031.230.
 
To the extent Defendant raises
objections based on privilege, Defendant must “provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c).) 
 
RFP No. 19:
 
All DOCUMENTS,
including but not limited to electronically stored information and electronic
mails, concerning customer complaints, claims, reported failures, and warranty
claims related to ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT, including but not limited to any
databases in YOUR possession with information from dealers, service
departments, parts departments, or warranty departments, and all documents
concerning YOUR response to each complaint, claim or reported failure.
 
Response: 
 
GM objects to
this Request on grounds the terms “concerning,” “customer complaints,”
“claims,” “reported failures,” “warranty claims” “related to” and “ENGINE
SYSTEM DEFECT” are vague and ambiguous. GM also objects to this Request on
grounds it improperly assumes that there are alleged defects with respect to
the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or GMC Vehicles, generally. GM also objects to this
Request on grounds it is overbroad and seeks documents that are irrelevant and
not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence as it
is not limited to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at issue in this action. GM also objects
to this Request on grounds it is burdensome and oppressive, and that compliance
would be unreasonably difficult and expensive considering the needs of the
case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in
the litigation. This is a simple, individual lemon law case with limited issues
and this request violates Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997)
53 Cal.App.4th 216, 61 Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically, whether Plaintiff is
entitled to relief under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entirely
unrelated and incommensurate to the scope and breadth of this Request. GM also
objects to this Request to the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and
trade secret information. GM further objects to this Request to the extent it
seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or
work-product doctrine. No documents will be produced.
 
(Separate Statement 47:27-48:22.)
 
Defendant’s objection to “ENGINE
SYSTEM DEFECT” is not well taken. The RFPs define the term on page three,
paragraph five. (See Decl. Iraida Gonzalez, Exh. 6 at ¶ 5.) As to the other
terms, the Court applies the plain meaning of the words. As to this objection –
“GM also objects to this Request on grounds it improperly assumes that there
are alleged defects with respect to the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or GM Vehicles,
generally” – the basis of this Complaint is alleged defects within the Subject
Vehicle. Plaintiff seeks discovery to prepare her case. As to the objections
regarding burden; Calcor Space Facility; attorney-client and work
product privilege; and confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information,
the Court directs the parties to its discussion in RFP No. 7. Defendant does
not meet its initial burden. 
 
As to scope, the Court agrees
that the scope of this RFP is overbroad. The Court limits RFP No. 19 to
vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the Subject Vehicle. 
 
To the extent Defendant raises
objections based on privilege, Defendant must “provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c).) 
 
RFP No. 21:
 
All DOCUMENTS,
including but not limited to electronically stored information and electronic
mails, concerning or relating to any fixes for ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT in vehicles
of the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
Response:
 
GM objects to
this Request on grounds the terms “concerning,” “relating to,” “fixes” and “All
DOCUMENTS”, including but not limited to electronically stored information and
electronic mails, concerning or relating to any fixes for “ENGINE SYSTEM
DEFECT” in vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.”
are vague and ambiguous. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it
improperly assumes that there are alleged defects with respect to the SUBJECT
VEHICLE, or GM Vehicles, generally. GM also objects to this Request on grounds
it is overbroad and seeks documents that are irrelevant and not reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence as it is not limited
to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at issue in this action. GM also objects to this Request
on grounds it is burdensome and oppressive, and that compliance would be
unreasonably difficult and expensive considering the needs of the case, the
amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the
litigation. This is a simple, individual lemon law case with limited issues and
this request violates Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 216, 61 Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically, whether Plaintiff is
entitled to relief under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entirely
unrelated and incommensurate to the scope and breadth of this Request. GM also
objects to this Request to the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and
trade secret information. GM further objects to this Request to the extent it
seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or
work-product doctrine. No documents will be produced.
 
(Separate Statement 58:7-59:1.)
 
Defendant’s objections regarding
vague and ambiguous are without merit. The Court applies the plain definition
of the words and/or phrases “concerning,” “relating to,” and “fixes.” “DOCUMENTS”
are described on page three at paragraph two and “ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT” is
designed on page three at paragraph five. (See Decl. Iraida Gonzalez, Exh. 6 at
p. 3 ¶¶ 2, 5.) Plaintiff has repeatedly used the term “vehicles of the same
year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE” and Defendant did not raise any
objection to this term until now. It is unclear if the objection is only as to
the words and/or phrases “concerning,” “relating to,” and “fixes” or as to the
whole RFP. In either case, the Court has addressed each. 
As to the arguments burden; Calcor
Space Facility; confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information;
and attorney client and work product doctrine, the Court directs the parties to
its discussion in RFP No. 7. The Court incorporates its analysis as for these
objections for this RFP. Regarding improperly assumed alleged defects, the
Court directs the parties to its analysis in RFP No. 16 and incorporates its
analysis as for these objections for this RFP. As to overbreadth, the Court
does not find this RFP overbroad as it is limited to vehicles of the same year,
make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE. Such information is reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
 
To the extent Defendant raises
objections based on privilege, Defendant must “provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c).) 
 
RFP No. 34:
 
All DOCUMENTS
that YOU use to evaluate consumers’ requests for repurchases pursuant to the
Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. 
 
Response:
 
GM objects to
this Request on grounds that it would require GM to compile information related
to GM world-wide on every vehicle sold, none of which are related to this
individual lawsuit or the SUBJECT VEHICLE. This is a simple, individual lemon
law case with limited issues and this Request also violates Calcor Space
Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 61 Cal.Rptr.2d 567.
Specifically, whether Plaintiff is entitled to relief under the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act is entirely unrelated and incommensurate to the scope and
breadth of this request. GM also objects to this Request to the extent it seeks
confidential, proprietary and trade secret information in the form of GM’s
internal policies and procedures. GM further objects to this Request to the
extent it seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or
work-product doctrine. No documents will be produced.
 
(Separate Statement 68:14-27.)
 
As to arguments regarding
confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information, and attorney client
and work product doctrine the Court directs the parties to its discussion in
RFP No. 7. The Court incorporates its analysis as for these objections for this
RFP. Defendant presents that this RFP is seeking its internal policies and
procedures while also presenting that the documents are not policy and
procedures but rather documents related to Defendant “GM world-wide on every
vehicle sold.” On its face, the Court believes that this RFP is overbroad.
However, it is unclear how to limit the scope due to Defendant’s
representations. The Court inquires at the hearing. 
 
RFP No. 38:
 
All DOCUMENTS
issued by YOU or on YOUR behalf which evidence, describe, refer, or relate to
policies, procedures, and/or instructions since 2021 that YOUR employees and
agents should follow when evaluating a customer request for a refund of the
price paid for a vehicle or replacement of a new motor vehicle manufactured or
distributed by YOU.
 
Response:
 
GM objects to
this Request on grounds the terms “evidence, describe, refer, or relate to” are
overbroad, vague and ambiguous. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it
is overbroad, unduly burdensome, oppressive, and seeks documents that are
irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence as it is not limited to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at issue in this action.
This is a simple, individual lemon law case with limited issues and this
Request also violates Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 216, 61 Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically, whether Plaintiff is
entitled to relief under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entirely
unrelated and incommensurate to the scope and breadth of this request. GM also
objects to this Request to the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and
trade secret information in the form of GM’s internal policies and procedures.
GM further objects to this Request to the extent it seeks information protected
by the attorney-client privilege and/or work product doctrine. No documents
will be produced.
 
(Separate Statement 75: 7-24.)
 
As to the terms objected to, the
Court applies the plain definition of those terms. As to overbreadth; Calcor
Space Facility, confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information;
and attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine arguments, the Court
directs the parties to RFP No. 7. The Court incorporates its analysis as for
these objections for this RFP. 
 
However, the Court does believe
this RFP is overbroad. The Court limits the RFP to vehicles of the same year,
make, and model as the Subject Vehicle. 
 
To the extent Defendant raises
objections based on privilege, Defendant must “provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c).) 
 
RFP No. 41:
 
All Vehicle
Warranty History Reports for the repurchased or replaced vehicles due to the
ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT for the same make, model and year as the SUBJECT VEHICLE
 
Response:
 
GM objects to
this Request on grounds the term “ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT” is vague and ambiguous.
GM also objects to this Request on grounds it improperly assumes that there are
alleged defects with respect to the SUBJECT VEHICLE, or GM Vehicles, generally.
GM also objects to this Request on grounds it is overbroad and seeks documents
that are irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence as it is not limited to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at issue in
this action. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it is burdensome and
oppressive, and that compliance would be unreasonably difficult and expensive
considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and the
importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. This is a simple,
individual lemon law case with limited issues and this request violates Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 61
Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically, whether Plaintiff is entitled to relief under
the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entirely unrelated and incommensurate
to the scope and breadth of this Request. GM also objects to this Request to
the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and trade secret information. GM
further objects to this Request to the extent it seeks information protected by
the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product doctrine. No documents will
be produced.
 
Defendant’s objection to “ENGINE
SYSTEM DEFECT” is not well taken. The RFPs define the term on page three,
paragraph five. (See Decl. Iraida Gonzalez, Exh. 6 at p. 3 ¶ 5.) Regarding
improperly assumed alleged defects, the Court directs the parties to its
analysis in RFP No. 16 and incorporates its analysis as for these objections
for this RFP. As to overbreadth; Calcor Space Facility, confidential,
proprietary, and trade secret information; and attorney-client privilege and
work product doctrine arguments, the Court directs the parties to RFP No. 7. The
Court incorporates its analysis as for these objections for this RFP. The
request is limited to vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the Subject
Vehicle. 
 
To the extent Defendant raises
objections based on privilege, Defendant must “provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c).) 
 
RFP No. 42:
 
All DOCUMENTS
which evidence YOUR organizational charts of people within YOUR customer
service call center or prelitigation department. 
 
Response:
 
GM objects to
this Request on grounds the terms “evidence” and “organizational charts” are
vague and ambiguous. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it is
overbroad, unduly burdensome, oppressive, and seeks documents that are
irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence as it is not limited to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at issue in this action.
This is a simple, individual lemon law case with limited issues and this
request violates Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 216, 61 Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically, whether Plaintiff is
entitled to relief under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entirely
unrelated and incommensurate to the scope and breadth of this Request. GM also
objects to this Request to the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and
trade secret information. GM further objects to this Request to the extent it
seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or
work-product doctrine. No documents will be produced.
 
Despite Plaintiff’s presentation,
the Court does not believe that this information is necessary and/or relevant
to the preparation of Plaintiff’s case. As to Plaintiff’s cited cases, (1) the
full quote from Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 1094, 1105 reads: “Finally, there was evidence that Isuzu adopted
internal policies that erected hidden obstacles to the ability of an unwary
consumer to obtain redress under the Act[,]” and is distinguished as it
discussed internal policies, not organizational charts or employees; and (2) Kwan
v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, as
presented by Plaintiff, explains that absence of written policy on
implementation of Act's provisions is admissible to prove lack of good faith
and is likewise distinguished. 
 
RFP No. 51:
 
All DOCUMENTS,
including electronically stored information and electronic mails, regarding any
communications between YOU and any government agency or entity (e.g. National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”)) regarding the ENGINE SYSTEM
DEFECT in vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
 
Response:
 
GM objects to
this Request on grounds the terms “communications” and “ENGINE SYSTEM DEFECT”
are vague and ambiguous. GM also objects to this Request on grounds it
improperly assumes that there are alleged defects with respect to the SUBJECT
VEHICLE, or GMC Vehicles, generally. GM also objects to this Request on grounds
it is overbroad and seeks documents that are irrelevant and not reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence as it is not limited
to the SUBJECT VEHICLE at issue in this action. GM also objects to this Request
on grounds it is burdensome and oppressive, and that compliance would be
unreasonably difficult and expensive considering the needs of the case, the
amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the
litigation. This is a simple individual lemon law case with limited issues and
this request violates Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 216, 61 Cal.Rptr.2d 567. Specifically, whether Plaintiff is
entitled to relief under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entirely
unrelated and incommensurate to the scope and breadth of this Request. GM also
objects to this Request to the extent it seeks confidential, proprietary and
trade secret information. GM further objects to this Request to the extent it
seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or
work-product doctrine. No documents will be produced.
(Separate Statement 99:23-100:16)
 
Defendant’s objection to “ENGINE
SYSTEM DEFECT” is not well taken. The RFPs define the term on page three,
paragraph five. (See Decl. Iraida Gonzalez, Exh. 6 at p. 3 ¶ 5.) The Court
applies the plain meaning of “communications.” As to the arguments burden; Calcor
Space Facility; confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information;
and attorney client and work product doctrine, the Court directs the parties to
its discussion in RFP No. 7. The Court incorporates its analysis as for these
objections for this RFP. Regarding improperly assumed alleged defects, the
Court directs the parties to its analysis in RFP No. 16 and incorporates its
analysis as for these objections for this RFP. This RFP is sufficiently limited
to vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the Subject Vehicle. 
 
To the extent Defendant raises objections
based on privilege, Defendant must “provide sufficient factual information for
other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including, if necessary, a
privilege log.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c).) 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Compel
Further is Granted in Part as to RFP Nos. 7, 10, 16-19, 21, 34, 38, 41, and 51,
and denied in part as to RFP No. 42.

Sanctions
 
Plaintiff does not request
sanctions.
 
“Except as provided in
subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(i).)
 
Defendant has provided
boilerplate objections, and has not provided code-compliant responses (e.g.
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c)). 
 
The Court declines to impose a
sanction. 
 
The Court notes that the
sanctions stem from Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310 and the changes to
legislation in Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.050 do not apply as Plaintiff did
not request sanctions.

41, and 51, and DENIED in part as to RFP No. 42. 
 
The Court declines to impose a sanction.
