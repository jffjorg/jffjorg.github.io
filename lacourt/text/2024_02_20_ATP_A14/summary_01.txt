English-text summary:

The Judge denies the Motion to Set Aside/Vacate filed by Guy Paul Blackburn, III, seeking to set aside a default judgment entered against him and Susan Diane Blackburn. The Judge finds that Guy's motion lacks supporting documentation to show that the vehicle in question was not registered to him, and that he has not shown a meritorious defense, a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action, and diligence in seeking to set aside the default once it was discovered. The Judge also notes that the judgment by default was supported by affidavits filed by the insured, Tina Trevino, and that the DMV has determined that some basis exists for the determination that the grounds for suspension, revocation, or cancellation did not exist at the time the action was taken.
