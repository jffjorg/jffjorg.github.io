various times and in various places notices of their intent to sell the Subject
Property at a public auction on June 16, 2022 at 9:00 at 1311 Sycamore Drive in
Norwalk, Los Angeles County, California; (3) Nerez attempted to sell the

Discussion
 
Judicial Notice – Plaintiff requests judicial notice only of
certain parts of a whole document (i.e. redaction, certain numbers, location of
space, etc.). The Court will take judicial notice of the documents in which the
requests are located as they are part of this Court’s records. (Cal. Evid. Code
§ 452.) The Court will not view the documents piece meal. This statement applies
to Plaintiff’s requests regarding Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice
Exhibits 1, 3, 14, 15, 16, and 17; Plaintiff’s document in related case
23AVUD0441.
 
As to the request for judicial notice regarding Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, (“Fontenot”) the request is DENIED. This is case law and not judicially
noticeable under Cal. Evid. Code § 452. Further, Fontenot has been
overruled in part by Yvanova v.
New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016)
62 Cal.4th 919 [questioned by Watson
v. Bank of Am., N.A. (S.D.Cal.
Nov. 7, 2016, No. 16cv513-GPC(MDD)) 2016 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 154375 as to
application to pre-foreclosure sales].)  
 
As to the request for the Sallie Mae Selling Guide regarding MERS,
judicial notice is GRANTED  under Cal.
Evid. Code § 452(h).
 
Application – The
Court must address several initial matters.
 
First, Plaintiff states he seeks
an order setting aside and vacating the December 12, 2023 judgment. (Motion, 3:3-9.)
The Court’s records reflect that no judgment was entered on December 12, 2023.
Rather, there is (1) an order on December 12, 2023 sustaining Newrez and BNY
Mellon’s Demurrer, and (2) a judgment entered on January 02, 2024. As Plaintiff
has provided the date of the order and described the judgment as one sustaining
Newrez and BNY Mellon’s Demurrer, the Court will read this motion as directed
to the December 12, 2023 order. 
 
Next, Plaintiff states that he is
moving under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 473(d) and the Court’s inherent powers.
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 473(d) reads: “The court may, upon motion of the injured
party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders
as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on
motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void
judgment or order.” The order sustaining Newrez and BNY Mellon’s Demurrer was
not made as a clerical error. “ ‘A judgment or order is said to be void on its
face when the invalidity is apparent upon an inspection of the judgment-roll.’
” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441
[internal citation omitted].) 
 
As to any issue with notice
stemming from these errors, Newrez and BNY Mellon have filed their Opposition. An
opposition on the merits is a waiver of any defects or irregularities in the
notice of the motion. (See Tate v. Superior Court (1975) 45 Cal. App. 3d
925, 930; Eliceche v. Federal Land Bank Assn. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th
1349, 1375; Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1288-89.) 
 
Plaintiff relies on the documents
by Newrez and BNY Mellon provided in the Demurrer to argue manifest fraud due
to redactions. Plaintiff cites to Ross v. Murphy (1952) 113 Cal.App.2d
453 (“Ross”) to provide a partial quote of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 473. Plaintiff
argues that fraud exists because the serialized loan numbers stemming from Selling Guide regarding MERS were redacted
and, thus, false. Plaintiff argues that the loan number on the deed of trust
provided is 1470002009 while the one Newrez and BNY Mellon foreclosed on is
0555856819. Plaintiff further argues that MERS did not have a valid assignment,
citing Fontenot. Plaintiff presents that (1) the buyer did
not cancel and return the note which is evidence that Newrez and BNY Mellon did
not foreclose against the note, and (2) res judicata does not apply as the
previous cases were filed before the nonjudicial foreclosure. 
 
Newrez and BNY Mellon present: (1) there is no grounds to vacate under
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 473(d) as Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §473(d) does not
provide authority to set aside a judgment that is void on its face as Plaintiff
claims; (2) there are no grounds to
set aside the order on the demurrer as a party moving to set aside fraud must
establish the elements of fraud as well as establish three elements – (1) a
meritorious defense; (2) a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense in
the first place; and (3) diligence in seeking to set aside the default judgment
once discovered – and Plaintiff has not done so. Newrez and BNY Mellon further
present that Rodriguez v. Cho (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742 (“Rodriguez”) holds that (1) a party seeking equitable relief on the
grounds of extrinsic fraud or mistake must show a meritorious defense, a
satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense in the first place, and
diligence in seeking to set aside the default judgment once discovered; and (2)
fraud is "intrinsic," and not a valid ground for setting aside an
order, when the moving party was given notice of the action and had an
opportunity to present its case and to protect itself from any mistake or fraud
by the opposing party, but unreasonably neglected to do so.
 
Plaintiff’s citation to Ross is inapposite. Ross cites to Provencher v. City of Los Angeles (1935) 10 Cal.App.2d 730, 733 where the
plaintiffs had dismissed the action themselves and the trial court was without
power to render a judgment, making the judgment entered after dismissal void on
its face pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 473(d). Ross used this citation to
answer whether a judge of one superior court has the power to vacate a void
order of another judge of the superior court. (Ross, supra, 113 Cal.App.2d at 455.) Ross and the source of its citation are
distinguished from the action at hand. Plaintiff has not presented any
argument for invalidity apparent upon an inspection the judgment-roll in his
moving papers. The Court notes that
Plaintiff’s Reply attempts to argue that the judgement in this case is void on
its face; however, Plaintiff’s argument simply (1) cites to new cases (i.e.,
cases not presented in the moving or opposing papers) discussing that a
judgment is void on its face when invalidity appears upon inspection of the
judgment-roll; (2) a bullet pointed list of what a judgment roll consists of
under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 670(a); and (3) a statement that reads: “Here, inspection
of the judgment-roll without question there is grounds for relief and the Court
has the power to grant the relief requested.” (Reply 3:1-19.) Plaintiff does
not present what in the judgment-roll would make the judgment void on its face
in his Reply. The order issued for the Demurrer is not void on its face
as it was based upon and supported by arguments from Newrez, BNY Mellon, and
Plaintiff and their corresponding filings. Therefore, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 473(d) does not apply.
 
As to equitable powers of the court, Newrez and BNY Mellon’s cited
case, Rodriguez, is binding on this Court. Rodriguez provides, in relevant part: 
 
‘The court may grant relief under its
inherent equity power if, because of the fraud of his opponent, the aggrieved
party was prevented from presenting his claim or defense to the court.
[Citations.] “Two essential conditions are found in a classic case in equity
which seeks to set aside a judgment: first, the judgment is one entered against
a party by default under circumstances which prevented him from presenting his
case; second, these circumstances result from extrinsic fraud practiced by the
other party or his attorney.”’” (Id. at p. 314.) “‘Fraud is intrinsic and not a
valid ground for setting aside a judgment when the party has been given notice
of the action and has had an opportunity to present his case and to protect
himself from any mistake or fraud of his adversary, but has unreasonably
neglected to do so.’” (Id. at p. 315.)
 
Additionally, the party seeking equitable
relief on the grounds of extrinsic fraud or mistake must show three elements:
(1) a meritorious defense; (2) a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a
defense in the first place; and (3) diligence in seeking to set aside the
default judgment once discovered. (Gibble
v. Car-Lene Research, Inc., supra, 67 Cal.App.4th at p. 315.)
 
[. . .]
 
Moreover, even if
evidence of extrinsic fraud existed, Cho did not establish he had a meritorious
defense—a necessary element for equitable relief. (Gibble v. Car-Lene
Research, Inc., supra, 67 Cal.App.4th at p. 315.) He attached a
proposed answer to his motion reciting a kitchen sink full of affirmative
defenses, but he did not attempt to demonstrate any of these defenses had merit
by, for example, explaining the underlying facts and applying the law to them.
On appeal, he contends for the first time that he has a meritorious defense
because Rodriguez had no evidence that he, as opposed to Reliable, was her
employer. This contention is not well taken. Rodriguez's prove-up package
contained court documents from a small claims court action Cho filed against
her in which he identified himself as “Nam Min Cho DBA Reliable Building
Maintenance Company,” and he referred to Reliable as “plaintiffs [sic]
company.” She further presented evidence of a payroll document and other
correspondence from Reliable showing she was an employee, besides her own sworn
declaration. Cho had the burden of proving he had a meritorious defense, and he
did not carry that burden. (Sakaguchi v. Sakaguchi (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 852, 862 [92 Cal. Rptr. 3d 717].)
 
(Rodriguez, supra,
236 Cal.App.4th at 749-52.)
 
Though slightly different (i.e.,
this action does not concern default), the basic premise of Rodriguez
applies. Plaintiff was not prevented
from presenting his claim or defense to the Court. Rather, Plaintiff could have
brought up the arguments that he brings for this motion in either his
Opposition to the Demurrer or during oral argument at the hearing. Plaintiff
did not. Plaintiff has not a provided a satisfactory excuse for not presenting
a defense in the first place.
 
Further, as to res judicata, “ ‘Res judicata’ describes the preclusive
effect of a final judgment on the merits. Res judicata, or claim preclusion,
prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the
same parties or parties in privity with them. Collateral estoppel, or issue
preclusion, ‘precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior
proceedings.’ (Lucido v. Superior
Court (1990) 51 Cal.3d 335, 341
[272 Cal. Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223].) Under the doctrine of res judicata, if a
plaintiff prevails in an action, the cause is merged into the judgment and may
not be asserted in a subsequent lawsuit; a judgment for the defendant serves as
a bar to further litigation of the same cause of action.” (Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 896-97.) The Court
takes judicial notice of its Order After Hearing/Statement of Decision, filed
on December 12, 2023 under Cal. Evid. Code § 452 as this filing is part
of the Court’s record. The Court
provides this tentative to afford each party reasonable opportunity to meet
such information before judicial notice of the matter may be taken. (See Cal.
Evid. Code § 455.) The Court determined that as (1) a final decision was
rendered (2) upon the same primary rights/claims (3) with parties BNY Mellon,
sued directly in previous cases, and Newrez, as the party in privity with
then-servicer Bank of American, N.A. (See 12/12/2023 Order After
Hearing/Statement of Decision.) Case law holds the doctrine of res judicata
applies to a new theory of wrongful foreclosure premised on the same primary
right as past litigation that had resulted in final judgments allowing
foreclosure proceedings to go forward. (Gilles v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 907 [generally].) The timing of the filing does
not bar the application of res judicata. 
 
With regards to the Court’s inherent powers, Plaintiff’s Reply contains
arguments that: (1) courts have inherent power at law to set aside a void
judgment on the motion of a party, whether it is void on its face; and (2) a
finding that the fraud worked upon a court was intrinsic rather than extrinsic
is immaterial upon a motion to vacate made within six months. These are
arguments do not change the Court’s opinion as the item at issue is an order,
not a judgment; the order on the Demurrer is not void as discussed ante; and Plaintiff has not provided argument that overcomes the bar due to
res judicata. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate/Set Aside is DENIED.
 
-----
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Rodney Rouzan’s Motion
to Vacate/Set Aside Judgment is DENIED.
