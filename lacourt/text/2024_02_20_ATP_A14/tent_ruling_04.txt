Legal Standard
 
Standard for Compelling Interrogatories – Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2030.290 provides
that a party may bring a motion to compel responses to interrogatories, where
the responding party failed to serve a timely response. Unless otherwise
agreed, the responding party is required to serve response within 30 days after
service of the discovery demand for production documents. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§2030.290(b).) If the responding party fails to serve a timely response, the
party “waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or
on the protection for work product . . .” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2030.290(a).)
The requesting party need not demonstrate “good cause to compel responses, nor
that it satisfied the “meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 143 Cal.App.4th
390, 404.) 
 
Responses to interrogatories are due within
30 days after service of interrogatories. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.260.)
“The party propounding interrogatories and the responding party may agree to
extend the time for service of a response to a set of interrogatories, or to
particular interrogatories in a set, to a date beyond that provided in Section
2030.260.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.270(a).) While this agreement may be
informal, it must be confirmed in writing. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.270(b).)

Discussion
 
Application – 
 
i.       
Form Interrogatories
 
Defendant propounded Plaintiff
with its Request for Responses to Form Interrogatories, (Set One). The Proof of
Service for the Request for Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) is
dated February 28, 2023. (Motion to Compel Form Interrogatory Responses, Decl.
of Jessie A. Nudelman, ¶ 2 and Exh. A.) Defendant presents that the initial
date responses were due was March 30, 2023; however, on March 27, 2023, the
office representing Plaintiff requested a 30-day extension in time to respond
in light of changing the handling attorney on the case and Defendant agreed. (See
id. at ¶ 4 and Exh. B.) As such, Plaintiff’s new deadline was April 27,
2023. Following this, on April 25, 2023, the office representing Plaintiff
requested an additional two- or three-week extension which was agreed to by
Defendant. (See id. at ¶ 6, Exh and C.) Thus, the agreed upon deadline
was June 06, 2023. Despite this, the office representing Plaintiff requested
further extensions which Defendant did not agree to. (See id. at ¶¶ 8-9
and Exhs. D and E.) Defendant presents that on July 05, 2023, Plaintiff served
his responses to interrogatories which consisted of only objections. (See id.
at ¶ 10 and Exh. F.) Defendant presents that this led to a meet and confer with
Plaintiff’s counsel wherein it was agreed that Plaintiff would provide
supplemental, full responses by July 14, 2023. (See id. at ¶ 12 and Exh.
H.) However, no supplemental responses were received by the deadline and, to
date, Defendant has not received any supplemental discovery. (See id. at
¶¶ 12-15.)
 
It appears what Defendant seeks
is not a motion to compel, but rather a motion to compel further as Defendant
has resented (1) responses were received; and (2) the objections given by
Plaintiff in his responses are without merit. “Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300.) The responses contain only
objections and are signed by Plaintiff’s then counsel, Jeffrey M. Schwartz
(“Schwartz”). (Motion to Compel Form Interrogatory Responses, Decl. of Jessie
A. Nudelman, ¶ 10 and Exh. F.) The Proof of Service of Plaintiff’s responses
indicates the responses were served on July 05, 2023. (Ibid.) Defendant
did not move to compel further until September 18, 2023, over two months since
Plaintiff’s responses were received (75 days). (See 09/28/2023 Notice of IDC.) Taking
into consideration the agreement between the parties in which supplemental
responses were due on July 14, 2023, the date of the Notice of the IDC,
September 18, 2023, is still over two months (66 days) from the date decided
upon by counsels. Defendant has not provided argument for why the 45-day
statutory deadline should not apply. Defendant has waived its right to compel a
further response to the interrogatories. 
 
The Court notes that Defendant
has also failed to adhere to the separate statement required for Motions to
Compel Further. (See Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345; see also Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.300(a)(2) [discussing separate statement requirement].) 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) which is, in actuality, a Motion to
Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) is
DENIED. 
 
 
 
ii.      Special
Interrogatories
 
Defendant presents the same set
of facts: (1) Special Interrogatories (Set One) were propounded on February 28,
2023 (See Motion to Compel Special Interrogatories (Set One) Decl. Nudelman ¶ 2
and Exh. A); (2) the office representing Plaintiff requested a 30-day extension
which was agreed upon by Defendant (See id. at ¶ 4 and Exh. B); (3) on
April 25, 2023, the office representing Plaintiff requested an additional two-
or three-week extension which was agreed to by Defendant (see id. at ¶
6, Exh and C); (4) the office representing Plaintiff requested further
extensions which were denied (see id. at ¶¶ 8-9 and Exh. D and E); (5) on
July 5, 2023, Plaintiff served his responses to the special interrogatories
which consisted of only objections (see id. at ¶ 10, Exh. F); (6) this
led to a meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel wherein it was agreed that
Plaintiff would provide supplemental, full responses by July 14, 2023 (see id.
at ¶ 12 and Exh. H); and (7) no supplemental responses were received by the
deadline and, to date, Defendant has not received any supplemental discovery
(see id. at ¶¶ 12-15). 
 
This is, once again, not a motion
to compel, but rather a motion to compel further as Defendant has resented (1)
responses were received; and (2) the objections given by Plaintiff in his
responses are without merit.
 
The Court incorporates and
applies its analysis for the Form Interrogatory section as to the Special
Interrogatories. The Court notes that the discussion of the objection and the
signature by then counsel Schwartz remains applicable. (See Motion to Compel
Special Interrogatories (Set One) Decl. Nudelman ¶ 10 and Exh. F [stating
“Respondent objects to this entire set of interrogatories on the grounds that
it includes a preface or instruction in violation of Code of Civil Procedure,
section 2030.060(d). Additionally, “INCIDENT” is capitalized but undefined in
violation of subsection (e)[]” and signed by then counsel Scwartz].)
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) which is, in
actuality, a Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set One) is DENIED. 
 
iii.    RFPs
 
Defendant presents a similar set
of facts: (1) a Demand for Production and Identification of Documents was propounded
on February 28, 2023 (See Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Demand for
Inspection and Production of Documents (Set One), Decl. Nudelman ¶ 2 and Exh.
A); (2) the office representing Plaintiff requested a 30-day extension which
was agreed upon by Defendant (See id. at ¶ 4 and Exh. B); (3) on April
25, 2023, the office representing Plaintiff requested an additional two- or
three-week extension which was agreed to by Defendant (see id. at ¶ 6,
Exh and C); (4) the office representing Plaintiff requested further extensions
which were denied (see id. at ¶¶ 8-9 and Exh. D and E); (5) on July 5,
2023, Plaintiff served some responses which consisted of only objections (see id.
at ¶ 10, Exh. F); (6) despite objections, Plaintiff did produce some responsive
documents on July 06, 2023 (see id. at ¶ 11, Exh. G); (6) Plaintiff’s
responses led to a meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel wherein it was
agreed that Plaintiff would provide supplemental, full responses by July 14,
2023 (see id. at ¶ 12 and Exh. H); and (7) no supplemental responses
were received by the deadline and, to date, Defendant has not received any
supplemental discovery (see id. at ¶¶ 14-16). 
 
This is, once again, not a motion
to compel, but rather a motion to compel further as Defendant has resented (1)
responses were received; and (2) the objections given by Plaintiff in his
responses are without merit. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2031.310(a).)
 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(c) provides: “Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the demand.” As with the interrogatories, (1)
the response is verified as it contains only objections and then-attorney
Schwartz signed the responses (see Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to
Demand for Inspection and Production of Documents (Set One), Decl. Nudelman at
¶ 10 and Exh. F; compare with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.250); (2) Defendant
did not move to compel further until September 18, 2023, over two months (75
days) since Plaintiff’s responses were received (see 09/28/2023 Notice of IDC);
and (3) taking into consideration the agreement between the parties in which
supplemental responses were due on July 14, 2023, the date of the Notice of the
IDC, September 18, 2023, is still over two months (66 days) from the date
decided upon by counsels. Defendant has not provided argument for why the
45-day statutory deadline should not apply. Defendant has waived its right to
compel a further response to RFPs. 
 
The Court notes that Defendant
has also failed to adhere to the separate statement required for Motions to
Compel Further. (See Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345; see also Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.310(b)(3) [discussing separate statement requirement].) 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Demand for Inspection and Production of Documents (Set
One) which is, in actuality, a Motion to Compel Further Responses to Demand for
Inspection and Production of Documents (Set One) is DENIED.

Sanctions
 
Defendant requests sanctions in
the amount of:
 
·        
$787.50 for each Motion to Compel related to
interrogatories [3.5 hrs@ 195.00/hr $60.00 filing fee]; and 
·        
$735.00 for the Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s
Responses to Demand for Inspection and Production of Documents (Set One) [3 hrs
@ $225/hr + $60.00 filing fee]. 
 
It is unclear why there is a
discrepancy in the billing rates of Defendant as Nudelman has signed the
declaration for all three motions to compel and all under penalty of perjury
under the State of California. (See Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Response to
Form Interrogatories (Set One), Decl. of Nudelman ¶ 17; Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Response to Special Interrogatories (Set One), Decl. of Nudelman ¶
17; and Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Demand for Inspection and
Production of Documents (Set One), Decl. Nudelman ¶ 18.) The Court inquires at
the hearing.
 
Further, it is patent that the
motions contain substantial overlap as they focus on the same events that
occurred, contain similar declarations, and shared exhibits. 
 
Regarding interrogatories, Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(d) provides: “The court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
 
Regarding RFPs, Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.310(h) provides: “Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
 
Defendant may have brought the
motions from a place of good will; however, Defendant has presented the motions
as motions to compel when they are motions to compel further. Unlike motions to
compel further, a motion to compel does not have a statutory 45-day deadline. Further,
Defendant waited to bring such motions, leading to a waiver of its right to
compel a further response and still filed such motions. As such, the Court
cannot find that Defendant acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
 
Accordingly, the Court imposes a
sanction of $250.00 on Defendant and its counsel of record, Nudelman, jointly
and severally.

Conclusion
 
Defendant T & J Unlimited
Transportation, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set One) is DENIED. 
 
Defendant T & J Unlimited
Transportation, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set One) is DENIED. 
 
Defendant T & J Unlimited
Transportation, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Responses to Demand for Inspection and
Production of Documents (Set One) is DENIED. 
 
The Court notes that while
Defendant T & J Unlimited Transportation, Inc.’s motions are labeled as
“motions to compel,” they are “motions to compel further” as Defendant T &
J Unlimited Transportation Inc.’s counsel of record, Jessie A. Nudelman, has
conceded that she has received discovery responses from Plaintiff and provided
such responses which show that the responses were verified and served within
the agreed upon extension deadline. 
 
The Court imposes a sanction of $250.00 on Defendant T
& J Unlimited Transportation, Inc. and its counsel of record, Jessie A.
Nudelman, jointly and severally.
