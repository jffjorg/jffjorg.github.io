 Case Number:  23AVCV00176    Hearing Date:   February 20, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This action arises from an injury
that occurred on or about December 17, 2022. 
Plaintiff Kevin Molina (“Kevin”)[1]
fell into a firepit when visiting the premises at 39811 22nd Street W,
Palmdale, CA 93551 which is alleged to be owned, managed, operated, controlled,
and inspected by Defendants Evergreen Nursery and Evergreen Nursery, Inc.
Plaintiff Emma Molina (“Emma”) was present and witnessed the incident. 
 
On February 14, 2023, Plaintiffs Kevin
and Emma, minors by and through their Guardian Ad Litem, Celia Castro
(collectively “Minor Claimants”), filed a complaint against Defendants alleging
three causes of action for: (1) Premises Liability by Kevin against all
defendants; (2) Negligence by Kevin against all defendants; and (3) Negligence
– Bystander by Emma against all Defendants. 
 
On January 18, 2024, Petitioner Celia
Castro (“Petitioner”) filed one petition to approve the compromise of pending
action on behalf of Kevin.
 
The Court inquires as to the
status of Emma and why no petition has been filed on her behalf.
 
Analysis
 
Standard for Approving Minor’s
Compromises – Court approval is required for all settlements of a
minor’s claim or that of a person lacking the capacity to make decisions.  (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.)
 
“[T]he protective role the court
generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a role to assure that
whatever is done is in the minor’s best interests . . . .  [I]ts primary concern is whether the
compromise is sufficient to provide for the minor’s injuries, care and
treatment.”  (Goldberg v. Superior Court (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.)  
 
A petition for court approval of
a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code of Civil Procedure section 372
must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952.  The petition must be verified by the
petitioner and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any
bearing upon the reasonableness” of the compromise or the covenant.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  The person compromising the claim on behalf
of the minor or person who lacks capacity, and the represented person, must
attend the hearing on compromise of the claim unless the court for good cause
dispenses with their personal appearance. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952(a).)
 
An order for deposit of funds of
a minor or person lacking decision-making capacity and a petition for the
withdrawal of such funds must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.953
and 7.954.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1384; see also Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.)
 
-----
 
The petition shows that Kevin settled with Defendant Juan Cruz for
$300,000.00. $21,574.91 will be used to pay medical expenses, $75,000.00 will
be used to pay attorney’s fees, and $997.34 will be used to pay non-medical
expenses. However, the petition summary states that the amount of non-medical
expenses is $15,997.34 and not the $997.34 as written in Number 13(b). The
Court has added the amounts listed in Number 13(b). The Court notes that there
is no Attachment 13(b). The total amount is $997.34. As there is no explanation
for the unaccounted $15,000.00 for non-medical expenses, the Court believes
that the non-medical expenses of $15,997.34 listed in Number 16(d) to be a
scrivener’s error. The other numbers – medical expenses of $21,574.91 and
attorney’s fees of $75,000 – are reflected accurately in other sections of the
petition. Thus, (1) the total expenses to be paid from the proceeds of
settlement equals $97,572.25 instead of the $112,572.25 written in Number
16(e), and (2) the balance of proceeds of settlement available for Kevin after
payment of all fees and expenses is $202,454.75 instead of the $187,427.75
written in Number 16(f).
 
The Court finds the settlement, as adjusted, to be fair and
reasonable.  The Court also finds the
requested attorney’s fees, which constitute 25% of the gross settlement amount
from each minor claimant, are reasonable.
 
The Court notes while the settlement for Kevin is fair and reasonable,
the petition has raised questions about Emma as it shows (1) a settlement for
Emma in the amount of $4,900.00, and (2) a settlement for Petitioner for
$10,100.00. It is unclear why Petitioner, who is neither a plaintiff nor a
claimant in this action, is receiving a settlement and why the settlement
received by Petitioner is more than the settlement received by Emma, a
plaintiff in the action who allegedly witnessed Kevin fall into the firepit and
burn. (See Complaint ¶ 43.) The Court inquires at the hearing. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Petition to Approve the
Compromise of Pending Action on Behalf of Minor Claimants Kevin Molina is
GRANTED.
 
Non-medical expenses are adjusted pursuant to the
amount written in the Petition at Number 13(b).
