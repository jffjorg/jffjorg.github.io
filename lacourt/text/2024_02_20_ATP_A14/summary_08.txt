And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has sustained the demurrer filed by the defendants, Guar Enterprise, Inc., Sanjay Guar, and Seema Gaur, with leave to amend. The plaintiff, David Greenstein, brought a complaint alleging violations of the California Unruh Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) after being refused access to a restroom at an Arco AM/PM store. The court found that the complaint did not state a cause of action for discrimination under the ADA, as the inability to use the restroom allegedly affected everyone at the store. However, the court allowed leave to amend the complaint to allege violations of California law, as there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
