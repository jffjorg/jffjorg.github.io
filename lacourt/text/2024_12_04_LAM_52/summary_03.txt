Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Arms Trans Inc.'s special motion to strike the entire complaint against it without leave to amend. The complaint alleges that Arms and co-defendant U Work Personnel, Inc. entered into a settlement agreement under false pretenses and that Arms omitted to disclose U Work's suspension by the Franchise Tax Board during settlement negotiations. The judge finds that Arms has met its burden of showing that all eight causes of action arise from protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute, and that plaintiffs have not presented any admissible evidence to establish a prima facie case. The judge also finds that the litigation privilege protects Arms's conduct and bars plaintiffs' claims against Arms. As a result, the court hereby strikes the entire complaint against defendant Arms Trans Inc. without leave to amend.
