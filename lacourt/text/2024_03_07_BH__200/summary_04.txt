And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request by the Bank to determine the validity of a claim against the defendant, Blyumkin. The Bank relies on declarations from Stanislav Krivopusko, the Project Director of VTB DC, LLC, and an expert report from Dr. Ilia Rachkov. The judge grants the request and finds that the claim is probably valid. However, this does not mean that Blyumkin has no defense to the Bank's case. The judge notes that several points need to be explored further, including why the Bank did not return the collateral on the first loan and why Blyumkin became the borrower under the second loan. The judge also finds that the war between Ukraine and Russia is not a relevant consideration, as the Russian proceedings began in 2020.
