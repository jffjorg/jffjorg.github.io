And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, Judge David J. Cowan addresses two motions in limine filed by the Petitioners, Maya Rubin and Jason Rubin, seeking to exclude certain evidence from the trial. The first motion seeks to exclude evidence related to alleged bad acts of Sarolta Nuszer's daughters, Cathy Abbasi and Sarah Mogel, which Petitioners argue are irrelevant to the issue of whether Jim Nuszer and his wife Maria stole Sarolta's interest in NB Industries and her share of the fair market value of 700 Ivy Street. Respondents argue that the evidence is relevant and would show that Sarolta trusted Jim. The Court denies the motion, finding that the evidence may be relevant and that the lack of specificity in the motion does not satisfy the requirements of LASC Local Rule 3.57(a)(1).

The second motion seeks to exclude financial documents, including tax returns, from before 2014, and an unproduced set of books. The Court grants this motion, finding that Respondents did not produce these documents previously and that testimony in lieu of these documents may be vulnerable to objection.
