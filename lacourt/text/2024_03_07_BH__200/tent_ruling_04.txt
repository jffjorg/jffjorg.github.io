[1] Bank relies on declarations of Stanislav Krivopusko,
Project Director of VTB DC, LLC, which is responsible for resolving defaults of
loans by banks that are part of the VTB Group, including Bank, as well as an
expert report of Dr. Ilia Rachkov, a Russian lawyer. Ex. 18 to the Krivopusko
Decl. is a copy of the judgment translated into English. Also attached are
copies of the relevant agreements translated into English.  


[2] The Court grants this request. 


[3] In AO Alfa-Bank, supra, personal
jurisdiction was not challenged based on the sufficiency of defendant’s
contacts with Russia or the reasonableness of personal jurisdiction there.
Instead, his challenge rested on a challenge to service of process.


[4] Blyumkin has not provided any evidence, and there is
nothing in the record, as to any system-wide concerns with impartial
administration of justice in Russia. 


[5] The current war between Ukraine and Russia would not
in any event be a relevant consideration here, as the Russian proceedings began
in 2020 and it is common knowledge that the war started in 2022.


[6] A finding of probably validity of the claim does not mean
that the Court is now finding Blyumkin has no defense to Bank’s case. To the
extent that the underlying merits are relevant (which Bank contends they are
not under CCP sec. 1716), there are several points that the parties may need to
explore further; for example, why Bank allegedly did
not return the collateral on the first loan, why Blyumkin became the borrower
under the second loan and how Blyumkin could have borrowed the funds Bank states
were transferred if the initial borrower was not able to repay what it owed. In
addition, it is unclear whether the Tagansky Court should have advised Blyumkin
it was denying his request to continue the case before proceeding to hear it. Blyumkin
did not support this claim with any evidence or law to warrant denial of this
application.
