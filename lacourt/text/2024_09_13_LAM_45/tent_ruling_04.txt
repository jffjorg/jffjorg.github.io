Hearing Date:             September
13, 2024
Applicant:                   Plaintiff
Elian Flores
Defaulting Party:        Defendants
Gil Eytan, Lior Emuna, CLG New Properties, LLC
Default Taken:            April 5, 2024
Application Filed:       August 23, 2024
 
Request for Entry of Default Judgment
 
The court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE the request
for entry of default judgment.
 
Plaintiff Elian
Flores (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment against Defendants Gil
Eytan, Lior Emuna, and CLG New Properties (“Defendants”) in the amount of $19,560,
including costs.  (8-23-24: Form
JUD-100.)
On August 14,
2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s application for default judgment, filed on
April 19, 2024, without prejudice.  The
Court found that Plaintiff had failed to attach Exhibit C – Demand Letter
showing 2% monthly interest mentioned in Plaintiff’s Affidavit.
            Following
the Court’s ruling, Plaintiff filed JUD-100 on August 23, 2024.  The Court finds that the default package is
deficient as it does not contain any of the other required papers or evidence
in support of the application for default judgment.
The court
therefore DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Plaintiff’s request for entry of default
judgment.
            It
is so ordered.
