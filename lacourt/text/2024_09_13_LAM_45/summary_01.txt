And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions. The first motion is to compel Oliver Leon to comply with a deposition subpoena for personal appearance and production of documents and things. The motion is denied because there is no proof of service that Leon was personally served with the motion to compel and supporting papers.

The second motion is to compel Sharol Batres to further respond to Special Interrogatories Set 2. The motion is granted because Defendant 25 Art, L.P. has satisfied its meet and confer obligation and timely filed its motion. The court finds that Batres' responses are nonresponsive or evasive and without substantial justification. The motion is granted, and Batres is ordered to provide further responses to Defendant's Special Interrogatories Set 2 numbers 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14 within 30 days. Batres and her counsel are also ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,911.65 to Defendant's counsel within 30 days.
