Request for Monetary Sanctions.

Background
On
September 1, 2022, Plaintiff Mirna Valerio Molina (“Plaintiff”) filed the
Complaint in this action against Defendants Elysian City Lights, Aperto
Property Management, Inc., TK Elevator Corporation, and Does 1 to 50  (collectively “Defendants”), asserting causes
of action for (1) negligence; (2) premises liability; (3) common carrier
liability; (4) strict products liability; (5) negligent products liability; and
(6) breach of express and implied warranty. Plaintiff alleges that the elevator
she was using at 1370 Allison Avenue, Los Angeles, jolted upwards as she was
exiting it causing her to fall and sustain injury. According to the Complaint,
the subject elevtor was owned and operated by Defendants. 
On
October 6, 2022, Defendants Elysian City Lights, Aperto Property Management,
Inc. filed their Answer to the Complaint. On the same day, Defendant Tk
Elevator Corporation filed its Answer to the Complaint and a Cross-Complaint
against Aperto Property Management Inc. and Roes 1 to 25.
On
Apil 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed its motion to compel Defendant TK Elevator
Corporation to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s request for production
of documents set one and request for monetary sanctions to which Defendant
opposed on September 8, 2023, and Plaintiff replied on September 13, 2023.[1]

 On September 25, 2023, the case was reassigned
to Department 45 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The parties were ordered pending
motions to be re-calendared in the new department and re-noticed by the moving
party. 
Currently
before the Court, and set for hearing on September 13, is Plaintiff’s motion
filed on November 3, 2023 to compel Defendant TK Elevator Corporation to
provide further responses to Plaintiff’s request for production of documents
set one and request for monetary sanctions. No opposition to this motion was
filed.  
Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Requests for Production of Documents
On receipt of a response to a Request for Production of Documents,
the demanding party may move for an order compelling further responses to the
demand if the demanding party deems that (1) a statement of compliance with the
demand is incomplete, (2) a representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or (3) an objection in the response is
without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)
Motions to compel further responses to RPDs must set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
request. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b).) To establish good cause, a
discovery proponent must identify a disputed fact that is of consequence in the
action and explain how the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or
disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or
disprove the fact. (Digital Music News LLC v. Superior Court (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 216, 224, disapproved on other grounds by Williams v. Superior
Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531; see also Kirkland v. Superior Court
(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98 [characterizing good cause as “a fact-specific
showing of relevance”].) If good cause is shown by the moving party,
the burden shifts to the responding party to justify any objections made to
disclosure of the documents. (Kirkland, supra, 95 Cal.App.4th at 98.)
Discussion 
Insufficient Meet and Confer 
A motion to compel further responses to requests for production of
documents must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) The declaration must state facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented in the motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.) “The Discovery Act
requires that, prior to the initiation of a motion to compel, the moving party
declare that he or she has made a serious attempt to obtain an informal
resolution of each issue.” (Townsend v. Superior Court (1998) 61
Cal.App.4th 1431, 1435.) “A determination of whether an attempt at informal
resolution is adequate involves the exercise of discretion.”  (Stewart
v. Colonial W. Agency (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016.) Where a party
fails to make any real effort at informal resolution, a failure which is
particularly egregious would justify an immediate and outright denial of
further discovery. (Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424,
433-34; Townsend, supra, 61 Cal.App.4th at 1437.)   
Here, the Court finds that the meet and confer
letter that Plaintiff’s counsel sent to Defendant’s counsel on March 24, 2023, requesting
Defendant to provide supplemental responses to Requests for Production of
Document to be inadequate. (Decl. of Asobie, Exh. A; See Stewart 87 Cal.App.4th at
1016.) There is no showing that in requesting Defendant to provide supplemental
responses to said discovery—which was more of a demand—that Plaintiff and
Defendant attempted to meet and confer regarding the discovery dispute. The
letter hardly complies with the requirement that the declaration must state
facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented in the motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.) The failure to meet and confer in good faith is
further demonstrated by the time frame in which Plaintiff’s counsel sent the
letter (March 24, 2023) and filed the original motion (April 3, 2023). It would lessen the burden on the
Court and reduce the unnecessary expenditure of resources by the parties and the
Court should the parties here reach informal resolution to all or part of the
discovery in dispute. (See Townsend 61 Cal.App.4th at 1435.) 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further is CONTINUED and the parties are ordered to meet and confer
further. If the parties are able to fully resolve the discovery dispute, then
the Court will take the Motion off calendar. If the parties are unable to
resolve the entire dispute, then the Court will hear the dispute remaining
after the parties adequately meet and confer. 
It is so
ordered.
