Background
On
January 4, 2022, Plaintiff Lester Jimenez (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in
this action against Defendants 25 Art, L.P., Frederick Leeds, David Oved, and
Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for negligence and premises
liability. Plaintiff alleges that he was seriously injured when he fell down a
flight of stairs on a fire escape attached to a building on South Hobart
Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, that is owned, operated, managed, or
controlled by defendants. 
On
March 25, 2022, Defendants 25 Art, L.P., Frederick Leeds, David Oved filed an
Answer to the Complaint. On the same day, they filed a Cross-Complaint for
indemnity, apportionment, and declaratory relief against Roes 1 through 25.
On
April 5, 2023, Plaintiff amended the Complaint to name Fred Leeds Properties,
an unknown entity, as Doe 1, and Fred Leeds Investment Properties, LP as Doe 2.
On
May 3, 2023, Fred Leeds Investment Properties, LP, filed an Answer to the
Complaint, on its own behalf and as an entity erroneously named as Fred Leeds
Properties. 
On
July 18, 2023, Plaintiff named Olga Avalos as Doe 3. Defendant Avalos filed an
Answer on August 30. 
On
August 14, 2023, Defendants 25 Art, L.P., Frederick Leeds, David Oved amended
their Cross-Complaint to name Sharol Batres as Roe 1. On September 1, they
filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint (the “FACC”). The FACC includes, as the
Fourth Cause of Action, a claim against Batres and Roes 2 through 10 for breach
of lease agreement/contract. Batres filed an Answer on December 15, 2023. 
Currently
before the Court, and set for hearing on September 13, are two motions. On
March 12, 2024, Defendants 25 Art, LP and Frederick Leeds (collectively
“Defendants”)filed a motion to compel nonparty Oliver Leon (“Leon”) to comply
with subpoena for personal appearance and production of documents; Defendants
also seek sanctions. On March 13, 2024, Defendant 25 Art, LP filed a motion to
compel Batres to further respond to 25 Art, LP’s Special Interrogatory Set Two;
Defendant 25 Art, LP also seeks sanctions. 
No
opposition has been filed to any of these motions.
Motion
to Compel Compliance with Deposition Subpoena
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) The
process by which a party may obtain discovery from a person who is not a party
to the action is through a deposition subpoena. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.010,
subd. (b).) Personal service of the deposition subpoena on the non-party is
required. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.220, subd. (b).) 
A
deposition subpoena may command: (1) only the attendance and testimony of the
deponent, (2) only the production of business records for copying, or (3) the
attendance and testimony of the deponent, as well as the production of business
records, other documents, electronically stored information, and tangible
things. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.020.) 
“If
a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (a).) “This motion
shall be made no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the
deposition, and shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Section 2016.040.” (Id., subd. (b).)
“If
the court determines that the answer or production sought is subject to
discovery, it shall order that the answer be given or the production be made on
the resumption of the deposition. (Id., subd. (i).) 
“[T]he
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel an answer or production, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Id., subd.
(j).) 
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” Where a party or
attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a
monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Id.,
§ 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
A
deponent who disobeys a deposition subpoena may also be punished for contempt
without the necessity of a prior order of the court directing compliance by the
witness. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.240.) 
A
motion to compel a non-party to answer questions or produce documents “must be
personally served on the nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees
to accept service by mail or electronic service.” (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.1346.)
Discussion 
            On February 4, 2024, Leon was personally served with a
deposition subpoena issued by Defendants. (Ruiz Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. B.) The
deposition was noticed for March 6, 2024. (Ibid.) On March I, 2024,
Defendants’ counsel received an email from Plaintiff’s counsel asking that the
deposition of Leon be continued; the deposition could not be rescheduled due to
the difficulty of personally serving Leon. (Ruiz Decl., ¶ 6 & Exh. D.) On
March 6, 2024, Plaintiff s counsel appeared for the deposition by zoom. (Ruiz
Decl., ¶ 7.) Leon did not appear, and a Certificate of Nonappearance was
obtained. (Ruiz Decl., ¶ 8 & Exh. E.) On March 8, 2024, Defendants’ counsel
wrote Leon at the address where service was perfected and requested that  he appear for a deposition without the need
of a court order; Leon did not respond. (Ruiz Decl., ¶ 9 & Exh. F.) Counsel
declares good cause exists for the document requests as Leon was one of two
individuals identified by Plaintiff who was actually drinking with him the day
of the incident; the subpoena seeks the production of documents that reflect
communications between Leon and Plaintiff and are believed to relate to
liability and damage issues. (Ruiz Decl., ¶ 10.)
Defendants
have presented evidence that nonparty Leon did not comply with a properly
served deposition subpoena. Defendants have shown good cause for the document
production, and Defendants have satisfied their meet and confer obligation. Further,
the motion is unopposed. However, there is no proof of service that Leon was
personally served with the motion to compel and supporting papers, and Defendants
have not presented evidence that Leon agreed to accept service by mail or
electronic service. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.1346.) 

The
court, therefore, denies the motion. The request for monetary sanctions is denied
based on the denial of the motion and because the authority cited by Defendants
in support of their request are not applicable as previously addressed in
response to Defendants’ prior motions to compel.  
Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Special Interrogatories  
The propounding party may bring a motion to compel further
responses to interrogatories if it believes the responses received are evasive
or incomplete, the attempt to produce writings pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.230 is unwarranted or inadequate, or if the objections
raised are meritless or too general. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(a).) The
motion must be accompanied by a good-faith meet and confer declaration, (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2016.040), and be accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal. R.
Ct., rule 3.1345.) The opposing party bears the burden of justifying any
objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245,
255; Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92,
97-98.)  
Unless extended, the motion must be filed within 45 days of
service of the responses. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2016.050; 2030.300(c); Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410 (“the time within which
to make a motion to compel . . . is mandatory and jurisdictional.”).) 
Discussion 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant
25 Art L.P. requests an order compelling Batres to respond further to 25 ART,
L.P.'S Special Interrogatory set two numbers 9, 10, 11, 13, 14.
On
January 11, 2024, Defendant 25 Art L.P., served Request for Special
Interrogatories Set Two. (Ruiz Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.) On February 14, 2024,
Batres served her responses by electronic mail. (Ruiz Decl., ¶ 3 & Exh. B.)
Thereafter, Defendant 25 Art L.P., initiated a meet and confer request on
February 16, 2024 after determining that the responses were unsatisfactory.
(Ruiz Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. C.)
Upon
review of the motion and declaration of counsel, the court finds that Defendant
25 Art L.P. has satisfied its meet and confer obligation and timely filed its
motion within 45 days of service of Batres’ response. The court also finds that
Defendant 25 Art L.P. is entitled to further responses to the interrogatories
at issue as they are relevant to this action regarding liability and damages
and because Batres’ objection on the grounds that the requests are “irrelevant,
violated right to privacy, and were harassing” is boilerplate. The Court finds the
responses are nonresponsive or evasive and without substantial justification as
no opposition has been filed. 
Therefore,
the motion to compel further is granted. 
As
to sanctions, Defendant 25 Art L.P. requests $5,761,65 in connection with the
motion against Batres and her counsel of record. The requested amount
represents 12 hours at the hourly rate of $475, plus filing fee of $61.65.
(Ruiz Decl., ¶¶ 24-26.) The court grants the request for sanctions in the
reduced amount of $2,911.65 (6 hours at $475 hourly rate, plus $61.65 filing
fee) because the motion is unopposed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(d).)
            Accordingly, the court rules as
follows. 
Motion
to compel Oliver Leon to comply with the deposition subpoena for personal
appearance and production of documents and things, monetary sanctions is DENIED.

Motion
to compel Cross Defendant Sharol Batres to further respond to Special
Interrogatories Set 2, monetary sanctions is GRANTED. Batres is ordered
to provide further responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories Set 2
numbers 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 within 30 days. Batres and
her counsel of record are ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of
$2,911.65 to Defendant’s counsel within 30 days.
It is so
ordered.
