And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the petition for Expedited Minors Compromise without prejudice. The court requires additional medical records to support Claimant Ruth Herrera's current condition. The court also finds that the requested attorney fees of $12,000 are not supported, as the petitioner did not provide a revised calculation based on the court's previous finding of 33.33% of the gross settlement. The court orders the moving party to provide notice of the denial and to amend the petition to include medical records and revised attorney fee calculations.
