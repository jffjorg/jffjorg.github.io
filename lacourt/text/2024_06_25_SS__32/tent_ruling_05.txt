Eighth Amended Standing Order for PI Hub Procedures does not require an
informal discovery conference for initial motions to compel.

appears to suggest that he objects to the notice of deposition encompassing
topics relating to him as a “plaintiff,” but any refusal to answer questions on
this basis necessarily raises the issue of a second deposition. There has been
no dispute that the parties are entitled to depose Espinoza in both cases.
