Here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel the deposition of Enedino Espinoza, an employee of Watermark Security Group, Inc. The motion was brought by Defendant Target Corporation, who argued that Espinoza is required to appear for deposition as an employee of Watermark Security Group, Inc. under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.280. The judge found that the deposition notice was properly served on Watermark Security Group, Inc. and that Espinoza failed to schedule the deposition despite attempts to do so. The judge also rejected Espinoza's objections to the deposition notice, including his argument that only one deposition may be permitted due to his separate representation in the related case. The judge granted the motion to compel and ordered Espinoza to appear for deposition within 5 days.
