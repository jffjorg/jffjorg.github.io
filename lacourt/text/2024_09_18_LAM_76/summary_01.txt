English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the judge sustains the defendants' demurrer to the second and third causes of action (negligence and wrongful death) with leave to amend. The plaintiff is given 30 days' leave to amend the complaint. The motions to strike are moot since there are no viable causes of action against Doe 1 and Doe 2. The judge also ruled that the plaintiff's allegations of elder abuse and wrongful death are time-barred as to the Doe defendants, unless the amendments relate back to the filing of the original complaint.
