And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to designate the plaintiff, Bigfoot Ventures, Ltd., as a vexatious litigant. The motion is denied. The court finds that the plaintiff has had only one adverse determination in the last 7 years and has not met the necessary prongs to establish vexatious litigant status. The court also notes that the plaintiff has presented evidence in support of its argument that it will likely succeed at trial. The defendant's request for judicial notice of various court orders and filings is granted. The court also sustains the plaintiff's objections to a supplemental declaration submitted by the defendant.
