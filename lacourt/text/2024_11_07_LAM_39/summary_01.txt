And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to amend a complaint filed by the Plaintiff, Urban Soccer 5 Center LLC. The Plaintiff seeks to add new defendants and allegations to the complaint, including a claim against Sebastien Abonnel, who was allegedly involved in a conspiracy with the current defendants. The Judge has denied the motion because it lacks evidentiary support. The Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient explanation for why they did not seek leave to amend earlier and did not provide sufficient information about the proposed new defendants. The Judge has wide discretion to allow either party to amend pleadings "upon any terms as may be just," and judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters between the parties. However, the Judge must also ensure that the opposing party was not misled or prejudiced by the amendment.
