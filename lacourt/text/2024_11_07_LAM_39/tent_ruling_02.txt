MOTION


Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses




MOVING PARTY

OPPOSING PARTIES


Defendant Lisa Vernola Salas



 
MOTION
Plaintiff Urban
Soccer 5 Center LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel further responses from Defendant
Lisa Vernola Salas (“Defendant”) to Requests for Production of Documents, set one
(“RPD”) and Requests for Admissions, set one (“RFA”).  Defendant opposes the motions.
ANALYSIS
If the propounding
party deems responses to requests for production of documents or requests for
admissions unsatisfactory, the propounding party may move to compel further
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310,
2033.290.) 
In Defendant’s
supplemental responses to RPD Nos. 8, 9, 15, and 16, Defendant states, “After a
diligent and reasonable search, Responding Party is unable to comply because
the requested documents have been lost or no longer exist and cannot be located.”  Defendant’s response is proper.  If a party cannot respond to an RPD, the
responding party must state that “a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry
has been made in an effort to comply with that demand . . . ,” and must “specify
whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has
never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has
never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the
responding party.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.230.)  Defendant states it made a
diligent search and reasonable inquiry and it could not produce responsive
documents because the documents are either lost or no longer exist.  No further response is warranted.
Defendant’s
responses to RPD Nos. 61, 62, and 73 likewise suffice.  Defendant identifies documents it contends
are responsive and states, “Otherwise, after a reasonable and diligent search,
no other documents have ever existed.” 
No further response is necessary.
In response to RPD
No. 24, Defendant responded, after asserting objections, “To the extent the
documents exist, and [are] within Responding Party's possession, custody and
control, [Responding Party] will comply as previously agreed and will produce,
labeled as Tabs A-P.”  Defendant thus provided
responsive documents after objecting to the RPD, “leaving nothing to address in
a motion to compel.”  (American
Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees v. Metropolitan Water
Dist. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 247, 269.) 
For the same reason, Plaintiff cannot move to compel further responses
to RPD Nos. 66, 67, 68, 69, 74, and 78, to which Defendant responded, after
asserting objections.  The motion to
compel further responses to the RPD is denied. 
After asserting
objections, Defendant provided qualified responses to RFA Nos. 32, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, and 40.  Defendant’s
responses to the RFA must be “as complete and straightforward” as possible.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.220.)   Defendant
denied qualified statements.  Defendant’s
responses are proper.  (See St. Mary
v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 781.)  No further responses are warranted.  Therefore, the motion to compel further
responses to the RFA is denied. The Court concludes
Plaintiff’s motions are without merit and Plaintiff's filing of them
constitutes an abuse of the discovery process. 
The Court, therefore, awards sanctions. 
The Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff and its counsel of record,
Michelangelo Tatone, in the amount of $1,800, which represents six hours of
attorney time to prepare the oppositions to the motions and to attend the
hearing at $300 per hour.  Plaintiff and
its counsel of record, jointly and severally, are to pay sanctions in the
amount of $1,800 to Defendant, by and through counsel, within 30 days of notice
of this ruling.
Defendant is
ordered to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
