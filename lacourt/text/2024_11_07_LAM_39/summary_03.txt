And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules on Defendant F21 OpCo, LLC's demurrer to Plaintiff Anne Heiting's complaint and motion to strike portions of the complaint. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant installed software on its website, which gathers information about users and compares it to existing data, without obtaining a court order in violation of Penal Code section 638.51.

The judge finds that the Defendant's demurrer is overruled and that the Plaintiff's allegations suffice for pleading purposes. The judge also finds that the Defendant's purpose in using the software is an issue of fact and cannot be determined on demurrer.

The judge grants the Defendant's motion to strike the Plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages without leave to amend and strikes the prayer for attorney fees with leave to amend. The judge orders the Plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 20 days of notice of the order and orders the Defendant to provide notice of the order and file proof of service of same.
