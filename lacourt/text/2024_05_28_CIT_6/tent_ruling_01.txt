BACKGROUND           
This is
a breach of contract action. On March 10, 2023, plaintiff Xiuqin Wang
(Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Hao Gong (Gong), Zhiyong Fu
(Fu), Zhuangzhuang Xu (Xu) (collectively, Defendants) and Does 1 to 20,
alleging causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, common count,
conversion, constructive trust, restitution/unjust enrichment, and civil
conspiracy. 
            Default
was entered against Gong on May 18, 2023. Default was later entered against Fu
and Xu on June 23, 2023. On April 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry
of default judgment. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a
proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment
is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil
Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)
exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff seeks
default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $254,183.03, including
$225,050.00 in general damages, $28,301.94 in interest, and $831.09 in costs. The
Court finds Plaintiff has remedied many of the issues noted in the Court’s
prior rulings denying entry of default judgment, but still notes some issues. The
Court finds that the WeChat conversation between Plaintiff and Gong does not
conclusively establish that Gong acknowledged owing Plaintiff $225,050.00.
Plaintiff appears to have been the one that stated that amount, followed by Gong
asking what money had been paid before and how much of that amount was
principal. The conversation ends after that, so it is not clear if Gong
confirmed owing that amount. (Wang Decl., pg. 8 of pdf.) But, the Court otherwise
finds Plaintiff has proven $200,000.00 in damages, as evidenced by the
repayment agreement and Gong’s failures to repay. (Wang Decl., ¶¶ 1-17, pg. 7
of pdf.) Accordingly, the Court will reduce the total damages to $200,000.00. 
Given the
reduced damages, this affects Plaintiff’s prejudgment interest calculation,
which the Court finds to be $25,148.61, i.e., per diem rate of $54.79 (10% of
$200,000, divided by 365 days), multiplied by 459 days, i.e., January 15, 2023
to April 18, 2024, (Wang Decl., pg. 4 of pdf). 
The Court does
note, however, that Fu and Xu are not parties to the repayment agreement. (Wang
Decl., pg. 8 of pdf.) Thus, they cannot be liable for breach of contract. (Cf. Martinez
v. Socoma Companies, Inc. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 394, 400 [generally one must be
a party to a contract to enforce it]; see also Ash v. N. Am. Title Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1268 [“’Contract
damages are generally limited to those within the contemplation of the parties
when the contract was entered into or at least reasonably foreseeable by them
at that time…’”]) 
The
complaint and supporting declaration are otherwise devoid of any allegations
showing that Fu and Xu entered into any sort of agreement with Plaintiff, made
a misrepresentation to Plaintiff upon which Plaintiff reasonably relied to
Plaintiff’s detriment, or otherwise wrongfully took or withheld Plaintiff’s
money. (See Compl., ¶¶ 9-25; Wang Decl., ¶¶ 1-17.) While Gong contends Fu and
Xu received some of the money Gong borrowed from Plaintiff, Plaintiff does not
show how much they each received, what they did with that money, or that they
were still in possession of it. (See Compl., ¶ 9.; Wang Decl., ¶ 1.) Plaintiff
then contends Gong wrote two bad checks under Xu’s name, (Compl., ¶ 21; Wang
Decl., ¶ 13), and that Fu purportedly deposited $42,050 into Plaintiff’s
account, but Plaintiff never received that money, (Compl., ¶ 25; Wang Decl., ¶
17). This is insufficient to establish liability against Fu and Xu. Therefore,
the Court DENIES the request for entry of default judgment as to Fu and Xu with
prejudice. 
CONCLUSION           
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED as to Defendant Hao Gong in the reduced amount of $225,979.70. Plaintiff’s request is DENIED with prejudice as to Defendants Zhiyong Fu and Zhuangzhuang Xu. If Plaintiff submits on the tentative ruling, Plaintiff can submit a new proposed judgment reflecting the reduced amount stated herein prior to the hearing. If the default judgment is entered, no appearance is needed and the OSC will be taken off-calendar.
