LEGAL STANDARD 
“After
the setting of the initial trial date for the action, any party may obtain
discovery by demanding that all parties simultaneously exchange information
concerning each other’s expert trial witnesses” to the extent specified by Code
of Civil Procedure section 2034.210.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.210.)  
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2034.260, subdivision (a), provides: 
“(a) All parties who have appeared in the action shall
exchange information concerning expert witnesses in writing on or before the
date of exchange specified in the demand. The exchange of information may occur
at a meeting of the attorneys for the parties involved or by serving the
information on the other party by any method specified in Section 1011 or 1013,
on or before the date of exchange.
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2034.260, subd. (a).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2034.300 provides: 
“Except as provided in Section 2034.310 and in
Articles 4 (commencing with Section 2034.610) and 5 (commencing with Section
2034.710), on objection of any party who has made a complete and timely
compliance with Section 2034.260, the trial court shall exclude from evidence
the expert opinion of any witness that is offered by any party who has
unreasonably failed to do any of the following: 
“(a) List that witness as an expert under Section
2034.260. 
“(b) Submit an expert witness declaration. 
“(c) Produce reports and writings of expert witnesses
under Section 2034.270. 
“(d) Make that expert available for a deposition under
Article 3 (commencing with Section 2034.410).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.300.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 provides: 
“(a) On motion of any party, the court may grant leave
to complete discovery proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery
heard, closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new
trial date has been set. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(b) In exercising its discretion to grant or deny
this motion, the court shall take into consideration any matter relevant to the
leave requested, including, but not limited to, the following: 
“(1) The necessity and the reasons for the discovery. 
“(2) The diligence or lack of diligence of the party
seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons
that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was not heard
earlier. 
“(3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or
hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the
date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in
prejudice to any other party. 
“(4) The length of time that has elapsed between any
date previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to extend or to reopen
discovery, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Motion to strike Defendant’s expert designation 
1.    Plaintiff’s argument 
December
6, 2022 was the last day to serve a demand for exchange of expert witnesses.  December 27, 2022 was the final day to
exchange expert witness information.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2034.220, 2016.060.) 
On
November 22, 2022, using email, Defendant’s counsel served a demand for expert exchange
with an exchange date of December 26, 2022. 
Plaintiff
served an expert designation on December 29, 2022. In the email serving the
designation, Plaintiff’s counsel explained that Plaintiff had not yet received
a copy of Defendant’s expert designation. 
On
March 24, 2023, Defendant’s counsel served supplemental discovery requests.
Plaintiff’s counsel responded that discovery had been closed when the trial
date was continued but Defendant’s counsel did not respond. 
On
April 6, 2023, Defendant’s counsel served a demand for expert exchange.
Plaintiff’s counsel responded that Plaintiff would not provide a new
designation because discovery had been closed and Plaintiff had never received
Defendant’s designation. Defendant’s counsel asserted
that Defendant had timely disclosed on December 26, 2022.  Plaintiff’s counsel requested a copy of
the designation.  Defendant’s counsel sent a copy of Defendant’s expert disclosure, which had a proof of service
indicating service on December 26, 2022. 
Plaintiff’s counsel examined the metadata in Defendant’s expert disclosure and concluded that the document was created on
January 23, 2023. On April 6, 2023, and April 11, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
requested a copy of the email in which Defendant’s counsel had originally served
the designation. Defendant’s counsel has not provided this email. 

On
May 3, 2023, Defendant’s counsel served a new expert designation. Plaintiff’s counsel
again responded that discovery had been closed and was not reopened when the Court
continued the trial. 
Plaintiff
argues that the Court should strike Defendant’s expert designation and exclude
Defendant’s experts because Defendant did not serve a timely expert designation.  Plaintiff relied on Defendant’s failure to
serve a timely expert designation and has not had an opportunity to depose
Defendant’s two untimely designated experts because discovery has been closed
for months. 
2.    Defendant’s argument 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff may not complain of Defendant’s untimely designation
because Plaintiff filed his designation two days late.   “When the objecting party would
have been entitled to mandatory exclusion of expert testimony under [Code of
Civil Procedure section 2034.300] except for the objecting party’s own
noncompliance with the exchange requirements, exclusion of the opponent’s expert
testimony is discretionary, not mandatory.” 
(R. Fairbank et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Trials and Evidence (Rutter
2022) ¶ 4:274.2, p. 4-71, citing Cottini v. Enloe Medical Center (2014)
226 Cal.App.4th 401, 405 (Cottini); see Cottini, supra, 226
Cal.App.4th at p. 425 [“We read nothing in section 2034.300 to limit the
inherent power of the trial court to exclude from evidence the testimony of
Cottini's expert witnesses as a remedy for his unreasonable failure to comply
with the expert witness exchange requirements prior to the cutoff date for
expert discovery. The statute simply states that when certain conditions are
met (i.e., the party seeking to call an expert witness has unreasonably failed
to list the witness as an expert under § 2034.260, submit an expert witness
declaration, produce reports and writings under § 2034.270, or make the expert
available for a deposition), the appropriate remedy is exclusion of that
expert's testimony. Where the objecting party has made a complete and timely
compliance with section 2034.260, exclusion is mandatory. The statute does not
state, as Cottini would have us hold, that where the objecting party's
compliance with section 2034.260 is untimely, the trial court is powerless to
exclude such testimony”].) 
Defendant
relies on Staub v. Kiley (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1437 (Staub),
where the Court of Appeal concluded that because defendants’ expert witness
exchange demand was premature, they did not comply with the statutory exchange
procedures and therefore lacked standing to seek to exclude the opposing party’s
experts.  (Staub, supra,
226 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1445-1446.)  The court
in Staub did not address whether – as Cottini held – trial courts
have discretion apart from Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.300 to exclude
expert testimony based on a party’s unreasonable failure to comply with the
expert witness exchange requirements.  ““An
opinion is not authority for propositions not considered.’”  (Cottini, supra, 226 Cal.App.4th
at p. 424, quoting Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd.
(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1182, 1195.) 
Defendant
does not dispute Plaintiff’s argument that her expert witness designation was
late.  Instead, she argues “there is no
evidence of gamesmanship on the part of defendant” and Plaintiff has not shown
prejudice because Plaintiff knows who Defendant’s experts are. 
 But Defendant does not mention or
attempt to refute Plaintiff’s assertion that an examination of the metadata in Defendant’s
expert designation, which Plaintiff’s counsel received on April 6, 2023, showed
that the document was created on January 23, 2023, almost one month after
Defendant’s counsel claimed to have served it. When Plaintiff’s counsel received the document on April 6, 2023, it
included a proof of service indicating service on December 26, 2022 and Defendants' counsel stated that Defendant had timely disclosed on December 26, 2022.  
3.    Analysis 
The
Court exercises its discretion to strike Defendant’s expert designation and exclude
Defendant’s experts from testifying at trial because Defendant’s unreasonable
failure to serve a timely expert witness designation prevented Plaintiff from
deposing Defendant’s experts before the discovery cut-off.  In addition, Defendant engaged in “gamesmanship”
by attempting to mislead Plaintiff about when Defendant served the expert witness
designation. 
II.      Motion to continue or reopen discovery 
The
Court has considered the factors identified in Code of Civil Procedure section
2024.050 and finds good cause to re-open discovery for the purpose of allowing the
Court to hear Plaintiff’s motion to strike Defendant’s expert designation and
exclude Defendant’s late-designated experts. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Christopher Thomas’s motion
to strike Defendant Bashie Brianna Turner’s
expert designation and exclude Defendant’s experts from trial. 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Christopher Thomas’s motion to reopen discovery for the
purpose of hearing the motion to strike. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
