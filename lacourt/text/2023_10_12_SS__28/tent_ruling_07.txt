On

On September 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for sanctions
for alleged discovery abuse by Vazquez and for sanctions, to be heard on

PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court compel Vazquez to appear for a deposition and provide
further responses to questions. Plaintiff also requests that the Court
impose sanctions. 
Defendants
request that the Court deny the motion and impose sanctions on Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action … without having
served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
A
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (a) shall
comply with both of the following: "(1) The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice. (2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(b).)  
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (g)(1) provides that if a
motion made under 2025.450 is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“The
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
Misuse
of the discovery process includes "[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery" and "[m]aking or opposing,
unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or to
limit discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (h).) 
DISCUSSION  
The
Court continues the hearing on this motion to November 15, 2023, so it can
be heard at the same time as Defendants’ motion for a protective order
terminating or limiting Vazquez’s deposition and for sanctions.  In addition, the Court advances the hearing
on Plaintiff’s motion for sanctions, filed on September 21, 2023, to today and
continues the hearing to November 15, 2023. 
The
issues raised by these three motions appear to be related.  The Court will address them together.

Court CONTINUES the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant Felipe
Jesus Vazquez’s deposition and for sanctions to November 15, 2023 at 1:30 p.m.
