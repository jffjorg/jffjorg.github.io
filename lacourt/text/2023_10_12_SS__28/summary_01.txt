```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the motion to strike Defendant's expert designation and exclude Defendant's experts from testifying at trial. The Judge finds that Defendant's late expert designation prevented Plaintiff from deposing Defendant's experts before the discovery cut-off, and that Defendant engaged in "gamesmanship" by attempting to mislead Plaintiff about when Defendant served the expert witness designation. Therefore, the Judge grants Plaintiff's motion to strike Defendant's expert designation and exclude Defendant's experts from trial.

Additionally, the Judge grants Plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery for the purpose of hearing the motion to strike. The Judge finds good cause to re-open discovery based on the factors identified in Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling, and the moving party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
