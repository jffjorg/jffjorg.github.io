Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving papers and grants the motion to continue the trial filed by Crowley Lake Fish Camp, Inc. and Sierra Recreation Associates, Inc. The trial was previously scheduled for January 11, 2024, but the defendants have requested a continuance to allow the court to hear a motion for summary judgment prior to trial. The defendants have not yet filed the motion, but have reserved a hearing date in June 2024. The court finds good cause for the continuance and grants the request. The trial is now continued to August 12, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The final status conference is set for July 29, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. All discovery and related dates are set to trail the new trial date.
