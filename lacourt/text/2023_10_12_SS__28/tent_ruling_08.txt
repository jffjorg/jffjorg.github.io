Angeles Department of Water and Power (“Plaintiff”), filed this action against
Defendants Cinthia Briceno Luna (“Defendant”) and
Does 1-10 for property damage. 
On May
2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service on
Defendant of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents
on April 3, 2023. 
On
July 27, 2023, the clerk entered Defendant’s default.  On August 25, 2023, the Court dismissed the
Doe defendants with prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
 On August 24, 2023, Plaintiff submitted a request
for Court judgment to be heard on October 12, 2023. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
The City of Los Angeles requests that the Court enter default judgment against
Defendant Cinthia Briceno Luna and award Plaintiff $57,916.97, consisting of
$53,867.61 in special damages, $0.00 in general damages, $4,049.36 in
prejudgment interest, $0.00 in attorney’s fees, and $0.00 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2)  Declarations
or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section
579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
          On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a cause of
action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence
establishing a prima facie case for damages.” 
(L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide: Procedure), citing
Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred
in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's
default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal
injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount
listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585,
subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental
fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494
(Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken against
them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is taken
against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a right to a
hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A trial court
exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified
in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494; see Cal.
Practice Guide: Procedure, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.) 
The
court “shall hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and shall render
judgment in the plaintiff’s favor for that relief, not exceeding the amount
stated in the complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11, or in the
statement provided for by Section 425.115, as appears by the evidence to be
just. If the taking of an account, or the proof of any fact, is necessary to
enable the court to give judgment or to carry the judgment into effect, the
court may take the account or hear the proof . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
has submitted a completed default judgment packet with all applicable
attachments. Plaintiff’s evidence supports the requested special damages award.  The Court grants the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the application for default judgment filed by Plaintiff City of Los
Angeles on August 24, 2023.  The Court
enters judgment of $57,916.97 against Defendant Cinthia Briceno Luna. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
