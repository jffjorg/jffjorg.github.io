And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the documents submitted in support of default judgments and has ruled as follows. The plaintiff, Douglas Rhee, Jr., seeks default judgment against defendants Hilarion Candido Varela and Steve Song for damages resulting from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff's declarations do not support the amount of special damages he is requesting, and his declaration provides insufficient information to support his request for general damages. The court denies the motion for default judgment, as the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to justify an award of $7,000,000 in general damages from each defendant. The court also notes that the plaintiff is seeking duplicate damage awards from each defendant and may wish to consider filing a single default judgment application with a request that the two defendants be found jointly and severally responsible for the damages.
