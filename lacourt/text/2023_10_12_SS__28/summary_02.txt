And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment and has declined to grant the application. The Plaintiff, Jacob Ali, is seeking a default judgment against the Defendant, Anargyros Lazaridis, for $76,184.94 in damages. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's evidence does not support the request for $49,278.12 in special damages, and that the Plaintiff has not dismissed Does 1-50 as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7). Additionally, the Court notes that the Plaintiff's request for $477.50 in "investigation" fees is unclear and requires additional information to determine recoverability under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. Therefore, the Court denies the application for default judgment and orders the Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
