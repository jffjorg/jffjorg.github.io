And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Ramiro Perez, moves to quash the service of the summons and complaint on the grounds of invalid service. Perez claims that the service was improperly attempted on a person present on the premises, who was not an agent or authorized person to receive service. The plaintiff, Carmen Solis, filed a proof of service on August 18, 2024, showing that service was completed by a licensed process server. The court finds that the plaintiff has met its initial burden to establish valid statutory service of the summons and complaint. Therefore, the motion to quash is denied. Perez is ordered to file a responsive document within 10 days of the order and to give notice.
