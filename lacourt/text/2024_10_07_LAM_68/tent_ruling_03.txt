REQUESTED
Motion to Compel
Further Production to Requests for Production of Documents
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Bewind Company Limited alleges a $1,067,854.66 balance due against
predecessor  Mobileessentials LLC, and
seeks to collect on said balance against Defendant Solaray, LLC, following
Defendant’s acquisition of Mobileessentials LLC with all attendant liabilities.

 
On
March 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for (1) Breach Of Contract (2)
Common Counts (3) Open Book Account (4) Account Stated (5) Unjust Enrichment. Defendant
answered on April 19, 2023.
 
RULING: Denied.
Defendant,
Solaray, LLC moves to compel further responses to Request for Production to of
Documents (set one), numbers 1-36. Defendant summarizes the purported responses
in the separate statement, but the actual omnibus declaration incorporating
multiple sets of discovery items across separately filed motions lacks any
actual copy of any responses. Notwithstanding, Defendant challenges the
objections. Plaintiff in opposition contends Defendant failed meet and confer
prior to filing the motion, Plaintiff served full verified responses to numbers
1-5 and 26-33 with 473 pages of documents, and the motion should otherwise be
denied and sanctions imposed in favor of Plaintiff. The court electronic filing
system shows no reply on file at the time of the tentative ruling publication
cutoff.
 
"Whether a particular response does resolve
satisfactorily the issues raised by a motion is a matter best determined by the
trial court in the exercise of its discretion, based on the circumstances of
the case. In many cases involving untimely responses, the propounding
party will take the motion off calendar or narrow its scope to the issue
of sanctions. If the propounding party proceeds with the motion, however,
the trial court has the discretion to rule on the motion. The trial court might
compel responses without objection if it finds no legally valid
responses  have been provided to one or more interrogatories; it might
deny the motion to compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole
or in part, and just impose sanctions; it might treat the motion as one
under section 2030.300 and either determine that further answers are
required, or order the propounding party to “meet and confer” (§ 2030.300,
subd. (b)) and file a separate statement (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1020(a)(2), (c)); or it might take the motion off calendar, thereby requiring
the propounding party to file a motion under section 2030.300.”
 
(Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 408–409.) 
 
The
court declines to consider the propriety of the responses to numbers 1-5 and
26-33. [Declaration of William Niu, Ex. D.] If Defendant elects to challenge
the electronic signature verification, the court will set a separate hearing,
but otherwise accepts the verification for purposes of the subject motion.
 
On
numbers 6-25, the court finds no evidence of any meet and confer effort prior to
filing the subject motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2).) 
 
The
motion is therefore denied as moot on numbers and 1-5 and 26-33, and denied on
the validity of the objections as to numbers 6-25, due to the lack of any meet
and confer effort. 
 
The
court declines to impose sanctions in favor of Plaintiff given the supplemental
responses were still only served after the filing of the motion. Plaintiff
therefore conceded some validity to the motion and should not recover
sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
 
Trial
date of March 24, 2025, to stand.
 
Defendant
to give notice.
