And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Bewind Company Limited v. Solaray, LLC, denying a motion to compel further responses to a Request for Production of Documents. The Defendant, Solaray, LLC, moved to compel further responses to numbers 1-36, but failed to meet and confer with the Plaintiff prior to filing the motion. The Court finds that the Plaintiff provided full verified responses to numbers 1-5 and 26-33, and that the motion is therefore denied as moot on those numbers. The Court also finds that the Defendant failed to meet and confer prior to filing the motion on numbers 6-25, and therefore denies the motion on those numbers. Additionally, the Court declines to impose sanctions in favor of the Plaintiff, as the supplemental responses were still only served after the filing of the motion. The trial date of March 24, 2025, remains set.
