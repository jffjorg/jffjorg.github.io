And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for pro hac vice admission of attorney Andrew Kolozsvary. The motion is governed by California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40, which requires that the applicant be a member in good standing of and eligible to practice before the bar of any United States court or the highest court in any state, territory, or insular possession of the United States. The applicant must also file a verified application in both court and the State Bar of California establishing certain information, including the applicant's residence and office address, the courts to which the applicant has been admitted to practice, and the dates of admission.

In this case, the applicant, Andrew Kolozsvary, has not sought admission within the last two years and practices within the State of Michigan. The application includes proof of payment to the California State Bar on August 26, 2024. The Judge finds that the application complies with California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40, and grants the motion for pro hac vice admission.

The Judge notes that discovery motions, including a motion for determination of privilege on November 14, 2024, still appear on calendar notwithstanding the September 18, 2024, order referring all discovery to a referee. The trial is currently set for February 24, 2025.
