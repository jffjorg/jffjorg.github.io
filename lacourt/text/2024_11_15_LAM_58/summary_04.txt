And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Defendant Supportive Care Medical Group, dismissing the complaint against the defendant with prejudice. The court found that the claims for negligence and wrongful death against the defendant are time-barred, as the statute of limitations for medical malpractice and wrongful death claims had expired. The court based its decision on the allegations in the complaint, which indicated that the plaintiff had been aware of the alleged wrongful act or negligence that caused the decedent's death and had failed to file the complaint within the statute of limitations. The court also found that the plaintiff had failed to make a specific showing of a reasonable possibility of amending the complaint to cure the defects.
