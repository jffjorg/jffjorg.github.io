 
The is an elder abuse action. On February 7, 2022,
Plaintiffs George Small III (Decedent) (by and through his Successor in
Interest, Barbara Small), Barbara Small, and Kent Small, M.D. (collectively,
Plaintiffs) filed their initial complaint in this action. 
 
            On
July 11, 2023, Defendant Nicholas
Jauregui, M.D., Inc. (Defendant or
Supportive Care) filed
a demurrer to the first cause of action and a motion to strike. Plaintiffs opposed the demurrer and motion to strike. The
Court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend and granted the motion to
strike.
 
            On
September 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC); the FAC
contains causes of action for (1.) elder abuse, (2.) negligence, and (3.) wrongful death. Defendant
Supportive Care filed
a demurrer to the first cause of action to the FAC and a motion to strike. The
Court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.
 
            On
January 10, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended
Complaint (SAC); the SAC contains causes of action for (1.) elder abuse, (2.) negligence,
and (3.) wrongful death.

 
            On February 9, 2024, Defendant Supportive
Care filed a demurrer to the first cause
of action for the SAC and a motion to strike. Plaintiffs
opposed the demurrer and motion to strike. The demurer to the first cause of
action was sustained without leave to amend. The motion to strike was also
granted without leave to amend. 
 
            Then,
Defendant European Loving Care II (European) demurred
to the first, second and third causes of action in the SAC and moves to strike
portions of the pleading.  Plaintiffs
opposed the demurrer and motion to strike. The Court sustained the demurrer and
granted the motion to strike.
 
            On
August 15, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Complaint (TAC); the TAC
contains causes of action for (1.) elder abuse, (2.) negligence, and (3.) wrongful death.
 
            On
September 16, 2024, Defendant Nicholas Jauregui, M.D., Inc. dba Supportive Care Medical
Group (Supportive Care) filed the instant motion for
judgment on the pleadings as to the second and third causes of action. (The
first cause of action of the Third Amended Complaint was not pleaded against Supportive
Care; the Court had previously sustained a demurrer without leave to amend as
to that claim against that Defendant.) Plaintiff filed no opposition to
Defendant Supportive Care’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.
 
            The
motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted without leave to amend. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            “[A] motion for judgment on
the pleadings is the functional equivalent of a general demurrer.... Indeed,
the only significant difference between the two motions is
in their timing.” (People v. $20,000 U.S. Currency (1991) 235
Cal.App.3d 682, 691.)
 
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. The defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading
stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the
defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however,
admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the
pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in
law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732
[internal citations omitted].)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Second Cause of Action for
Negligence and Third Cause of Action for Wrongful Death: 
 
            The
essential elements of a negligence claim are: “(1) a defendant's legal duty to use
due care; (2) a breach of that duty; and (3) the breach as the proximate or
legal cause of the resulting injury.” (Elam v. College Park Hospital
(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 332, 338.) Similarly, the elements of a cause of action
for wrongful death are (1) a wrongful act or negligence on the part of the
defendants, (2) caused the decedent’s death, (3) resulting in damages to the
plaintiff. (Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Center (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256,
1263.)
 
            In a cause
of action for medical malpractice and wrongful death, the statute of
limitations is “three years after the date of injury or one year after the
plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have
discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first. In no event shall the time for
commencement of legal action exceed three years unless tolled for any of the
following: (1) upon proof of fraud, (2) intentional concealment, or (3) the
presence of a foreign body, which has no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or
effect, in the person of the injured person.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.5.)
 
Injury is “ ‘ “damage which has clearly surfaced and is
noticeable.” ’ ” (Garabet v. Superior Court (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1538,
1550.) “Once the damaging effect of the alleged wrongful act is apparent, the
statute [of limitations] is activated. This event may occur even without the
knowledge that negligence was the cause of the injury.” (Hills v. Aronsohn
(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 753, 762.)
 
To avoid being time-barred by the statute of limitations, Plaintiffs
were required to bring their cause of action for medical malpractice and
wrongful death “on the earlier date of three years after [her] injury or
one year after [she] discovered the injury.” (Filosa v. Alagappan (2020)
59 Cal.App.5th 772, 778.)[1]
 
            Here, the
TAC alleges that Decedent passed away on February 6, 2020. (TAC ¶¶ 1, 37.) There
are no allegations suggesting a delayed discovery of the negligent cause of Decedent’s
injury. In fact, the TAC alleges that Plaintiff Kent Small was “shocked” by Decedent’s
condition as of February 6, 2020 “when [Decedent] was awake, alert, and
oriented a few days earlier.” (TAC ¶ 37.) Plaintiff Kent Small then “demanded
that [Defendants] cease all further chemical restraints of his father.” (TAC ¶
37.) 
 
These allegations indicate that Plaintiffs were on notice that
something was wrong and deserving of further inquiry. (Enfield v. Hunt
(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 302, 308.) The statute of limitations requires Plaintiffs
then “conduct a reasonable investigation of all potential causes of that
injury.” (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 808; Hills,
supra, 152 Cal.App.3d at p. 760.) 


Thus, to be timely, the complaint had to be filed no later
than February 6, 2021 – one year from the date of injury/death. Here, the
instant action was filed on February 7, 2022 – more than a year later. Based on
the foregoing allegations, Plaintiffs’ claims for negligence and wrongful death
against Defendant Supportive Care are time barred. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion for
judgment on the pleadings is granted in favor of Defendant Supportive Care as
to the second and third causes of action. 
 
Plaintiff has
failed to make a specific showing of a reasonable possibility of amending. (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians' Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43 [“The
plaintiff bears the burden of proving there is a reasonable possibility of
amendment.”].)  Accordingly, the motion
for judgment on the pleadings is granted without leave to amend.
 
The Court
dismisses with prejudice the entire complaint against Defendant Nicholas
Jauregui, M.D., Inc. dba Supportive Care Medical Group.
