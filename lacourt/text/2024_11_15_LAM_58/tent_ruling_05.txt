[1] A medical malpractice cause of action is not timely
if only one of the limitations requirements is met because the statute
“requires that the action be brought within the limitation which ‘occurs
first.’ ” (Hills, supra, 152 Cal.App.3d at p. 758.) “To make it even
more evident that a plaintiff must satisfy the requirements of both provisions,
the statute further provides that ‘[i]n no event shall the time for
commencement of legal action exceed three years.’ ” (Ibid.; Moore v.
State Bd. of Control (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 371, 382.)
