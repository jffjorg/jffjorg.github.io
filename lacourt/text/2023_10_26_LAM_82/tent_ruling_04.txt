Case:               Gerardo Gonzalez v. City of
Cerritos (23STCP02409)
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Petitioner Gerardo Gonzalez’s Petition for Relief from
Claims Presentation Requirement of Government Code § 945.4 is DENIED. 
 
On April 4, 2022, petitioner was allegedly injured while working
at the City of Cerritos Corporate Yard. (Gonzalez Decl. ¶ 3; Golshani Decl. ¶ 3
& Ex. 3.) A claim relating to a cause of action
for personal injury must be presented to the public entity no later than six
months after the accrual of the cause of action.¿ (Gov. Code § 911.2; Munoz
v. State of California¿(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1776.)¿Accordingly, petitioner had until October 4, 2022 to present a claim
to respondent City of Cerritos. No such timely claim was presented to the City.
 
Instead, petitioner submitted a written application to
respondent for leave to present a late claim. (CCP §§ 911.4, 911.6; Golshani
Decl. ¶ 1 & Ex. 1.) That claim was denied on May 3, 2023. (Golshani Decl. ¶
2 & Ex. 2.) Petitioner brings the instant petition seeking relief under
Government Code § 946.6 to present a late claim. The instant
petition was filed on July 12, 2023, within six months of May 3, 2023, in
accordance with Government Code § 946.6(b).
 
Petitioner is required to demonstrate that the failure to
present a claim under Government Code § 945.4 was “through mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect….” (Gov. Code § 946.6(c)(1).)
“The mere recital of mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect is
not sufficient to warrant relief…. There must be more than the mere failure to
discover a fact; the party seeking relief must establish the failure to
discover the fact in the exercise of reasonable diligence.” (Department of
Water & Power v. Superior Court (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1293.) “The
party seeking relief based on a claim of mistake must establish he was diligent
in investigating and pursuing the claim [citation] and must establish the
necessary elements justifying relief by the preponderance of the evidence.” (Id.)
 
Petitioner maintains that he initially hired the Law Offices
of Jacob Emrani (“Emrani”) to handle his workers compensation claim. (Gonzalez
Decl. ¶ 4.) Emrani purportedly never identified a government claim during the six-month
period to present a claim under Government Code § 911.2. (Ibid.) Petitioner
claims that only after discharging Emrani and hiring a different attorney did petitioner
discover the possibility of a claim against respondent City of Cerritos. (Ibid.)

 
“Failure to discover the alleged basis of the cause of
action in time is…not a compelling showing in the absence of reasonable
diligence exercised for the purpose of discovering the facts.” (Tsingaris v.
State of California (1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 312, 314.)  Petitioner hired former counsel Emrani in
mid-May 2022 (Pet. at 7:4-5), which was many months before the October 4, 2022
deadline to file a claim with the City of Cerritos. “[A] late claimant who
seeks relief under section 946.6 may be barred by inexcusable delay by
counsel.” (Hasty v. County of Los Angeles (1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 623, 626,
citing Black v. County of Los Angeles (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 670, 674-77.)  Here, petitioner does not demonstrate that
former counsel was reasonably diligent in discovering the available claims
against respondent. Petitioner does not provide a declaration from any
representative of former counsel to demonstrate what efforts were made between
May 2022 and October 2022 to ascertain the claims available against respondent.
Petitioner does not state what information former counsel had concerning the
incident, which could inform the Court on the reasonableness of any delay by
former counsel to discover the claims available against respondent.
 
Further, petitioner does not provide any details concerning
attempts he made to follow up with former counsel regarding the status of his
case. (Golshani Decl. Ex. 1 & Ex. 1 at ¶ 3 [“Claimant’s former counsel
began working on this case on an unknown time, the previous counsel has failed
to respond to any inquiries into the [sic] their work on the matter”].)
Instead, petitioner states that “after a while,” he “got the feeling that [his]
case was not being attended to properly.” (Gonzalez Decl. ¶ 4.) “Where the
lateness of the claim is attributable to the failure of the claimant or his
counsel to conduct a reasonably prudent investigation of the circumstances of
the accident, relief from the claims filing statute is not available.” (Department
of Water & Power v. Superior Court (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1296.)
 
The Court notes that, where “the attorney's neglect is in an
extreme degree amounting to positive misconduct, and the person seeking relief
is relatively free from negligence,” the neglect of counsel is not imputed on
the client. (Ibid.) However, as discussed above, petitioner does not
provide sufficient information for the Court to determine that former counsel’s
neglect amounted to positive misconduct or that petitioner was free from any
negligence, including efforts (or lack thereof) to follow up with former
counsel regarding the status of the case.
 
Petitioner also argues that his late claim should be allowed
because he purportedly was incapacitated after his April 4, 2022 fall due to
resulting injuries. (Gonzalez Decl. ¶ 3; Pet. at 7:1-3.) It is true the Court “shall
relieve a petitioner” who complied with Government Code § 911.4 from the
requirements of Government Code § 945.4 if the petitioner failed to timely
present the claim due to physical incapacity. (Gov. Code § 946.6(c)(5).) Here,
however, petitioner’s claimed physical incapacity is not determinative.
Petitioner does not present meaningful evidence to demonstrate physical
incapacity prevented him from pursuing relief for the fall and making a timely
claim.  To the contrary, petitioner was
able to retain counsel a little more than one month after the incident. 
 
Lastly, even crediting petitioner’s assertion that he
believed workers compensation was his only remedy, such belief is unavailing.
In Powell v. City of Long Beach (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 105, cited by
petitioner, the appellant did not seek counsel until after the presentation
period because he had sought and obtained workers compensation benefits, which
he believed were his sole remedy. (Powell, 172 Cal.App.3d at 110.) The
Court of Appeal found that the appellant “had no reason to seek advice of
counsel and, in fact, was acting in just the manner designed by the workers'
compensation laws.” (Ibid.) Here, by contrast, petitioner had counsel
during the presentation period. As is discussed above, any inexcusable neglect
by former counsel is imputed to petitioner. (Clark v. City of Compton
(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 522, 528.) 
 
In sum, there is no explanation why counsel delayed in
pursuing petitioner’s claim until the presentation period set forth in
Government Code § 911.2. Petitioner
consequently does not demonstrate the diligence necessary to obtain relief
under Government Code § 946.6. While there is a “general policy favoring trial
on the merits,” it “cannot be applied indiscriminately so as to render
ineffective the statutory time limits.” (Department of Water, 82
Cal.App.4th at 1293.)
 
The petition is DENIED.
