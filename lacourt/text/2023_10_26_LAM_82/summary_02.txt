And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition for a writ of administrative mandamus filed by Dr. Timothy Hunt, a physician and orthopedic surgeon, against the Medical Board of California, Department of Consumer Affairs, State of California. The petition challenges the Board's decision to revoke Dr. Hunt's medical license.

The judge has found that the Board's decision was justified. Dr. Hunt was part of a scheme to refer patients to Pacific Hospital in exchange for kickbacks, and he was convicted of a felony and ordered to forfeit $3 million. Despite his recent expression of remorse, Dr. Hunt has not demonstrated rehabilitation, and the Board was entitled to revoke his license to protect the public.

The judge has also found that the Board's decision complies with the requirements of Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974), which requires that the agency's findings be sufficient to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and the ultimate decision or order.

The petition is denied, and the Board shall prepare, serve, and file a proposed judgment.
