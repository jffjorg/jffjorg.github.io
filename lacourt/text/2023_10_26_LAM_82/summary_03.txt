  - The Court does not have the power to order a non-party escrow agent to release funds.
  - It is premature to determine whether defendants are entitled to recovery of interest, fees, and costs incurred in defeating the attachment.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the application for a right to attach order filed by Morad Ben Neman and Lancaster Eagle, LLC against Payam Bahari, 114 Grand Cypress, LLC, Cavalini, Inc., and Caster Modelo, LLC. The application sought to secure $1,740,312.50 in attachment. The Court found that the claimant failed to demonstrate the probable validity of their claim for a share of the profits from the sale of the Grand Cypress Property pursuant to an alleged oral joint venture agreement.

The Court noted that the existence of a written agreement between entities related to the parties concerning an agreement to jointly purchase a property at 42933 Business Center Parkway in Lancaster suggests that an agreement between Nemen and the Bahari defendants for a real estate joint venture of the type alleged here would have been reduced to writing.

The Court also denied the request for an order requiring the release of funds encumbered by the temporary protective order, noting that it does not have the power to order a non-party escrow agent to release funds. The Court deferred consideration of the request for recovery of interest, fees, and costs incurred in defeating the attachment until further litigation.
