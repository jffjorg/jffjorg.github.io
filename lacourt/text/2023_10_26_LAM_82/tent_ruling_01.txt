Case:                           Sound Equity High Income Debt
Fund, LLC v. Top Flight Investments LLC et al. (21STCV13141)
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Receiver Pacific Crest Realty Advisors, LLC’s Motion for
Approval of Receiver’s Fourth Interim Request for Fees is GRANTED. 
 
Receiver Pacific Crest Realty Advisors, LLC moves for
approval of its interim fees incurred in the performance of its duties. 
 
Pursuant to the Order Appointing Equity Receiver and
Preliminary Injunction entered on 3/17/22, Receiver is authorized to prepare
“periodic interim statements reflecting the Receiver’s fees and administration
of the Receivership Estate.” (3/17/22 Receiver Order ¶ 11.) Receiver is
obligated to submit its fees and expenses to the Court for approval and
confirmation by way of a noticed interim request for fees, a stipulation among
the parties, or the Receiver’s final account and report. (3/17/22 Receiver
Order ¶ 11.) 
 
Through three interim requests for fees, Receiver seeks approval
of $42,960.50 incurred between July 2022 and September 2022. 
 
“Interim fees are subject to final review and approval by
the court. The court retains jurisdiction to award a greater or lesser amount
as the full, fair, and final value of the services rendered.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1183(a).) “Unless good cause is shown, objections to a receiver’s
interim report and accounting must be made within 10 days of notice of the
report and accounting, must be specific, and must be delivered to the receiver
and all parties entitled to service of the interim report and accounting.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1183(b).) No objections were received. 
 
A review of the invoices received in support of the motions
reveals that Receiver collected rental income from the properties of defendant
Top Flight Investments LLC, paid utilities and vendors, marketed the properties,
completed repairs of the properties, negotiated offers for sale, reviewed lien
claims, and advanced the eviction of unlawful occupants from the properties. (Constantinescu
Decl. ¶¶ 19-62 & Exs. 1-3; 3/17/22 Receiver Order ¶ 3(b) [“The Receiver is
granted the following powers and duties…[t]o operate, manage, maintain,
preserve, market, and sell the Property, and to collect revenues, security
deposits, storage fees, income, issues, and profits thereof….”].) Receiver billed
$295 per hour for Sidney Constantinescu, $160 per hour for accounting tasks,
and $50 per hour for administrative tasks, rates which are permitted in the
March 17, 2022 order appointing Receiver. (3/17/22 Receiver Order ¶ 2(d).) Having
reviewed the supporting declaration and invoices, the Court finds that the fees
claimed by Receiver are reasonably related to the administration of the
Receivership Estate. 
 
The motion is GRANTED. The Court strikes the words “and
costs” from paragraph 2 from the proposed order lodged on 9/29/23, as Receiver
is not seeking costs. (Motion at 10, fn. 1.) The Court signs the proposed order
lodged on 9/29/23.
