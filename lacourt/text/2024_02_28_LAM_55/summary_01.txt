Summary:
The judge has made a tentative ruling on two motions to strike or tax costs filed by Plaintiffs Gerald Owen Ryckman and Judith Lorraine Ryckman. The motions seek to strike or tax costs sought by Defendants Michael Schwimer, David Drexler, and Laura Drexler in connection with an anti-SLAPP motion. The judge finds that the costs sought by the Defendants are reasonable and necessary for the conduct of the litigation, and therefore denies the motions.
