 Case Number:  22STCV36583    Hearing Date:   February 28, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  DEFENDANT LEO IMANI, INC’S MOTION TO COMPEL
FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES FROM PLAINTIFF AND REQUEST FOR
MONETARY SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,360.00. DEFENDANT NEDA MENSWEAR, INC.'S
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES FROM PLAINTIFF AND
REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,360.00.
 
In this case, SUITS AMERICA, INC. (“Plaintiff”) claims
that NEDA MENSWEAR, INC., PEYMAN ELYASI and LEO MANI, INC. (“Defendants”) failed
to pay Plaintiff for the products Plaintiff allegedly provided to Defendants. 
Defendants filed motions to compel further responses
to form interrogatories that each of them served upon Plaintiff. After filing
the motions, the parties held an IDC with the Court. As reflected in Plaintiff’s
opposition and Defendants’ reply, Plaintiff subsequently served further verified
responses to the form interrogatories. 
Defendants’ reply does not contest the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s
further supplemental responses. The Court’s review of the supplemental responses
confirms that Plaintiff provided further supplemental information to the form
interrogatories at issue in the motion. The Court therefore exercises its
discretion to order the motions off-calendar. Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., v. Klugman (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 409.
Defendants’ reply maintains that they are entitled to
sanctions. Plaintiff also seeks sanctions in its opposition. Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure Section 2030.300(d), the Court shall impose monetary
sanctions against any party that unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further responses unless it concludes that the one subject to the
sanctions “acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanctions unjust.” Here, the Court finds Defendants were
substantially justified in filing the motions due to Plaintiff’s incomplete and
evasive responses to the form interrogatories. Moreover, many of Plaintiff’s
objections lacked merit. The Court therefore finds no basis to impose sanctions
against Defendants. 
On the other side, Plaintiff is correct that
Defendants’ separate statement does not comply with CRC 3.1345. More important,
Plaintiff did supplement the responses after the parties’ informal discovery
conference.  Plaintiff provided these further
responses well-ahead of the motion hearing date and Defendants’ reply does not
contest the sufficiency of these further responses. Under these circumstances,
the Court ultimately concludes that it would be unjust to impose sanctions against
Plaintiff.
