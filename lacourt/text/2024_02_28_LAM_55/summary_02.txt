And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories from the plaintiff, SUITS AMERICA, INC., and a request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,360.00. The defendants, NEDA MENSWEAR, INC. and LEO IMANI, INC., claim that the plaintiff failed to provide complete responses to their interrogatories. The judge finds that the defendants were substantially justified in filing the motions due to the plaintiff's incomplete and evasive responses. However, the judge also finds that the plaintiff supplemented its responses after an informal discovery conference, and therefore does not impose sanctions against the plaintiff. The judge grants the motions to compel further responses, but does not award monetary sanctions against the plaintiff.
