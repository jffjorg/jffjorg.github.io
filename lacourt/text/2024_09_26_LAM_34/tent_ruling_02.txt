             Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint states “As a result of that Lease, Defendant has charged and accepted
rents from Plaintiff for $1500 to $1,5550 per month from the time the Lease
Agreement was fully executed until the present time.” (FAC, ¶ 16.) Assuming
that Plaintiff made a typographical error, the range of rent received by
Defendant was of $1,500 to $1,550. 


[2]
             Plaintiff filed two separate
oppositions to Defendant’s Demurrer on September 13, 2024, at 5:49 p.m. and at
6:01 p.m. Plaintiff’s Opposition is not in compliance with California Rule of
Court 3.1113. The court will not consider any briefs from Plaintiff that are
not in compliance with this rule in the future.


[3]
             The court will remind the
parties of its obligation to meet and confer consistent with the requirements
of section 430.41(a). Here, it appears a single letter was sent to Plaintiff’s
counsel and no follow up was done. The court will not accept such a practice
going forward and contemplates at the hearing speaking with counsel to
determine whether a continuance should be granted to allow for a proper meet
and confer.
