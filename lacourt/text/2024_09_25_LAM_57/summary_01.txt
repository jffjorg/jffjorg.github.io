And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff, George Luk, lacks standing to enforce the 2010 Lease against the defendant, Sigal Redfield, because Luk is not a party to the lease agreement. The evidence shows that the 2010 Lease was executed between Redfield and her husband, John Redfield, as tenants, and ACI International LLC as the landlord. Luk is not mentioned as a party to the lease or having any rights under it. Additionally, the judge found that Luk's opposition to Redfield's summary judgment motion did not create a disputed issue of material fact, and that Luk did not provide any evidence of an assignment of ACI's rights under the 2010 Lease to himself. Therefore, the judge granted Redfield's motion for summary judgment and vacated all future hearing dates in the case, including the scheduled trial.
