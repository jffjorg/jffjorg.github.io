And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has partially granted the plaintiff's motion for an order directing the defendants to pay attorney's fees and costs. The settlement agreement between the parties deems the plaintiff the "prevailing party" and allows them to file a motion to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The court has awarded the plaintiff $27,508.50 in attorney's fees and $937.07 in costs and expenses. The court has disallowed recovery of attorney's fees in the amount of $980 related to the preparation of discovery requests and reduced the amount of attorney's fees related to the motion for fees and costs by $1,042.50. The defendants are ordered to pay the awarded amount to the plaintiff by November 25, 2024.
