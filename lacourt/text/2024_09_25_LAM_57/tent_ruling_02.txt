[1] In his
deposition in this action, Luk made reference to a second lease for the Property
with Redfield that purportedly was executed in 2012 (“the 2012 Lease”).  In his opposition to Redfield’s summary judgment
motion, however, Luk makes clear that he is not suing to recover the claimed
rental debt based the 2012 Lease, but rather, on the 2010 Lease.  (Opposition, p. 4 citing Luk Decl., ¶ 15 [“I
have not been able to locate the 2012 Lease and believe that it was never
created.”].)


[2] Luk presented
no evidence that he is a third-party beneficiary of the 2010 Lease, and is not
arguing that third-party beneficiary status gives him a right to enforce the
2010 Lease.
