And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion filed by Joshua House Health Center to strike Paragraphs 51 and 67 from the Plaintiffs' complaint and Paragraph 4 of the Complaint's Prayer for Relief. Joshua House contends that the Complaint contains insufficient allegations to support an award of exemplary and punitive damages against it as a corporation. The judge agrees with Joshua House and grants its motion to strike, but allows the Plaintiffs to amend the Complaint. The judge's ruling is based on Civil Code Section 3294, which provides that actions on which a prayer for an award of punitive or exemplary damages against a corporation rests must have been taken by an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation. The judge finds that the Complaint fails to allege that the actions in question that it attributes to Joshua House were taken by any such individuals.
