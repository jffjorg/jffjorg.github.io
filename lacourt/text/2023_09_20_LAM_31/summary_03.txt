And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production in a lawsuit between a plaintiff and GM. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, who is seeking information regarding GM's knowledge and handling of engine defects in Chevrolet vehicles.

The judge has granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The specific requests that were granted include:

* Request No. 54, which seeks documents related to GM's evaluation of consumer requests for repurchases under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
* Request No. 56, which seeks training manuals and documents related to the training given to GM employees and agents regarding handling of consumer lemon law repurchase requests.

The specific requests that were denied include:

* Requests related to engine defects in other Chevrolet vehicles, as they are overbroad and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence on the subject vehicle.
* Requests related to government agency communications, as they are overbroad and seek documents that are not relevant to the subject vehicle.
* Requests related to Early Warning Reports and performance standards, as they are overbroad and seek information that is not relevant to the subject vehicle.

The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
