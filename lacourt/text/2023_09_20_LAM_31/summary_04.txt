```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff is granted. The cross-complaint seeks damages for breach of contract and negligence. The judge finds that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises out of the same transaction as the original lawsuit, and that the defendant did not act in bad faith. The judge notes that the defendant inadvertently brought a second lawsuit against the plaintiff, but that this does not rise to the level of bad faith. The judge orders the defendant to give notice of the ruling and suggests that any other pleading issues should be reserved for a demurrer.

## English Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling in this case **grants** the Defendant's motion to file a cross-complaint against the Plaintiff.  

The Judge found that the Defendant's cross-complaint is **compulsory** because it stems from the same transaction or series of transactions as the Plaintiff's original claim, which involves an agreement to sell a residential property.  

The Plaintiff argued that the Defendant acted in **bad faith** by not filing the cross-complaint concurrently with their Answer, but the Judge found no evidence of bad faith. The Judge noted that the Defendant inadvertently filed a second action against the Plaintiff instead and took steps to rectify the situation. 

The Judge emphasized the **liberal interpretation** of the legal standard for filing cross-complaints, stating that the burden of proving bad faith rests on the opposing party.

```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to file a cross-complaint, finding that it is a compulsory cross-complaint that arises out of the same transaction as the original complaint. The Defendant had inadvertently brought a second action against the Plaintiff, but after consulting with alternative counsel, decided to move forward with the motion to file a cross-complaint and dismiss the second action. The Court found that there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the Defendant, and that the worst the Defendant could be charged with is neglect. The Court also found that the cross-complaint is in the interest of justice and should be granted. The Plaintiff's opposition to the cross-complaint was based on the fact that the Defendant did not file the cross-complaint concurrently with the answer, but the Court found that a late filing of a motion for leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint is not sufficient to support denial of the motion absent some evidence of bad faith. The Court ordered the moving party to give notice, and any other pleading issues the Plaintiff takes against the cross-complaint should be reserved for a demurrer.

## English Summary

The judge is granting the Defendant's motion to file a cross-complaint against the Plaintiff. 

The Defendant mistakenly filed a second lawsuit instead of a cross-complaint within the initial 30-day window.  However, the judge found that this delay, along with the Defendant consulting with alternative counsel and choosing to dismiss the second lawsuit,  doesn't demonstrate bad faith.

The judge emphasizes the legal principle that late filing of cross-complaints is not automatically grounds for denial, especially when no evidence of intentional wrongdoing exists.
