```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff is granted. The cross-complaint seeks damages for breach of contract and negligence. The judge finds that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises out of the same transaction as the original lawsuit, and that the defendant did not act in bad faith. The judge notes that the defendant inadvertently brought a second lawsuit against the plaintiff, but that this does not rise to the level of bad faith. The judge orders the defendant to give notice of the ruling and suggests that any other pleading issues should be reserved for a demurrer.
