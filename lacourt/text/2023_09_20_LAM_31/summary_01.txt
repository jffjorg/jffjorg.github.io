## English Summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to grant Defendant Jose Ontiveros Jr.'s motion to expunge the lis pendens (a notice filed with the court that warns potential buyers of a pending lawsuit affecting a property).  The lis pendens was recorded on two properties owned by Ontiveros Jr. in Los Angeles.

The Judge found that Plaintiff, who filed the original lawsuit, failed to meet her burden of proof by not opposing the motion. Since the Court had previously ruled in favor of Ontiveros Jr. in a separate motion, the lis pendens was deemed no longer necessary.

As a result, the lis pendens is being expunged, and Plaintiff and her attorney are ordered to pay $2,710 in attorney fees and costs to Ontiveros Jr.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Jose Ontiveros Jr.'s motion to expunge the lis pendens, which was recorded on two properties in Los Angeles, California. The judge found that the Plaintiff did not meet their burden of demonstrating that their pleadings contained a real property claim and that the probable validity of their real property claim could be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Since the action has been resolved in favor of the Defendant, there is no longer any need for the lis pendens, and it is therefore moot. The judge has ordered the Plaintiff and their counsel to pay attorney's fees and costs of $2,710 to the Defendant.

The judge's ruling is based on California Civil Procedure Code sections 405.30, 405.31, and 405.38, which govern the recording and expungement of lis pendens. The judge cited a prior case, BGJ Association, LLC v. Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 952, 966, to support their finding that the purpose of a lis pendens is to give constructive notice of an action affecting title or right to possession of real property. Since the action has been resolved in favor of the Defendant, there is no longer any action affecting title or right to possession of the real property, and the notice of lis pendens is therefore moot.
