And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Jose Ontiveros Jr.'s motion to expunge the lis pendens recorded on 9926 Anzac Avenue and 1961 East Century Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. The lis pendens is expunged as the Plaintiff failed to file an opposition and did not meet the burden of proof to establish a real property claim and the probable validity of the real property claim. The Court also awards attorney's fees and costs of $2,710 to the Defendant, jointly and severally, as the Plaintiff and her counsel of record failed to provide a valid reason for the motion. The Judge concludes that the lis pendens is moot as the action has been resolved against the Plaintiff, and there is no action affecting title or right to possession of the real property.
