```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a Pitchess Motion, which is a motion to disclose peace officer personnel records. The motion is denied without prejudice because the plaintiff failed to attach the police report to the motion, as required by Evidence Code section 1046. The plaintiff has since attached the police report, but the defendants have not had an opportunity to respond. Additionally, the initial declaration filed in support of the motion lacks a factual foundation for the discovery, and the motion relies on new evidence that was not permitted with the reply papers. The motion is denied without prejudice, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
