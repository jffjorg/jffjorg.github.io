And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a Pitchess Motion, which is a motion to disclose peace officer personnel records. The motion is denied without prejudice because the plaintiff failed to attach the police report to the motion, as required by Evidence Code section 1046. The plaintiff has since attached the police report, but the defendants have not had an opportunity to respond. Additionally, the initial declaration filed in support of the motion lacks a factual foundation for the discovery, and the motion relies on new evidence that was not permitted with the reply papers. The motion is denied without prejudice, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the Pitchess Motion, which is a request by the plaintiff to discover peace officer personnel records related to four defendant officers. The motion is denied without prejudice because the plaintiff failed to provide an initial declaration showing a factual foundation for the discovery, and new evidence was filed with the reply papers without giving the defendant an opportunity to respond. The judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel filed an additional declaration in support of the reply, but this declaration includes new evidence that the defendant has not had an opportunity to respond to. The judge also points out that the defendant officers argued that the plaintiff failed to attach the police report to the motion, as required by Evidence Code section 1046, but this section is not within the notice provisions of section 1043. The judge concludes that the motion for discovery of peace officer personnel records is denied without prejudice.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for discovery of peace officer personnel records (Pitchess Motion) without prejudice. The Plaintiff sought disclosure of complaints against Defendant Officers Beckstrom, Lopez, Moser, and Romero, including complaints of excessive force, dishonesty, and negligence, as well as their personnel files. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's counsel did not provide an initial declaration showing a factual foundational basis for the discovery, and that the motion was not properly supported. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff's counsel filed new evidence with the reply papers, which is not permitted under the general rule of motion practice. The Judge ordered the Plaintiff to give notice, and the motion is denied without prejudice. The Judge cited several cases, including Warrick v. Superior Court and People v. Mooc, in support of the decision. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff's counsel may re-file the motion with proper support and notice.
