  Case Number:  20STCV49938    Hearing Date:   July 11, 2024    Dept:  50 THE MINUTE ORDER DATED JUNE 17, 2024 ORDERED THE PARTIES TO DELIVER A COURTESY COPY OF THE JOINT STATEMENT REGARDING OBJECTIONS THAT WAS TO BE FILED ON OR BEFORE JUNE 21, 2024. NO COURTESY COPY WAS DELIVERED TO THE DEPARTMENT.  ADDITIONALLY, IT APPEARS THAT THE JOINT STATEMENT THAT WAS FILED WAS NOT FINAL IN THAT THE PARTIES INDICATED THAT THEY WERE CONTEMPLATING WITHDRAWING OBJECTIONS OR THEY BOTH AGREED THE INFORMATION WAS IMMATERIAL. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN NO REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF OBJECTIONS. THE JOINT STATEMENT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE COURT'S ORDER. AT THE HEARING, THE COURT WILL DISCUSS A NEW DATE FOR A COMPLIANT JOINT STATEMENT.
