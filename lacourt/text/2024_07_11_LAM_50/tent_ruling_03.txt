[1]Plaintiffs allege
that “David Lee’s felony convictions are likely to disqualify the Association
from obtaining coverage from insurance carriers. For example, David Lee’s
felony convictions make it a near certainty that absent his immediate removal
from the Association, the Association will be unable to obtain Directors &
Officers coverage. Furthermore, failure to disclose the facts and circumstances
surrounding David Lee’s felony convictions to the Association’s insurance
carrier risks the insurance company reserving the right to pursue the
Association (and possibly its directors) for damages for failure to disclose
adverse conditions.” (Compl., ¶ 24.) 
 


[2]Plaintiffs allege
that “[a]s of August 18, 2022, David Lee’s company, Stanford Pico Plaza, was
seriously delinquent in Association Assessments owed to the Association.
Stanford Pico Plaza’s payment obligations represent approximately 28% of the
Association’s income. However, Stanford Pico Plaza’s delinquency, which had
been ongoing for a period of two years, was, as of August 18, 2022, had grown
to $336,000 [sic], representing a loss of income to the Association of nearly
15% of the Association’s operating budget.” (Compl., ¶ 27.)


[3]As discussed, the
Association asserts that “Plaintiffs’ derivative claims must be dismissed under
the business judgment rule.” (Mot. at p. 15:13-14.)
