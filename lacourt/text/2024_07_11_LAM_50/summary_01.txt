And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to the failure of the parties to comply with a previous order. On June 17, 2024, the Court ordered the parties to deliver a courtesy copy of the joint statement regarding objections by June 21, 2024. However, no courtesy copy was delivered to the Department. Additionally, the joint statement filed by the parties was not final, as they indicated they were contemplating withdrawing objections or agreeing that the information was immaterial. Furthermore, the number of objections has not been reduced. As a result, the Judge will discuss a new date for a compliant joint statement at the upcoming hearing on July 11, 2024.
