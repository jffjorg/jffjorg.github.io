And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the plaintiffs' allegations that David Lee's felony convictions and Stanford Pico Plaza's delinquency in Association Assessments disqualify the Association from obtaining insurance coverage. The plaintiffs argue that Lee's felony convictions make it unlikely that the Association will be able to obtain Directors & Officers coverage, and that failure to disclose this information to the insurance carrier may result in the Association being pursued for damages. The Association, on the other hand, argues that the plaintiffs' derivative claims must be dismissed under the business judgment rule. The judge will consider these arguments and make a final ruling at the upcoming court hearing.
