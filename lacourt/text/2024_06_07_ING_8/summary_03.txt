And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer to the 5th and 7th causes of action in the complaint. The demurrer argues that the plaintiff's claims for negligent repair and fraudulent concealment are barred by the economic loss rule and fail to state a cause of action. The court finds that the plaintiff's complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for negligent repair and is barred by the economic loss rule. The court also finds that the plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent concealment are insufficient and fails to allege that Ford Motor Company had exclusive knowledge of the transmission defects. The court sustains the demurrer as to the 5th cause of action without leave to amend and sustains the demurrer as to the 7th cause of action with leave to amend.
