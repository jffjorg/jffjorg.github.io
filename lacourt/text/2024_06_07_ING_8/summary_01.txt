This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel discovery responses to post-judgment demand for identification and production of documents. The case involves a dispute over an oil and gas lease, which is alleged to be terminated. The plaintiff, Gardena Neighbors LLC, filed a complaint against the defendant, WG Holdings SPV, LLC, and others. The defendant filed a motion to set aside the default judgment, and the plaintiff filed a motion to compel discovery in anticipation of the defendant's motion. The court granted the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery, but denied its request for an evidentiary hearing. The court noted that the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment will be timely if it is filed within two years after entry of the default judgment.
