Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' unopposed demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained without leave to amend as to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th causes of action. The judge found that the plaintiff's causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of oral contract, constructive fraud, breach of the implied covenant, and unjust enrichment are time-barred due to the statute of limitations. Additionally, the judge found that the plaintiff's causes of action for fraudulent misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment are time-barred, and that the plaintiff's cause of action for conversion is also time-barred. The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud are insufficiently pled, and that the necessary elements of a cause of action for fraud are not met.
