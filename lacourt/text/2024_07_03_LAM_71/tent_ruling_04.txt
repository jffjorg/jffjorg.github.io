 Hearing
  Date:  July 3, 2024



 
Defendants Gregory Yates’ and The Law
Offices of Gregory Yates’ unopposed demurrer to pro per Plaintiff
Edgar Guzman’s complaint is sustained without leave to amend as to the
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th causes of action.
 
Defendants Gregory Yates (“Yates”) and the Law Offices of Gregory
Yates (“Law Office”) (collectively, “Defendants”) demur unopposed to the
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th causes of action in pro per
Plaintiff Edgar Guzman’s (“Guzman”)
(“Plaintiff”) complaint (“Complaint”) [erroneously labeled First Amended
Complaint] on the following bases: (1) the face of the complaint and matters
subject to judicial notice defeat at least an essential element for each cause
of action alleged; (2) each cause of action is barred by the statute of
limitations; (3) the alleged facts, even if true, would fail to support any of
the causes of action alleged; and (4) each cause of action is so vague and
confusing that it is fatally uncertain.  (Notice
of Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§430.10(e), (f).)

Hon. Carla Woehrle in Multi-Ethnic Immigrant Workers
Organizing Network et al., v. City of Los Angeles, et al., U.S. District
Court, C.D.
Cal., Case No. CV-07-3072
(D-RJN, Exh. 1); (2) the docket in the matter of Mary Santiago et al.
v. City of Los Angeles, U.S. District Court, C.D. Cal., Case No. 2:07-cv-02966-AHM-FMO
(D-RJN, Exh. 2); (3) Complaint in Guzman v. Yates, LASC

of Order dismissing LASC Case No. 21STCV30112 (D-RJN, Exh. 6) is granted.
Defendants’ 4/25/24 request for judicial notice of the March 14, 2024,
Notice of Ruling and Minute order in the instant case is denied because the
Court does not need to take judicial notice of filings on the instant docket.
 
Background
Plaintiff filed the operative Complaint against Defendants on April
19, 2023, alleging eight causes of action: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) fraudulent
misrepresentation; (3) conversion; (4) fraudulent concealment; (5) constructive
fraud; (6) breach of oral agreement; (7) breach of implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing; and (8) unjust enrichment.
Plaintiff’s Complaint arises from Plaintiff’s alleged entitlement
to a settlement in the amount of $525,000.00 in a class action lawsuit.  (See Complaint ¶10.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants sent a letter to
Plaintiff with a check enclosed in the amount of $55,000.00, which was
significantly less than it should have been. 
(Complaint ¶10.)  Plaintiff
alleges he was severely injured and could not cognitively investigate the
amount of the settlement until years later when he began to recuperate, and
through later discovery by a paralegal, Plaintiff found out the truth that his
settlement was a low amount.  (Complaint
¶12.)
On April 25, 2024, Defendants filed the instant demurrer.  As of the date of this hearing no opposition
was filed.
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer. 
(C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.) 
A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the
meet and confer process.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).)
Defendants’ counsel declares he met and conferred telephonically
with Plaintiff on April 9, 2024.  (Decl.
of Robinson ¶4.)  Defendants’ counsel
declares the parties did not reach an agreement resolving the objections raised
in the instant demurrer.  (See Decl.
of Robbins ¶4.)  Defendants’ counsel’s
declaration is sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a).  Accordingly, the Court will consider the
instant demurrer.
 
Summary of Demurrer
Defendants demur to each cause of action the Complaint
on bases they fail to state facts sufficient to plead a cause of action, are
impermissibly uncertain, and are barred by the statute of limitations.  (Notice of Demurrer, pgs. 4-5; C.C.P. §§430.10(e), (f), 340.6, 338.)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
A demurrer must be sustained without
leave to amend absent a showing by plaintiff that a reasonable possibility exists
that the defect can be cured by amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Lacher v. Superior Court (1991)
230
Cal.App.3d 1038, 1043.)
          
          Statute of
Limitations
Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, Constructive Fraud, Breach of Oral Agreement, Breach of the
Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, & Unjust Enrichment (1st, 5th, 6th, 7th, & 8th COAs)
C.C.P. §340.6 applies to all wrongful acts or omissions by an attorney, other
than actual fraud.  (Quintilliani v.
Mannerino (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 54 [claims for breach of fiduciary duty
against an attorney]; Stoll v. Superior Court (1992) Cal.App.4th 1162; Vafi
v. McCloskey (201l) 193 Cal.App.3d 874 [actions for malicious prosecution].)
 The statute of limitations for C.C.P.
§340.6 is within one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through
the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the facts constituting
the wrongful act or omission, or four years from the date of the wrongful act
or omission, whichever occurs first. 
(C.C.P. §340.6(a).)
Plaintiff alleges that the original settlement was made when he
was under duress with a head injury, economic duress, and undue influence, and
Defendants took advantage of Plaintiff and his severe head injury.  (Complaint ¶2.)  Plaintiff alleges he meets the requirement
for delayed discovery and equitable tolling of the statute of limitations based
on new, later discovery on or about December 29, 2018.  (Complaint ¶2.)
Defendants provided copies of the transcript of the status meeting
taken on May 26, 2009, before Hon. Magistrate Judge Carla M. Woehrle in Multi-Ethnic
Immigrant Workers Organizing Network et al., v. City of Los Angeles, et al.,
U.S. District Court, C.D. Cal., Case No. CV-07-3072.  (D-RJN, Exh. 1.)  At the May 26, 2009, status meeting, the
record states:
Court:
. . . All right. We had a further settlement discussion with Mr. Yates and Mr.
Guzman and myself just a few moments ago in chambers. And I want to get
everyone’s understanding clear on the record with regard to a final resolution
of the settlement as it effects Mr. Guzman individually.
 
And Mr. Guzman, what we discussed was an agreement—there had
previously been the signed agreement for a $50,000 payment to you. And the
number has now been agreed, and this is by Mr. Yates and you, that the number
will be $55,000. And is that Correct?
 
Plaintiff
Guzman: Yes.
 
The
Court: Okay. Thank you.
 
Mr.
Yates: That’s correct, your Honor.
 
(D-RJN, Exh. 1 at 3:19-4:6.)
The transcript further states:
Mr.
Litt: The payment will—it will be available to Mr. Guzman in the full amount.
It will be up to Mr. Guzman whether he wants it in the full amount because
nobody can guarantee how it effects his SSI payment.
 
The
Court: Okay. So that—if you want it all at once Mr. Guzman, it will be paid all
at once. Okay?
 
Plaintiff
Guzman: And then I’m going to lose my SSI?
 
The
Court: Well that’s what your consultation with the lawyer is for.
 
Plaintiff
Guzman: Because again, I did not put myself in this situation, the City did.
Why should I—
 
The
Court: Mr. Guzman? Do you want to take this $55,000 settlement?
 
Plaintiff
Guzman: Yes.
 
The
Court: Okay. Then, we’re done.
 
Plaintiff
Guzman: But I—but you ordered that I would not lose my SSI because that’s the
only thing I want to—
 
The
Court: No, I can’t. No one can order that. That’s an issue that is a completely
separate legal issue.
 
Plaintiff
Guzman: My—
 
The
Court: It will be important for you to talk to a lawyer about it. It will be
important and that’s why Mr. Yates—that’s why Mr. Yates has agreed to do that.
.
. .
 
The
Court: I said—what I’m saying now, Mr. Guzman—let’s make it clear—is that no
one is making any promises or agreements about what happens with your SSI.
Everyone will be trying to make it work for you so that you don’t lose your SSI
and that’s why Mr. Yates is setting up a consultation with you for a lawyer who
is a specialist. But I don’t know the answer to that so I’m certainly not
promising it, Mr. Litt doesn’t know the answer to that and Mr. Yates doesn’t
know the answer to that.
 
(D-RJN, Exh. 1 at 9:7-10:23.) 

The transcript reflects that on May 26, 2009, Plaintiff
acknowledged before the court that he understood he would receive $55,000 of
the settlement, that he accepted the $55,000 settlement amount, and that he was
to consult with separate counsel regarding his SSI benefits and Yates’ expense.
 There was no later opportunity for
Plaintiff to learn that he was to receive $55,000 in proceeds from the
settlement at issue.  Plaintiff’s August
16, 2021, complaint filed in now-dismissed LASC Case No. 21STCV30112 includes a
copy of a letter from Law Office, dated June 7, 2010, stating the $55,000 check
was enclosed.  (D-RJN, Exh. 3.)  There is no reason for the statute of
limitations to be equitably tolled based on late-discovered facts or duress
from Defendants.
Therefore, Plaintiff’s causes of action for
breach of fiduciary duty, breach of oral contract, constructive fraud, breach of
the implied covenant, and unjust enrichment are all governed by the four year
and one-year statute of limitations set forth in C.C.P. §340.6 and are
time-barred.
Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer to the 1st, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th causes of action is
sustained without leave to amend.

 
Fraudulent Misrepresentation & Fraudulent Concealment (2nd &
4th COAs)

Actions for fraud are subject to a three-year statute of
limitations.  (See C.C.P. §338(d)
[“An action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake. The cause of action
in that case is not deemed to have accrued until the discovery, by the
aggrieved party, of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.”].)
Plaintiff alleges he discovered the alleged
fraudulent conduct no later than December 29, 2018.  (Complaint ¶¶2, 4, 14.)  Accepting the allegations of fraud as true, the
statute of limitations for fraud causes of action expired, at the latest, by
June 29, 2022.
Therefore,
Plaintiff’s causes of action for breach of fraudulent misrepresentation and
fraudulent concealment are governed by the three-year statute of limitations
set forth in C.C.P. §338 and are time-barred.
Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer to the 2nd and 4th causes of action is sustained without
leave to amend.

 
Conversion (3rd COA)
          An action for
taking, detaining, or injuring goods or chattels is subject to a three-year
statute of limitations.  (See
C.C.P. §338(c)(1).)
Plaintiff alleges he discovered the alleged conversion no later
than December 29, 2018.  (Complaint ¶¶2,
4, 14.)  Accepting the allegation of
conversion as true, the statute of limitations for conversion expired, at the
latest, by June 29, 2022.
Therefore, Plaintiff’s cause of action for conversion governed by
the three-year statute of limitations set forth in C.C.P. §338 and is
time-barred.
Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to the 3rd cause of action is
sustained without leave to amend.
 
Failure to State a Cause of Action
Fraudulent
Misrepresentation & Fraudulent Concealment (2nd & 4th COAs)
The necessary elements of a cause of action for Fraud are: (1) the
false representation of material facts (or, in the case of fraudulent
concealment, active concealment of material facts); (2) knowledge of falsity;
(3) the intent to deceive or induce detrimental reliance; (4) actual and reasonable
detrimental reliance on the false representations; and (5) resulting damage.  (Civ. Code §§1709, 1710; CACI 1900; Molko
v. Holy Spirit Association (1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1108.)
Fraud “must be pled specifically; general and conclusory
allegations do not suflice.”  (Small
v. Fritz Cos., Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.)  A plaintiff must plead “how, when, where, to
whom, and by what means the [fraudulent] representations were tendered.”  (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th
631, 645.)  This stringent pleading
requirement is justified by the fact that fraud allegations constitute a
serious attack on a person’s character and fairness requires that the complete
details of the charge be given to allow for the preparation of a defense.  (Committee On Children’s Television, Inc.
v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197.)
“The law is well established that actionable misrepresentations
must pertain to past or existing material facts. Statements or predictions
regarding future events are deemed to be mere opinions which are not
actionable.”  (Cansino v. Bank of
America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469, internal citation omitted.)
Plaintiff fails to allege misrepresentations of fact that
Defendants made with the requisite specificity. 
Plaintiff merely alleges legal conclusions and promises of future
conduct.  (See id.)
Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to the 2nd and 4th causes of
action is sustained.
 
Conclusion
Defendants’ unopposed demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is
sustained without leave to amend as to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th,
7th, and 8th causes of action.
Moving Party to give notice.
