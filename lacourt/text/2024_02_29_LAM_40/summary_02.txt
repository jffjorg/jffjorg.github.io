Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to appoint a receiver to collect distributions from the LLCs. The receiver will have the power to make inquiries into the LLCs and make all necessary orders to effectuate the charging orders. The judge has also determined that the proposed order is proper and has granted the motion subject to further briefing on the scope of the receiver's powers. The judge has set an OSC re: status of receivership in approximately four months.
