And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is on a motion by the Plaintiffs to enforce a stipulation for a bellwether case. The Plaintiffs, Jason Gunnels, et al., are suing the Defendants, Equity Residential Management, LLC, Transunion Rental Screening Solutions, Inc., and Does 1 through 10, for alleged violations of the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA). The Plaintiffs argue that the case should be tried as a bellwether case, while the Defendants argue that there is no stipulation on the terms argued by the Plaintiffs and that the Court cannot force them to waive their objections to being forced to accept this action as a bellwether case.

The Court finds that insufficient reasons exist to order this action as a bellwether. The Court notes that the term "bellwether" trial finds its origin in the sheepherding practice of placing a large bell on a male sheep, and that the primary purpose of a "bellwether" trial is to educate the parties and the court about the strengths and weaknesses of the many underlying cases.

The Court also notes that courts have taken issue with the selection of the bellwether trial(s), finding that trial court determinations in those cases did not accurately reflect the issues and facts of the remaining cases, or used improper statistical analysis. The Court concludes that the Plaintiffs' motion is DENIED.
