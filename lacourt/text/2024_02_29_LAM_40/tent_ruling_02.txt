 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant/Cross-Complainant
  1351 Orizaba Avenue, LLC’s Supplemental Motion to Appoint a Receiver [CCP § 17705.03(b)].



 
Background
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant HTL
Automotive, Inc. (HTL) sued Defendant/Cross Complainant  1351 Orizaba Avenue, LLC (Orizaba) pursuant
to a February 22, 2017 Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of Written
Contract and (2) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing.
In turn, Orizaba sued HTL (dba
Hooman Toyota of Long Beach) and Cross-Defendants Hooman Michael Nissani
(Nissani) and Does 1-100 pursuant to an April 10, 2017 Cross-Complaint alleging
claims of (1) Breach of Contract and (2) Permitting Waste Upon Premises.
The claims arose from allegations
related to a lease of commercial property by Orizaba from HTL Automotive and
events taking place on that property.
Between May 20 and May 25, 2019,
the Court held a non-jury trial.
On March 6, 2020, the Court issued
a statement of decision.
That same day, the Court granted
judgment in favor of Orizaba as to the Complaint and Cross-Complaint, awarding
$746,830.34, jointly and severally, against Nissani and HTL.
On April 13, 2020, HTL and Nissani
noticed an appeal.
On May 4, 2021, the Court signed an
amended judgment, which added $190,923.75 in fees and $5,389.45 in costs to the
original judgment, for a total award of $943,116.54 against HTL and Nissani.
On May 17, 2021, the appeal was
dismissed based on default.
On January 12, 2022, the Court
issued charging orders against twelve limited liability companies (the LLCs) in
which Nissani held an interest, ordering that the LLCs make distributions
allocated to Nissani to Orizaba, up to the satisfaction of judgment.
On September 24, 2021, the appeal
was reinstated.
On November 15, 2022, the court of
appeal affirmed the March 6, 2020 judgment and awarded costs to Orizaba on
appeal.
On January 18, 2023, the court of
appeal issued remittitur.
On October 19, 2023, Orizaba moved
for fees and costs related to the appeal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1717 and 685.040. The motion notes that HTL and Nissani have failed to
satisfy the May 4, 2021 amended judgment.
That same day, Orizaba filed a
motion for an order appointing Invenz, Inc., through its Chief Executive
Officer, Richard Munro, as receiver over the interest of Cross-Defendant
Nissani in nine separate limited liability companies that are subject to the January
25, 2022 charging orders.
On December 7, 2023, HTL and
Nissani filed oppositions to the motions.
On December 13, 2023, Orizaba filed
replies to the oppositions.
On December 20, 2023, the Court
ruled on Orizaba’s motions, granting attorney’s fees in the amount of
$130,565.15, denying costs of $8,798.15, and continuing the hearing on the
receiver motion to January 31, 2024, with Orizaba to file further briefing by
January 6, 2024 as to the bases for the authority and scope of the receiver’s
powers, plus any exhibits or declarations, Nissani to oppose by January 18, 2024,
and Orizaba to reply by January 24, 2024.
Motion Before the Court
On January 2, 2024, the Court
entered the second amended judgment.
On January 3, 2024, the Clerk gave
notice of entry of judgment.
On January 5, 2024, Orizaba filed
its supplemental briefing for the receiver’s authority.
On January 22, 2024, Nissani filed
an opposition.
On January 23, 2024, Nissani filed
an ex parte application to continue the hearing on the motion to appoint a
receiver.
That same day, Orizaba filed an
opposition to the ex parte application.
On January 24, 2024, the Court
granted the ex parte application and advanced and continued the hearing on the
motion to appoint receiver to February 29, 2024.
That same day, Orizaba filed its
reply documents.
Orizaba’s motion to appoint
receiver is now before the Court.
 
Motion to Appoint Receiver
Legal
Standard
On
application by a judgment creditor of a member or transferee, a court may enter
a charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for
the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A charging order constitutes a lien on
a judgment debtor’s transferable interest and requires the limited liability
company to pay over to the person to which the charging order was issued any
distribution that would otherwise be paid to the judgment debtor. (Corp. Code,
§ 17705.03, subd. (a).)
To
the extent necessary to effectuate the collection of distributions pursuant to
a charging order in effect under subdivision (a), the court may do any of the
following:
(1)
Appoint a receiver of the distributions subject to the charging order, with the
power to make all inquiries the judgment debtor might have made.
(2)
Make all other orders necessary to give effect to the charging order.
(3)
Upon a showing that distributions under a charging order will not pay the
judgment debt within a reasonable time, foreclose the lien and order the sale
of the transferable interest. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale obtains
only the transferable interest, does not thereby become a member, and is
subject to Section 17705.02.
(Corp.
Code, § 17705.03, subds. (b)(1)-(3).)
Such
relief does not deprive any member or transferee of the benefit of any
exemption laws applicable to the member’s or transferee’s transferable
interest. (Corp. Code, § 17705.03, subd. (e).) Neither does such relief provide
the exclusive remedy by which a person seeking to enforce a judgment against a
member or transferee may, in the capacity of judgment creditor, satisfy the
judgment from the judgment debtor’s transferable interest. (Corp. Code, §
17705.03, subd. (f).)
Order
Appointing Receiver: GRANTED [Receiver, Appointment, and Proposed
Order].
I. Parties’ Initial Papers
In
its initial motion, Orizaba sought an order for the appointment of a receiver
over Cross-Defendant Nissani’s interests in nine limited liability companies:
(1)
737 N La Brea LLC;
(2)
3170 Cherry Avenue Property LLC;
(3)
3399 Willow Sr LLC [named 3399 E. Willow Sr LLC in the charging order];
(4)
Cielo S Holding LLC;
(5)
KIP Prop LLC;
(6)
Redondo Prop LLC;
(7)
Ridge Property LLC;
(8)
SJS Long Beach LLC; and
(9)
Slauson Gas Station LLC.
(Received
Mot., Proposed Order [the Receiver Order LLCs].)
Orizaba
filed its motion on the grounds that it has secured a $943,116.54 judgment
against Nissani, which Nissani has failed to pay, despite this Court granting
twelve charging orders for Nissani’s distributions, up the judgment amount, in:
(1)
737 N La Brea LLC;
(2)
3170 Cherry Avenue Property LLC;
(3)
Cielo S Holding LLC;
(4)
KIP Prop LLC;
(5)
Lennox Car Wash Properties LLC;
(6)
3399 Willow Sr LLC [named 3399 E. Willow Sr LLC in the charging order];
(7) Playa Vista Real Estate II LLC;
(8)
Redondo Prop LLC;
(9)
Ridge Property LLC;
(10)
SJS Long Beach LLC;
(11)
Slauson Gas Station LLC; and
(12)
Culver City Prop LLC.
(Receiver
Mot., Cole Decl., Ex. B [1/25/22 Charging Orders; the Charging Orders LLCs];
see Receiver Mot., pp. 2-6; Receiver Opp’n, 2-3; Receiver Reply, pp. 2-6.)
II. Court’s Prior Order
On
December 20, 2023, the Court issued a tentative order to appoint a receiver,
but continued the hearing for further briefing.
As
concluded by the moving party, “In order to facilitate the collection of the
judgment in this action, the Court granted twelve charging orders on January
25, 202[2]. These orders direct the distributions that the LLCs would have paid
Nissani should be paid to Orizaba, up to the satisfaction of judgment. (1/25/22
Orders.) Such distributions have not occurred. (Receiver Mot., Cole Decl., ¶
5.) The judgment is otherwise not satisfied. (Receiver Mot., Cole Decl., ¶ 2.)
Nissani has impeded discovery efforts as to whether the LLCs have paid any
distributions to him. (Receiver Mot., Cole Decl., ¶ 6.) As a result, Orizaba
brings this motion seeking to have a receiver appointed to ensure proper
distributions to Orizaba, as well as additional powers needed to effectuate the
charging orders. (See Receiver Mot., p. 6.)
Nissani—through
his opposition, which is unsupported by a declaration—does not deny that he has
received distributions from the LLCs despite the charging orders, instead
arguing that Orizaba has not met its burden of showing evidence that any
distributions were ever made. Neither has Nissani offered documents from the
LLCs to show that no distributions were made to him by the LLCs as of January
25, 2022. (Receiver Opp’n, p. 3.)
Thus,
to effectuate the distributions pursuant to the January 25, 2022 charging
orders, the Court finds that it is appropriate to appoint a receiver, with the
power to make all inquiries the judgment debtor might have made. (Corp. Code, §
17705.03, subd. (b)(1).)”
(12/20/23
Minutes, p. 11.)
However,
the Court requested further briefing on the issue of electing a receiver, determining
that “Orizaba need[ed] to further elaborate on the numerous grounds for
additional powers conferred to the receiver in its proposed order.”
The
Court tentatively granted the motion to appoint a receiver subject to further
briefing on the scope of the receiver’s powers. (12/20/23 Minutes, p. 12.)
III. Supplemental Briefing
In
its supplemental briefing, Orizaba argues that Corporations Code section
17705.03, subdivisions (b)(1)-(2) give courts the authority to appoint
receivers in relation to charging orders, with the power to make all inquiries
the judgment debtor might have made, and to make all necessary orders to give
effect to those charging orders. Orizaba argues that this authority is
harmonious with the trial court’s wide discretion to approve receiver powers
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 568. Next, Orizaba explains that
the only available authority on point for the scope of receiver powers was Phillips,
Spallas & Angstadt, LLP v. Fotouhi (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1132, 1138 (Fotouhi),
which included an order to pay income directly to the judgment creditor and an
appointment of a receiver and auditor to facilitate the payment, with Orizaba
modeling its proposed order to contain similar powers for the proposed receiver
in seeking satisfaction of judgment. Last Orizaba explains the logical
relationship between the proposed order’s terms and the enforcement of the
charging orders. (Supp. Mot., pp. 1-5; see 10/19/23 Proposed Order.)
In
his supplemental opposition, Nissani argues that the appointment of a receiver
to enforce a money judgment is a judicial error. Nissani also explains that he
has not been evading service, that he is not at fault for the actions of third
parties, that he has made efforts to settle this case for $500,000 and that
Nissani has instituted a lawsuit against two insurers to obtain insurance
coverage for the loss and payoff of the judgment. Next, Nissani argues that the
supplemental documents fail to attach evidence of the qualifications of and
assent to appointment as receiver. Last, Nissani argues that if the Court
appoints a receiver, the powers should be limited to permitting the receiver to
make inquiries from the Receiver Order LLCs as Nissani might have made, which
is the alleged extent of the applicable statutory section. (Supp. Opp’n, pp.
2-4.)
In
its supplemental reply, Orizaba references the Court’s December 20, 2023 order
to argue that Nissani rehashes arguments that the Court previously resolved
when it determined that a receiver should be appointed but asked for further
briefing on the scope of permissible powers. Orizaba then argues that the only
new section of briefing from Nissani is Section III of the supplemental
opposition, which highlights Nissani’s initiation of a lawsuit against his
insurer, attaches a copy of the draft complaint without confirmation of filing
from a clerk, and which does not show good faith efforts to facilitate a
settlement in this matter. Last, Orizaba argues that Code of Civil Procedure
section 1858—referenced in the supplemental opposition as prohibiting courts
from inserting their own provisions when interpreting statutes—does not
conflict with Corporations Code sections 17705.03, subdivision (b)(2) and Code
of Civil Procedure section 568, which permit courts to give receivers the
additional powers necessary to effectuate charging orders. (Supp. Reply, pp.
1-3.)
IV. Discussion
The
Court finds in favor of Orizaba.
The
Court first adopts its discussion in the December 20, 2023 order, quoted above,
to determine that the appointment of a receiver is proper here to “effectuate
the distributions pursuant to the January 25, 2022 charging orders, …, with the
power to make all inquiries the judgment debtor might have made. (Corp. Code, §
17705.03, subd. (b)(1).)” (12/20/23 Minutes, p. 11.)
The
Court also determines that additional powers pursuant to subdivision (b) are
proper given Nissani’s lack of forthcoming discovery as to distributions from
the Charging Orders LLCs.
The
Court also determines that the elected receiver—Invenz, Inc.—is a proper
receiver for the purposes of the Court’s order, with the Declaration of Richard
Munro, attached CV, and sample of a prior appointment order as receiver
supporting this determination. (Supp. Mot., Munro Decl., ¶¶ 1-10, Exs. 1-3.)
The
Court last determines that the powers enumerated in the proposed order are
proper. (See 10/19/23 Proposed Order.) While Nissani argues that the order goes
too far, the Court determines that the strict powers enumerated in the proposed
order would allow the receiver to properly determine whether income is being
received and properly distributed by the Receiver Order LLCs. Permitting the
receiver to have full control of the LLCs and the physical items tied to the
LLCs will assist in this endeavor. The Court adds that it determines the order
is consistent with Fotouhi in seeking to obtain an order facilitating
the enforcement of a charging order.
The
Court notes that the opposition does not provide any evidence to counter the
Court’s prior determination as to Nissani’s opaqueness on the question of
income and distributions related to the Receiver Order LLCs, where Nissani has
impeded discovery efforts as to whether the LLCs have paid any distributions to
him. (Receiver Mot., Cole Decl., ¶ 6.)

17705.03(b)] is GRANTED.
