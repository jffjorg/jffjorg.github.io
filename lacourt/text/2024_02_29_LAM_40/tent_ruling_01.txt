 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiffs’ Motion
  for Order Enforcing Stipulation for Bellwether Case.



 
Background
Plaintiffs Jason Gunnels, et al.,
sue Defendants Equity Residential Management, LLC, Transunion Rental Screening
Solutions, Inc. (Transunion), and Does 1 through 10 pursuant to an October 27,
2023 First Amended Complaint alleging claims of (1) Violations of The
Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA), Cal. Civ. Code § 1786,
et seq., (2) Invasion of Privacy, and (3) Declaratory Relief.
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiffs in
this action filed a motion to enforce a stipulation in a formerly related case 22STCV23730
assigned to Department 37 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, Honorable Maureen
Duffy-Lewis.
The stipulation at issue provides
in relevant part:
“Previously, the
Court had ordered all discovery stayed in all previously related matters other
than former lead case, Thomas v. Equity Residential (22STCV23730).
The Court lifts
the discovery stay on motion practice in all formerly related cases. Parties to
coordinate and meet & confer regarding an overall discovery plan.
This Court will
stay its own Thomas v. Equity Residential case (22STCV23730) upon the signing
and filing of stipulation re: stay and designation of Gunnels (23STCV17235) as
bell weather case.
Order to Show
Cause Re: Filing of Stipulation re: Stay With All Individual Departments
Pending Resolution of Gunnels (23STCV17235) Bell Weather Case is scheduled for
12/12/23 at 09:30 AM in Department 38 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. Status
Conference re: Stay and Trial Status (in Thomas v. Equity Residential -
22STCV23730) is scheduled for 12/12/23 at 08:30 AM in Department 38 at Stanley
Mosk Courthouse.”
On February 15, 2024, Equity Residential filed an opposition
to Plaintiffs’ motion.
That same day, Defendant Transunion
filed a response seeking to provide input on the Court’s ruling.
On February 22, 2024, Plaintiffs
replied to Equity Residential’s opposition.
Plaintiffs’ motion is now before
the Court.
 
Motion to Enforce Stipulation
Legal
Standard
Every
California court has the power to compel obedience to its judgments, orders,
and process, and to the orders of a judge out of court, in an action or
proceeding pending therein. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(4).)
Order
Enforcing Stipulated Order: DENIED.
In
their motion, Plaintiffs “move the Court for an Order that Jason Gunnels, et
al. v. Equity Residential Management, LLC, et al., Los Angeles Superior Court
case number 22STCV23730, be tried as the bellwether case regarding alleged
violations of the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (‘ICRAA’),
California Civil Code section 1786, et seq., against Defendants Equity
Residential Management, LLC and TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions, Inc.,
pursuant to stipulation.” (Mot., p. 2, Notice.)
Plaintiffs
argue that “notwithstanding the stipulation that 1) Gunnels is to be the
bellwether case as the parties agreed it is the most representative of all
other cases, and 2) that Gunnels should be tried as the bellwether case, and
notwithstanding court orders, Defendant Equity has refused to proceed with
Gunnels as a bellwether, despite the stipulations its attorney Shareef Farag
made in Department 38 on October 11, 2023.” (Mot., Murphy Decl., ¶ 7.)
In
opposition, Equity Residential argues that there is no stipulation on the terms
argued by Plaintiffs, but rather, that Department 37 ordered the parties to
file a stipulation and proposed order to make this action the bellwether case
for the cases formerly related to this action, i.e., STCV06143, 23STCV07370,
22STCV25746, 23STCV00072, 22BBCV00656, 22VECV01307, 22VECV01174, 23STCV03676,
23STCV03484, 23STCV03115, 23STCV02499, 23STCV05552, 23STCV04694, 23STCV04126,
23STCV04118, 22VECV01496, 22BBCV00656, 22SMCV01994, 22STCV25746, 22VECV01174,
22VECV01307, 22STCV25746, and 22STCV23730. (Opp’n, pp. 6-8; see 10/11/23
22STCV23730 Minutes, pp. 1-2.)
Equity
Residential also argues that it cannot be forced to waive its objections to
being forced to accept this action as a bellwether case, particularly where
ICRAA representative actions are limited to actual damages (as opposed to
statutory damages), and where Plaintiffs have not identified any procedural
rule or other authority permitting the Court to order a bellwether trial here. Equity
Residential notes its position that this Court’s October 12, 2023, ruling on
the demurrer to the initial Complaint undercut the conclusion that this action
was a proper bellwether for the formerly related actions. (Opp’n, pp. 5, 7-9.)
In
a brief response, Transunion merely adds that “to the extent that Gunnels is
determined to be “bellwether” and to be the case that will be first tried, any
order to that effect either should also stay both discovery and motion
practice, as well as trial, in all other related cases or neither discovery and
motion practice should be stayed. It is inefficient and unfair to stay motion
practice but not discovery in 23 other cases while Gunnels proceeds pre-trial
as some sort of partial bellwether.” (Response, p. 3.)
In
reply, Plaintiffs argue that this action is the appropriate bellwether case,
that Plaintiffs stipulated in Department 47 to this action being the bellwether
case, and that based on that stipulation alone, the Court should order a
bellwether trial in this action. (Reply, pp. 2-3.)
Here,
the Court finds that insufficient reasons exist to order this action as a
bellwether.
The
term “bellwether” trial finds its origin in the sheepherding practice of
placing a large bell on a male sheep, also known as a wether, which is selected
to lead the flock. The art of selecting the right wether involves looking for
one that the rest of the flock has confidence in and will follow. (See Hilao
v. Estate of Marcos (9th Cir. 1996) 103 F.3d 767, 771-772; In re Chevron
U.S.A., Inc. (5th Cir. 1997) 109 F.3d 1016, 1019.)
“The
primary purpose of a ‘bellwether’ trial is to educate the parties and the court
about the strengths and weaknesses of the many underlying cases.” (Pacific
Fertility Cases (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 568, 574, fn. 3, citing 4 Newberg on
Class Actions (5th ed. 2021) Selecting the bellwether cases—Generally, §
11:13.)
The
results of the bellwether trial(s) may help settlement of the remaining cases.
(Weil & Brown, Cal., Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 14:7, § 3 [“Where class actions are inappropriate or not
allowed, counsel should explore the potential of having the individual actions
consolidated (see ¶ 12:340 ff.) or coordinated (see ¶ 12:370 ff.). If there are
many individual suits, counsel and the court should also consider scheduling
representative (or bellwether) suits for trial and deferring discovery on the
remaining suits until completion of those trials. The results of the bellwether
trial(s) may help settlement of the remaining cases.”].)
In
California, higher courts have taken issue with the selection of the bellwether
trial(s), finding that trial court determinations in those cases did not
accurately reflect the issues and facts of the remaining cases, or used
improper statistical analysis. (See, e.g., Duran v. U.S. Bank National Assn
(2014) 59 Cal.4th 1, 44; McLaughlin v. National Union Fire Ins. Co.
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1132.)
Here,
while the moving papers argue, in essence, that this action should serve as a host
for a bellwether trial for the actions against Equity Residential because the
parties stipulated to that determination, Department 37 always intended that
Department 40 make the final decision, and only upon the filing of a written
stipulation. (10/11/23 22STCV23730 Minutes, pp. 1-2 [“Counsel to file a
proposed stipulation and order in Department 40 re: designation of Gunnels v.
Equity Residential (23STCV17235) as the bell we[]ther case. If granted, then
counsel are to a file proposed stipulation and order re: stay of action in each
‘related’ case staying each case until the bell we[]ther Gunnels v. Equity Residential
(23STCV17235) case is tried.”].) 
So,
while there is a Minute Order dated October 11, 2023 stating that “The parties stipulate
that Gunnels v. Equity Residential . . . currently pending in department 40, to
be the bellweather [sic] case” (Murphy Dec in support of Motion, Ex. 1) it is
clear that the Court envisioned further proceedings in the sense of providing a
signed stipulation and order to the Court. Thus, while it is eminently
reasonable for the judge in Department 37, upon learning of an agreement, to
order that the parties file the final stipulation and proposed order in the
relevant courtroom, that does not amount to an order requiring the
parties to stipulate to any particular case being the bellwether.
Nor
does any party cite any authority for the court to require the parties to agree
to a particular case being the bellwether. The cases cited by Plaintiff involve
cases designated as complex in which the parties stipulated to a particular
case being the bellwether. (See, e.g., Bernuy v. Bridge Property Management
Co. (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1174, 1179, 1180 [trial court granted
a complex designation and consolidated cases for pretrial purposes, and thereafter
the parties stipulated and the court ordered the particular case to be the
bellwether]; Connor v. First Student, Inc. (2018) 5 Cal.5th 1026, 1030 [“Eileen
Connor is the selected bellwether plaintiff” in this class action]; St. Paul
Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. AmerisourceBergen Corp. (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th
1, 16 [affirming trial court’s stay pending resolution of related proceedings in
West Virginia].) In fact, cases collected by Newberg and Rubenstein in their
Treatise on Class Actions indicate that outcomes in bellwether trials in the
context of multi-district litigation (MDL) cases generally are not binding on
other cases, absent a stipulation. (Rubenstein, Newberg and Rubenstein on Class
Actions (6th ed., November 2023 update) at § 11:20.)
Beyond
the parties’ purported agreement, the moving papers do not explain why a trial
in this action would serve as a proper bellwether for the ICRAA actions against
Equity Residential, let alone provide the authority around which the Court
could structure such an order. Equity Residential has represented that the
sustaining of a demurrer as to one cause of action in the Gunnels case, on
October 12, 2023, altered the equation that led to their initial agreement. (Opp’n
at p. 5:3-6.) 
As
a matter of public policy, if prior to proceeding to trial one party no longer
believes that a case is an appropriate bellwether, for whatever reason, the
outcome of that case is not going to have the desired outcome of helping the
parties to resolve the remaining cases. While this episode has assuredly caused
an unfortunate delay and confusion, the Court does not see a legal basis to
grant the requested relief.
Plaintiffs’
motion is thus DENIED. 

Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Order Enforcing Stipulation for Bellwether Case is
DENIED.
