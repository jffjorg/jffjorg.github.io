court has discretion to hear an untimely demurrer. “There is no absolute right
to have a pleading stricken for lack of timeliness in filing where no question
of jurisdiction is involved, and where, as here, the late filing was a mere
irregularity [citation]; the granting or denial of the motion is a matter which
lies within the discretion of the court.” (McAllister v. County of Monterey
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281–282.)
