Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has granted the motion to relieve counsel for 1242 Sunset Plaza, LLC, filed by Barry MacNaughton and Catherine Veeneman of Ervin Cohen & Jessup LLP. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Although no opposition was filed, the Court had previously denied the motion due to lack of proof of service of all moving papers. In this revised motion, all papers have been served, and the Court finds that this is a valid reason for withdrawal. The Court cites case law, including Thomas G. Ferruzzo, Inc. v. Superior Court, to support its decision. The Court grants the motion to relieve counsel and orders counsel to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file proofs of service of such.
