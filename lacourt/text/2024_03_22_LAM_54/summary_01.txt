Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to bifurcate the liability/compensatory damages and punitive damages phases of trial. The motion was filed by the defendant, Superior Printing, Inc., and was unopposed by the plaintiff, Greg Kunath.

The court has determined that bifurcating the trial is necessary to protect the defendant from the premature disclosure of their financial condition. The court has cited California Civil Code sections 3294 and 3295, which provide that a defendant's financial condition may only be disclosed after a verdict for the plaintiff and a finding of malice, oppression, or fraud.

The trial will be bifurcated into two phases. In Phase 1, the jury will determine liability, compensatory damages, and liability for punitive damages. In Phase 2, the jury will determine the amount of punitive damages.

The judge's decision is based on the principles of California law, including the protection of defendants from premature disclosure of their financial condition and the need to ensure a fair and impartial trial. The court's decision is consistent with previous cases, including Medo v. Superior Court and People v. Harris.
