And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Viva Aerobus, a defendant in a lawsuit brought by Maria Prado. The lawsuit alleges that Prado slipped and fell while trying to get into an airport wheelchair provided by an airport employee, and that the City of Los Angeles and other defendants are liable for the accident. Viva Aerobus argues that it is not a public entity under California law and therefore cannot be held liable under Government Code section 815.2. The judge has sustained the demurrer, meaning that the complaint must be rewritten to address Viva Aerobus's arguments. The judge has given the parties 20 days to amend the complaint and has scheduled oral argument on the issue for the hearing date.
