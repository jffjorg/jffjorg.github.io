  - "The Court disagrees and finds Defendant's objections to be without merit. First, this case was initiated in April of 2018, and the accident giving rise to this suit took place in March of 2017. As such, Defendant's financial information from 2019 to present is certainly relevant in the enforcement of the money judgment..."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants in part and denies in part the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The court orders the defendant to provide further responses to inspection demands, set one, on or before October 1, 2024. The court also orders oral argument on the issue of Special Interrogatory No. 23, which asks the defendant to identify all sources of present support.

The court finds that the defendant's objections to the motion are without merit. The court disagrees with the defendant's argument that the request for information is overbroad and that it would invade the privacy rights of non-parties such as the defendant's family members.

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to inspection demands, set one, on the grounds that the defendant's objections are without merit. The court finds that the information sought is necessary to determine the location of the defendant's collectible assets and to prepare for a judgment debtor examination.

The court denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories Nos. 8 and 9, which seek information about the defendant's family members, on the grounds that the plaintiff's reasoning is insufficient to order the discovery sought.
