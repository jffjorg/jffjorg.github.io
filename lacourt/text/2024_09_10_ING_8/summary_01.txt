And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the seventh cause of action, which alleges a violation of California Penal Code section 496. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant took possession of the plaintiff's rightful interest in the wrongfully overcharged rate and fees and withheld funds from the plaintiff. The judge finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges theft and criminal intent, and therefore, the motion is denied. The judge notes that the California Supreme Court in Siry Investment, L.P. v. Farkhondehpour (2022) 13 Cal.5th 333 held that a plaintiff may recover treble damages and attorney's fees under section 496(c) when property has been obtained in any manner constituting theft, including fraudulent diversion of partnership funds. The judge also notes that the court in Siry acknowledged that a plaintiff must still establish criminal intent on the part of the defendant beyond "mere proof of nonperformance or actual falsity."
