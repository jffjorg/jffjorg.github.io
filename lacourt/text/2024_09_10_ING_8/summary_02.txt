And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for sanctions brought by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and Scottsdale Insurance Company against Ocean Recovery, LLC. The defendants argued that the plaintiff had acted in bad faith by naming the wrong defendants in multiple amended complaints and by failing to comply with court orders. The judge found that the plaintiff had made a colorable legal and factual argument in its claims against the defendants and that the defendants had failed to show that the plaintiff's actions were taken in bad faith. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had not been given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the defendants' claims and that the sanctions statute must not be construed so as to conflict with the primary duty of an attorney to represent his or her client zealously.
