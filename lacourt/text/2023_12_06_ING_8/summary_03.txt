And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to consolidate two cases, one a quiet title action and the other an unlawful detainer action, involving the same property. The motion was filed by Lucila Parra, the defendant in both cases, who argues that the two cases involve a common question of law and fact and that the quiet title action should be resolved before the unlawful detainer action. The Judge disagrees, stating that the general rule is that only a limited inquiry into the landlord's title is made in an eviction lawsuit. The Judge also notes that the quiet title action is far from straightforward and that the title of the property is not in question. The Judge denies the motion to consolidate, without prejudice to it being renewed when there is a pending quiet title case.
