And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the motion for Joseph E. Ritch, Esq. to appear as counsel pro hac vice for the plaintiffs in the case Estate of Anthony Allen Lee, et al. v. Major Surplus & Survival, Inc., et al. The court finds that Mr. Ritch has substantially complied with the requirements for admission pro hac vice, including being admitted to practice in Texas since 2002 and being associated with an attorney of record who is a member of the California bar. The court also notes that Mr. Ritch has paid the required $50 State Bar fee and has noticed the California State Bar. Despite the lack of dates for his admission to the courts of Georgia and Louisiana, the court assumes he was admitted to the Southern District of Texas in or shortly after 2002.
