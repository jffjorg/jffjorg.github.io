And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendant, Centinela Valley Union High School District, and has decided to overrule it. The defendant argued that the plaintiff, Jane Doe T.B., failed to comply with the claims presentation requirement under the California Government Tort Claims Act. However, the court finds that this requirement does not apply to childhood sexual abuse claims, as established by Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 and Government Code section 905, subdivision (m).

The court notes that the plaintiff filed the complaint on December 27, 2022, and is therefore within the three-year timeframe provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1, subdivision (q). The court also finds that the defendant's arguments in its reply brief regarding Coats v. New Haven Unified School Dist. (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415 are unpersuasive.

The court orders the plaintiff to give notice and will discuss plans for discovery, investigation, and alternative dispute resolution (ADR) at the hearing.
