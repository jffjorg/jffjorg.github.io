Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Stephen Hakim v. Uber Technologies, Inc., et al. (Case Number: 22STCV22265). Plaintiff Hakim filed a motion to set aside the dismissal of his complaint, which was dismissed on January 8, 2024, due to Plaintiff's failure to appear for trial and serve defendants. The motion was filed on February 23, 2024, and no opposition was filed by the defendants. The Court found that the Plaintiff's previous counsel left the firm in November 2022, and the calendaring error constituted excusable neglect. Therefore, the Court grants the motion to set aside the dismissal and orders a trial setting conference for April 9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
