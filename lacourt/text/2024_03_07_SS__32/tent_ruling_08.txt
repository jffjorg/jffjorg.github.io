MOTION
 
On
November 10, 2022, Plaintiff James Ellis (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Defendants AIDS Healthcare Foundation (“AHF”) and Does 1 to 30 for
negligence and premises liability. Plaintiff alleges that he rented a unit at
the Madison Hotel, owned by AHF, and that Defendant failed to respond to
warnings about a violent tenant who later shot Plaintiff on July 26, 2022. (Complaint
¶ 42.) ¿ 
 
            On November 8, 2023, AHF filed a
cross complaint against County of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles’ Sheriff’s
Department, Omar Deayon, and Does 1 to 10 for failure to perform a mandatory duty
and equitable indemnity. AHF alleges that it obtained a writ of possession
against the tenant who shot Plaintiff, Omar Deayon, one month before the
shooting. (Cross Complaint ¶ 13.) However, the writ contained a clerical error.
AHF then corrected the writ and delivered it to the Sheriff’s Department three
weeks before the shooting. (Id.) AHF alleges that the Sheriff’s
Department “had been informed, or should have known, that Mr. Deayon had a
recent history of violent or threatening behavior at the Madison and needed to
be removed from the Madison, for the sake of the safety of other people there.”
(Id. ¶ 14.) 
 
            County of Los Angeles (also sued
erroneously as County of Los Angeles’ Sheriff’s Department) (“County”), now
demurs to the cross complaint arguing it fails to state a claim.  Specifically, County argues that AHF fails to allege
a mandatory duty, that it is protected by the litigation privilege under Civil
Code section 47, and that the pleading is uncertain. AHF opposes and County
replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A demurrer is a pleading used to
test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. 
It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the
opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to
challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on
the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
The general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege
ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter
of pleading, even as against a special demurrer, is that his complaint set
forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable precision and with
sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source and
extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149,
156-157.) 
 
On demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to
“determine whether or not the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a
cause of action under any legal theory.” (Das v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.) Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
A
demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the pleading is so bad
that the responding party cannot reasonably respond, i.e., he or she cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what claims are
directed against him or her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Where a demurrer is made upon the ground of uncertainty,
the demurrer must distinctly specify exactly how or why the pleading is
uncertain, and where such uncertainty appears by reference to page and line
numbers. (See Fenton v. Groveland Comm. Services Dist. (1982) 135
Cal.App.3d 797, 809.)
 
            Where a demurrer is sustained, leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
According to the Declaration of Rina
M. Mathevosian, it appears the parties have met and conferred by telephone
prior to bringing this demurrer. (See Mathevosian Decl. ¶ 2.) 
 
JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
The
Court grants County’s request for judicial notice of exhibits 1, 2, 3. (Evid.
Code § 452(d).) 
 
The
Court denies AHF’s request for judicial notice of exhibit 1, 3 but takes
judicial notice of exhibit 2 insofar as they are court records. 
 
ANALYSIS
Government Code section
815 provides that “[a] public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such
injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public
employee or any other person” except as provided by statute. (Gov. Code, § 815,
subd. (a); see Hoff v. Vacaville Unified School Dist. (1998) 19 Cal.4th
925, 932.) “[D]irect tort liability of public entities must be based on a
specific statute declaring them to be liable, or at least creating some
specific duty of care, and not on the general tort provisions of Civil Code
section 1714. Otherwise, the general rule of immunity for public entities would
be largely eroded by the routine application of general tort principles.” (Eastburn
v. Regional Fire Protection Authority (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1183.) Consequently,
“public entities may be liable only if a statute declares them to be liable.” (Tuthill
v. City of San Buenaventura (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1088 (emphasis in
the original).
Moreover, to state a
cause of action [for government tort liability] every fact essential to the
existence of statutory liability must be pleaded with particularity, including
the existence of a statutory duty.” (Searcy v. Hemet Unified School Dist.
(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792, 802.) “Duty cannot be alleged simply by stating
‘defendant had a duty under the law’; that is a conclusion of law, not an
allegation of fact. The facts showing the existence of the claimed duty must be
alleged. [Citations.] Since the duty of a governmental agency can only be
created by statute or ‘enactment,’ the statute or ‘enactment’ claimed to
establish the duty must at the very least be identified.” (Id.)
Section 815.6
Government Code section 815.6 provides: “[w]here a public entity is
under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect
against the risk of a particular kind of injury, the public entity is liable
for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the
duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence
to discharge the duty.” Therefore, “[t]hree requirements must be met before
governmental entity liability may be imposed under Government Code section
815.6:(1) an enactment must impose a mandatory duty; (2) the enactment must be
meant to protect against the kind of risk of injury suffered by the party
asserting section 815.6 as a basis for liability; and (3) breach of the
mandatory duty must be a proximate cause of the injury suffered.” (Ellerbee
v. County of Los Angeles (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1206, 1215.) 
 
Whether an enactment creates a mandatory duty is a question of law. (Haggis v. City of Los Angeles (2000) 22 Cal.4th 490, 499.) “[S]ection 815.6 requires
the mandatory duty be ‘designed’ to protect against the particular kind of
injury the plaintiff suffered. The plaintiff must show the injury is ‘one of
the consequences which the [enacting body] sought to prevent through imposing
the alleged mandatory duty.’ [Citation.] Our inquiry in this regard goes to the
legislative purpose of imposing the duty. That the enactment ‘confers some
benefit’ on the class to which plaintiff belongs is not enough; if the benefit
is ‘incidental’ to the enactment's protective purpose, the enactment cannot
serve as a predicate for liability under section 815.6.” (Ibid.) 
 
Additionally, the first
prong of the statute is construed strictly, “finding a mandatory duty only if
the enactment ‘affirmatively imposes the duty and provides implementing
guidelines.’” (Guzman v. County of Monterey (2009) 46 Cal.4th 887, 898.)
The enactment’s language is the most important guide to determine legislative
intent, but “there are unquestionably instances in which other factors will
indicate that apparent obligatory language was not intended to foreclose a
governmental entity's or officer's exercise of discretion.” (Haggis, supra, 22 Cal.4th at 499.) 
Analysis
Here, the Court has taken
judicial notice of a writ of possession dated July 7, 2022, as to Omar Deayon,
423 E. 7th Street, Unit 325, Los Angeles CA 90014. (Mathevosian
Decl., Exh. 1.) A sheriff attempted to execute the writ on July 26, 2022 and
July 27, 2022, but was informed by the property manager that the wrong unit
number was on the writ. (Id., Exh. 2.) County argues and AHF admits that the
unit address on the writ of possession was incorrect. As a result, County
argues that the Sheriff’s Department is not liable since the shooting occurred
on July 26, 2022, and therefore, it could not have executed the writ in time to
prevent it. 
In response, AHF argues
that County was dilatory in not attempting to execute the writ sooner, waiting
19 days after the writ was obtained. However, AHF does not explain what
mandatory duty was breached when the writ on which AHF relies is defective. All
of the statutes cited by AHF assume a proper writ pursuant to which County can
act. (Opposition at p. 8.) AHF instead argues that the defects are clerical
errors, and the eviction paperwork contained the correct unit number.
(Opposition at p. 11.) However, AHF provides no argument for its proposition
that County had a duty to look beyond the actual writ issued by the court, and
to instead rely on the underlying documents submitted in support thereof.
Accordingly, AHF provides no argument for why doing “nothing with the writ of
possession for 19 days” would establish a breach of mandatory duty.[1]
(Opposition at p. 12.)
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court SUSTAINS County’s demurrer to AHF’s cross
complaint without leave to amend. 
 
County shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of
service of such.
