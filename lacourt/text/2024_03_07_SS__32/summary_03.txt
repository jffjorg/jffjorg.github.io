Summary: This is a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to amend a complaint to assert that Doe 1 is a corporation. The plaintiff, Rabin Babazadeh, filed an amended complaint substituting Defendant 118 Clark Homeowners Association as Doe 1. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the amendment is barred by the statute of limitations. The court finds that the pleading contains sufficient charging allegations against all named and Doe defendants and grants the motion for leave to amend the complaint.
