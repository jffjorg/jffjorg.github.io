And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer (a pleading that challenges the legal sufficiency of a complaint) filed by County of Los Angeles against AIDS Healthcare Foundation's (AHF) cross complaint. AHF alleges that County is liable for a shooting that occurred at the Madison Hotel, where AHF rented a unit to a tenant who had a history of violence. AHF claims that County had a mandatory duty to prevent the shooting, but County argues that it did not have such a duty.

The judge has taken judicial notice of exhibits 1, 2, and 3, which include a writ of possession and sheriff's reports. The judge has also considered the parties' meet and confer efforts and has denied AHF's request for judicial notice of certain exhibits.

The judge concludes that AHF's cross complaint does not state a cause of action and sustains County's demurrer without leave to amend. The judge finds that AHF has failed to allege a mandatory duty on the part of County and that the shooting was not proximately caused by County's failure to discharge its duty. The judge also finds that AHF has not shown that County was dilatory in executing the writ of possession.

Accordingly, the judge orders that County's demurrer be sustained and that AHF's cross complaint be dismissed.
