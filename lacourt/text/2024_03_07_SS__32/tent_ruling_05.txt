HEARING DATE:

  7, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV15454




MOTIONS:  


(1)  
  Compel Answers to Supplemental Interrogatories
(2)  
  Compel Responses to Supplemental Demand for
  Production




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Jaime Gutierrez Martin  




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant Jaime Gutierrez Martin
(Defendant) moves to compel Plaintiff Delonda Stevens’ (Plaintiff) responses to
Supplemental Interrogatory, Set One and Supplemental Demand for Production of
Documents, Set One. No opposition has been filed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Demand
for Production
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.300, if a party fails to
serve a timely response to a demand for inspection, the party making the demand
may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Code Civ. Pro §
2031.300 (b).) The party who fails to serve a timely response to a demand for
inspection waives any objection to the demand unless the court finds that the
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance or
party’s failure was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300 (a)(1)- (2).) 
 
Supplemental
Demand for Production
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.050 provides:
 
“(b) A party may propound a supplemental demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling twice before the initial setting of a trial date,
and, subject to the time limits on discovery proceedings and motions provided
in Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 2024.010), once after the initial setting
of a trial date.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc. § 2031.050(b).)
 
Interrogatories
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290 (b).) Failure to timely respond waives
all objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)(1),
(a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no
responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a party does
not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
If a motion to compel responses is filed, the Court shall impose a
monetary sanction against the losing party “unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290 (c).) Further, “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery
Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
 
Supplemental
Interrogatories
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.070 provides:
 
            “(b) A party may propound a
supplemental interrogatory twice before the initial setting of a trial date,
and, subject to the time limits on discovery proceedings and motions provided
in Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 2024.010), once after the initial setting
of a trial date.”
 
(Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.070(b).)
             
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant asserts that on September 22, 2023, Defendant served
Plaintiff with Defendant’s Supplemental Request for Production of Documents,
Set One and Supplemental Interrogatories, Set One. (Galang Decl. ¶ 2. Exh. A.)
No responses have been served. (Id. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff was served via mail, the
discovery and these motions, at the address indicated on the order relieving
Plaintiff’s counsel. (Order, 7/12/23.) Therefore, since responses have not been
served and no opposition was filed, the motions to compel are granted. 
 
Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $310 for each motion (1
hour of attorney time at $250 plus the $60 filing fee). The Court finds the
amounts to be reasonable. Accordingly, the Court awards monetary sanctions in
the total amount of $620 for both motions. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel Supplemental
Interrogatory, Set One and Supplemental Demand for Production of Documents, Set
One. Plaintiff shall
serve verified responses, without objection, within 14 days.
 
            The Court further grants Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions in the amount of $620. Plaintiff shall pay said monetary sanctions to
counsel for Defendant within 30 days of notice of this order.
 
            Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s order and
file a proof of service of such.
