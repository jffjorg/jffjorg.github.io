[1] In any
event, the only time requirement AHF cites is Code of Civil Procedure section
715.050 (“[A] writ of possession issued pursuant to a judgment for possession
in an unlawful detainer action shall be enforced … without delay…”) AHF does
not provide any support for the argument that County had a mandatory duty to
act within a certain amount of time.
