Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denies the motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Perpetual Altruism, Ltd. The court finds that the service of summons and complaint on the defendant was proper under the Hague Service Convention and UK service of process laws. The court also finds that the service was reasonably calculated to give actual notice to the defendant, which had an obligation to maintain its current registered address. The court relies on the Certificate of Attestation issued by the UK Central Authority, which confirms that the service was completed in accordance with the Convention. The court also finds that the evidence of the act or event is not inadmissible hearsay as it was made by and within the scope of duty of a public employee, and the writing was made at or near the time of the act, condition, or event.
