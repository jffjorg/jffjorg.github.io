The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to amend the default judgment in part. The plaintiff, Californian II Homeowners Association, has seven days to file its proposed default judgment. The motion was filed due to the plaintiff's counsel's mistake in preparing the request for default judgment and proposed judgment. Specifically, the counsel mistakenly left out the relief of foreclosure of a lien, which is a cause of action in the complaint. The counsel has attested to their mistake and submitted the motion within six months of the signed default judgment, as required by California Civil Procedure Code Section 473, subdivision (b). The judge has granted the motion to correct this mistake and allow the plaintiff to file a corrected proposed default judgment.
