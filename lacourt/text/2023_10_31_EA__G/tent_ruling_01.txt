  Case Number:  21PSCV00589    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  G Defendant Xiaoshu Zhang’s Motion for Sanctions against  Plaintiff Respondent: Plaintiff Lingxi  Teng TENTATIVE RULING Defendant Xiaoshu Zhang’s Motion for Sanctions against  Plaintiff is DENIED without prejudice. BACKGROUND This is a breach of contract  action arising from a loan agreement. On February 22, 2021, Plaintiff Lingxi  Teng allegedly entered into a written loan agreement with Defendants Weijin Hu,  Xiaoshu Zhang, and Lion Tools LLC (Lion Tools) in which Teng agreed to loan $50,000  to Defendants in exchange for repayment by April 10. Subsequently, Teng alleges  Defendants breached the agreement by failing to repay the loan. On July 20, 2021, Teng filed  a complaint against Defendants and Does 1-10, alleging (1) breach of contract,  (2) common counts, and (3) negligence. On October 9, 2023, Zhang  filed the present motion. A hearing on the motion is set for October 31 with a  mandatory settlement conference on November 2 and a trial setting conference on  November 13. ANALYSIS Zhang  moves for monetary and terminating sanctions against Teng pursuant to Code of  Civil Procedure section 128.7. For the following reasons, the court DENIES Zhang’s motion. Legal Standard Pursuant  to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, “a court may impose sanctions if it  concludes a pleading was filed for an improper purpose or was indisputably  without merit, either legally or factually.” (Bucur v. Ahmad (2016) 244  Cal.App.4th 175, 189.) “A claim is factually frivolous if it is ‘not well  grounded in fact’ and is legally frivolous if it is ‘not warranted by existing  law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of  existing law.’” (Ibid, quoting Guillemin v. Stein (2002) 104  Cal.App.4th 156, 167.) The moving party bears the burden of showing the “the  party’s conduct in asserting the claim was objectively unreasonable.” (Ibid.)  “A claim is objectively unreasonable if ‘any reasonable attorney would agree  that [it] is totally and completely without merit.’” (Ibid, quoting In  re Marriage of Flaherty (1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 650.) But this section “should  be utilized only in ‘the rare and exceptional case where the action is clearly  frivolous, legally unreasonable or without legal foundation, or brought for an  improper purpose.’” (Kumar v. Ramsey (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 1110, 1121 (Kumar),  quoting Operating Engineers Pension Trust v. A-C Co. (9th Cir. 1988) 859  F.2d 1336, 1344.) Code  of Civil Procedure section 128.7 also includes a safe harbor provision that states  a “[n]otice of motion shall be served as provided in Section 1010, but shall  not be filed with or presented to the court unless, within 21 days after  service of the motion, or any other period as the court may prescribe, the  challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not  withdrawn or appropriately corrected.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (c)(1);  Li v. Majestic Industry Hills, LLC (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 585, 590-591.)  This safe harbor requirement is strictly enforced, and substantial compliance is  not sufficient. (See Cromwell v. Cummings (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th  Supp.10, 15.) “If  warranted, the court may award to the party prevailing on the motion the  reasonable expenses and attorney’s fees incurred in presenting or opposing the  motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (c)(1).) An award of fees is not  warranted unless the motion was “frivolous, unfounded, filed for an improper  purpose, or otherwise unreasonable.” (Musaelian v. Adams (2011) 197  Cal.App.4th 1251, 1258.) Discussion As  an initial matter, Zhang argues the court should decline to consider Teng’s  opposition on the grounds that it was untimely filed and improperly served. But  when a party files an opposition or reply that addresses the merits, that party  waives the right to challenge the notice of the respective moving papers or  opposition. (See Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 844, 697-698.) Because  Zhang has filed a reply to Teng’s opposition that addresses the merits of  Zhang’s motion, the court will not disregard Teng’s opposition. Prior  to the filing of this motion on October 9, 2023, Zhang’s counsel served a copy  of the motion on Teng via overnight mail on September 11. (Iazzetta Suppl.  Decl., ¶ 5.) Because Zhang’s original service of this motion was twenty-eight  days before it was filed, the court finds Zhang has complied with the safe  harbor provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7. Here,  the court finds Zhang’s motion premature. Zhang argues sanctions are warranted  because Teng’s Complaint lacks any evidentiary support as it fails to establish  how Zhang was a party to the alleged loan agreement. Zhang also argues Teng  failed to respond to Zhang’s demand for a bill of particulars and that Teng’s  action was brought for an improper purpose. Because the issues raised here are  more appropriately raised in a motion for summary judgment or adjudication, the  court exercises its discretion and declines to find Teng’s Complaint is without  merit. Accordingly,  the court DENIES Zhang’s motion. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Zhang’s  motion for sanctions is DENIED without prejudice.
