And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Xiaoshu Zhang's motion for sanctions against Lingxi Teng without prejudice. The motion was filed in response to Teng's complaint alleging breach of contract, common counts, and negligence. Zhang argued that Teng's complaint lacks evidentiary support and was brought for an improper purpose. The court found that Zhang's motion was premature and that the issues raised were more appropriately raised in a motion for summary judgment or adjudication. The court also found that Teng's opposition was timely and properly served, and therefore did not waive its right to challenge the motion. Finally, the court declined to find Teng's complaint without merit and denied Zhang's motion for sanctions.
