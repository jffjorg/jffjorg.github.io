  Case Number:  23STCV17249    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Aaron Friedman’s Motion for
Sanctions Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.99
            Plaintiff Aaron Friedman moves for
$112,908.50 in sanctions against defendant GR0.com, LLC under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.99.  Section
1281.99, subdivision (a) provides, “The court shall impose a monetary sanction
against a drafting party that materially breaches an arbitration agreement
pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1281.97 or subdivision (a) of Section
1281.98, by ordering the drafting party to pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by the employee or consumer as a
result of the material breach.”  
On
November 30, 2023, the court denied defendant’s motion to compel arbitration of
this action on the basis that defendant materially breached the arbitration
agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98 by failing to pay fees when
due.  Defendant argues the court should
defer ruling on this motion due to its pending appeal of that order.  The court agrees that doing so will serve the
interests of justice and judicial economy.
When
defendant moved to compel arbitration, it argued the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)
preempts Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98.  At the time, binding authority held
otherwise.  (See Espinoza v. Superior
Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 779; Gallo v. Wood Ranch USA, Inc.
(2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 621, 643.)  In its
opposition to this motion, defendant provides new authority holding the FAA does
preempt these statutes.  (Hernandez v. Sohnen Enterprises, Inc. (2024) 102
Cal.App.5th 222, 242-244, review granted August 21, 2024, No. S285696.)  
The question of preemption is pending before
the California Supreme Court.  If the
Court holds the FAA preempts these statutes, plaintiff would not be entitled to
recover attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure 1281.99.  Rather than imposing over $110,000 in
sanctions now, the court finds it appropriate to deny the motion without
prejudice.
The court does not reach the issue of whether
plaintiff reasonably incurred $112,908.50 in expenses as a result of
defendant’s material breach of the arbitration agreement.
            Plaintiff Aaron Friedman’s motion
for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.99 is denied
without prejudice.
