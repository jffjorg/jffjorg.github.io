And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on plaintiff Aaron Friedman's motion for sanctions against defendant GR0.com, LLC. The defendant breached an arbitration agreement by failing to pay fees when due, and the court previously denied its motion to compel arbitration. The defendant is now appealing that decision. Due to the pending appeal and the potential for a reversal of the court's earlier ruling, the court has denied the motion for sanctions without prejudice, rather than imposing over $110,000 in sanctions. The court has also taken into account new authority suggesting that the Federal Arbitration Act may preempt California's Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.99, which governs sanctions for material breaches of arbitration agreements.
