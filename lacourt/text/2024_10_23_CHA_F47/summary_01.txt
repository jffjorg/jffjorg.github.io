The judge has granted the motion filed by Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC to compel Plaintiff Edward Khechemyan to arbitrate his claims. The motion was filed after the Plaintiff refused to arbitrate his claims against the Defendant. The judge found that the arbitration provision in the lease agreement is valid and enforceable, and that the claims in this action arise out of and relate to the lease of the Vehicle and the resulting warranty relationship. The judge also found that the Defendant is a third-party beneficiary of the arbitration agreement and has the right to enforce it against the Plaintiff. The judge has stayed the action pending the outcome of the arbitration.
