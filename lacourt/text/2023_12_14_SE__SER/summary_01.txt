And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant/Cross-Complainant Lorena Belman's motion to set aside the judgment and/or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and motion for new trial. The motions were filed late, outside the 15-day deadline specified by the California Code of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff argues that the court committed five prejudicial errors, including granting summary judgment to a defendant, denying attorney's fees, reducing the jury's verdict, and failing to award all costs and prejudgment interest. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that it is untimely and lacks sufficient legal basis. The judge finds that the motions are untimely and denies them accordingly.
