TENTATIVE ORDER
 
      I.        
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant/Cross-Complainant
LORENA BELMAN’s Motion to Set Aside the Judgment and/or for Judgment
Notwithstanding the Verdict is DENIED. 
 
    II.        
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant/Cross-Complainant
LORENA BELMAN’s Moton for New Trial is DENIED. 
 
Defendants to give Notice. 
 
This wrongful termination action was filed on October 21,
2016. This action was consolidated with the later-filed action, Belman v.
Garcia (VC066907), filed on February 7, 2018. The subject action is the
lead case. 
 
On June 14, 2023, a Judgment, reflecting a jury’s verdict,
was entered. The June 14, 2023 Judgment awarded
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant/Cross-Complainant LORENA BELMAN (“Belman”) $197,750
from Defendants LOS BAGRES CORPORATION; JUAN ERASMO GARCIA; and GIZZELLE
CABRERA, jointly and severally, plus recoverable costs in the amount of
$31,005.42; and expert costs from Los Bagres Corporation and Juan Erasmo Garcia
in the amount of $7,110.00; and attorney’s fees in the amount of $699,990.00.
 
Belman moves to set aside the Judgment entered on June 14,
2023 “and/or” enter a new judgment notwithstanding the verdict; and also
separately moves for a New Trial. 
 
Belman argues that a judgment notwithstanding the verdict
and/or new trial is proper because this Court committed to following five
prejudicial errors: (1) Granting the dismissal of claims against
Defendant/Cross-Defendant Mariela Garcia because this Court’s February 1, 2019
Order granted summary judgment as to Defendant Mariela Garcia, but not
Cross-Defendant Mariela Garcia; (2) The Court improperly denied Belman’s
request for attorney’s fees on June 1, 2023; (3) This Court improperly reduced
the jury’s verdict of $303,000, by $106,250, on the basis that Belman received
$106,250 in a workers compensation case; (4) The Court should have awarded
Belman all costs requested against Cabrera and all prejudgment interest against
the other two defendants as Belman was the prevailing party; and (5) the Court
improperly reduced and failed to award reasonable attorney fees—fees should
have not have been reduced to $699,990.
 
In Opposition, Former-Defendant Mariela Garcia argues: (1)
Belman’s Motion is untimely; (2) the one-judgment rule does not apply; and (3)
Belman fails to provide any law or arguments sufficient to support a Judgment
Notwithstanding the Verdict or to Set Aside the Judgment and New Trial. 
 
“A judgment or decree, when based upon a decision by the
court, or the special verdict of a jury, may, upon motion of the party
aggrieved, be set aside and vacated by the same court, and another and
different judgment entered, for either of the following causes, materially
affecting substantial rights of the party and entitling the party to a
different judgment: 1. Incorrect or erroneous legal basis for the decision, not
consistent with or not supported by the facts; and in such case when the
judgment is set aside, the statement of decision shall be amended and
corrected. 2. A judgment or decree not consistent with or not supported by the
special verdict.” (CCP §663.) “A party intending to make a motion to set aside
and vacate a judgment, as described in Section 663, shall file with the clerk
and serve upon the adverse party a notice of his or her intention, designating
the grounds upon which the motion will be made, and specifying the particulars
in which the legal basis for the decision is not consistent with or supported
by the facts, or in which the judgment or decree is not consistent with the
special verdict, either: (1) After the decision is rendered and before the
entry of judgment. (2) Within 15 days of the date of mailing of notice of
entry of judgment by the clerk of the court pursuant to Section 664.5, or
service upon him or her by any party of written notice of entry of judgment,
or within 180 days after the entry of judgment, whichever is earliest.” (emphasis
added) (CCP §663a(a).)  
 
“A motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict shall be
made within the period specified by Section 659 for the filing and service of a
notice of intention to move for a new trial.” (CCP §629(b).) “The party
intending to move for a new trial shall file with the clerk and serve upon each
adverse party a notice of his or her intention to move for a new trial,
designating the grounds upon which the motion will be made and whether the same
will be made upon affidavits or the minutes of the court, or both, either: (1)
After the decision is rendered and before the entry of judgment. (2) Within 15
days of the date of mailing notice of entry of judgment by the clerk of the
court pursuant to Section 664.5, or service upon him or her by any party of
written notice of entry of judgment, or within 180 days after the entry of
judgment, whichever is earliest; provided, that upon the filing of the first
notice of intention to move for a new trial by a party, each other party shall
have 15 days after the service of that notice upon him or her to file and serve
a notice of intention to move for a new trial.” (CCP §659(a).) 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Set Aside Judgment; Motion for
Entry of Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict; and Motion for New Trial were
all due to be filed and served within 15 days of the service of the notice of
entry of Judgment. 
 
Here, Judgment was entered on June 14, 2023, and served on
June 20, 2023. Plaintiff’s Notice of Intent to Move for New Trial was not filed
until October 13, 2023. Plaintiff’s Motions were not filed until October 24,
2023. 
 
The Motions are DENIED as untimely.
