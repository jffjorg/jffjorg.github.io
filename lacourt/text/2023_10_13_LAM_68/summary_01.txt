Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge in a case between Plaintiff Linda Baek and Defendant County of Los Angeles. The case involves allegations of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by the County against Plaintiff. The Judge is considering the Defendant's motion for summary judgment and granting it for Plaintiff's Second and Sixth Causes of Action. The Judge finds that Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case for retaliation, and therefore, the County is entitled to summary judgment on those claims. The case will proceed with the remaining Causes of Action.
