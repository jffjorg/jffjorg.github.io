And here is the summary text:

This tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Dong Youb Lee's motion to strike the answers of Defendants Academy of Couture Art, Inc., Hollywood World Entertainment Incorporated, and Global Entertainment Management, Inc. in their entirety. The Defendants are corporate entities that have not been represented by counsel since June 2, 2023, and are therefore not able to represent themselves in court. Pursuant to CCP § 436, the Court strikes the Defendants' answers and enters default against them. The Court also notes that a corporation must be represented by licensed counsel in proceedings before courts of record, and that the unlicensed practice of law is prohibited in California.
