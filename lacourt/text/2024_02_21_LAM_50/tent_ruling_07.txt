[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default
judgment against Defendant Mystery Baking Company, LLC aka Mystery Baking
Company. Plaintiff requests judgment in the total amount of $52,870.17, comprising
$46,804.98 demanded in the Complaint, $3,680.28 in
interest, $590.77 in costs, and $1,794.14 in attorney fees. 
The
Court notes one defect with the submitted default judgment package. Plaintiff submits
the declaration of Doug Hewey, the Director, Billing and Accounts Receivable of
Bay Alarm Company. (Hewey Decl., ¶ 1.)[1]
Mr. Hewey states in his declaration that “[a] true and correct copy of the
Defendant’s Statement of Account/Invoices reflecting the obligation owed by
Defendant in the sum of $46,804.98 are attached hereto marked as Exhibit ‘2’
and incorporated herein by this reference as though fully set forth. I have
reviewed the statements and invoices and it accurately reflects the current
status of Defendant’s account and all unpaid invoices mailed to the Defendant…”
(Hewey Decl., ¶ 5.) However, the first page of Exhibit 2 contains a “Balance”
column that appears to list a total amount of $38,647.99. (Hewey Decl., ¶ 5,
Ex. 2.) The attached invoices also appear to total $38,647.99. (Ibid.)
As set forth above, Plaintiff seeks $46,804.98 in damages. It does not appear
that any explanation has been provided regarding this discrepancy. 
Accordingly,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment without prejudice. The
Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default
judgment package.
