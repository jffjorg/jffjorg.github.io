[1]Plaintiff cites to
page 16 of the demurrer, where Russell argues that “Russell taking the Board
seat based on SecurCapital’s equity position is fully consistent with Russell’s
status as agent of the corporation, which can act only through its employees and
agents.” (Demurrer at p. 16:1-3.) 


[2]The first
paragraph of the SAC alleges “Plaintiff Wave Investment, LLC (‘Wave’ or
‘Plaintiff’), by its undersigned counsel, brings this action against defendants
SecurCapital Corp. (‘SecurCapital’), Stephen J. Russell (‘Russell’), and DOES 1
through 10, inclusive, and each of them (together, ‘Defendants’)…” (SAC,
p. 2:1-4, emphasis added.) 


[3]Plaintiff also relies on Foster Poultry Farms, Inc. v.
SunTrust Bank (9th
Cir. 2010) 377 F.App'x 665, a non-binding federal case. Defendants also
note that Foster is an unpublished opinion.
