[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
MOTION FOR CLAIM
  OF EXEMPTION FOR DEFENDANT AARONOFF FROM ENFORCEMENT OF THE MONEY JUDGMENT




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Background
Plaintiff Curtis R. Olson (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on December
23, 2019 against a number of defendants, including Vidala Aaronoff. Plaintiff
filed the operative Second Amended Complaint on November 17, 2020, alleging ten
causes of action.
On August 29, 2023, Jane Doe filed a Cross-Complaint in this action
against, inter alia, Plaintiff. The Cross-Complaint alleges nine causes
of action. 
“Defendant and Cross-Complaint Jane Doe Aaronoff” (herein, “Aaronoff”)
now moves “for Claim of Exemption from enforcement of the money judgment.”[1] No
opposition to the instant motion appears to have been filed.  
Discussion
            Aaronoff’s notice of motion states
that Aaronoff “files this Amended Notice of Motion and Motion for Claim of
Exemption from enforcement of the money judgment.” (Notice of Motion at p.
2:8-10.) As an initial matter, Aaronoff does not appear to specify what
judgment she is referring to.  
The Court notes that on May 17, 2022, the Court issued an Order in
this action on Plaintiff’s motion for statutory attorneys’ fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. The Court’s May
17, 2022 Order provides, inter alia, “Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’
fees is granted in the amount of $41,697.00.” The Court notes that on October 11,
2023, a writ of execution (money judgment) was issued as to the “Judgment
entered on…May 17, 2022.”  On November 20, 2023, an Abstract of
Judgment was issued in this action stating, inter alia, that Judgment
was entered on May 17, 2022 (Attorneys Fees Order), and that
“[t]otal amount of judgment as entered or last renewed: $41,697.00.” The
instant motion appears to concern such judgment, as Aaronoff asserts,
“Defendant Jane Doe contests Olson’s money judgment, which is based on Olson
fraudulently obtaining an attorney’s fees award against Defendant’s
anti-SLAPP.” (Mot. at p. 7:6-8.) 
            In the instant motion, Aaronoff
asserts that “Olson’s Derivative Case 19STCV46503 Is Void” and that “all orders
in this case 19STCV46503 are void.” (See Mot. at pp. 8:6-9:7.) The Court
does not understand this argument and it is not supported by citations to legal
authority. Moreover, this argument appears to concern a different case,
referred to by Aaronoff as “Aaronoff v Olson 17SMRO00308.” (Mot. at p. 8:7-8.) 
Aaronoff also cites to Code of Civil Procedure
section 708.550, which provides that “[t]he
judgment debtor may claim that all or a portion of the right to payment is
exempt from enforcement of a money judgment by application to the court on
noticed motion filed not later than three days before the date set for the
hearing on the judgment creditor’s application for an assignment order. The
judgment debtor shall execute an affidavit in support of the application that
includes all of the matters set forth in subdivision (b) of Section 703.520. Failure of the judgment debtor to
make a claim of exemption is a waiver of the exemption.” ((Id., § 708.550, subd. (a).) Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 708.550, subdivision (c), “[t]he
court shall determine any claim of exemption made pursuant to this section at
the hearing on issuance of the assignment order.” But here, the instant hearing
does not appear to concern the issuance of an assignment order. Thus, the Court
does not see how Code of Civil Procedure section
708.550 is applicable here.
            In addition, Aaronoff cites to Code of Civil Procedure section 482.100. (See Notice of Motion at p. 2:20.) This
provision provides, inter alia, that “[t]he defendant may claim an exemption provided in Section 487.020 for property levied upon pursuant to a
writ issued under this title if the right to the exemption is the result of a
change in circumstances occurring after (1) the denial of a claim of exemption
for the property earlier in the action or (2) the expiration of the time for
claiming the exemption earlier in the action.” ((Id., § 482.100, subd. (a).) Aaronoff has
not shown that these circumstances apply here. 
 
            Aronoff also cites to Code of Civil Procedure section 708.470. (Notice of Motion at p. 3:5.) This provision
provides, inter alia, that “[i]f the judgment debtor is entitled to money or property under
the judgment in the action or special proceeding and a lien created under this
article exists, upon application of any party to the action or special
proceeding, the court may order that the judgment debtor’s rights to money or
property under the judgment be applied to the satisfaction of the lien created
under this article as ordered by the court. Application for an order under this
section shall be on noticed motion. The notice of motion shall be served on all
other parties. Service shall be made personally or by mail.” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 708.470, subdivision (c), “[i]f
the court determines that a party (other than the judgment debtor) having
notice of the lien created under this article has transferred property that was
subject to the lien or has paid an amount to the judgment debtor that was
subject to the lien, the court shall render judgment against the party in an
amount equal to the lesser of the following: (1) The value of the judgment debtor’s interest in the property or the
amount paid the judgment debtor. (2) The amount of the judgment creditor’s lien created under this
article.” The Court also does not see
how Code of Civil Procedure section 708.470 is applicable here.  
            Based on the foregoing, the Court does not find that Aaronoff
has demonstrated grounds for the Court to grant the instant “Motion for Claim
of Exemption from enforcement of the money judgment.” 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Aaronoff’s motion is denied.

Aaronoff is to provide notice of this
ruling.¿
