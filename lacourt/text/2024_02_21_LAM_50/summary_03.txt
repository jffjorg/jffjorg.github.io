And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants and has determined that the demurrer will be overruled in its entirety. The defendants' motion to strike is also denied. The court finds that the plaintiff has adequately alleged a concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated, routine or a generalized nature and that the defendant's conduct would have interfered with a reasonable employee's work performance and would have seriously affected the psychological well-being of a reasonable employee and that the plaintiff was actually offended. The defendants' argument that no employer-employee relationship existed between the parties is rejected. The court orders the defendants to file and serve their answer to the complaint within 10 days of the date of this order.
