And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the claim of exemption filed by the judgment debtor, Arabo Sarkesyan, and has determined that the claim does not appear to cite to any applicable statutory basis supporting the claim of exemption. The court has also determined that the judgment debtor has failed to meet his burden of tracing exempt funds into the subject account. As a result, the court has continued the hearing on the claim of exemption for the submission of supplemental briefing and necessary documentary support for any claim of exemption. The new hearing date is set for May 17, 2024.
