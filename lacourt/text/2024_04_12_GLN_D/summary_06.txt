And here is the English text that summarizes the judge's tentative ruling:

"The motion to be relieved as attorney of record is denied. The motion was not served or filed on sufficient notice, and the proposed order was not lodged with the court. The court finds that the service of the motion on the client was not proper, as the declaration did not show that the address was confirmed as current within the past 30 days. Additionally, the motion was filed and served only 15 court days prior to the hearing, which is less than the required 16 court days. The court also notes that the proposed order was not lodged with the court, as required by court rules. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice."
