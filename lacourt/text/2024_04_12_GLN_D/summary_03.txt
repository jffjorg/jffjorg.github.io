And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the plaintiff's motion to withdraw or amend admissions and has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks relief from the deemed admissions due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The court finds that the plaintiff's previous counsel's actions were excusable and that the party who obtained the admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining their action or defense on the merits.

The court notes that the plaintiff's previous counsel was unaware of the deemed admissions due to email blocking and that the plaintiff's previous counsel has taken responsibility for the mistake. The court also finds that the defendant will not be prejudiced by the relief sought and that the costs of additional discovery will not be unnecessarily incurred.

The court has tentatively ordered that the plaintiff be permitted to respond to the Requests for Admissions and continue discovery. The court also has tentatively ordered that the defendant pay $10,000 in discovery costs and expenses resulting from the conduct of the plaintiff and its previous counsel.

The court's tentative ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.300 and 473(b), which provide for the withdrawal or amendment of admissions and the imposition of conditions on the granting of relief. The court's ruling is subject to finalization after considering further argument and evidence.
