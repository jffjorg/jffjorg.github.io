And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the case and the arguments presented by both parties. The plaintiff, James Soleimani, was a student at Saint Francis High School of La Canada-Flintridge, where he was involved in a series of fights with his peers. The plaintiff alleges that he was subjected to bullying and harassment by his peers, and that the school failed to take adequate measures to prevent these incidents. The plaintiff also alleges that he was unfairly expelled from school, and that the expulsion was motivated by a desire to avoid liability for the school's failure to prevent the bullying.

The defendant, California Interscholastic Federation (CIF), demurred to the complaint, arguing that it did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care. The CIF argued that it did not have a duty to supervise students or make determinations concerning discipline. The plaintiff argued that the CIF did owe a duty of care to the plaintiff, and that the CIF's failure to prevent the bullying and harassment was a breach of that duty.

The court noted that the plaintiff did not allege how the CIF had a duty to supervise students or make determinations concerning discipline. The court also noted that the plaintiff did not identify any recoverable damages attributable to the CIF's ruling. The court ultimately ruled that the CIF did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff's claims against the CIF were therefore without merit.
