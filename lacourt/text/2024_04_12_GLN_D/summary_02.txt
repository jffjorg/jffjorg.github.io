The court finds that the motion fails to comply with the mandatory requirements of CRC Rule 3.1324(a) and (b) and that there is no proof of service showing that the motion was served on the other parties. The court also finds that the motion does not include a copy of the proposed amended pleading, does not state what allegations are proposed to be added or deleted, and does not specify where, by page, paragraph, and line number, these additional allegations are located. The court suggests that any further motion propose to file an amended pleading which is drafted by counsel.
