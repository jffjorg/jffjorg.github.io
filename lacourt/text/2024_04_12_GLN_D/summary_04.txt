Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrers to the sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action. The court concludes that the demurrers to the sixth and seventh causes of action are sustained as the FAC does not sufficiently allege alter ego allegations or a basis for subjecting defendants to liability on other grounds for the conduct of Hippo. The court also concludes that the demurrer to the eighth cause of action, alleging a violation of the Fair Housing Act, is sustained as the FAC does not sufficiently allege alter ego allegations or a basis for subjecting HHI to liability on other grounds for the conduct of Hippo. The court orders that the demurrers are sustained, and the FAC is insufficient to state a cause of action.
