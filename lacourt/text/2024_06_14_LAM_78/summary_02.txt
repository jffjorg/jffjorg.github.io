And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel arbitration filed by defendants Daniel Lamotte and Paul Stewart. The court continues the hearing to June 28, 2024. The movants must file supplemental briefing on the delegation clause by June 19, 2024, and the plaintiff must respond by June 24, 2024. The court is considering whether the parties intended to delegate issues of enforceability to the arbitrator. The court finds that the language of the arbitration agreement clearly and unmistakably states that the arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve disputes. However, the court notes that the movants did not address state contract defenses in their reply, and the parties must provide further briefing on this issue.
