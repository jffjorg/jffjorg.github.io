 Case Number:  22STCV32453    Hearing Date:   June 14, 2024    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78  RODRIGO SANGUINO,Plaintiff,  vs. COPART, INC., et al., Defendants.  Case No.:  22STCV32453 Hearing Date:  June 14, 2024   [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:  MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION FILED BY DEFENDANTS DANIEL LAMOTTE AND PAUL STEWART   This matter is continued to June 28, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.Movants Lamotte and Stewart must file supplemental briefing as outlined below by June 19, 2024. Plaintiff must file a response as outlined below by June 24, 2024. Movants Lamotte and Stewart argue for the first time on reply that the parties delegated enforceability to the arbitrator.The enforceability of an arbitration agreement is generally determined by the court. See¿Aanderud¿v. Superior Court¿(2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 880, 891;¿Ajamian¿v. CantorCO2e, L.P.¿(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 771, 781. However, parties may agree to arbitrate gateway questions of arbitrability such as the enforceability of an arbitration agreement and whether claims are covered by the arbitration agreement. See¿Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson¿(2010) 561 U.S. 63, 68-69;¿Aanderud, supra, 13 Cal.App.5th at 891-92;¿Ajamian, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at 781. “To establish this exception, it must be shown by ‘clear and unmistakable’ evidence that the parties intended to delegate the issue to the arbitrator.” Ajamian, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at 781 (citing¿First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan¿(1995) 514 U.S. 938, 944).¿ “‘There are two prerequisites for a delegation clause to be effective.’” Aanderud, supra, 13 Cal.App.5th at 892 (quoting¿Tiri¿v. Lucky Changes, Inc.¿(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 231, 242).¿ “‘First, the language of the clause must be clear and unmistakable.’” Id. “‘Second, the delegation must not be revocable under state contract defenses such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability.’” Id. Here, the language of the delegation clause states: “[T]he Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this agreement.”(Santosuosso Decl., Exh. 4, pdf p. 119.)The language of the delegation clause clearly and unmistakably states issues of enforceability are to be adjudicated by the arbitrator. Therefore, it appears that the agreement satisfies the first prong. As for the second prong, Plaintiff does not address the delegation clause in his opposition. Movants do not address whether the delegation clause would be revocable under any state contract defense in their reply. Because Movants raised this argument on reply, Plaintiff has not had the opportunity to respond. The parties must provide supplemental briefing on this issue. Movants must address the issue of whether the delegation is revocable under state contract defenses.Plaintiff must address both issues, the language of the agreement and whether any delegation is revocable under state contract defenses.DATED:  June 14, 2024___________________________Hon.
