  Case Number:  22STCV13269    Hearing Date:   June 14, 2024    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78  EDUARDO SANTA CRUZ SOSA,Plaintiff,           vs. BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC, Defendant.  Case No.:  22STCV13269  Hearing Date:  June 14, 2024 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:  PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees and costs is GRANTED in the reduced amount as described below.Moving party to provide notice.I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND   This is an action brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. Plaintiff Eduardo Sosa purchased a used 2018 BMW 430i with express warranties. The vehicle was delivered to Plaintiff with serious defects and nonconformities which Defendant BMW North America failed to repair after a reasonable number of attempts.II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY On April 21, 2022, 2022, Plaintiff filed his Complaint.On December 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement.On January 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for attorney fees.On May 20, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition.III. LEGAL STANDARDUnder the Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d) the prevailing party in an action that arises out of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entitled to fees that were reasonably incurred:  “If the buyer prevails under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the Court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).) With respect to attorney fees and costs, unless a statute provides for them, (e.g., Code of Civil Procedure sections 1032, et seq.), the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties.¿(Code Civ. Proc., section 1021.)¿ The prevailing party on a contract, which specifically provides for attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the agreement, is entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.¿ (Civ. Code, section 1717, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., sections 1032; 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(A).)¿ The court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall determine the prevailing party and shall fix, as an element of the costs of suit, the reasonable attorney fees.¿ (Civ. Code, section 1717, subds. (a), (b).)¿ A party moving for attorneys’ fees as an element of costs shall serve and file the notice before or at the same time the party serves and files the memorandum of costs; if only attorney fees are claimed as costs, the party shall serve and file the notice within the time specified in the Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700 for filing a memorandum of costs.¿ (Cal. Rules Court. 3.1702; Gunlock Corp. v. Walk on Water, Inc. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303, fn. 1.)¿¿¿  ¿¿¿ “It is well established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.”¿ (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”¿ (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)¿ “[A] computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.”¿ (Margolin v. Reg’l Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.)¿ The court may then adjust the lodestar figure based on consideration of factors specific to the case, to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.¿ (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].)¿   In challenging attorney fees as excessive because the moving party claimed too many hours of work, the challenging party bears the burden of pointing to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.¿ (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)¿ General arguments that the fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.¿ (Ibid.)¿¿ IV. DISCUSSIONPlaintiff seeks $142,525 in fees for attorney’s fees, $35,369.35 in costs and expenses, and a lodestar modifier of 2. Attorney’s fees and costs are recoverable pursuant to Civ. Code, section 1794. The parties dispute whether Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing was reasonable and whether Plaintiff’s counsel may be awarded a multiplier.Reasonableness of Hourly RatesDefendant argues that Plaintiff’s counsels’ hourly rates are unreasonable in light of the non-complex nature of this case. In assessing the reasonableness of hourly billing rates,¿“the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees [citation], the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied [citations], and affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate determinations in other cases.”  (569 East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.¿(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437; see¿Mountjoy v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 272 [“a reasonable hourly rate is the product of a multiplicity of factors . . . [including] the level of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount to be obtained in the litigation, the attorney’s reputation, and the undesirability of the case”].)¿Here, Plaintiff’s counsel’s rates are as follows:Time Keeper Position  RateSepehr Daghighian Partner $625Sepehr Daghighian Partner $575Alastair Hamblin Associate Attorney $550Jim Martinez Associate Attorney $400Jim Martinez Associate Attorney $325Brian Murray Senior Associate $550Brian Murray Senior Associate $500Bill Oppenheim Associate Attorney $350Michael Rosenstein Partner $700Michael Rosenstein Partner $650Although six attorneys worked on this matter, the billing shows the bulk of the expenses were generated by Sepehr Daghighian, Jim Martinez, and Michael Rosenstein. Sepehr Daghighian, a partner and the attorney who spent the most time on this matter, testifies that he has over 18 years of experience in litigation with specialized experience in Song Beverly matters. (Daghighian Decl., ¶¶4-5.) Rosenstein, also a partner, has over 28 years of litigation experience. (Id., ¶8.) Each attorney on this matter increased their hourly rates by $50-$75 in 2023. (Id., ¶¶4-10.)The Court agrees that the hourly rates proposed by Plaintiff’s counsel are unreasonably high. Although Plaintiff’s counsel includes various minute orders from attorney’s fees motions in other matters from 2018 through 2020, Daghighian’s rate never exceeded $550. (Daghighian Decl., Exhs. C-O.) However, Defendant’s proposed reduction to $350 per hour is also unreasonable given Plaintiff’s counsel’s experience and expertise in Song Beverly cases. Accordingly, the Court adjusts Plaintiff’s counsels’ rates as follows:Timekeeper Position  RateSepehr Daghighian Partner $575Alastair Hamblin Associate Attorney $550Jim Martinez Associate Attorney $350Brian Murray Senior Associate $525Bill Oppenheim Associate Attorney $325Michael Rosenstein Partner $650Reasonableness of Hours BilledDefendant next argues Plaintiff’s counsel’s hours billed are not reasonable.A prevailing party’s verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred.  (Hadley v.¿Krepel¿(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.”  (Lunada¿Biomedical v. Nunez¿(2014) 240 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.) Block Billed Entries: Defendant argues some entries should be taxed because they were block billed. Defendant specifically points out two entries that were unreasonably block-billed. Although Defendant argues there were 30.4 hours of block-billed entries, Defendant failed to point out which entries it challenged. Therefore, the Court will consider the two entries Defendant included in its opposition.With respect to the September 27, 2023 entry, the billing entry states “Prepare for and take deposition of BMW Technical Support Engineer Jose Conde; Draft report regarding same; Draft letter to defense counsel to meet and confer regarding further discovery that remains outstanding.” Defendant argues that Conde’s deposition took three hours from 10am to 1pm. (Opp., p.13.) Plaintiff’s counsel sent the meet and confer letter to Defendant’s counsel shortly after at 1:27pm. (Id.) The Court agrees the time billed on this task is excessive because the remaining 3 hours billed would then be attributed to the drafting of an internal report. The Court will reduce this entry to 3.5 hours.Defendant next argues the entry dated December 13, 2023 is excessive because it is for trial preparation related to Conde, who had previously testified at deposition that he had no relevant involvement with Plaintiff or the subject vehicle. (Opp., p. 17.) Because Conde had already testified that he had no involvement with the vehicle, it is not reasonable that time would have been spent on trial preparation related to Conde. The Court will strike this time entry in its entirety. Template based work: Defendant argues the entries for drafting Plaintiff’s written discovery requests is excessive because Plaintiff’s counsel typically propounds identical discovery responses for Song Beverly cases. Defendant also alleges time spent on Motion in Limine No. 8 and on oppositions to Defendant’s motions in limine should be taxed because the time is inflated, and the time spent filling in minor details in templates should be lower.Although it is not disputed that Plaintiff’s counsel uses templates in their work, the use of templates alone does not mean tasks involving template-based work may not be billed. Plaintiffs’ counsel’s entries are each a little over or under an hour, meaning the time billed is minimal. Because templates are typically used to save time, the small amounts of time billed for these tasks are reasonable. With respect to the discovery requests, the Court agrees that the time spent on these discovery responses over an hour was excessive. The Court will tax time spent in excess of one hour from these entries.With respect to Motion in Limine No. 8, the time entries state Daghighian performed legal research into case law on excluding expert testimony from trial. (Daghighian Decl., pdf p. 27, 29.) An examination of the motion shows the bulk of the motion is not template work. Therefore, no time will be taxed from these entries.With respect to the oppositions to Defendant’s motions in limine, the Court agrees the oppositions consist primarily of template language. Time on these entries will be reduced to one hour total.Motion to Compel Further Discovery: Defendant also requests that the hours billed for Plaintiff’s motions to compel further discovery be taxed because Plaintiff was required to schedule an IDC before filing his motions and failed to. The Court agrees that it is unreasonable to hold Defendant responsible for Plaintiff’s improperly filed motions to compel further discovery. The filing fees for this motion will likewise be taxed in the amount of $157.34.Anticipated fees: Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ anticipated fees for this motion should be taxed because the time billed is excessive. The Court finds the 15 hours billed for this motion, reply, and hearing are excessive. The Court will award a total of 6 hours total for this motion. The total reductions are as follows:  Date Timekeeper Billed Reduced to Total ReductionSeptember 27, 2023 Daghighian 6.5  3.5  3December 13, 2023 Daghighian 4.7  0 4.7August 9, 2022 Martinez 1.8 1 0.8August 9, 2022 Martinez 1.6 1 0.6August 9, 2022 Martinez 1.4 1 0.4August 5, 2023 Martinez 4.6 0 4.6August 6, 2023 Martinez 4.2 0 4.2September 19, 2023 Daghighian 5.2 0 5.2November 14, 2023 Daghighian 1.9 0 1.9November 17, 2023 Daghighian 5.7 0 5.7November 22, 2023 Oppenheim 0.7 0 0.7November 27, 2023 Oppenheim 0.2 0 0.2November 27, 2023 Martinez (Motions in Limine) 5.3 1 4.3January 20, 2024-March 4, 2024 Daghighian 15 6 9The total time to be taxed is as follows:Daghighian: 29.5 hoursMartinez: 14.9Oppenheim: 0.9The final calculation of fees is as follows:Time Keeper Position  Quantity Rate TotalSepehr Daghighian Partner 137.1  $575 $78,832.50Alastair Hamblin Associate Attorney 3.7 $550 $2,035Jim Martinez Associate Attorney 73.1 $350 $25,585Brian Murray Senior Associate 0.5 $525 $262.50Bill Oppenheim Associate Attorney 0 0 0Michael Rosenstein Partner 3 $650 $1,950Total $108,665Lodestar MultiplierPlaintiff’s counsel seeks a multiplier of 2 on the grounds that they were exposed to risk in taking this matter on a contingency basis.After calculating the lodestar amount, the court may increase or decrease the amount “by applying a positive or negative ‘multiplier' to take into account a variety of other factors.” (Laffitte v. Robert Half Int'l Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 489). Those factors include, but are not  limited to:(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) success or failure, (4) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (5) the contingent nature of the fee award, (6) that an award against the state would ultimately fall upon the taxpayers, (7) that the attorneys in question received public and charitable funding for the purpose of bringing lawsuits of the character here involved, and (8) that the monies awarded would inure not to the individual benefit of the attorneys involved but the organizations by which they are employed. (Glaviano v. Sacramento City Unified Sch. Dist. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 744, 751). Such an approach “anchors the trial court's analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney's services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary.” (Id.). However, “a trial court should not consider these factors to the extent they are already encompassed within the lodestar.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138). “Although the attorney's fee agreement is relevant and may be considered, the agreement does not compel any particular award.” (Glaviano, 22 Cal.App.5th at 757). Based on all the factors to be considered, the Court does not find that a multiplier should be applied here given this was a routine case in which a settlement was reached approximately one year and seven months from the filing date. Relevant factors to determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1) the novelty and difficulty of the¿questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded¿other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.¿¿(Ketchum v. Moses¿(2001) 24 Cal.4th¿1122, 1132.) Based on the record, including Plaintiff’s motion,¿the Court finds that¿no multiplier is warranted.  This was routine case and there were not any novel or complex issues that were presented. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request¿for a lodestar multiplier is denied.  The court awards attorney fees and costs as follows:Attorney Fees$108,665Costs$35,212.01Total$143,877.01DATED: June 14, 2024 ________________________Hon.
