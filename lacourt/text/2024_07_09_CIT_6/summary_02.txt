And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiffs in a fraud action. The motion was granted, but the court found several issues with the motion that need to be addressed before the hearing. Specifically, the proposed order was incomplete and failed to include the correct courthouse address and the Post-Arbitration Status Conference date. The court also admonished the counsel to carefully proofread documents to ensure they are accurate. The motion was granted, and the counsel is ordered to resubmit a correct and complete proposed order prior to the hearing.
