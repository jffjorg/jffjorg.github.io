LEGAL
STANDARD
The Court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted,
provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the
orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all
parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362,
subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
Ben
Roberts of Law Office of Ben Roberts (Counsel) seeks to be relieved as counsel
for Plaintiffs Michael Rosas and Odalys Rosas. Counsel contends he and his firm
have lost all contact with Plaintiffs. (Roberts Decls., ¶ 2.) 
Grounds for permitting an attorney to withdraw from representation
include the client’s conduct that “renders it unreasonably difficult for the
lawyer to carry out the representation effectively[.]” (Cal. Rules of
Professional Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).) A breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship is also grounds for allowing the attorney to
withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) While
the Court finds Plaintiffs’ lack of communication sufficient grounds for
permitting withdrawal, the Court finds a few issues with Counsel’s motions that
need to be fixed. 
First, each of the Judicial Council forms Counsel filed with the
Court show that Counsel provided the wrong courthouse contact information in
the caption of each document. Counsel provided the following contact
information: 1427 West Covina Parkway, Compton, CA 90220. The correct
courthouse address is 1427 West Covina Parkway, West Covina, CA 91790. Nevertheless,
the proof of service filed on June 13, 2024, lists the correct courthouse
address and the declaration provides the correct courthouse address for the
Post-Arbitration Status Conference. The Court will not deny the motion on this
ground but admonishes Counsel to carefully proofread documents to ensure they
are accurate. 
Second, the proposed order does not include the Post-Arbitration
Status Conference scheduled for July 30, 2024. On May 13, 2024, the Court’s
minute order provided the new date. The motions to be relieved as counsel were
filed on June 13, 2024, therefore, counsel was aware of the new date but failed
to include it in the proposed order. The proposed order is also incomplete in
that items 3, 5, 6, 9 and as previously discussed, item 7, have not been
completed. 
Notwithstanding, the Court GRANTS the motion. Plaintiff must
resubmit a correct and complete proposed order prior to the hearing, addressing
the items discussed above, including the correct courthouse address in the
caption and noting that the order is effective upon the filing of the proof of
service of the signed order (Item 5.a.). 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS the motion. Plaintiffs’ Counsel must resubmit a correct
and complete proposed order prior to the hearing, addressing the items
discussed above, including the correct courthouse address in the caption and noting
that the order is effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the
signed order (Item 5.a.). 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of
service of same within five calendar days.
