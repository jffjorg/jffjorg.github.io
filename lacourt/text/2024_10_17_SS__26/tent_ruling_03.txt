ANALYSIS:
 
On March 13, 2024, Defendant Budget Truck Rental, LLC
(“Defendant”) served Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff
Robert Hawes (“Plaintiff”). (Motion, Bergerson Decl.,
Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort, Plaintiff has not served responses
to the discovery. (Id. at ¶¶5-7 and Exh. B.) Defendant filed the instant
Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and
Request for Sanctions, on September 6, 2024. Plaintiff’s counsel filed
opposition declarations on October 7, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Based on Plaintiff’s failure to serve initial responses to
the discovery, the Motion to Compel Responses to the Request for Production of
Documents, is granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) There is no requirement
for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to compel initial responses
can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought
at any time after the responding party fails to provide the responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Therefore,
Defendant is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff to serve verified
responses to the requests, without objections.
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for a
simple and unopposed motion to compel initial responses. Pursuant to a lodestar
calculation, sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $230.00
based on one hour of attorney time billed at $230.00 per hour. (Motion, Bergerman Decl.,
¶9.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Budget Truck Rental, LLC’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions, is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF ROBERT
HAWES IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS, WITHOUT
OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF IS ORDERED TO PAY
SANCTIONS OF $230.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
