And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by Defendants Eugenia Souza and Jermaine Souza is overruled. The judge has also ordered the defendants to file and serve answers to the complaint within 20 days of the order. The judge has not ruled on the merits of the demurrer, but rather has determined that the complaint states sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The judge has also rejected the defendants' arguments that the complaint is uncertain, lacks specificity, and is barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.
