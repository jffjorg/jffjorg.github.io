And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by the defendants (25 Art, L.P. and Frederick Leeds) to compel the attendance of Oliver Leon at a deposition. The defendants had served Leon with a subpoena on February 4, 2024, but he failed to appear at the scheduled deposition on March 6, 2024. The judge finds that Leon was properly served with the subpoena and that the defendants made a good faith effort to contact him and resolve the issue. As a result, the judge is granting the motion to compel Leon's attendance at a deposition within 30 days. The judge is also granting sanctions in the amount of $1790.55 to the defendants for the two hours of work they spent on the motion and for the non-appearance fee and cost of filing.
