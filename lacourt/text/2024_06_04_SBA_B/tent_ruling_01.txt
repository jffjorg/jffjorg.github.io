Hearing
Date:                          June 4, 2024
Moving
Parties:                      Plaintiff Onyi Ko
Responding
Party:                  Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC
Motion
for Reconsideration
            The Court considered the moving papers.  The Court exercises its discretion and also
considered the untimely filed opposition.
RULING
            The motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
BACKGROUND
            On November 21, 2023, plaintiff Onyi
Ko filed a complaint against Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC and Envision WC MB Auto,
LLC dba Mercedes-Benz of West Covina for violations of Song Beverly Act and
negligent repair.
            On April 24, 2024, the Court denied
plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses or production of documents as to
Nos. 1, 3, 7, 11, 18, 19, 21, and 31. 
Defendant was ordered to produce a privilege log, which Plaintiff
indicates is due June 6, 2024.  The
motion was denied without prejudice as to No. 30, until after the trier of fact
has returned a verdict favorable to plaintiff in phase one.
PLAINTIFF’S
BELIEF
            Plaintiff points out in its moving
papers that:
“The operative Complaint in this
action was filed on November 11, 2023. The Court has set a trial date in
this matter for July 14, 2025, with a Final Status Conference set
for June 26, 2025. (LAS Decl., ¶ 7.)” 
(Plaintiff’s Memo of P&A, pg. 4:16-18.)(Bold and underlining added.)

 
“The Motion to Compel was filed
March 27, 2024 (LAS Decl., ¶ 10.)
The Court denied the Motion to
Compel on April 24, 2024, and gave MBUSA twenty (20) calendar days from the
date of the hearing to provide Plaintiff with a privilege log, or by June 6,
2024. (LAS Decl., ¶ 11.)
Any discovery must be completed by
the statutory “cut-off” date of June 14, 2024, or a mere eight
(8) days after the deadline for the production of the privilege log. C.C.P. § 2024.020.
(LAS Decl., ¶ 12.)
Based on the foregoing, it will
be impossible for Plaintiff to meaningfully challenge or conduct further
discovery prior to the trial in this action. (LAS Decl., ¶ 13.)” (Plaintiff’s
Memo of P&A, pg. 4:25-5:5.)(Bold and underlining added.) 
Plaintiff’s
analysis of the timeline is off by one full year.
 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Under CCP §1008(a), “When an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.  The party making the application
shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what
judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” 
Further, “the party seeking
reconsideration must provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory
explanation for the failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time.”  Glade v. Glade (1995) 38 Cal. App. 4th
1441, 1457.  A motion for reconsideration
was properly denied where based on evidence that could have been presented in
connection with the original motion.  Morris
v. AGFA Corp. (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1452, 1460.  The burden under §1008 “is comparable to that
of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the
information must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence,
have discovered or produced it at the trial.” 
New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal. App. 4th
206, 212-213.
As stated by the court in Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.
App. 4th 1494, CCP §1008 governs reconsideration of court orders whether
initiated by a party or the court itself. 
“It is the exclusive means for modifying, amending or revoking an order.  That limitation is expressly
jurisdictional.”  Id. at 1499.    
CCP §128(a) states, “Every court
shall have the power to do all of the following: . . . (8) To amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. . . .”
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
requests that the Court reconsider its April 24, 2024 order denying plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to plaintiff’s request for production of
documents, set one, to allow plaintiff the opportunity to challenge any item
presented on the privilege log and to conduct meaningful discovery prior to the
statutory discovery completion date.
            As
stated above, on April 24, 2024, the Court denied plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses
or production of documents as to Nos. 1, 3, 7, 11, 18, 19, 21, and 31.  Defendant was ordered to produce a privilege
log.  The motion was denied without
prejudice as to No. 30, until after the trier of fact has returned a verdict
favorable to plaintiff in phase one.
            Plaintiff argues that she has met
her burden of showing new or different facts, circumstances or law.  As to “new facts,” plaintiff contends that
she will suffer irreparable harm from the order denying her meaningful
discovery.  As to “new case law,” she
cites to cases “not previously entertained in the original ruling.”
Plaintiff contends that as to No.
30 (customer complaints regarding vehicles with similar defects), such
information is relevant to not only plaintiff’s claim for civil penalties but
to establish liability under the Song-Beverly Act—including the existence of a
defect or issue not in conformity with warranties and defendant’s willful
failure to offer repurchase regarding “a known defect and one without a proven
fix” and to rebut defendant’s allegation that such problems were the result of
plaintiff’s supposed wrongdoing.
            Plaintiff further contends that the
Court did not rule on plaintiff’s objections to Nicholas Cinquepalmi’s
declaration as he was not the individual who reviewed or verified defendant’s
responses.  Plaintiff also argues that as
to defendant’s failure to provide a privilege log, “it is impossible for MBUSA
to have met its burden in justifying any objections.”  Moreover, plaintiff asserts, the order did
not provide any provision extending plaintiff any ability to challenge any item
on the privilege log and to conduct further discovery, as all statutory
deadlines have passed.
            In opposition, defendant argues that
the motion is procedurally improper as plaintiff has failed to show by
affidavit any new facts or law that was “previously unavailable” and that
plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration is conclusory.  As to “new law,” defendant asserts that
plaintiff cites to cases dating from 1962 and 1979 and does not explain why the
cases were not presented at the original hearing and also reargues cases made
in her original motion.
            The
Court finds that plaintiff has not met her burden under CCP §1008 as she has
not presented new or different facts, circumstances, or law.
            The
motion is thus DENIED.
ORDER
            The
motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
            Defendant
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
