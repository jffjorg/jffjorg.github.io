And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer to the complaint and the motion to strike. The court has ruled that the demurrer is overruled as to the fifth cause of action for fraudulent concealment. The court has also denied the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The defendant is ordered to file an answer within twenty days. The court has also ordered the plaintiff to make a notation in its time keeping records that the time devoted to addressing the demurrer that attacked the claim for fraudulent concealment must be noted for purposes of any future request for attorneys fees.
