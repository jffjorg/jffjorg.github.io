And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a dispute between petitioners and respondents regarding the scope of an agreement and the release of claims. The dispute arises from the execution of an agreement and the appointment of a receiver to manage assets. The court will not consider unpublished decisions and will only consider the literal terminology of the contract. The court will also not consider the intentions of the parties in this phase of the trial. The court finds that the agreement is susceptible to an interpretation that it releases all claims, but notes that this does not mean that the parties did not sign in their capacities. The court will need to hear further evidence at trial to determine whether petitioners were aware of potential claims against Thomas related to the 2011 will and trust. The court will also need to consider whether the agreement modifies the provisions of the agreement and whether the recitals to the agreement evidence the limited scope of the agreement.
