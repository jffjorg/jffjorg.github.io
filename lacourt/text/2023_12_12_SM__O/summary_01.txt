And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the cross-defendants, Roman James Design Build, Inc. and Roman James, on their demurrer to the cross-complaint. The judge has also granted their motion to strike. The demurrer was sustained because the same cause of action is pending between the same parties in a separate case (23SMCV02873). The judge has also granted the cross-defendants' request for judicial notice of the existence of certain documents, but not to their contents. The prosecution of the cross-complaint is stayed pending the dismissal or adjudication of the prior action (23SMCV02873).
