And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to vacate the appointment of an accounting referee. The plaintiff, Ebby Shakib, argues that Judge Mackenzie was not the assigned judge when she granted the motion to appoint an accounting referee, and therefore, the appointment is void. However, the court disagrees with the plaintiff's argument and finds that Judge Mackenzie's order is not void. The court notes that a court that "acts contrary to its authority" may lack jurisdiction, but such acts do not render the court's ensuing judgment or order void. The court also finds that the motion to appoint an accounting referee had merit and would order one to be appointed again for the same reasons found by Judge Mackenzie. The parties may submit a stipulation and proposed order to clarify the purpose and scope of the accounting.
