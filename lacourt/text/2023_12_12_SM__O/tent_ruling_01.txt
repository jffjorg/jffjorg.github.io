RULING
            Cross-Defendants
Roman James Design Build, Inc. and Roman James’ Demurrer under CCP §430.10
subdivision (c) (“[a]nother action pending between the same parties on the same
cause of action) to the Cross-Complaint is SUSTAINED. Cross-Defendants Roman
James Design Build, Inc. and Roman James’ Motion to Strike is GRANTED. 
 
            Cross-Defendants
Roman James Design Build, Inc, et al.’s RJN is GRANTED as to the existence of
the documents only, but not to the truth of the documents’ contents. (See In

            On June 21,
2023, Royal Excell filed a complaint in case no. 23SMCV02873 against the Roman
James defendants for: (1) breach of contract, (2) equitable indemnity, (3)
implied contractual indemnity, and (4) fraud. A month later, on July 21, 2023,
Royal Excell filed a cross-complaint in this action against the same Royal
James defendants for: (1) Equitable Indemnity, and (2) Implied contractual
indemnity. The facts alleged in support of Royal Excell’s two identical claims
for indemnity in the prior action are identical to the facts alleged in support
of the two claims for indemnity asserted against the Royal James defendants in
this action.  No other claims are
asserted against the Royal James defendants in this action.  
 
            The prosecution
of Royal Excell’s cross-complaint against the Roman James defendants is stayed
pending the dismissal or adjudication of Roman James in the prior action: ROYAL
EXCEL ENTERPRISES CORP. & 521 N. CANNON DR. LLC v. ROMAN JAMES, et.al.,
Case No. 23SMCV02873.
