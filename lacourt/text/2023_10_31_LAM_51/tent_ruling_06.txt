[1]
According to the Petition, Respondent issued the $200,000 payment on August 1,
2023.
 


[2]
Petitioner seeks $48,362.22 in costs.
 


[3]
Respondent did not oppose confirmation of the Arbitration Award itself.


[4]
As to the experts in particular, Petitioner highlights that the Aarbitrator
heavily relied on expert testimony in issuing the award, that the experts
reviewed thousands of pages of medical records as well as deposition
transcripts of Respondent’s experts, and otherwise prepared for arbitration.
 


[5]
Petitioner notes that she incurred $4,193.06 in arbitration fees associated
with preparing the arbitration award (Exhibit C has a receipt for $4,750.00,
not $4,193.06), $434.20 in credit card fees (confirmed in Exhibit C), and
$1,900 associated with Respondent’s motion to reschedule the arbitration
(confirmed in Exhibit C). 
 


[6]
In particular, Respondent challenges the amount of time some of Petitioners
experts spent preparing for the instant arbitration because there was a prior
arbitration that, Respondent claims, these experts should have already been
familiar with Petitioner’s injuries. 
 


[7]
However, the first bill for $16,700.00 indicates it was incurred on October 21,
2022, due on December 20, 2022, and paid on January 20, 2023. Petitioner cites Storm v. Standard Fire Insurance Company
(2020) 52 Cal.App.5th 636 to support her position that she may recoup her
portion of the arbitration fee. Storm
does not say when the petitioner there paid their portion of the arbitration
fee compared to when they served their 998 offer. Instead, the court in Storm focused on whether the petitioner
could recover her arbitration fees at all. Still, because Respondent did not
oppose the arbitration fees on this ground, the court will not do so either.
 


[8]
Petitioner’s request as to Dr. Tagliati is missing $3,200.00 of supporting
invoice. This accounts for 4 hours of work billed at Dr. Tagliati’s $800 rate.
