STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On May 10, 2023, Arbitrator Constance Ellen Bouidis (the
Arbitrator) with FINRA Dispute Resolution Services issued an Arbitration Award
in favor of Petitioner Jordan Varela (Petitioner) and against Respondent Wells
Fargo Advisors Financial Network (WFAN). The Award requires the expungement of
all references to Occurrence Number 2094046 from the registration records
maintained by the CRD for Petitioner. The CRD is a database maintained by FINRA
for firms and individuals that participate in the U.S. securities industry.
 
Petitioner filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award on August 16, 2023. FINRA waived its requirement under FINRA Rule 2080 to
be named as a party and to receive notice of this Petition. (Donovan Decl.,
Exhibit A.) WFAN did not file an opposition.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., (CCP) § 1285.) “If a petition or
response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm
the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in
accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as
corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (CCP § 1286.)
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Filing Requirements of a Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award (CCP § 1285.4) 
 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states: “A petition under this chapter shall: 
 
a.                  
Set forth the substance of or
have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies
the existence of such an agreement. 
 
b.                 
Set forth the names of the
arbitrators. 
 
(c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” 
 
(CCP § 1285.4 (emphasis added).) 
 
Here, Petitioner attached a copy
of the FINRA Arbitration Submission Agreemen . (Declaration of Donovan, Exhibit
B.) Petitioner also identified the arbitrator. (Declaration of Donovan, Exhibit
C.) 
 
Therefore, the requirements under
CCP § 1285.4 have been met.
 
Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing (CCP §
1290.4) 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 states in pertinent
part:  
 
(a) A copy
of the petition and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing
thereof and any other papers upon which the petition is based shall be served
in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such
petition and notice. 
 
(b) If the
arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service shall
be made and the person upon whom service is to be made has not previously
appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been served in accordance
with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State shall be made in the
manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action. 
 
(CCP § 1290.4.) 
 
Here, Petitioner filed a proof of service indicating
service on WFAN on August 17, 2023 via U.S. Mail, which was acknowledged by
EFAN on August 21, 2023. FINRA is not a party to this petition and
waived its requirement to be named as a party. (Declaration of Donovan, Exhibit
A.)
 
Therefore, the requirements of CCP § 1290.4 have been
met.  
 
Service of the Arbitration Award (CCP § 1283.6) 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1283.6 provides that: “The neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration
personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided in the
agreement.”¿This requirement may be satisfied by service by the arbitrator or
upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d
796, 799-800.) 
 
The Court finds Code of Civil
Procedure section 1283.6 is satisfied.  
 
Timing of Service of Petition (CCP §§ 1288, 1288.4) 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿  
A party may seek a court judgment
confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no more than
four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award is served. (CCP §§ 1288, 1288.4.) 
 
Petitioner filed the instant
petition approximately 3 months after service of the Award, making it timely
under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and 1288.4.  
 
Merits of the
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award  
 
The court must confirm the award as made, unless it
corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) 
 
Petitioner has demonstrated that on May 10, 2023, the
arbitrator issued an Arbitration Award in its favor and against Respondent to
expunge a customer complaint, Occurrence Number 2094046, from his CRD
record. Furthermore, as the Petition is unopposed,
there is no basis to find the Award should not be confirmed.  
 
Request for Costs 
 
To the extent Petitioner requests costs according to proof
(Pet., Prayer at ¶3), those are permitted on a petition to confirm arbitration
award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1293.2; MBNA
America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006) 147 Cal.App.4th.Supp. 1, 7.) Petitioner
may file a memorandum of costs pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1700. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      The
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
