And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition to confirm an arbitration award and to recoup arbitration fees. The award was issued on August 1, 2023, and the respondent did not oppose its confirmation. The petitioner seeks $48,362.22 in costs, including $4,193.06 in arbitration fees, $434.20 in credit card fees, and $1,900 associated with the respondent's motion to reschedule the arbitration. The respondent challenges the amount of time some of the petitioner's experts spent preparing for the arbitration, but the judge finds that the petitioner may recoup her portion of the arbitration fee based on the case of Storm v. Standard Fire Insurance Company (2020) 52 Cal.App.5th 636. The judge also notes that one of the petitioner's experts, Dr. Tagliati, is missing $3,200.00 of supporting invoice, which accounts for 4 hours of work billed at Dr. Tagliati's rate of $800 per hour.
