Here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the dispute between the plaintiff and defendants. The plaintiff has argued that Mr. Healy, the custodian of employee records, cannot authenticate the plaintiff's signature. However, the court disagrees and finds that Mr. Healy has been the custodian of employee records for the past 10 years.

The plaintiff has also argued that the defendants have a heightened showing to authenticate the plaintiff's signature, citing authority that pertains to electronic signatures, not physical signatures. The court rejects this argument, finding that the authority cited is inapplicable to physical signatures.

The plaintiff has included a footnote arguing that claims for sexual harassment should be excluded from arbitration, citing the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2022. However, the defendants contend that the act does not apply retroactively, and the plaintiff has not further developed this argument in her opposition, which the court interprets as conceding.

The court also agrees with the defendants that the plaintiff has not shown that their motion to compel is "unreasonable", as the plaintiff has not claimed to expend resources that would have been saved by arbitrating the dispute instead.

The plaintiff has also argued that the MAP is substantively unconscionable because the defendants did not sign it, but the court finds that this argument is misplaced.

The court concludes that failure to attach the AAA Rules standing alone is insufficient to find procedural unconscionability, and that the plaintiff has not challenged any particular aspect of the AAA Rules as limiting her discovery rights.
