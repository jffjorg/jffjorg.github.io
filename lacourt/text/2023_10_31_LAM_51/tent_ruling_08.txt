The first is a commercial property located at 8440 South Broadway, Los Angeles, California 90003 (the Broadway Property). The second property is a commercial property located at 1308 S. Van Ness Ave., Los Angeles, California 90019 (the Van Ness Property). Plaintiff and Defendant Kim married on December 28, 2012 in a confidential marriage. (FAC ¶ 21.) Plaintiff alleges capacity issues due to extended opoid use and dementia. (FAC ¶¶ 23-29, 35.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Kim forged a deed purporting to transfer the Broadway Property from Plaintiff’s separate property to their community property and then solely to herself. (FAC ¶¶ 30, 35(h), 35(m).)  Plaintiff alleges that all defendants intended to purchase the Van Ness Property through their ownership of the Broadway Property. (FAC ¶ 39.) Plaintiff also alleges a series of notary fraud. Plaintiff timely filed an opposition on October 16, 2023. Defendant Kim did not file a reply. LEGAL STANDARD: Request for Judicial Notice The court grants Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice as to Exhibits 62, 6 3, 64, 65, 66, 67, and 68. (Evid. Code § 452(d), (h); See Kalnoki v. First American Trustee Servicing Solutions, LLC (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 23,37.) However, the court only takes judicial notice of the foregoing documents only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of public records and other specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)¿  Evidentiary Objections This court is unaware of any legal authority which requires a court to rule on evidentiary objections on a motion, except as to a motion for summary motion/adjudication [Cal. Code Civ. Proc. (CCP) § 437c (q)] or a special motion to strike [CCP § 425.16 (b)(2); see also, Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019) 6 Cal.5th 931, 947-949.]  As such, this Court respectfully declines to rule on any of these objections.  This court is well aware of the rules of evidence, and to how much weight, if any, should be given to any of the proposed evidence. Expunge Lis Pendens “[A] lis pendens is a recorded document giving constructive notice that an action has been filed affecting title or right to possession of the real property described in the notice.” (BGJ Associates, LLC v. Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 952, 966.) “Its effect is that anyone acquiring an interest in the property after the action was filed will be bound by the judgment.” (Ibid.) “Once a lis pendens is filed, it clouds the title and effectively prevents the property’s transfer until the litigation is resolved or the lis pendens is expunged.” (Id. at p. 967.)  Under CCP § 405.30, at any time after a notice of pendency of action has been recorded, any party with an interest in the real property may apply to the Court to expunge the notice. A Lis Pendens may be expunged either under CCP § 405.31 if the pleadings do not contain a real property claim; or under CCP § 405.32 if the Court finds that the party claiming the Lis Pendens has not established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim. Under CCP § 405.30, the party claiming the Lis Pendens has the burden of proof under sections 405.31 and 405.32. The party claiming the Lis Pendens has the burden of demonstrating that their pleadings contain a real property claim and that the probable validity of their real property claim can be established by a preponderance of the evidence.   A motion for expungement may be based on the ground that the “pleading on which the notice is based does not contain a real property claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.31.) It may also be based on the ground that “the claimant has not established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.32.)   ANALYSIS: Standing Plaintiff argues that Defendant Kim has no standing because she is no longer on the title for the Broadway Property or the Van Ness Property. Defendant Kim does not raise this issue in her moving papers and has not filed a reply. As a threshold matter, the court notes that Plaintiff attached a grant deed entered on February 17, 2021 showing the Van Ness Property transferred from Kwon Wook Cook and Yun Ja Kim to Soo Kyung Lee. (Kim Decl., ¶8, Exhibit E; Opposition, Exhibit 19.) Defendant Kim, therefore, does not have an interest in the Van Ness Property at the time she filed the instant motion. Accordingly, the court DENIES Defendant Kim’s Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens.  CONCLUSION:             For the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 1.      Motion to expunge lis pendens is DENIED.2.      Motion to award attorney’s fees is DENIED. Moving party is to give notice. IT IS SO ORDERED. Dated:             October 31, 2023                    __________________________________                                                                                                                Upinder S.
