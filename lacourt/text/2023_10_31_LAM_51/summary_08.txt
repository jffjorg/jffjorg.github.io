  - "The party claiming the lis pendens has the burden of demonstrating that their pleadings contain a real property claim and that the probable validity of their real property claim can be established by a preponderance of the evidence."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to expunge the lis pendens notice filed in connection with a lawsuit involving two commercial properties. The defendant, Yu Ja Kim, had argued that she had no standing to bring the motion because she was no longer on the title for the properties, but the judge found that this argument was not raised in her moving papers and was not addressed in her reply. The judge also denied the defendant's request for attorney's fees and expenses. The case is ongoing, and the judge has ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling.
