(Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Defendants Fred Panahi, Kamelia
Jalilvand, and Jalilvand Law Corporation with ten causes of action for:1.      Intentional
Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage;2.      Negligent
Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage;3.      Fraud;4.      Conversion;5.      Breach
of Written Contract;6.      Unjust
Enrichment;7.      Declaratory
Relief;8.      Accounting;9.      Constructive
Trust;10.  Money
Had and Received.Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Panahi retained their
office to represent him in a personal injury matter on a contingency fee basis.
Plaintiff alleges that they were entitled to one-third of the gross amount
recovered from any source in connection with the claim or, if Defendant Panahi
terminated their services, to pay the value of their services from any recovery
in connection with the claim. Defendant Panahi terminated Plaintiff’s
representation and retained Defendants Jalilvand and Jalilvand Law Corporation.
Plaintiff alleges to have informed Jalilvand Defendants of their attorney lien.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants refused to confirm the true settlement
amount, refused to share the settlement agreement, and refused to honor the
attorney lien.  On December 17, 2020, Defendants Kamelia Jalilvand and
Jalilvand Law Corporation (Moving Defendants) filed a Special Motion to Strike
under CCP § 425.16. Plaintiff opposed this motion.  On January 29, 2021, the court denied the Special Motion to
Strike as to the Seventh Cause of Action for Declaratory Relief and granted the
Special Motion to Strike as to the remaining causes of action. Moving
Defendants appealed, seeking to strike the Seventh Cause of Action, too. On June 15, 2023, the Court of Appeal issued a remittitur
which affirmed the trial court’s ruling on the Special Motion to Strike.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. Moving Defendants
have not filed a reply. LEGAL STANDARD:  Meet and Confer Prior to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required
to satisfy their meet and confer obligations pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc.
(CCP) §430.41 and demonstrate that they so satisfied their meet and confer
obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant to CCP §430.41(a)(2) & (3). The meet and
confer requirement also applies to motions to strike. (CCP § 435.5.)  After reviewing the
Declaration of Payam Mahram, the parties did not meet and confer. (Mahram
Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.) Still, failure to meet and confer is not a sufficient ground
to overrule or sustain a demurrer. (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).) Demurrer A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether
the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a
cause of action.” (Hahn 147
Cal.App.4th at 747.) Motion to Strike  The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper
matter inserted in any pleading. (CCP § 436(a).) The court may also strike all
or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the
face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id.¿§¿437.)¿“When the defect which justifies striking a complaint
is capable of cure, the court should allow leave to amend.” (Vaccaro v. Kaiman¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th
761, 768.)  ANALYSIS:  Declaratory Relief A plaintiff’s declaratory relief
complaint must specifically allege that an actual, present controversy exists,
and must state the facts of the respective claims concerning the disputed
subject matter. (City of Cotati v.
Cashman (2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 79; Connerly
v. Schwarzenegger (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 739, 746 (Connerly).) A sufficient complaint: (1) sets forth facts showing
the existence of an actual controversy relating to the parties’ legal rights
and duties, and (2) requests the court to adjudge these rights and duties. (Ludgate Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.
(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 606; Qualified
Patients Ass’n v. City of Anaheim (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 734, 751; see also
Travers v. Louden (1967)
254.Cal.App.2d 926, 931-32 (Travers)
[commenting that declaratory relief may be appropriate for parties with a
continuing relationship].) A declaratory relief claim should not be used to
determine issues that are already engaged by other causes of action. (Hood v. Superior Court (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 319, 324.) Standing Moving Defendants contend that Plaintiff lacks standing to
sue until concluding their independent action against their former client to
establish the validity of the lien (Mojtahedi
v. Vargas (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 974 (Mojtahedi).)
Plaintiff did not file an opposition. Failure to establish standing is a separate ground for
demurrer based on a failure to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) “It is well established that after the client
obtains a judgment, the attorney must bring a separate, independent action
against the client to establish the existence of the lien, to determine the
amount of the lien, and to enforce it.” (Mojtahedi,
supra, at p. 977-98.) (internal
quotations omitted.) Like Mojtahedi,
where the plaintiff failed to allege facts establishing that he adjudicated the
existence, value, or enforceability of his lien, here, Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant Panahi “signed a contingency fee agreement . . . promising to pay
thirty three and one-third of all gross amounts recovered from any source in
connection with the claim” or “the value of Plaintiff’s services out of any
recovery . . . received” if Defendant Panahi terminated Plaintiff’s services.
(Compl. ¶ 9.) This does not allege that Plaintiff has already adjudicated the
existence, value, or enforceability of his lien. Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Moving Defendants’
demurrer with leave to amend.[1] Motion to Strike Because the court sustained the demurrer, the motion to
strike is OVERRULED as moot. CONCLUSION:             For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows:  1.      Demurrer
as to the Seventh Cause of Action for Declaratory Relief is SUSTAINED with 20
days leave to amend.2.      Motion
to Strike is OVERRULED as moot. Moving party is to give notice.  IT IS SO ORDERED.  Dated:             October
31, 2023                    __________________________________                                                                                                                Upinder
