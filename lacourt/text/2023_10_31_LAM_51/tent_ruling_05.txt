STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On July 7, 2023, the Arbitrator Hon. Richard Stone (Ret.)
(Arbitrator) issued an award in favor of Petitioner Daniela Saspe (Petitioner)
and against Respondent Crestbrook Insurance Co. (Respondent) in the amount of
$200,000.[1]
Petitioner simultaneously filed a Motion for Costs pursuant to CCP § 998.[2]
The parties entered into a written arbitration agreement on or about November
2018. Petitioner sought UIM policy limits payment from Respondent and a dispute
arose as to the amount of damages. The arbitration hearing was on May 11, 2023.

 
Petitioner filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award on August 4, 2023. On August 7, 2023, Petitioner filed Notice of Petition
and Petition to Confirm Award of Arbitration with supporting declaration and
exhibits. Respondent timely filed an opposition to Petitioner’s motion to award
costs only on October 19, 2023.[3]
Petitioner timely filed a reply in support of the motion to award costs on
October 23, 2023.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., (CCP) § 1285.) “If a petition or
response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm
the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in
accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as
corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (CCP § 1286.)
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Filing Requirements of a Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award (CCP § 1285.4) 
 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states: “A petition under this chapter shall: 
 
a.                  
Set forth the substance of or
have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies
the existence of such an agreement. 
 
b.                 
Set forth the names of the
arbitrators. 
 
(c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” 
 
(CCP § 1285.4 (emphasis added).) 
 
Here, Petitioner set forth the
terms of the Arbitration Agreement in the Petition and to her declaration in
support of the Petition and Motion for Costs.  (Petition p. 4:8-24; Saspe Decl., Exhibit G.) Petitioner
also identified the arbitrator. (Petition p. 3:4.) 
 
Therefore, the requirements under
CCP § 1285.4 have been met.
 
Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing (CCP §
1290.4) 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 states in pertinent
part:  
 
(a) A copy
of the petition and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing
thereof and any other papers upon which the petition is based shall be served
in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such
petition and notice. 
 
(b) If the
arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service shall
be made and the person upon whom service is to be made has not previously
appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been served in accordance
with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this State shall be made in the
manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action. 
 
(CCP § 1290.4.) 
 
Here, Petitioner attached proof of service to her petition
that indicates service via e-mail to counsel for Respondent on August 4, 2023. Although
there is no indication that the arbitration agreement allows service via e-mail
because the quoted portion of the agreement does not say so, Respondent appears
to have accepted service via e-mail because it timely filed an opposition to
the motion for costs and has not argued insufficient service.
 
Therefore, the requirements of CCP § 1290.4 have been met.  
 
Service of the Arbitration Award (CCP § 1283.6) 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
1283.6 provides that: “The neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration
personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided in the
agreement.”¿This requirement may be satisfied by service by the arbitrator or
upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d
796, 799-800.) 
 
The Court finds Code of Civil
Procedure section 1283.6 is satisfied.  
 
Timing of Service of Petition (CCP §§ 1288, 1288.4) 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿  
A party may seek a court judgment
confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no more than
four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award is served. (CCP §§ 1288, 1288.4.) 
 
Petitioner filed the instant
petition approximately 1 month after service of the Award, making it timely
under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and 1288.4.  
 
Merits of the
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award  
 
The court must confirm the award as made, unless it corrects
or vacates the award, or dismisses the proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) 
 
Petitioner has demonstrated that on July 7, 2023, the
arbitrator issued an Arbitration Award in her favor and against Respondent in
the amount of $200,000.00. 
 
Request for Costs 
 
Petitioner served a CCP § 998 Offer to Compromise to
Respondent’s counsel on March 14, 2023 in the amount of $99,999.00. (Theriault
Decl., Exhibit B.) Respondent did not accept Petitioner’s offer. (Theriault
Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4.) Petitioner contends that her offer was reasonable and, because
she is the prevailing party and obtained an award of $200,000, that she is
entitled to costs.[4] Petitioner claims the following costs:
·        
Arbitration
Fees: $23,784.20[5]
·        
Expert
Deposition Expenses: $2,293.06
·        
Expert Witness
Fees: $21,660.00
·        
Exhibits:
$553.66
·        
Postage: $35.30
·        
TOTAL:
$48,236.22
 
Respondent opposes portions of Petitioner’s cost memorandum
as excessive. First, Respondent notes that the parties agreed to split the
arbitration fees equally and so Petitioner’s bill should be the same as their
bill. Second, Respondent contends that Petitioner’s expert witness fees are
unreasonable and unexpected and are not supported by the facts and evidence.[6]  
 
A Petitioner may request costs on a petition to confirm
arbitration award. (CCP § 1293.2; MBNA
America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006) 147 Cal.App.4th.Supp. 1, 7.) “If an
offer made by a plaintiff is not accepted and the defendant fails to obtain a
more favorable judgment or award in any action or proceeding other than an
eminent domain action, the court or arbitrator, in its discretion, may require
the defendant to pay a reasonable sum to cover postoffer costs of the services
of expert witnesses, who are not regular employees of any party, actually
incurred and reasonably necessary in either, or both, preparation for trial or
arbitration, or during trial or arbitration, of the case by the plaintiff, in
addition to plaintiff's costs.” (CCP § 998(d).) 
 
Arbitration Costs
 
The court agrees
with Petitioner that the arbitration costs, as indicated by the receipts
provided with the moving papers, reflect the cost Petitioner requests.[7]

 
Accordingly, the
court will not reduce the fee request.
 
Expert Costs
 
Upon reviewing the evidence provided in support of the cost
request, the court agrees with Petitioner that the request for expert fees are
reasonable and expected. First, Dr. Tagliati’s fees are reasonable because, as
Petitioner indicates, the hourly rate comports with Dr. Tagliati’s unique
expertise in his field, the Arbitrator heavily relied on his opinion in issuing
the award, and Dr. Tagliati’s review of extensive records to prepare his
opinion and for testimony.[8]
(Exhibit G, CV; Exhibit A, Arbitration Award; Exhibit C Invoice Nos. 001, 002.)
Respondent’s contention that Dr. Tagliati’s testified for a limited amount of
time fails to acknowledge the hours of preparation for that hearing. As to Dr.
Rashtian, the court disagrees with Respondent that the bills reflect excessive
time. Indeed, the bills reflect Dr. Rashtian spend 0.35 hours reviewing neuro
records and also communicating with Petitioner and spent 0.8 hours preparing
for the instant arbitration. (Exhibit C, Invoice Nos. 455, 466.) Otherwise, the
bills reflect work pertaining only to this arbitration. (Ibid.) 
 
Accordingly, reduces the fee request by $3,200.00 for a
total of $18,460 in expert witness fees.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      The
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
2.      Motion
to Award Costs is GRANTED in the amount of $45,036.22.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
