And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Carolyn Johnson. The plaintiff is a schoolteacher who underwent brain surgery in 2021 and requires accommodation. She requested continued remote work, but was denied by LAUSD.

The judge sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the first and second causes of action, which are for discrimination and failure to prevent discrimination, respectively. The judge found that the complaint lacks sufficient evidence of an adverse employment action and failed to articulate separate and distinct claims based on a common core of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate allegations.

The judge overruled the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action, which is for failure to engage in good faith interactive process. The judge found that the complaint adequately alleges the process leading to the denial of the request for accommodation and constitutes the issue.

The judge granted the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint, but prohibited the plaintiff from adding any new causes of action or damages claims. The judge warned that if the plaintiff declines or fails to file a first amended complaint, the defendant will be entitled to answer the operative complaint within 10 days of the lapsed deadline.
