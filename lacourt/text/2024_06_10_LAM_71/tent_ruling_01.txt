 Hearing Date:  June 10, 2024



 
Defendants Ivan Kutsevol’s, Alina
Kutsevol’s, and Elena Talan’s motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Todd
Beeson is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition and produce documents within 10 days
of this ruling.
Defendants Ivan
Kutsevol’s, Alina Kutsevol’s, and Elena Talan’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff is denied.
 
          Defendants Ivan Kutsevol (“Ivan”),
Alina Kutsevol (“Alina”), and Elena Talan (“Talan”) (collectively, “Moving Defendants”)
moves to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Todd Beeson (“Beeson”) (“Plaintiff”)
to appear for deposition within ten (10) days of this Court’s ruling.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2;
C.C.P. §§2023.010, 2025.010, et seq.) 
Moving Defendants also request sanctions in the amount of $450 against
Plaintiff.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
          Meet and Confer
A
motion to compel a deposition must be accompanied by a declaration stating
facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion.”  (C.C.P.
§§2016.040, 2025.480(b).)
Moving Defendants’
counsel’s declaration does not indicate if he attempted to meet and confer with
Plaintiff’s counsel.  (See Decl.
of Castillon-Mendoza.). Moving Defendants’ counsel’s declaration does not
substantially comply with the requirements of C.C.P. §2016.040.  Regardless, the Court in its discretion will
consider Moving Defendants’ motion.
 
Background
On March 18, 2022, Moving Defendants served a notice
for the deposition of Plaintiff set for April 16, 2022.  (Decl. of Castillon-Mendoza ¶3, Exh. A.) 

Plaintiff did not appear for the deposition and a
notice of non-appearance was taken. 
(Decl. of Castillon-Mendoza ¶¶4-5,
Exh. B.)  
Moving Defendants’ counsel rescheduled Plaintiff’s deposition
for April 22, 2024.  (Decl. of Castillon-Mendoza ¶6.)  On
April 18, 2024, a Notice of Taking Deposition was served on Plaintiff by and
through his attorney of record, scheduling Plaintiff’s deposition for April 22,
2024.  (Decl. of Castillon-Mendoza ¶6, Exh. C.) 
Plaintiff did not appear for the deposition and a notice of
non-appearance was taken.  (Decl. of Castillon-Mendoza ¶8.)  
Moving Defendants filed the instant motion on May 15,
2024.  Plaintiff filed his opposition on May
29, 2024.  Moving Defendants filed their
reply on June 3, 2024.
 
          Discussion
C.C.P. §2025.280(a) provides, in part, “[t]he
service of deposition notice under Section 2025.240 is effective to require any
deponent who is a party to the action . . . to attend and to testify, as well
as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection and copying.”  (C.C.P. §2025.280(a).)
C.C.P. §2025.450 states, in pertinent part, as
follows:
(a) If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action . . . , without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, . . . described in the deposition
notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the
deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any
document, . . .  described in the
deposition notice.
 
(1) The motion shall set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any
document . . . described in the deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails
to attend the deposition and produce the documents . . . described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.
 
(C.C.P. §2025.450.)
          The
Court grants Moving Defendant’s motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders
Plaintiff to appear for deposition and produce documents and things within ten
(10) days of this Court’s ruling.  Plaintiff was properly served with two
deposition notices and failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition.
          Accordingly,
Moving Defendants’ motion is granted.
 
Sanctions
Moving Defendants’ request for sanctions against
Plaintiff is denied on the basis Moving Defendants did not meet and confer with
Plaintiff’s counsel on the instant motion.
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendants’ motion to compel is granted.  Plaintiff to appear for deposition with 10
days of this ruling.
Moving Defendants’ request for sanctions
against Plaintiff is denied.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.
