And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling states that the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff is granted. The plaintiff, Todd Beeson, is ordered to appear for deposition and produce documents within 10 days of the ruling. The defendants, Ivan Kutsevol, Alina Kutsevol, and Elena Talan, also requested sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $450, but this request was denied. The court found that the defendants did not meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel before filing the motion. The plaintiff did not appear for two scheduled depositions and failed to produce documents, which is a violation of the court's rules. As a result, the court granted the defendants' motion to compel the deposition.
