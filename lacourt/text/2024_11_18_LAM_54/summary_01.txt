And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The defendant argues that the plaintiff, Felipe Chavez, executed an arbitration agreement on June 16, 2022, and that the court should order the parties to arbitrate the dispute. The plaintiff argues that the motion should be denied because he was employed as an exempt transportation worker under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The judge finds that the plaintiff falls within the transportation worker exemption and that he was actively engaged in transporting goods originating from out of state. Therefore, the judge denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration.
