STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for disability discrimination and retaliation that was

accommodations for Plaintiff’s work-related injury. 
 
Plaintiff moves for leave to file a
first amended complaint pursuant to a joint stipulation between the parties. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves for leave to file a
first amended complaint pursuant to a joint stipulation between the parties. 
 
The Court may, “at any time before
or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such
terms as may be proper, . . . allow the amendment of any pleading.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 576.) Here, Plaintiff states that the parties met and conferred between
January 11, 2024 and February 2, 2024 concerning the allegations in the
Complaint with respect to Defendant Katherine Gordon in advance of a possible
demurrer to the Complaint. (Declaration of Amy G. Zavidow ISO Mot. ¶¶ 4-6,
Exhs. 3-4.) The parties executed a stipulation to permit filing of the First
Amended Complaint, deem the proposed First Amended Complaint filed and served
as of the date of this order, and provide Defendants 20 days to serve and file
their responsive pleadings. (Zavidow Decl. Exh. 5.) The proposed First Amended
Complaint is attached to the stipulation. (Id.) 
 
As all parties agree about the
propriety of a First Amended Complaint, the Court finds good cause to permit
leave to amend. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Leave to File a First Amended Complaint is GRANTED as modified below.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to file a
clean stand-alone copy of the First Amended Complaint within five days of this
order. The First Amended Complaint will be deemed served on the date of filing.
 
Defendants shall serve and file
their answer, demurrer, or other responsive pleading within 20 days of the date
of service of the First Amended Complaint. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
