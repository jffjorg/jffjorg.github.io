Legal
Standard
 
            Defendant does not set forth in the
Notice of Motion the statutes or other authority under which it is seeking the
relief requested in this motion. As the operative authority, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.450, is referenced extensively throughout the included
Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the Court will address the motion on its
merits under this statute.
 
California Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450, subdivision (a) provides: 
 
If, after service of a deposition notice,
a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(a).) Further, where production of documents is sought in
connection with the deposition, the motion must set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the production. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2025.450(b)(1).) 
 
Meet
and Confer
 
A motion to compel a deposition must
include a meet and confer declaration stating facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2025.450(b); 2016.040.)  
 
The declaration of Erin E. Tallent
describes the extensive efforts undertaken by Defendant to meet and confer
regarding the taking of Plaintiff’s deposition between June 22 and October 18,
2023. (Declaration of Erin E. Tallent ISO Mot. ¶¶ 3-16, Exhs. A-I.) Defendant
has therefore satisfied its statutory meet-and-confer obligations.
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff
to appear for deposition. Defendant served the operative notice of Deposition
on July 14, 2023, setting the date of deposition as September 18, 2023 pursuant
to dates of availability identified by Plaintiff’s counsel. (Tallent Decl. ¶¶
6-7, Exhs. E-F.) On September 16, 2023, during settlement discussions,
Defendant’s counsel advised Plaintiff’s counsel that Defendant would be willing
to reopen a previously rejected Offer to Compromise. (Tallent Decl. ¶ 9.)
Plaintiff did not appear at the September 18 deposition, and only gave notice
that Plaintiff would not appear more than an hour after the scheduled
deposition time. (¶¶12-13, Exh. I.) Plaintiff’s counsel represented that, if
the parties did not settle, alternative dates would be provided no later than
September 22, 2023. (Id.) As of the date of filing of the motion, no
deposition dates had been provided. (¶ 17.) The Court subsequently ordered the
parties to provide deposition dates for Plaintiff and Defendant’s Person Most
Knowledgeable by February 26, 2024. (February 22, 2024 Minute Order.) Defendant
is therefore entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff’s appearance for a
deposition. 
 
            The Court observes that the Notice
of Deposition also requests the production of documents. However, as
Defendant’s moving papers do not speak to this portion of the deposition
notice, the Court does not reach this issue. 
 
Sanctions
 
            Defendant also requests monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $2,215.
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.450(g)(1) requires the Court to impose sanctions against
any party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel deposition,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.
 
            Here, Defendant
requests sanctions in the amount of $2,215, based on 2 hours of attorney time
incurred preparing this motion at an hourly rate of $370 per hour, plus 2
anticipated hours, plus $60 in filing fees, plus an additional $675 in costs to
cover the fees for the court reporter at the September 18 deposition. (Tallent
Decl. ¶ 20.) The Court declines to award anticipated attorney’s fees not
actually incurred. Accordingly, Defendant will be awarded reduced sanctions in
the amount of $1,475, reflecting the fees and costs actually incurred. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Deposition is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to appear for remote deposition by Defendant at a time of
Defendant’s choosing within 10 days of this order. 
 
            Defendant’s
request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $1,475 against
Plaintiff and his counsel, jointly and severally. Payment is to be made within 30
days of this order. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
