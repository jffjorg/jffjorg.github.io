And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court, presided over by Judge Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion of Plaintiff Breanna Williams for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The original complaint was filed on August 18, 2023, and alleges disability discrimination and retaliation by Defendants Medical Management International, Inc. d/b/a Banfield Pet Hospital, et al. due to their failure to provide accommodations for Plaintiff's work-related injury. The parties met and conferred between January 11, 2024, and February 2, 2024, and executed a stipulation permitting the filing of the First Amended Complaint.

The Court finds good cause to permit the amendment and grants the motion as modified. Plaintiff is ordered to file a clean stand-alone copy of the First Amended Complaint within five days of this order, and the First Amended Complaint will be deemed served on the date of filing. Defendants shall serve and file their answer, demurrer, or other responsive pleading within 20 days of the date of service of the First Amended Complaint. The Court's ruling is subject to modification if any party appears at the hearing on March 13, 2024.
