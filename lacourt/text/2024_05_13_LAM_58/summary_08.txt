And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP motion) and dismissed the plaintiff's claims for malicious prosecution and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court found that the defendant's lawsuit against the plaintiff was not malicious and frivolous, and that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate minimal merit in their claims. The court also found that the litigation privilege applied to the plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. The defendant had filed the anti-SLAPP motion, claiming that the plaintiff's claims arose from protected activity, namely the defendant's filing of a lawsuit against the plaintiff. The court concluded that the plaintiff's claims did not demonstrate minimal merit and therefore the special motion to strike was granted.
