And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Based on the information presented, the judge is unclear how the defendant's argument about the underlying litigation is relevant to the elements of the plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim. The judge notes that the defendant's cross-complaint in the underlying action contained claims for abuse of process, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, but that the court in the underlying action found that the litigation privilege applied to these claims. In contrast, the judge notes that the litigation privilege does not extend to actions for malicious prosecution, a claim that the plaintiff did not allege in the cross-complaint.
