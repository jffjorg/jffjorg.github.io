discusses the fact that neither Plaintiff nor Defendant prevailed on this cross-claims
and claims (respectively) in the underlying litigation, but it is not clear how
this is relevant to the elements of Plaintiff’s malicious prosecution claim
here. Admittedly, Plaintiff’s cross-complaint in the underlying action contained
claims for abuse of process, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional
distress. (Def.’s RJN Ex. 2.) While the allegations in the Complaint in this
action are similar to the allegations in the cross-complaint in the underlying
action, the court in the underlying action resolved the matter by finding that
the litigation privilege applied to these claims. (Def.’s RJN Ex. 3.) In
contrast, the litigation privilege does not extend to actions for malicious
prosecution – a claim that Plaintiff Cho did not allege in the Cross-Complaint in
the underlying action. (Action Apartment Assn., Inc. v. City of Santa Monica
(2007) 41 Cal.4th 1232, 1242.)
