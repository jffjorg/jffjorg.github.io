And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of State Farm v. Estrada, et al. The Defendant, Eric Lopez Estrada, has filed a Motion to Quash Service, Vacate Default and Default Judgment. The Judge has continued the hearing to May 7, 2024, and ordered the Defendant to file a corrected proof of service of the motion papers and notice of new hearing date by April 9, 2024. Failure to do so may result in the motion being denied. The Judge has made this decision based on the fact that the Defendant failed to give notice of the motion to the Plaintiff's counsel, which is a violation of due process and statutory requirements. The case involves a default judgment entered against the Defendant in 2012, which was renewed in 2022. The Judge has also considered the fact that the Plaintiff's counsel's address changed in 2014, but the motion papers and notice of hearing date were served to the old address.
