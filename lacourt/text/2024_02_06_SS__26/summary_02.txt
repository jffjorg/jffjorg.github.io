And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs had failed to comply with a discovery order, despite notice of the court's ruling, and had not filed an opposition to the motion. The court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted due to the plaintiffs' willful disobedience of the discovery order and their failure to comply with the court's orders. The judge concludes that the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the court's orders demonstrates a pattern of abuse and that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance.
