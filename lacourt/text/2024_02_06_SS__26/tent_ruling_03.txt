ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant
Eric L. Estrada (“Defendant”) on June 20, 2012. Following Defendant’s failure
to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered default judgment on December
22, 2012. The judgment was renewed on October 25, 2022. On the same date,
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a Notice of Firm Name and Address Change. 
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion
to Quash Service of Summons, Vacate Default and Default Judgment on November
30, 2023. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
The Motion is not accompanied by
a proof of service demonstrating service of the moving papers and notice of
hearing on Plaintiff’s counsel’s correct address. The Motion and Notice of
Hearing was served to 6725 Mesa Ridge Road, Ste. 240, San Diego, California.
(Proof of Service, filed 02/01/24.) The Notice of Firm Name and Address Change,
however, demonstrates that Plaintiff’s counsel’s address changed from 6725 Mesa
Ridge Road, Ste. 240, San Diego, California to 3168 Lionshead Avenue, Carlsbad,
California in March 2014. (Notice of Firm Name and Address Change, filed
10/25/22, ¶7.) 
 
 Failure to give notice of a motion is not only
a violation of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) The hearing on
the Motion must be continued to allow for proper service of the papers and
notice of hearing date. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Eric Lopez Estrada’s Motion to Quash Service, Vacate
Default and Default Judgment is CONTINUED TO MAY 7, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN
DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY APRIL 9, 2024, DEFENDANT IS
TO FILE CORRECTED PROOF OF SERVICE OF THE MOTION PAPERS AND NOTICE OF NEW
HEARING DATE. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE MOTION BEING DENIED.
