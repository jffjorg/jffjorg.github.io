And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of David A. Ortiz v. General Motors LLC. The case involves a claim of fraudulent concealment by GM regarding the transmission defect in a 2018 Cadillac CTS-V purchased by Ortiz. GM demurred to the fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment, arguing that Ortiz failed to plead the existence of a fiduciary relationship and did not specifically identify the individuals at GM who concealed the information. The Judge, however, found that Ortiz's allegations sufficient to state a cause of action and overruled GM's demurrer.

GM also moved to strike the punitive damages claimed by Ortiz, arguing that the Song-Beverly Consumer Act and the SAC failed to state facts sufficient to support punitive damages. The Judge denied the motion, finding that Ortiz's allegations of fraud and concealment by GM were sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

The Judge also addressed GM's argument that Ortiz failed to plead a transactional relationship with GM, finding that Ortiz's allegations of a relationship between the parties through the sale of the vehicle were sufficient to support a claim for fraudulent concealment.

The case is set for hearing on September 26, 2023.

**Tentative Ruling**

**Case Number:** 22TRCV01477
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Dept:** 8

**Case Name:** David A. Ortiz v. General Motors LLC

**Moving Party:** Defendant General Motors LLC
**Responding Party:** Plaintiff David A. Ortiz

**Motion:** (1) Demurrer and Motion to Strike as to the 4th cause of action for fraudulent concealment

**Tentative Ruling:**

**Demurrer:** OVERRULED

**Motion to Strike:** DENIED

The Court has reviewed the pleadings and finds that the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint ("SAC") has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action for fraudulent inducement—concealment. The Defendant's demurrer to the 4th cause of action is therefore OVERRULED.

**Background:**

The Plaintiff, David A. Ortiz, filed a lawsuit against the Defendant, General Motors LLC, alleging four causes of action, including a violation of the Song Beverly Act and fraudulent concealment. The Defendant filed a demurrer to the 4th cause of action, alleging that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

**Analysis:**

The Court finds that the SAC has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action for fraudulent inducement—concealment. The Plaintiff has alleged that the Defendant had knowledge of the transmission defect in its vehicles, including the one purchased by the Plaintiff, and that the Defendant intended to defraud the Plaintiff by concealing this information.

The Court also finds that the SAC has alleged sufficient facts to establish a transactional relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, as the Plaintiff purchased the vehicle from an authorized dealership of the Defendant. Therefore, the Defendant has a duty to disclose any material information about the vehicle's condition.

**Motion to Strike:**

The Defendant also moves to strike the Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages, arguing that it is not supported by the pleadings. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to state a claim for punitive damages under the Song Beverly Act, and therefore, the Motion to Strike is DENIED.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's SAC has alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action for fraudulent inducement—concealment. The Defendant's demurrer to the 4th cause of action is therefore OVERRULED, and the Motion to Strike is DENIED.
