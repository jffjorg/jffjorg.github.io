And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of David A. Ortiz v. General Motors LLC. The case involves a claim of fraudulent concealment by GM regarding the transmission defect in a 2018 Cadillac CTS-V purchased by Ortiz. GM demurred to the fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment, arguing that Ortiz failed to plead the existence of a fiduciary relationship and did not specifically identify the individuals at GM who concealed the information. The Judge, however, found that Ortiz's allegations sufficient to state a cause of action and overruled GM's demurrer.

GM also moved to strike the punitive damages claimed by Ortiz, arguing that the Song-Beverly Consumer Act and the SAC failed to state facts sufficient to support punitive damages. The Judge denied the motion, finding that Ortiz's allegations of fraud and concealment by GM were sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

The Judge also addressed GM's argument that Ortiz failed to plead a transactional relationship with GM, finding that Ortiz's allegations of a relationship between the parties through the sale of the vehicle were sufficient to support a claim for fraudulent concealment.

The case is set for hearing on September 26, 2023.
