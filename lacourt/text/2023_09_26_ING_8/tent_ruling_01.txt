I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A.   
Factual¿¿
 
Plaintiff William Tyler Horn,
Trustee of The William Tyler Horn Revocable Trust Dated May 18, 2009
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Reverse Mortgage Solutions, Inc. (“RMS”)
Bank of America, N.A. (“BofA”); American Home Mortgage Servicing Inc. (“AHMS”) on
June 7, 2022.  RMS filed an Answer on
November 7, 2022. 
 
On February 16, 2023, RMS served
its first set of written discovery requests on Plaintiff, including Form
Interrogatories, Set One; Request for Admissions, Set One; Special
Interrogatories, Set One; and Request for Productions Documents, Set One.  The responses were due March 23, 2023.  The Court noted that RMS propounded this discovery
on Plaintiff after Plaintiff’s no longer had a lawyer, i.e., after former
counsel was granted relief from the representation on March 20, 2023.  RMS’ motion papers on its motions to compel
and for deemed admissions showed that Plaintiff did not provide any responses
to the written discovery requests. 
 
On July 12, 2023, the Court
granted RMS’s Motions to Compel as to the first sets of Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories and Request or Production of Documents, and Ordered
Plaintiff to provide verified responses, under oath and without objections, by
August 11, 2023.  As to RMS’s Motion to
Deem Matters and Documents Admitted, the Court granted the motion deeming the
requests admitted and that the attached documents are genuine. 
 
On August 11, 2023, RMS sent
correspondences to Plaintiff via U.S. Mail and email, indicating that RMS would
be proceeding with a Motion for Terminating Sanctions if RMS did not hear back
from Plaintiff by August 17, 2023.  (Spaeder-Younkin Decl., ¶9, Exh. F.)  RMS has not received any record that the
letter was returned to their office via U.S. mail.  (Spaeder-Younkin Decl., ¶ 9.)  Additionally, the email bounced back as
undeliverable.  (Spaeder-Younkin Decl.,
¶9.)  RMS is not aware of any other email
or address to which to send Plaintiff correspondence.  (Spaeder-Younkin
Decl., ¶9.)  To date, Plaintiff has
failed to provide any responses in direct violation of this Court’s order. 
 
On August 22, 2023, RMS filed a
motion for terminating sanctions and to dismiss Plaintiff’s lawsuit with
prejudice due to Plaintiff’s failure to comply with court orders.  In the alternative, RMS requests issue and
evidence sanctions prohibiting Plaintiff from introducing testimony, witnesses,
documents, or other evidence that Plaintiff failed to produce or explain in
discovery.  In addition, RMS seeks an
award of monetary sanctions for $1,957.50 for the expense of this motion.  
 
B.    
¿ Procedural

 
On August 22, 2023, RMS filed a motion for terminating sanctions or in the alternative, issue and evidence
sanctions. 
 
No opposition was filed. 
 
On September 14, 2023, RMS filed a “Reply” in support of
their motion for terminating sanctions or in the alternative, issue and
evidence sanctions, which is essentially a statement of non-opposition to the
motion

¿III. ANALYSIS¿ 
¿ 
A.   
Legal
Standard ¿
 
¿If a party fails to comply with a court order compelling
discovery responses or attendance at a deposition, the court may impose
monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions. Code Civ. Proc. §
2025.450, subd. (h) (depositions); § 2030.290, subd. (c) (interrogatories); §
2031.300, subd. (c) (demands for production of documents); § 2033.290, subd.
(e) (requests for admission). Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides
that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery
method . . . , the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or
attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose . . .¿ [monetary,
issue, evidence, or terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process . . .” Section 2023.010 provides that
“[m]isuses of
the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: . . . (d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. . . (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery. . .”¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for
discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the]
conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to
the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain
the discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made
lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.’” (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390
[citation omitted].)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed
terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more
discovery orders.” (Id., citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal. App.
4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating
sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen
(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against
plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating
various discovery statutes].)¿¿ 
 
Issue sanctions may be imposed “ordering that designated
facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance with the claim
of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process. The
court may also impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing
designated claims or defenses.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(b).) 
 
Evidence sanctions may be imposed “by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated
matters in evidence.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(c).) 
 
 
B.    
Discussion  
 
¿On July 12, 2023, the Court issued an order requiring Plaintiff
to provide verified responses to RMS’s Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request or Production of Documents under oath and without
objections by August 11, 2023.  Defendant
BofA served a Notice of Ruling attaching the Court’s July 12, 2023 Order to
Plaintiff’s home address.  The Order
mistakenly does not include the ruling on RMS’s discovery motions, which were all
granted, as set forth in the Notice of Ruling. 
(Spaeder-Younkin Decl., ¶6, Exhs. D, E.)  
 
            RMS
asserts Plaintiff did not provide verified responses by August 11, 2023.  On August 11, 2023, RMS sent mail and email
correspondences to Plaintiff indicating RMS would proceed with a Motion for
Terminating Sanctions if RMS did not hear from Plaintiff by August 17, 2023.  (Spaeder-Younkin Decl., ¶9.)  RMS did
not receive any response. 
 
            RMS
has submitted evidence suggesting Plaintiff failed to obey the Court’s order
compelling him to provide verified responses in a manner that warrants
terminating sanctions. But because of Plaintiff’s self-represented status, and
because of the drastic nature of a terminating sanction, the Court has
determined to continue the hearing on this motion and to give Plaintiff a
further opportunity to comply with the Court’s order requiring him to respond
to the normal discovery a defendant asks of a plaintiff in civil
litigation.  In Deyo v. Kilbourne
(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793-784, the Second District noted: “The sanction of
dismissal or the rendition of a default judgment against the disobedient party
is ordinarily a drastic measure which should be employed with caution. 
[Citation] However, there is no question that a court is empowered to apply the
ultimate sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to
comply with his discovery obligations.  [Citation] The refusal to reveal
material evidence is deemed to be an admission that the claim or defense is
without merit. [Citations]”  Here, the only evidence of Plaintiff’s
willfulness in failing to comply with the Court’s order is that he failed to
respond to the Court’s order to provide verified responses.  There is no direct evidence that Plaintiff’s
failure to respond is willful.  Plaintiff
is given one last chance.  Plaintiff is
ordered to serve verified responses no later than 48 hours before the continued
hearing date of October 12, 2023.  Any
further failure to provide verified responses will evidence that sanctions
lesser than terminating sanctions would not bring about Plaintiff’s compliance.

 
            Counsel
for defendant is to give written notice of this ruling, attaching a copy of the
tentative ruling to its notice to make sure Plaintiff understands the
consequences of a continued failure to comply with the July 12 discovery order.
