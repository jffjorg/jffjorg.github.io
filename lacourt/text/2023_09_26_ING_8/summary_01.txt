English text:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion for terminating sanctions filed by defendant Reverse Mortgage Solutions, Inc. against plaintiff William Tyler Horn, Trustee of The William Tyler Horn Revocable Trust Dated May 18, 2009. The motion was filed on August 22, 2023 due to plaintiff's failure to comply with court orders related to discovery requests.

The case involves plaintiff's lawsuit against defendant and other parties, which was filed on June 7, 2022. Defendant filed a response on November 7, 2022. On February 16, 2023, defendant served discovery requests on plaintiff, including form interrogatories, request for admissions, special interrogatories, and request for productions of documents. However, plaintiff did not provide any responses.

On July 12, 2023, the court granted defendant's motions to compel and ordered plaintiff to provide verified responses by August 11, 2023. The court also granted defendant's motion to deem matters and documents admitted. However, plaintiff failed to provide any responses.

Defendant sent correspondences to plaintiff via US mail and email, indicating that defendant would proceed with a motion for terminating sanctions if plaintiff did not respond by August 17, 2023. Defendant did not receive any response and filed a motion for terminating sanctions on August 22, 2023.

The court has determined that plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's order warrants terminating sanctions. However, due to plaintiff's self-represented status and the drastic nature of terminating sanctions, the court will continue the hearing and give plaintiff a further opportunity to comply with the court's order.

Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses no later than 48 hours before the continued hearing date of October 12, 2023. Any further failure to provide verified responses will evidence that sanctions less than terminating sanctions would not bring about plaintiff's compliance.

Defense counsel is to give written notice of this ruling to plaintiff, attaching a copy of the tentative ruling to make sure plaintiff understands the consequences of a continued failure to comply with the July 12 discovery order.

* RMS filed an Answer on November 7, 2022.
* RMS served its first set of written discovery requests on Plaintiff on February 16, 2023, including Form Interrogatories, Request for Admissions, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Productions Documents.
* Plaintiff failed to provide any responses to the written discovery requests.
* On July 12, 2023, the Court granted RMS’s Motions to Compel as to the first sets of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents, and Ordered Plaintiff to provide verified responses by August 11, 2023.

* Plaintiff is given one last chance. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses no later than 48 hours before the continued hearing date of October 12, 2023.
