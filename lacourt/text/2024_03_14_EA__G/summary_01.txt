And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted defendant Paola Carcamo Cotero's motion to strike punitive and exemplary damages from the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Dejuan Antwaun Haney, alleges that Carcamo Cotero was driving at an unsafe speed and acted with conscious disregard for his safety when he collided with Haney's vehicle in a motor vehicle accident. However, the judge finds that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, as they do not allege specific facts that demonstrate despicable conduct. The judge relies on California Civil Code section 3294 and relevant case law to support its decision.
