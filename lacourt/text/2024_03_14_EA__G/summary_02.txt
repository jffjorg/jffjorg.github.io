And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the plaintiff's application for default judgment against La Barca Restaurant Inc. The plaintiff, Cyntia Valle, is seeking a default judgment in the amount of $385,667.21, including $385,000 in damages and $667.21 in costs, based on a premises liability action. The plaintiff filed a complaint against La Barca and the City of El Monte, alleging that the sidewalk where she tripped and fell was jointly owned, maintained, managed, and operated by the two defendants. The City filed an answer, but La Barca was defaulted on January 22, 2024. The plaintiff submitted an application for default judgment on March 7, 2024. The judge has found that the application is incomplete because the plaintiff failed to attach copies of the exhibits referenced in the declaration. Therefore, the hearing is continued to a date to be determined at the case management conference set in Department G.
