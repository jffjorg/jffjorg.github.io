The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion of defendants to strike the punitive damages allegations from the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, BRAVHART, L.P., brought this action against defendants LOS FELIZ INVESTORS, LLC, ZWICK CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, and LATERRA DEVELOPMENT, LLC, alleging that their construction of an apartment complex caused damage to the plaintiff's property.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations adequately plead an intentional tort, and therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to seek punitive damages for both its nuisance and trespass claims.
