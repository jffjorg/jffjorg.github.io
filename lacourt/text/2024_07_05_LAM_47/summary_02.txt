And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production (Set One) and (Set Two). The plaintiff is seeking documents relating to customer complaints, warranty claims, and employee records concerning alleged defects in a 2019 Jeep Wrangler. The defendant has objected to the requests, citing vagueness, ambiguity, and irrelevance, but the judge has found that the requests are relevant and admissible.

The judge has ordered the defendant to produce verified, code-compliant responses without objections to the requests as propounded within 30 days of the order. The plaintiff has shown good cause for the requests, and the judge has found that the defendant's objections are meritless. The judge has also ordered the defendant to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections to the requests as propounded within 30 days of the order.
