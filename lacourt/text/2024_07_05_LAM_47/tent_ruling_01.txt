STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a lemon law action. Plaintiffs allege there were defects
in the 2018 Honda Pilot that they purchased, including defects in the
“infotainment” system, malfunctioning windows, abnormal noises and delay upon
acceleration, and others. Following a jury verdict, judgment was entered for
Defendant and against Plaintiffs on April 10, 2024. 
 
Plaintiffs move to tax costs
claimed by Defendant in its Memorandum of Costs. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiffs’
Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED IN PART. Items 8 and 12 in Defendant’s
Memorandum of Costs are taxed in their entirety, and Item 11 is taxed in the
amount of $3,464.15.
Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs is therefore taxed in the total amount of
$6,202.60, permitting it to recover a total of $21,288.32.
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiffs move to tax costs
claimed by Defendant in its Memorandum of Costs. 
 
//
Legal Standard 
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ.
Proc. §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co.
Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)  “Prevailing
party” includes a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recovery any
relief against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1032(a)(4).) Assuming the
“prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion to order
each party to bear his or her own costs of suit.  (Michell v. Olick
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) 
 
Allowable costs under Section 1033.5 must be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable in amount.  An item
not specifically allowable under Section 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under
subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the discretion of the court
if they meet the above requirements (i.e., reasonably necessary and reasonable
in amount).  If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper
charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were
not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc.
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.)  On the other hand, if the items are
properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the
party claiming them as costs.  (Ibid.) Whether a cost item was
reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the
trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  (Ibid.) 
However, because the right to costs is governed strictly by statute, a court
has no discretion to award costs not statutorily authorized.  (Id.) 
Discretion is abused only when, in its exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds
of reason, all of the circumstances being considered.”  (Ibid.)   
 
Timeliness of Motion
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail or email, the period is extended as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1013.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(1).) Here,
Defendant served the memorandum of costs by electronic service on April 30,
2024. (Memorandum of Costs POS.) This motion was filed and served on May 16,
2024, 16 days later. Accounting for the manner of service, the motion is timely
brought. 
 
General Entitlement
to Costs
 
            Plaintiffs argue that Civil Code
section 1794(d), which entitles a buyer of a defective vehicle to an award of
attorney’s fees and costs upon prevailing on a Song-Beverly claim, acts to
preclude the seller or manufacturer from seeking an award of costs under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1032 if they prevail in a Song-Beverly action. None
of the authorities cited by Plaintiff stand for that proposition. (Jensen v.
BMW of N.Am., Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 119, 138; Wohlgemuth v.
Caterpillar, Inc (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1264; Graciano v. Robinson
Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 150.) In fact, the California
Supreme Court expressly considered this question in 1998 in Murillo v.
Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc., cited by Plaintiffs in their motion, and held
that a prevailing seller in a Song-Beverly suit is entitled to recover costs
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032. (Murillo v. Fleetwood
Enterprises, Inc. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 985, 999.) Defendant is therefore
entitled to recover costs Code of Civil Procedure sections 1032 and 1033.5. 
 
Specificity of
Challenged Costs
 
            Plaintiffs do not specifically
identify in the Notice of Motion which costs it seeks to challenge, as required
by California Rule of Court 3.1700(b). The Court would therefore be within its
discretion to deny the motion in its entirety. However, the Court observes that
Plaintiffs’ memorandum of points and authorities refers to (1) filing and
motion fees; (2) deposition costs; (3) transcripts and court reporter fees; (4)
expert costs; (5) models, enlargements, and copies; and (6) other costs, which
mirror Items 1, 4,11, 8, 12, and 16, respectively, as set forth in the
Memorandum of Costs. (See Memorandum of Costs filed April 30, 2024.) As Defendant
has not objected to the notice of motion on this basis, the Court will overlook
this error and consider the motion on its merits with respect to the individual
cost items being challenged.
 
Challenged
Costs
 
            Plaintiffs challenge six sets of
claimed costs in Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs: (1) filing and motion fees;
(2) deposition costs; (3) transcripts and court reporter fees; (4) expert
costs; (5) models, enlargements, and copies; and (6) other costs,
 
1.     
Filing and Motion Fees (Item 1)
 
            Plaintiffs challenge the entirety of
Defendant’s claimed costs for filing and motion fees in the amount of $2,390.32
on the basis that these are discretionary costs which have not been justified. Plaintiffs
are incorrect. As Defendant is entitled to costs as a prevailing party under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, Defendant is entitled to recover these
costs as of right pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(1).
This cost item should not be taxed. 
 
2.     
Deposition Costs (Item 4)
 
            Plaintiffs challenge the entirety of
Defendant’s claimed deposition costs of $4,665.50 on the basis that these are
discretionary costs which have not been justified. Plaintiffs are incorrect. As
Defendant is entitled to costs as a prevailing party under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1032, Defendant is entitled to recover these costs as of
right pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(3) for all
depositions that were reasonably necessary. As all three deponents testified
during the trial of this matter, the Court finds that their depositions were reasonably
necessary.  This cost item should not be
taxed. 
 
 
3.     
Transcript Costs and Court Reporter Fees (Item 11)
 
            Plaintiffs challenge $13,247.33 of
Defendant’s claimed $15,991.66 in Court reporter fees as improper on the basis
that these are discretionary costs which have not been justified. Plaintiffs
are incorrect. As Defendant is entitled to costs as a prevailing party under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, Defendant is entitled to recover Court
reporter fees as of right pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5(a)(11). 
 
            However, Plaintiffs also argue that
Defendant is improperly seeking to recover transcript fees not ordered by the
Court, which are expressly prohibited by Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5(b)(5). Indeed, Attachment 12c to the Memorandum of Costs expressly
identifies three cost entries as “Rough Draft of Trial Transcript,” and a
further three entries as “Gaye L. Limon Court Reporter Services and Rough
Draft.” (Memorandum of Costs Attach. 12c.) Further, the attached invoices show
that, in total, Defendant is seeking $3,464.15 in transcript costs. (Memorandum
Invoices Exh. 11.) These cost items are expressly prohibited. Item 11 must
therefore be taxed in the amount of $3,464.15. 
 
4.     
Expert Witness Fees (Item 8)
 
            Plaintiffs seek to tax the entirety
of Item 8, seeking $825 in expert witness fees, as improper. Plaintiffs argue
that Defendant is not entitled to recover expert witness fees under Code of
Civil Procedure section 998 because the offer to compromise which served was
not reasonable. Expert witness fees not ordered by the Court typically may not
be recovered after trial. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(b)(1).)  Expert witness costs may be recovered
notwithstanding this provision when a defendant makes an offer to compromise
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998 which is rejected and the
plaintiff thereafter fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 998(d).)
 
            As stated
by the Court of Appeal: 
 
Whether a section
998 offer is reasonable must be determined by looking at circumstances when the
offer was made. However, the reasonableness of an offer depends upon the
information used to evaluate it. In many cases, a plaintiff and a defendant
will not have the same information when an offer is made. For this reason, the
reasonableness of an offer may lie in the eye of its beholder.
 
As a general rule,
the reasonableness of a defendant's offer is measured, first, by determining
whether the offer represents a reasonable prediction of the amount of money, if
any, defendant would have to pay plaintiff following a trial, discounted by an
appropriate factor for receipt of money by plaintiff before trial, all premised
upon information that was known or reasonably should have been known to the
defendant. It goes without saying that a defendant is not expected to predict
the exact amount of his exposure. If an experienced attorney or judge, standing
in defendant's shoes, would place the prediction within a range of reasonably
possible results, the prediction is reasonable. 
 
If the offer is
found reasonable by the first test, it must then satisfy a second test: whether
defendant's information was known or reasonably should have been known to
plaintiff. This second test is necessary because the section 998 mechanism
works only where the offeree has reason to know the offer is a reasonable one.
If the offeree has no reason to know the offer is reasonable, then the offeree
cannot be expected to accept the offer.
 
(Elrod v. Oregon Cummins Diesel, Inc. (1987) 195
Cal.App.3d 692, 700 [internal citations omitted].) A party who extends an offer
under section 998 has the burden of demonstrating that the offer is valid. (Barella
v. Exchange Bank (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 793, 799.) To be valid, a statutory
offer of compromise “need not contain any ‘magic language,’ so long as it is
clear the offer, which must be written, is made under section 998 and, if
accepted, will result in the entry of judgment or in the alternative final
disposition of the action legally equivalent to the judgment.” (Berg v.
Darden (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 721, 731-32.) However, the offer “must be
sufficiently specific to allow the [recipient] to evaluate it and make a
reasoned decision whether to accept.” (Taing v. Johnson Scaffolding Co. (1992)
9 Cal.App.4th 579, 586.) 
 
            Plaintiffs
argue that Defendant’s September 25, 2023 Offer to Compromise was invalid
because it was not sufficiently specific to be valid. Defendant’s offer to
compromise presented three choices for settlement of the entire case: (1) Defendant
would repurchase the vehicle for $27,000; (2) Defendant would repurchase the
vehicle for an amount “subject to proof,” or (3) Defendant would pay $10,000
without Plaintiffs surrendering the vehicle. (Declaration of Dhara Patel ISO
Mot. Exh. 1 ¶¶ 1-7.) Defendant would also, at Plaintiffs’ election, either pay
$20,000 in attorney’s fees and costs, or, alternatively, the parties would
determine the award of fees and costs by a single noticed motion. (Id. ¶
8.) Plaintiffs did not accept the offer. (Patel Decl. ¶ 3; Exh. 2.) 
 
The Court of Appeal recently
addressed offers to compromise containing such “moving target” alternatives in
its 2022 opinion, Duff v. Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC (2022) 74
Cal.App.5th 491. In Duff, the manufacturer presented an offer to
compromise which provided “that Jaguar would repurchase the vehicle for
$28,430.80 or greater than that amount if Duff ‘provide[d] documentation to
show the amount is more than $28,430.80.” (Duff. v. Jaguar Land Rover North
America LLC (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 491, 496.) The plaintiff rejected the
offer, and, at a bench trial, the court found that the plaintiff had not proven
damages and deemed the manufacturer the prevailing party. (Id. at 496.)
However, the trial court declined to award the manufacturer costs under Code of
Civil Procedure section 998, finding the offer to compromise was not
sufficiently specific. (Id. at 497.) The trial court’s final statement
of decision deemed the plaintiff the prevailing party but awarded him only
nominal damages. (Id.) On appeal, the Court of Appeal considered the
threshold question of whether the manufacturer’s offer to compromise was valid.
(Id. at 500.) The Court of Appeal concluded that the offer was not
sufficiently specific, reasoning: 
 
Here, our concern is
that Jaguar's 998 Offer presents somewhat of a moving target. For example, if
Duff were awarded an amount over $28,430.80, say $30,000, it is not clear, by
the terms of the statutory offer that the amount was greater than what Jaguar
was offering to pay. Jaguar could argue, based on the evidence offered by Duff
at trial, that it actually would have paid him more than $30,000, and thus,
Duff recovered less than the 998 Offer. Therefore, we agree with the trial
court that “[t]he offer [wa]s not sufficiently specific; judgment could be for
$28,430.80 or for some higher amount that is subject to proof.”
 
(Duff, supra 74 Cal.App.5th at 500.) Here, Plaintiffs
argue that Defendant’s offer to compromise is subject to the same deficiency in
that the final judgment entered could be for $27,000 or for some higher amount
according to proof based on the express terms of the 998 Offer. (See Patel
Decl. Exh. 1.) Tellingly, Defendant does not address Duff or the
specificity of its offer in its opposition to this motion, instead focusing on
whether Plaintiffs have adequately shown that the offer was not made in good
faith. While a party seeking to prove an offer to compromise is made in bad
faith bears the burden of proving that position (see Santantonio v.
Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 102, 116-17), the
offeror bears the burden of demonstrating the validity of the offer. (Barella
v. Exchange Bank (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 793, 799.) By failing to address
this argument, Defendant has failed to prove the validity of its Offer to
Compromise. The Court therefore finds that the offer was not sufficiently specific
and is invalid. 
 
            Defendant
is therefore not entitled to expert costs because no expert witness fees were
ordered by the Court, and therefore these costs are precluded by Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5(b)(1).  Item 8
must therefore be taxed in its entirety, totaling $825. 
 
5.      Models,
Enlargements, and Photocopies of Exhibits (Item 12)
            
            Plaintiffs
next challenge Item 12, seeking $1,913.45 in costs for models, enlargements,
and photocopies of exhibits. While costs for models, enlargements and
photocopies of exhibits are expressly allowable, such costs may only be allowed
“if they were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of fact.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(a)(13).) Plaintiffs contend that the cost memorandum does not provide
sufficient detail to allow them to determine whether this is the case. In
response, Defendant asserts, without elaboration or evidence, that these costs
are related to “preparing exhibit binders and ‘electronic presentations of
exhibits,’ many of which were used at trial.” (Opposition p.6:5-6.) This
statement is not sufficient to carry Defendant’s burden where the utility of
these costs has been put at issue by Plaintiffs. The Court therefore finds that
Item 12 must be taxed in its entirety, totaling $1,913.45.
 
//
6.     
Other Costs (Item 16)
 
Finally, Plaintiffs challenge
Defendant’s claim for $1,195.07 in “other” costs for meals and parking expenses
as not reasonably necessary to the litigation, and therefore not authorized as
discretionary costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(c). Plaintiffs
offer no explanation for why these costs are unreasonable beyond the bare
assertion that they are. Conclusory assertions do not suffice to substantiate
an objection to this claim for costs. (See, e.g., State v. Meyer (1985)
174 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1075.) Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that this cost
item should be taxed. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED IN PART. Items 8 and 12 in
Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs are taxed in their entirety, and Item 11 is
taxed in the amount of
$3,464.15. Defendant’s Memorandum of Costs is therefore taxed in the total
amount of $6,202.60, permitting it to recover a total cost award of $21,288.32.
