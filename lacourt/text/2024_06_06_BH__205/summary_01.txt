And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the Complaint. The Plaintiff, Leslie Dugger, slipped and fell down the stairs of an apartment building on October 19, 2020, and alleges two claims for negligence and premises liability. The Court dismissed the Complaint without prejudice due to Plaintiff's counsel's failure to appear at a scheduled hearing. The Plaintiff seeks mandatory relief due to counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The Court finds that the mandatory relief provision of Section 473(b) applies, and grants the motion to set aside the dismissal. The action is reinstated, and a case management conference is set for June 28, 2024.
