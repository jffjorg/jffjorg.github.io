 Case Number:  23PSCV01667    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
PLAINTIFF'S
APPLICATION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT is DENIED without prejudice for two
reasons: (1) individual defendant’s liability and (2) attorney fees. 
 
Background
 
This is an
ADA case based upon architectural barriers. 
 
On June 2,
2023, Plaintiff Orlando Garcia filed his complaint against Main-Cortez Street
One, an Arizona Limited Parternship and Helen B. Cortez. 
 
On September
14, 2023, the court rejected the request for entry of default as to the entity
because “Service on Secretary of State requires a court order.”
 
On April 22,
2024, the court again denied the request for entry of default for the same
reason.
 
On August 18,
2024, default was entered against Helen Cortez. 
 
On August 29,
2024, default was entered against the entity.
 
On September
13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ‘Application to Have Attorney’s Fees Fixed by the
Court [CCP 585(d) and Local Rule 3.214] – requesting fees in excess of default
schedule and according to proof’ and other application material. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
seeks $10,106.64 in damages ($4,000 for statutory violations, $1,916.64 in
costs, and $4,190 in attorney fees. The court finds the following two defects. 
 
First,
Plaintiff seeks liability against Helen B. Cortez, the owner of the real
property at issue. (Price Decl., ¶5.) However, Plaintiff has not offered an analysis as to how
Cortez by the mere fact as the owner of the property can be liable.
Therefore, the court denies the application for this reason. 
 
Second,
Plaintiff’s Counsel seeks $4,190 in attorney fees. For one, Counsel has not
provided a total number of hours expended on the matter. But reviewing the
billing entries, the court finds 10 hours reasonable on such a matter. After all, the complaints
are boilerplate (and nearly identical to others filed by the firm), the actions
do not involve novel or difficult questions of law, and no discovery or other
substantive measures were taken in the action. For similar reasons, the court
finds the billing rates of $650/hour and $400 to be unreasonable. For cases
such as this wherein much of the work can be done by associates (and was done
by associates) who bill at $100/hour, the court reduces the hourly rate to $250. Therefore,
the court will award $2,500 in attorney fees.  
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing two defects, the application is denied without prejudice.
