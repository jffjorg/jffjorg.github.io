[1] The caption of the
CC mistakenly states it is filed by Defendant ‘Redlands Unified School
District.’ 
 


[2] Plaintiff in
opposition dismisses the 4th COA. (Se Opp. p. 1, fn. 1 [“Plaintiff
agrees to dismiss his fourth cause of action for sexual harassment against
CVUSD only, but not on the basis as stated in CVUSD’s Motion (that there was
inadequate notice). Rather, pursuant to K.M. v. Grossmont Union High School
Dist. (2022) 84 Cal. App. 5th 717, a school district is not subject to a
claim for sexual harassment under Civil Code § 51.9.”].) Thus, only the
negligence based COAs will be discussed. 
 


[3] The supplemental
opposition provides Dr. Shakeshaft’s C.V., which was inadvertently omitted from
the original opposition. 
 


[4] While the COA is for
negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, the allegations, arguments, and
separate statement focus on supervision, notably as Northrop’s background
checks (i.e., hiring) did not reveal any concerning information nor are there
allegations that after the District learned of what happened, that it did not
take measures to separate the District and Plaintiff (i.e., supervision). (See
also Plaintiff’s Opp. and Supp. Opp. [focus solely on supervision].) 
 


[5] Or, as laid out in CACI 426, the District “knew or
should have known that [name of employee]
[was/became] [unfit/ [or] incompetent]/[other particular risk]]
and that this [unfitness [or] incompetence/ [other particular risk]]
created a particular risk to others.” (CACI, subs. (3), emphasis added.)


[6] The evidence as
these students have been filed under seal. Of note, one of the students, J.S., was
in Northrop’s class for one day and on the second day he was transferred to
accommodate his wrestling schedule. (Plaintiff’s AMF No. 3.) The day after he
was transferred, Northrop hugged the student and asked why he left her class;
one of the J.S.’s friends commented that Northrop was going to have sex with
him.
 


[7] The District’s evidentiary
objections where relevant are OVERRULED. For example, the District
objections to Plaintiff’s AMF No. 17, infra, on the grounds that the deposition
was not properly authenticated, the deposition was not signed by the court
report, or that the deposition fails to provide page numbers. These are
technicalities that do not prejudice Defendant, especially when the District
attended the depositions and has access to the same documents. Additionally, to
the extent that the District argues L.B.’s deposition is irrelevant, the court
agrees any connection between L.B. and the history teacher is irrelevant, but
what L.B. said about rumors regarding Plaintiff and Northrop is relevant per
the standard set forth in A.H.  


[8] The District objects arguing that Grise never
testified that she did not recall having lunch with L.B. and Northrop, but
point to exhibit 3 Plaintiff’s evidence. However, Exhibit 3 is LB’s deposition,
not Grise’s, and the court’s review of Grise’s deposition does not provide that
Grise said she does not recall having lunch with L.B. That said, it appears
L.B. testified about lunches with other teachers. 


[9] See also District’s citation to Doe v. Lawndale
Elementary Sch. Dist. (2021) 72 Cal. App. 5th 113. That case is inapposite
as it focused on actual notice, not constructive notice.
