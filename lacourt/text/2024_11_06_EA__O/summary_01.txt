Summary in English:

The tentative ruling grants the District's motion for summary judgment in part, finding that the District had actual knowledge of Northrop's behavior and therefore owed a duty to protect the students. However, the court denies the motion in part, finding that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the District's alleged failure to supervise Northrop and other teachers. The court finds that the District's failure to supervise Northrop and other teachers was negligent, and therefore denies the District's motion for summary judgment on the issue of negligent supervision. The court also finds that the District had constructive knowledge of Northrop's behavior, which means that they should have known or reasonably suspected that Northrop was engaging in inappropriate behavior.
