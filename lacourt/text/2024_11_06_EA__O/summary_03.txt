And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice for two reasons. Firstly, the plaintiff has not provided an analysis of how the defendant Helen Cortez, the owner of the real property at issue, can be liable. Secondly, the plaintiff's counsel has not provided a total number of hours expended on the matter and has unreasonable billing rates. As a result, the court will award only $2,500 in attorney fees. The rest of the damages, totaling $10,106.64, will not be awarded at this time.
