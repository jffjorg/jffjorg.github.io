And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by FCA US LLC, the defendant, with leave to amend. The plaintiffs, Vanessa Aviles and Alejandro Aviles, alleged that FCA US LLC violated various provisions of the California Civil Code, including the lemon law, and fraudulently concealed the defective nature of the transmission in their 2018 Ram ProMaster City. The court found that the allegations were conclusory and failed to plead sufficient facts to constitute a valid claim. Specifically, the court found that the allegations of violation of California Civil Code Section 1793.2, subdivision (A)(3) and fraudulently concealment were insufficiently pled and failed to provide specific details or facts. The court granted the defendant's demurrer and gave the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint to plead more particular facts.
