FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES
 
Keshara Shaw et al v Los Angeles Unified School District,
20STCV36489.
 
All parties in this action were notified on
March 21, 2024 via Case Anywhere that effective April 2, 2024, and until
further notice, Judge Elaine Lu will be temporarily assigned to Department 9 at
312 N. Spring Street, Los Angeles, California 90012, Spring Street
Courthouse.  
 
               On
April 4, 2024, the Court again notified all parties in this action via Case
Anywhere that until further notice, Judge Elaine Lu has been assigned to
Department 9, including the instant action. 
The Court required all parties to respond either (a) by indicating
acceptance of Judge Elaine Lu to preside over this action during her temporary
assignment to Department 9 via Case Anywhere, or (b) by filing a peremptory
challenge under Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6 (if one was still
available to that party).
 
Having been so advised, all parties in this
action have indicated via Case Anywhere that they accept the assignment of
Judge Elaine Lu to preside over the case during her temporary assignment to
Department 9.
 
As the parties have indicated their
acceptance of the judicial assignment, the Court hereby posts the following
tentative ruling for the April 8, 2024 Case Management Conference:
 
The parties indicate in their Joint Status Report
filed on April 2, 2024 that they all wish to pursue private mediation and stay
discovery.  The Case Management Conference
is continued to May 13, 2024 at 10:00 am to allow the parties an opportunity to
schedule their mediation.  
 
Discovery and litigation remain stayed
pending mediation.  
 
No later than one week prior to the May 13,
2024 CMC, the parties are to file a Stipulation or Joint Statement: (1)
advising of the date on which the mediation is scheduled to occur, (2) setting
forth the parties’ respective calculations of any period during which the five-year
time period under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310 was tolled by virtue
of the pendency of the appeal, (3) setting forth the current last date by which
the trial must commence pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310, (4)
indicating whether the parties are willing to stipulate to extend the five-year
deadline under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310, and (5) proposing future
dates, including a mediation completion date and class certification motion
filing deadline.
 
The Court’s Judicial Assistant shall give
notice to all parties.
