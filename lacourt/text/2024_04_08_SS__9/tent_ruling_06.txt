 Case Number:  24STCP00374    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  9 On March 18, 2024, the Court’s minute order
noted: “The criminal history assessment by the Clerk’s Office states “No
information found.” It is unclear what is meant by this – whether Petitioner
has not provided sufficient identifying information to enable the Clerk’s
Office to run a criminal history check or instead whether a criminal history
check reveals no convictions. The Clerk must run a criminal history check and provide
the result more clearly.”  The Clerk’s
Office has not re-run the criminal history as requested.  The petition is continued to April 15, 2024
at 9:30 am to enable the Clerk’s Office to run a more comprehensive criminal
history.  The Clerk’s Office must re-reun
the criminal history assessment and provide the results more clearly.  Court Clerk to give notice.
