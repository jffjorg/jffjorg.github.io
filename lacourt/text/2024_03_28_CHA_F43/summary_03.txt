Here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiff, Duda Adams, against the defendants, GG&C 1 LLC and David L. Adams. The plaintiff claims an equitable interest in the property located at 18834 Devonshire, Northridge, California 91324, which was purchased with her own funds. The defendants demurred to the Eighth Cause of Action for Quiet Title and the Twelfth Cause of Action for Equitable Mortgage.

The judge overruled the demurrer to the Eighth Cause of Action, finding that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to survive this stage of the proceedings. The plaintiff claims that she has an equitable interest in the property due to her having funded the purchase of the property and because she has paid to maintain the property since it was purchased in 2007. The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud by David L. Adams are sufficient to support a cause of action for quiet title.

However, the judge sustained the demurrer to the Twelfth Cause of Action for Equitable Mortgage, finding that the plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to maintain a cause of action. The plaintiff has not pled any facts indicating that a security interest would be formed based on Romani cultural understandings or that she was in the role of a creditor. The judge also declined to grant leave to amend the complaint.

The defendants are given 20 days to file an answer to the plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint.
