SUMMARY OF
ACTION AND ANALYSIS
In this case,
the parties’ dispute concerned a rental unit that Plaintiff lived in on
Defendant’s property. The property was in violation of Municipal Code sections.
After a three day bench trial, this Court ruled that Plaintiff was entitled to
damages in the amount of $80,830.00 for Defendant’s violations. After judgment
was entered, Plaintiff filed this motion for attorney fees on October 30, 2023.
Plaintiff requests attorney fees in the amount of $162,630 for the four years
of litigation. 
 
Plaintiff
argues that he is entitled to attorney fees based on Defendant’s violation of
Los Angeles Municipal Code §§ 151.09 and 151.10. Both of those sections allow a
tenant to recover attorney fees for violations of the sections. Plaintiff
further argues that fees incurred were reasonable, particularly when the length
of the litigation is considered. Finally, Plaintiff argues that his attorney’s
hourly rate of $550 is reasonable based on his experience.
 
Defendant
argues in opposition that the motion is without support for the fees and that
the time spent on this case was excessive. Defendant seeks a reduction
multiplier of 50% since only one defendant was found liable, and a further 90%
reduction because, according to Defendant, 90% of the causes of action did not
allow for the recovery of attorney fees. Finally, Defendant argues that a
reasonable amount for attorney fees in this case would be $4,503.20 based on
Los Angeles County Superior Court Rule 3.214.
 
Plaintiff
argues in his reply that all fees incurred were necessary to prove the causes
of action for which judgment was entered. Next, Plaintiff argues that the fees
are completely supported by the ruling of the Court and the evidence presented
in the moving papers. Plaintiff also argues that LA Superior Court Rule 3.214
is inapplicable in this matter. Finally, Plaintiff argues that the fees sought
were reasonably incurred and should be awarded.
 
A prevailing
party is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract,
statute, or law. (See CCP § 1033.5(a)(10); Cal. Civ. Code § 1717(a).) “A
successful party means a prevailing party, and [a party] may be considered
prevailing parties for attorney’s fees purposes if they succeed on any
significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties
sought in bringing suit.” (Bowman v. City of Berkeley (2005) 131
Cal.App.4th 173, 178.)
 
LA Municipal
Code § 151.10 provides, in pertinent part, a landlord who violates this code, “shall
be liable in a civil action to the person from whom such payment is demanded,
accepted or retained for damages of three times the amount by which the payment
or payments demanded, accepted or retained exceed the maximum rent or maximum
adjusted rent which could be lawfully demanded, accepted or retained together
with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the court.”
Likewise, LAMC § 151.09 provides, in pertinent part, as follows, “In addition, any
landlord who fails to provide monetary relocation assistance as required by
Subsection G. of this section shall be liable in a civil action to the tenant
to whom such assistance is due for damages in the amount the landlord has
failed to pay, together with reasonable attorney fees and costs as determined
by court.”
 
Plaintiff
argues that because the Court awarded damages for breach of these two code
sections, then attorney fees are warranted in this action. Plaintiff represents
that the attorney fees are for hours reasonably spent. The Court does not agree
with Defendant’s argument that the motion is without support for the fees. The
fees are clearly allowable under the relevant LA Municipal Code sections.
 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff only prevailed on certain causes of action, so the
attorney fees are not justified or should be reduced. In EnPALM, LLC v.
Teitler (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, the Court of Appeal held that the
degree of success at trial was a factor in setting fees. Here, however, Defendant
made no attempt to parse the billing of Plaintiff’s counsel in that manner or
otherwise demonstrate how time was spent on the other causes of action or on
the other defendant.
 
As for Defendant’s
argument that the fees are not reasonable, Plaintiff has accounted for the
295.7 hours spent on the case over the course of four years. Nothing in
Plaintiff’s statement of services appears to be unreasonable given the length
and nature of the case. Defendant argues that the amount of time to do certain
tasks, such as drafting the complaint, appear to be unreasonable. However,
Defendant says that Plaintiff’s attorney took 9.2 hours to draft the complaint
in this case, but the statement of services provided by Plaintiff only shows 4.3
hours for the actual drafting of the complaint. This appears to be a reasonable
length of time for drafting a complaint. The other times are reasonable, as
well. It is also worth noting that, of the 295.7 hours billed, 32.88 were spent
obtaining the default and default judgment, and then responding to Defendant’s
successful effort to vacate the default. That means that almost 33 hours of the
time spent were due to Defendant’s own conduct. Additionally, Plaintiff’s
counsel’s hourly rate of $550 an hour appears to be reasonable.
 
Finally,
Defendant argues that the fees should be reduced to $4,503.20 based on LA
Superior Court Rule 3.214 which provides that in cases where damages were
between $50,000.01 and $100,000, the amount of fees awarded should be $3,270
plus 4% of the excess over $50,000. Rule 3.214(a) states that its guidelines
apply “unless otherwise determined by the court.”
 
Plaintiff
argues that the Court is not required to follow the fee guidelines because of
the discretion the Rule gives the Court, and case law has shown that attorney
fees awards are not limited by this fee schedule, and courts do not abuse their
discretion when they award fees higher than those provided by the rule. (See Korech
v. Hornwood (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1412, 1423; Crus v. Ayromloo
(2007) 155 Cal.App.5th 1270, 1275.) Based on these cases, the Court is not
required to follow the guidelines, as they are only recommendations and fees in
excess of the guidelines may be awarded.
 
Plaintiff is
the prevailing party in this case. After carefully scrutinizing the case
history and the billing statement, the Court finds that the amount of attorney
fees requested by Plaintiff is reasonable. A total of 295.7 hours over the
course of more than four years is not excessive. Additionally, the Court does
not find that Plaintiff’s hourly rates were unreasonable. No adjustment will be
made to the amount requested by Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney fees is granted in the amount of $162,630.
 
Defendant is
ordered to pay $162,630 to Plaintiff’s attorney within 30 days.
