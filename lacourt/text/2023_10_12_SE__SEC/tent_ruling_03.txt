 Case Number:  23NWCV0008    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  SEC Saenz v.
Riviera Nursing & Convalescent Home Inc. 23NWCV0008
Plaintiff's Ex
Parte Application to Advance Plaintiff's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel is DENIED.
"A party seeking
an ex parte order must notify all parties no later than 10:00 a.m. the court
day before the ex parte appearance, absent a showing of exceptional
circumstances that justify a shorter time for notice..... (CRC
Rule 3.1203(a).)   "An ex parte application must be
accompanied by a declaration regarding notice stating: (1) The notice given,
including the date, time, manner, and name of the party informed, the relief
sought, any response, and whether opposition is expected and that, within the
applicable time under rule 3.1203, the applicant informed the opposing party
where and when the application would be made; (2) That the applicant in good
faith attempted to inform the opposing party but was unable to do so....; or
(3) That, for reasons specified, the applicant should not be required to inform
the opposing party." (CRC Rule 3.1204(b).) Plaintiff's
Counsel's Declaration attached to the Ex Parte Application fails to
establish that today's hearing was properly noticed. Consequently,
Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application is procedurally defective and must be
denied. 
 
The Ex Parte Application is also properly denied
on the merits. Plaintiff's Counsel indicates that continued representation may
result in sanctions to Plaintiff or Plaintiff's Counsel and that "[t]here
is discovery at issue which plaintiff's counsel cannot proceed with under the
circumstances." (Motion 3:13-15.) There are no discovery motions on
calendar until after the Motion to Withdraw is heard on January 24, 2024. 
The Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses previously scheduled for
October 24, 2023, was continued by this Court to be heard on February 13,
2024-- after the Motion to Withdraw is heard. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
