  Case Number:  20NWLC12523    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  SEC Socal Lien
Solutions, LLC v. Jos Little B Trust, 20NWLC12523
Cross-Complainant
HEATHER DAVIS's Ex Parte Application to Shorten Time on Cross-Complainant
HEATHER DAVIS' Motions to Compel Initial Discovery is GRANTED.
Cross-Complainant Heather Davis's (1) Motion to Compel Initial Responses to
Form Interrogatories; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories are ADVANCED from Tuesday, November 7, 2023 to this date
and CONTINUED to Thursday, October 26, 2023 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept.
SE-C. Both motions are already fully briefed, no supplemental briefs may be
filed. Moving Party to give notice. 
 
*Note- Judge, the
Motions were filed on July 18, 2023. Apparently, responses were served after
the Motions were filed. Therefore, the only issue remaining is the issuance of
sanctions. Since both motions are fully briefed and our Oct. 26 calendar is set
pretty light, I don't see any harm in advancing the hearing. Should be a
relatively easy issue.
