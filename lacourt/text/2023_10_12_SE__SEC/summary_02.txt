And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Ex Parte Application to Continue Cross-Defendant ANITRA WASHINGTON's Demurrer to Cross-Complainant ERSSELL REID's Cross-Complaint. The Demurrer was filed on July 7, 2023, and the hearing is set for October 18, 2023. However, the Judge has denied the Ex Parte Application to Continue the Demurrer, as the First Amended Cross-Complaint was filed on September 27, 2023, prior to the date the Opposition was due on October 5, 2023. Additionally, the Judge has placed the Demurrer to Cross-Complaint off-calendar as moot, as the First Amended Cross-Complaint has rendered the Demurrer ineffective. Notice must be given to Defendant Reid.
