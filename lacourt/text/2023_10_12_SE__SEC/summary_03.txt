And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's ex parte application to be relieved as counsel is denied. The application is procedurally defective because it fails to establish proper notice to the opposing party. Additionally, the application is denied on the merits because there are no discovery motions scheduled until after the motion to withdraw is heard. The judge notes that the continued representation by plaintiff's counsel may result in sanctions and that the discovery motions are scheduled after the motion to withdraw. The judge orders the moving party to give notice.
