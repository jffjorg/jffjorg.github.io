This tentative ruling is issued by the Judge presiding over the case Solutions, LLC v. Jos Little B Trust, case number 20NWLC12523. The Judge is considering an Ex Parte Application by Cross-Complainant Heather Davis to shorten the time on her Motion to Compel Initial Discovery. The Motion was originally set to be heard on November 7, 2023, but the Judge has advanced the hearing to October 26, 2023 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. The Motions to Compel Initial Responses to Form Interrogatories and to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories are fully briefed and no supplemental briefs may be filed. The only issue remaining is the issuance of sanctions, and the Judge believes that advancing the hearing will be a relatively easy process.
