Significant Statements:
  - The court has the inherent power to correct clerical errors in its Judgment.
  - The distinction between clerical error and judicial error lies in whether the error was made in rendering the Judgment, or in recording the Judgment rendered.
  - The court's Judgment states that the second and fourth causes of action are denied, and the sixth cause is dismissed without prejudice.
  - Feah moves to amend the Judgment to state that the second and fourth causes of action are dismissed with prejudice.
  - The court is granting Feah's motion to amend the Judgment solely to correct a clerical error.
  - The Judgment is ordered to be amended to reflect that the second and fourth causes of action are dismissed without prejudice, not that they are denied.
