```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the parties' requests for judicial notice and the granting of a mandatory injunction. The court grants the requests for judicial notice of the DOT and NOD recorded against the Property. The court also addresses the defendants' arguments that the Homeowners Bill of Rights does not apply to the Loan and that the statute of frauds prevents oral modification of the TMP. The court finds that the Homeowners Bill of Rights does apply, and that the defendants did modify the loan agreement. The court also finds that the defendants' argument about the statute of frauds is not relevant, as there are many exceptions to the statute, including that the agreement will be performed within a year. The court does not address the issue of bad faith in stipulating to continue the OSC for the parties to negotiate a resolution.
