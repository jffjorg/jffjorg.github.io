And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues prior to the Court Hearing. First, the City is admonished for failing to provide courtesy copies of its opposition documents, in violation of the Presiding Judge's order. Second, the Judge notes that Feah has withdrawn its mandamus claims related to the Dormant Commerce Clause and Electronic Municipal Market Capacity. Third, the Judge refers to the defendants collectively as the "Lewis Group", which includes SIG–El Monte, Tradecraft Farms, and SHL–El Monte. Fourth, the Judge notes that Light Box is now known as Summit Location Plans. Finally, the Judge addresses Feah's request to amend the Judgment as to the second and fourth causes of action, finding that the City did not concede the request as Feah asserted, but instead suggested that any correction should target only the affected causes of action.
