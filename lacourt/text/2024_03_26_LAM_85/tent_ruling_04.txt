            [1] The courts look to the
substance of an injunction to determine whether it is prohibitory or
mandatory.  Agricultural Labor
Relations Bd. v. Superior Court, (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 709, 713.  A mandatory injunction — one that mandates a
party to affirmatively act, carries a heavy burden: “[t]he granting of a
mandatory injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases
where the right thereto is clearly established.”  Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc. v.
Furlotti, (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 187, 1493.


            [2] However, a court may issue an
injunction to maintain the status quo without a cause of action in the
complaint.  CCP §526(a)(3).


            [3] Geneseee requests judicial
notice of (1) the DOT recorded against the Property on September 16, 2019 (RJN
Ex. 1); (2) the NOD recorded for the Property on July 12, 2023 (RJN Ex. 2); and
(3) the NOS recorded for the Property on November 14, 2023 (RJN Ex. 3).  The requests are granted.  Evid. Code §452(c).
            Defendants request judicial notice of (1) the DOT recorded
against the Property on September 16, 2019 (RJN Ex. A); (2) the Corporate
Assignment of DOT recorded on August 12, 2021 (RJN Ex. B); (3) the Corporate
Assignment of DOT recorded on December 22, 2022 (RJN Ex. C); (4) the Assignment
of DOT recorded on June 6, 2023 (RJN Ex. D); (5) the Substitution of Trustee
recorded on July 12, 2023 (RJN Ex. E); (6) the NOD recorded against the
Property on July 12, 2023 (RJN Ex. F); and (7) the NOS recorded for the
Property on November 14, 2023 (RJN Ex. G). 
The requests are granted.  Evid.
Code §452(c).


[4] Defendants respond that California law
requires tender of the amount due to challenge a foreclosure.  Opp. at 5. 
Defendants are incorrect.  The
tender rule has no application to a circumstance where a plaintiff is seeking
to specifically enforce a contract in which the DOT holder agrees not to
foreclose.
Defendants also
argue that the Homeowners Bill of Rights does not apply to the Loan, and they
were under no obligation to modify Genesee’s commercial loan.  Opp. at 6. 
True, but Genesee correctly notes that Defendants did so.  Reply at 5.


[5] Defendants
deny that Selene made an oral amendment and object to the assertion that it did
as hearsay and lacking foundation.  Opp.
at 7.  Genesee replies that the statement
is a party admission. Reply at 6.  This might
be true if Genesee provided foundation evidence about who, when, and where the
representation was made.  It did not do
so.
Defendants also
argue that the statute of frauds prevents oral modification of the TMP.  An agreement for the sale of property must be
in writing and signed by the party to be charged.  Civil Code §1624.  An unsigned oral modification to a loan
agreement is unenforceable due to the statute of frauds.  Secrest v. Security National Mortgage Loan
Trust 2002-2, (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 544, 553.  Opp. at 7. 
Genesee does not reply, but there are many exceptions to the statute of
frauds, including that the agreement will be performed within a year.  See Civil Code §16524(a)(1).  The TMP was intended by the parties to be
fully performed in less than a year.  The
court need not address whether Genesee’s alleged oral modification of the TMP
violated the statute of frauds. 


[6] Given the ruling, the
court need not address Genesee’s argument about bad faith in stipulating to
continue the OSC for the parties to negotiate a resolution.  Reply at 2-3.
