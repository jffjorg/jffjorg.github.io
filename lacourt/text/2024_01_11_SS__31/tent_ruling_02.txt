 Case Number:  21STCV02151    Hearing Date:   January 11, 2024    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  ELIS ISMAEL CASTRO, Plaintiff(s),  vs.  ROBERT M. MAGID LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 20STCV36178  [TENTATIVE] ORDER (1) GRANTING MOTION TO DEEM ADMISSIONS ADMITTED AND (2) DENYING REQUEST FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  January 11, 2024  I. Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted Defendants Roberta Magid aka Roberta A. Magid and Gregory Philip Segal (“Defendants”) propounded requests for admissions (“RFAs”), set one, on pro per Plaintiff Elis Ismael Castro (“Plaintiff”) on February 1, 2023 by mail. (Mot. Decl. Aloyan ¶ 4; Exh. A.) Responses were due on or before March 8, 2023. (Ibid.) To date, Plaintiff has not responded to Defendants’ meet and confer letter or served responses. (Id. at ¶ 5.) The RFAs were mailed to Plaintiff’s last known address on file, found in Plaintiff’s Notice of Ruling on Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. (Id. at ¶ 6.) Defendants therefore seek an order deeming the RFAs admitted and imposing both monetary and terminating sanctions. The instant motion was served on Plaintiff in pro per. The motion is unopposed. Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission under CCP § 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to the motion, nor has Plaintiff otherwise demonstrated that a response to the RFAs were served in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.  Accordingly, Defendants’ RFAs, set one, is deemed admitted against Plaintiff. (CCP §2033.280(b).)     II. Request for Monetary Sanctions Where a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Defendants request monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,485.15 for the instant motion. A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)  Defendants are awarded 1 hour to prepare the motion and one hour to appear at the hearing, all at the requested rate of $195 per hour, for a total of $390 in attorney fees. Further, Defendants are awarded the motion filing fee of $61.65, as costs. Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff. Plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions to Defendants, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $451.65, within twenty (20) days.  III. Request for Terminating Sanctions¿¿ Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a misuse of the discovery process.  A court may impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(d).)  A violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions.  (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.)  Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's orders.  (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.)    A terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with caution."  (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at 793.)  "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."  (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)  While the court has discretion to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions "should be appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery."  (Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at 793.)  "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his discovery obligations."  (Ibid.)  Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information.  (See Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971].) Here, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not responded to any of Defendants’ notices or correspondences. Defendants contend the mail sent to Plaintiff have been returned because of an alleged change of address, and that Plaintiff is avoiding discovery.  However, “[d]iscovery sanctions are intended to remedy discovery abuse, not to punish the offending party. Accordingly, sanctions should be tailored to serve that remedial purpose, should not put the moving party in a better position than he would otherwise have been had he obtained the requested discovery, and should be proportionate to the offending party's misconduct.” (Williams v. Russ (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 1223.) Aside from Plaintiff’s silence in this matter, Defendants cite to no specific violation of any order by the Court to warrant the imposition of terminating sanctions. The Court already granted Defendants’ motion to deem RFAs admitted and request for monetary sanctions, which serves the remedial purpose of Plaintiff’s failure to serve responses to those RFAs. Thus, the addition of imposing terminating sanctions at this time would place Defendants in a better position than warranted. The Court further notes Defendants have a separately filed motion for terminating/evidentiary sanctions, set to be heard on February 23, 2024. The request for terminating sanctions sought in connection with Defendant’s motion to Deem RFAs admitted is therefore denied.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 10th day of January 2024      Hon.
