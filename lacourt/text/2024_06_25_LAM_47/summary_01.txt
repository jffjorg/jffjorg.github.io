And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules in favor of Defendant AJ Global Group's Motion for Summary Judgment. The court finds that the Defendant owes no duty to the Plaintiff to protect its property from criminal activity, citing controlling precedent Royal Neckwear Co. v. Century City (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1146. The warehouse fire was caused by arson perpetrated by an unknown third party, and the Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a triable issue of fact in its negligence claim. The court grants summary judgment in favor of the Defendant.
