Legal Standard
 
The function of a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an
opposing party can show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and, if
not, to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment
if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from
the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” 
(Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.)  “The function of the pleadings in
a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the
function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any
triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge
v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-82.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (Code Civ Proc. § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes,
Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) The lack of opposition by a plaintiff is
not grounds to grant a motion for summary judgment if a defendant cannot meet
their initial burden of proof. (See Thatcher v. Lucy Stores, Inc. (2000)
79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1087.)
 
            Once the
defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that
a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action
or a defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant
requests that the Court take judicial notice of the Complaint in this action. This
request is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d) (court records).
 
Plaintiff’s Evidentiary Objections

Analysis
 
            Defendant
AJ Global Group moves for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s claim for negligence
against it. 
 
To prevail on a claim of
negligence, a plaintiff must prove (1) a duty of the defendant to use due care,
(2) a breach of that duty, and (3) that the breach was the cause of the
resulting injury. (See, e.g., Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12
Cal.4th 913, 917-18.)
 
Here, Plaintiff asserted a claim
against this Defendant for general negligence to recover for property damage,
loss of use, and loss of earning capacity stemming from the destruction of
Plaintiff’s property in a fire at a warehouse located at 1250 Bixby, City of
Industry, CA on December 4, 2020. (See Separate Statement of Undisputed
Material Fact No. 1; Complaint.) Defendant AJ Global owned the warehouse and
leased it to Defendant Pro-Com Products on July 18, 2018, pursuant to a 5-year
lease. (SSUMF Nos. 4, 8.) Plaintiff executed a Consignment Agreement with
Pro-Com on September 9, 2018, and a Memorandum of Understanding on January 13,
2020 (amended June 28, 2020) under which Plaintiff operated and stored product
at the warehouse during Pro-Com’s lease. (SSUMF Nos. 4, 11.) On December 4,
2020, a fire broke out at the warehouse at approximately 8:44 p.m., causing
damage to the warehouse and the loss of Plaintiff’s stock. (SSUMF Nos. 19-26, see
also Complaint.) Investigators for the Los Angeles County Fire Department and
Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department independently determined that the fire
was caused by arson perpetrated by an unknown third party. (SSUMF Nos. 33-34,
36.) Plaintiff does not dispute that the fire was caused by arson, or that the
arson was perpetrated by an unknown third party. (See Separate Statement of
Disputed Fact Nos. 33, 34, 36.) 
 
Defendant contends that under
established case law, it owed no duty to Plaintiff as a landlord to protect
Plaintiff’s property from the criminal acts of an unknown third party. Defendant
relies on the controlling precedent of Royal Neckwear Co. v. Century City
(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1146, in which the Court of Appeal categorically stated
that a commercial landlord owes no duty to safeguard the tenant’s property from
reasonably foreseeable criminal activity of third parties. (Royal Neckwear
Co. v. Century City (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1146, 1151.) In that case, the
appellant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct a jury
that such a duty existed in an action for negligence resulting in the theft of
the appellant’s property from its storefront. (Id. at 1150.) The Court
of Appeal examined a wide range of cases, finding that they spoke to the duty
of a landlord to safeguard its tenant’s safety, before turning to the
California Supreme Court’s 1968 Rowland v. Christian opinion for further
guidance. (Id. at 1151-52; Rowland v. Christian (1968) 69 Cal.2d
108.) 
 
In Rowland, our Supreme
Court examined the history and development of the landlord’s exemption from the
duty to use ordinary care to prevent injury of others with respect to
trespassers or licensees, as opposed to invitees. (Rowland, supra, 69
Cal.2d at 112; Royal Neckwear Co. supra, 205 Cal.App.3d at 1152.) The Rowland
Court noted that this exception arose from “historical considerations stemming
from the high place which land has traditionally held in English and American
thought, the dominance and prestige of the landowning class in England during
the formative period of the rules governing the possessor's liability, and the
heritage of feudalism.” (Rowland, supra, 69 Cal.2d at 113; Royal
Neckwear Co. supra, 205 Cal.App.3d at 1152.) Our Supreme Court concluded
that “increasing regard for human safety” and lack of clarity regarding
application of the common law classifications required a new rule (Rowland,
supra, 69 Cal.2d at 114), ultimately holding that the liability of a
possessor of land is determined by whether the possessor has acted as a
reasonable person in view of the probability to injury of others. (Rowland,
supra, 69 Cal.2d at 119; Royal Neckwear Co. supra, 205 Cal.App.3d at
1152.) 
 
Applying the reasoning of the Rowland
opinion, the Court of Appeal in Royal Neckwear Co. concluded that the
concerns inherent in a situation where a person is injured do not translate to
an action for injury to property, holding that a landlord does not have a duty
to protect a tenant or warn it about loss of its property caused by criminal
conduct. (Royal Neckwear Co., supra, 205 Cal.App.3d at 1152.) As the
Court of Appeal stated, “[w]e cannot find such a duty exists because it is the
tenant that is in the best position to take steps to protect the safety of its
own property; there is no moral blame to be ascribed to a failure to prevent
another's property from being stolen; it would place an onerous financial
burden on a landlord -- which eventually would be passed on to all of its
tenants -- to hold it responsible for the loss of its tenants' property; and a
tenant can easily obtain insurance to cover any such loss.” (Id.) 
 
With this forceful ruling as
support, Defendant contends that Royal Neckwear Co. precludes
Defendant’s liability because it had no duty as a matter of law to protect
Plaintiff from damage to Plaintiff’s property caused by the criminal activity
of a third party. Although Plaintiff attempts to argue the contrary position in
opposition, Plaintiff does not directly engage with the holding of Royal
Neckwear or its effect on this case. Instead, Plaintiff cites to Rowland,
which, as discussed, sets forth a duty of reasonable care to prevent injury to
persons, and an array of cases setting forth general rules for duty
determinations (e.g., Weirum v. RKO General, Inc. (1975) 15 Cal.3d 40, 46),
or cases discussing the obligation of residential landlords to exercise
due care to prevent personal injury or property damage (e.g. Eevans v.
Thomason (1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 978, 984-85; Brennan v. Cockrell
Investments Inc. (1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 796, 801.) These authorities are not
relevant in this case, which concerns only injury to property by a commercial
tenant. 
 
The Court concurs with Defendant.
Controlling precedent explicitly precludes negligence claims against a
commercial landlord for the loss of a tenant’s property caused by the criminal
activity of a third party. As Plaintiff expressly concedes that the warehouse
fire was started by an unknown third party (see SSDF No. 36), the Court finds
that Defendant has demonstrated that Plaintiff cannot prevail on its negligence
theory, and that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a triable issue of fact in
that respect. Defendant AJ Global Group is therefore entitled to summary
judgment on the claims against it. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant AJ Global Group’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
