And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling indicates that the case is not ready for trial due to the failure to receive any FSC materials. The court had previously issued an FSC order on September 28, 2023, but the parties have not complied with it. The judge is giving the parties an opportunity to settle the case, and if they do, the court will set an OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement) for a specific date. If the case has not settled, the court will set a TSC and also an OSC re: Sanctions against each party and counsel (separately) not to exceed $5000 for their failure to follow the court's FSC order.
