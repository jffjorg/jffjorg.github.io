  Case Number:  23SMCV01337    Hearing Date:   December 30, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for an FSC.  The FSC order was given on September 28,
2023.  However, the court has not
received any FSC materials.  If the case
has settled, then that is well and good. 
If not, it means that the parties are out of compliance with the court’s
FSC orders.  In either case, the matter
is NOT READY FOR TRIAL and the trial date is vacated.  
 
If the matter settled, the court will set an OSC re:
Dismissal (Settlement) for the relatively near future at a specific date to
which all agreed.  If the matter has not
settled, the court will set a TSC and also an OSC re: Sanctions against each
party and counsel (separately) not to exceed $5000 for the failure to follow
the court’s FSC order given more than a year ago.
