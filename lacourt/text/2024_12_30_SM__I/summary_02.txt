```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion for trial preference filed by Montgomery, who is over 90 years old and claims her health is failing. The defense argues that there is no proof of Montgomery's age or health, but the court finds these arguments to be without merit. However, the defense raises a more serious concern: Montgomery's deposition reveals that she is not aware she is a plaintiff and does not want to be one. The court is troubled by this and will not force a party to be a plaintiff against their will. Therefore, the court will inquire about Montgomery's awareness of being a plaintiff and whether she was made aware of her role before the lawsuit was filed. If Montgomery wants to withdraw as a plaintiff, the court will also need to determine if the preference motion is proper. Until these issues are resolved, the court is denying the motion for trial preference.
