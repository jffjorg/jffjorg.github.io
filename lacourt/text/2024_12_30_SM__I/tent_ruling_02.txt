 Case Number:  24SMCV03221    Hearing Date:   December 30, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here on a motion for trial preference.  Plaintiff’s counsel asserts that plaintiff
Montgomery is over 90 years old and, given that age, it is self-evident that
her health is failing and that trial must be soon in order to allow her to
participate.  The opposition suggests
that there is no proof that she is over 90 or that her health is failing.  The court finds both of those arguments to be
without merit. 
 
The defense raises a different argument, though, that the
court believes is very troubling. 
Quoting from Montgomery’s deposition, it does not appear that she is
aware that she is a plaintiff and she does not want to be a plaintiff.  The court needs to inquire about this.  The court will not force a party to be a
plaintiff against that party’s will.  Given
the very clear deposition, the court will need to inquire of plaintiff’s
counsel whether plaintiff was made aware that she was a plaintiff before suit
was filed and if so, for an explanation of the deposition.  Further, if plaintiff wants to withdraw as a
party (leaving another plaintiff, as the court understands it, but not one
entitled to preference), then the court will inquire as to whether the
preference motion is proper.  If the
answer is that plaintiff is not capable of knowing, then the court needs to
know whether a GAL needs to be appointed. 
In either case, the court is not going to set a trial date until it
knows who the plaintiff is.  Until that
is resolved, the motion for trial preference is DENIED.
