And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a continuation of the County of Los Angeles' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication of issues. Due to the numerous objections (29) from both parties, the hearing is continued to a date to be set. The parties are ordered to meet and confer in a serious and good faith effort to resolve and eliminate the objections, with the goal of reducing the objections to just a few material issues. If material objections remain unresolved, the parties must file a joint statement outlining the remaining objections and the arguments for each side. The Court will then review the objections and set a revised briefing schedule if necessary.
