And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Judge Beaudet, discloses her relationship with a pickup truck purchase 24 years ago. She and her husband purchased a pickup truck, which developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer agreed to take back the pickup truck and refund the purchase price. The Judge does not believe her experience will cause her to be biased for or against either party. However, if anyone believes otherwise, they have until July 2, 2024, to file a verified statement of disqualification. The hearing on the status conference will be continued to August 15, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the disclosure to new parties and file proof of service. Any new party has 14 calendar days from the date of service to file and serve the statement.
