[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Navy Federal Credit Union (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment
against Defendant Artium AME, Inc. Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount
of $59,530.19, comprising $56,977.14 in damages, $2,029.54 in attorney’s fees,
and $523.51 in costs.
The
Court notes a few defects with the submitted default judgment package. 
            First, on December 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
proof of service indicating that the summons and Complaint were personally
served on “Atrium AME Inc” on November 30, 2023. (Emphasis added.)
However, Plaintiff seeks entry of default judgment against “Artium AME,
Inc.” and the defendant named in the Complaint is “Artium AME, Inc.” (Emphasis
added.) Thus, the spelling of the defendant’s name on the proof of service
appears to be incorrect. 
            Second, this is an action on a loan contract
(Compl., pp. 3-4), but Plaintiff has not provided the original of the note. In
lieu of the original, Plaintiff may also provide a declaration explaining loss
or unavailability, along with a proposed order to accept a copy in lieu of the
original. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1806; Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1118,
1124.)
Accordingly,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment without prejudice. The
Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default
judgment package.
