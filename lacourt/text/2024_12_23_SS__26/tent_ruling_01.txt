  Case Number:  23STUD15432    Hearing Date:   December 23, 2024    Dept:  26 TENTATIVE RULING:
Plaintiff 636
NHP, LLC’s Motion to File First Amended Complaint is DENIED. The Court also sets a TRIAL SETTING CONFERENCE ON MAY 29, 2025 at 9:30 A.M. 
ANALYSIS:
Plaintiff 636 NHP,
LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant unlawful detainer action for possession and
back rent against Defendant Leslie Nicole Walker (“Defendant”) on November 30,
2023. Defendant filed an Answer on December 12, 2023. On July 29, 2024, the
case came for trial and the Court found that possession was no longer at issue.
(Minute Order, 07/29/24.) The case was then transferred to the Limited
Jurisdiction Department. (Minute Order, 08/02/24.)
On September 19,
2024, the Court denied Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment and continued
the trial setting conference to October 30, 2024. (Minute Order, 09/19/24.)
Plaintiff then filed a First Amended Complaint on September 24, 2024 without
leave of court. When neither party appeared at the trial setting conference,
the Court struck the First Amended Complaint on its own motion and set an order
to show cause re: why case should not be dismissed for December 16, 2024.
(Minute Order, 10/30/24.) The order to show was subsequently discharged.
(Minute Order, 12/16/24.)
Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to File First Amended Complaint on November 27, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date.
Discussion
As an initial matter, the Motion was not timely served on Defendant. The
Motion was served on November 27, 2024 by electronic and first-class mail.
(Motion, p. 6.) The minimum notice period for service of the Motion was 16
court days, which fell on November 27, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., §1005.) However,
service by first class mail adds five regular days to the notice period;
service by electronic mail adds two court days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1013, subd.
(a); § 1010.6, subd. (a)(2)(B).) The latest Plaintiff could have served
Defendant with the Motion, therefore, was November 25, 2024.
Plaintiff moves for leave to file
a First Amended Complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 1952.3, which
states in relevant part:
[I]f the lessor brings an unlawful
detainer proceeding and possession of the property is no longer in issue
because possession of the property has been delivered to the lessor before
trial or, if there is no trial, before judgment is entered, the case becomes an
ordinary civil action in which: 
 
(1) The lessor may obtain any
relief to which he is entitled, including, where applicable, relief authorized
by Section 1951.2; but, if the lessor seeks to recover damages described in
paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 1951.2 or any other damages not
recoverable in the unlawful detainer proceeding, the lessor shall first
amend the complaint pursuant to Section 472 or 473 of the Code of Civil
Procedure so that possession of the property is no longer in issue and
to state a claim for such damages and shall serve a copy of the amended
complaint on the defendant in the same manner as a copy of a summons and
original complaint is served.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1952.3, subd.
(a)(1) [emphasis added].) The Motion explains that Plaintiff now seeks to
recover unpaid rent and other damages with respect to the subject property. (Motion,
p. 4:6-7.) However, the Motion offers no citation nor analysis of the request
for leave to amend pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 472 or 473, as
required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1952.3, subdivision (a)(1).) Nor
does the case on which Plaintiff relies pertain to a motion for leave to amend
under sections 472 or 473. That case addressed the liberal amendment standard
following an order by the trial court sustaining a demurrer without leave to
amend. (City of Torrance v. Southern California Edison Company (2021) 61
Cal.App.5th 1071, 1083-1084.)
Also, a motion for leave to amend
a pleading must comply with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1324, which requires a supporting declaration to set forth explicitly what
allegations are to be added and where, and explicitly stating what new evidence
was discovered warranting the amendment and why the amendment was not made
earlier. The motion must also include (1) a copy of the proposed and numbered
amendment, (2) specifications by reference to pages and lines of the allegations
that would be deleted and added, and (3) a declaration specifying the effect,
necessity and propriety of the amendments, date of discovery and reasons for
delay. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, subds. (a), (b).) The supporting
declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel does not meet any of these requirements. 
Conclusion
Plaintiff 636 NHP, LLC’s Motion to File First Amended Complaint is DENIED. The Court also sets a TRIAL SETTING CONFERENCE ON MAY 29, 2025 at 9:30 A.M.
