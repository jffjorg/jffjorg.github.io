And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling is a tentative order overruling the plaintiff's demurrer to the defendants' answer and denying the plaintiff's motion to strike portions of the defendants' answer. The demurrer was filed by the plaintiff, arguing that the defendants' answer fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense. The defendants argued that the demurrer is frivolous and calculated to increase costs of litigation. The court found that the answer is sufficient and that the plaintiff's claims of uncertainty and lack of specificity are without merit. The court also found that the defendants' affirmative defenses are sufficient and that the plaintiff's motion to strike them is denied.
