[TENTATIVE]
ORDER OVERRULING PLAINTIFF’S DEMURRER TO DEFENDANTS’ ANSWER
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF DEFENDANTS’ ANSWER
I.       
BACKGROUND
       This action
arises from injuries sustained by Plaintiff due to the conditions of the
residential real property owned by Defendants and leased to Plaintiff.
Plaintiff alleges 16 causes of action for breach of implied warranty of
habitability and related claims. 
II.     
ARGUMENTS
       Plaintiff
demurs to the answer filed by Defendants, Wily Orios Barrios and W.B.E.
Properties, Inc., (collectively “Defendants”) on grounds it fails to state
facts to constitute a defense, is uncertain and the 51 affirmative defenses do
not refer to the causes of action to which they are intended to answer. They
are “boilerplate” and devoid of facts. Despite meeting and conferring with
defense counsel, the parties have not resolved their differences.  
       In
opposition, Defendants argue that Plaintiff did not specify what part of the
answer is ambiguous, unintelligible, or uncertain. The demurrer is frivolous
and calculated to increase costs of litigation. Alternatively, Defendants ask
for leave to amend.
       In
reply, Plaintiff argues that she has clearly identified the uncertainty of the
affirmative defenses. Defendants’ claim that facts can be ascertained in
discovery is not substantiated by their discovery responses. 
III.   
LEGAL STANDARDS
       A demurrer reaches defects that appear on
the face of the pleading. The court considers the allegations and matters that
are subject to judicial notice. All facts are accepted as true. (Saunders v. Superior Court (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 832, 837–838.) A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations. It does not test their truth, the plaintiff’s ability to prove
them, or the possible difficulty in making such proof. (Saunders at 840.)
       The sufficiency of an
answer depends on the complaint to which it purports to answer. (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 733.) Therefore, the answer does not stand
alone; rather it is read with reference to the facts alleged in plaintiff’s
complaint. The pleading must “minimally advise the opposing party of the nature
of the defense even if defective as conclusory.” (FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 385.) 
       The critical inquiry when a
plaintiff demurs to an answer is whether the answer raises a defense to
plaintiff’s stated cause of action. (Timberidge Enterprises, Inc. v. City of
Santa Rosa (1978) 86
Cal.App.3d 873, 880.) The
demurrer raises the objection that the answer does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a defense. (Id.)  The
answer to a complaint must include any statement of any new matter constituting
a defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.430(b)(2).)
       “New matter” refers to
“something relied on by a defendant which is not put in issue by the plaintiff.
[Citation.] Thus, where matters are not responsive to essential allegations of
the complaint, they must be raised in the answer as “new matter.” (Walsh v. West Valley Mission Community
College Dist. (1998) 66
Cal.App.4th 1532, 1546.) Thus,
“new matter” is “any ground urged in avoidance of the complaint, ie., some
independent reason why plaintiff should be barred from recovery, even if
everything alleged in the complaint was true.” (Walsh at 1546 [“Thus,
where matters are not responsive to essential allegations of the complaint,
they must be raised in the answer as 'new matter.' [Citation.].) Where,
however, the answer sets forth facts showing some essential allegation
of the complaint is not true, such facts are not 'new matter,' but only a
traverse.”]) 
       The answer is liberally
construed with a view to substantial justice between the parties. The answer
should make clear what issues the adverse parties must meet such that when
taken in connection with the complaint, “no reasonable person could be in any doubt
about the issues to be met.” (Hoelzle v. Fresno County (1958) 159 Cal.App.2d 478, 483.)
IV.   
DISCUSSION
       Plaintiff relies
in part on FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1993) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367 which
involved a summary judgment motion and whether or not affirmative defenses
raised in the answer sufficiently placed facts at issue for purposes of the
motion since the facts material to the motion were limited by the allegations
of the pleading. (FPI
at 380.) Since the affirmative defenses raised in FPI were not fact
specific, the court found no facts were placed at issue for purposes of the
motion for summary judgment. 
       Furthermore,
the defenses that the FPI court determined “would not survive demurrer”
were defenses asserting fraud in the inducement and failure of consideration. (FPI
at 385.) Fraud claims typically require specificity in pleading. (Nagy
v. Nagy (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1262, 1268.) Ultimately, FPI observed
that the pleading must “minimally advise the opposing party of the nature of
the defense even if defective as conclusory. (FPI
at 385.) Specificity in pleading is not required since “modern discovery
procedures necessarily affect the amount of detail that should be required in a
pleading.” (Ludgate
Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 608.)
       A
demurrer to an answer is limited to the following: failure to state facts sufficient
to constitute a defense, uncertainty, and failure to allege whether a contract
is written or oral. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.20.) Plaintiff demurs to affirmative defenses 2 through
50 on grounds “no conduct or situation exists for which the alleged relief can
be granted.” This is not a statutory basis for demurrer, and asserts a legal
conclusion without factual context, which cannot be decided at the demurrer
stage in any event.
       Whether
Defendant can assert equitable defenses in its answer is not articulated in Abbott
v. City of Los Angeles (1958) 50 Cal.2d 438, on which Plaintiff
relies. A pleading is required to assert general allegations of ultimate fact.
Evidentiary facts are not required. (Quelimane
Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 47.) The
answer must be read in connection with the complaint, and the allegations must
be liberally construed.  (Hoelzle
v. Fresno County (1958) 159 Cal.App.2d 478, 483; FPI, supra
at 384.)  
       Plaintiff’s
contention that the answer is uncertain is without merit.  A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures. It is inequitable to require Defendant to allege specific
evidentiary facts where discovery has not yet been completed. (Khoury
v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616 [“A demurrer
for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some
respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.”])
       Finally,
the court must disregard errors in pleadings or proceedings, which do not
affect the substantial rights of the parties. (Code Civ. Proc., § 475.) The
primary function of a pleading is to give the other party notice, “and a defect
in a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect
substantial rights.” (Harris
v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240; Code
Civ. Proc., § 475.) Here, Defendants will suffer greater prejudice if the
demurrer is sustained since “a party who fails to plead affirmative defenses
waives them.” (California
Academy of Sciences v. County of Fresno (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1436,
1442.) Moreover, “[d]iscovery necessarily serves the function of ‘testing
the pleadings,’ i.e., enabling a party to determine what his opponent's
contentions are and what facts he relies upon to support his contentions."
(Burke
v. Superior Court of Sacramento County (1969) 71 Cal.2d 276, 281.)

       Plaintiff’s
separate motion to strike the second through 51st affirmative
defenses because they do not refer to a specific cause of action is DENIED for
the same reason as the demurrer is overruled. Any ambiguity can be resolved
through discovery.
V.     
CONCLUSION
       Based on the
foregoing, the demurrer to Defendant’s answer is OVERRULED. Plaintiff’s motion
to strike is DENIED.
