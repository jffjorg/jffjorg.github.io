And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motions to compel discovery are moot since Plaintiff has served verified responses to the discovery requests. However, the judge is ordering monetary sanctions of $2,500 against Plaintiff and/or his counsel to Defendant's counsel, Brigitte M. Mayo, for failing to timely respond to discovery requests and for serving objections to the discovery requests. The sanctions are payable on or before March 15, 2024. The judge is also ordering oral argument on the issue of whether the January 2024 verified responses are in fact Code-compliant and whether Defendant will need to file a Motion to Compel Further responses in the future.
