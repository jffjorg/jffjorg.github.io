English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for a protective order, which sought to allow remote depositions of employees and the PMK. The judge finds that the defendant has not shown that in-person depositions would be unusually or unreasonably burdensome, and that the defendant's business would not be significantly disrupted. The judge also denies monetary sanctions, but reserves the right to reconsider if the depositions are not taken in person by the end of the month. The court continues the hearing on sanctions to February 29, 2024, and will set a court-ordered schedule if the parties cannot agree on a schedule.
