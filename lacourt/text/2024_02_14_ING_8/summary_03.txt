Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment and the alternative motion for summary adjudication. The defendants, Subaru of America, Inc. and Subaru Pacific, moved for summary judgment on the plaintiff's claims for breach of express and implied warranties under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The plaintiff, Vivianne Jean Coe, purchased a used vehicle with a balance remaining on the manufacturer's express warranty. The defendants argued that the Song-Beverly Act does not apply to used vehicles with a balance remaining on the manufacturer's express warranty, citing Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 209. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has presented evidence that the defendants made an express warranty to the plaintiff, and therefore, the Song-Beverly Act may apply. The judge also finds that the defendants have not met their moving burden as to the plaintiff's first cause of action for breach of express warranty. The case is set for hearing on February 14, 2024.
