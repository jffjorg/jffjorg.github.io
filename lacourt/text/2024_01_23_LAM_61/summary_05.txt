And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Emser Tile, LLC to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Crescenta Valley Tile Distributor, Inc. The Judge has OVERRULED the demurrer, meaning that the Plaintiff's claims will proceed.

The Judge's reasoning is that the Plaintiff's schedule of assets, filed in connection with its bankruptcy petition, adequately disclosed the accounts receivable at issue, including the unpaid invoices that the Plaintiff is seeking to recover. The Judge noted that the schedule did not mention the Defendant, but it did include the amount of accounts receivable at issue, which was a reasonable classification given that most of the invoices had not yet come due.

The Judge also distinguished this case from the case of M & M Foods, Inc. v. Pacific American Fish Co., Inc., which held that a bankruptcy disclosure of "unknown" value was not adequate to support a later claim for accounts receivable. Here, the Plaintiff's schedule included the amount of accounts receivable at issue, and the Judge found that this was sufficient to establish the Plaintiff's standing to pursue its claims.

The Judge did not grant leave to amend the complaint, as the Plaintiff's claims, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any theory, and there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.
