And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendants, SSA Terminals, LLC, SSA Terminals (Pier A), Pacific Maritime Services, LLC, and Frank Hall. The motion is granted because the arbitration provision contained in the corporate defendants' Marine Terminal Operator Schedule of Rates, Regulations and Practices (MTO Schedule) is enforceable by the court as an implied contract under 46 U.S.C. § 40501.

The defendants' motion to compel arbitration is based on the arbitration provision contained in the MTO Schedule, which requires arbitration of all disputes between the parties. The plaintiff, Plentitude Transportation, Inc., never executed an agreement containing this provision, but the defendants argue that the arbitration provision is enforceable by the court as an implied contract under 46 U.S.C. § 40501.

The judge rejects the plaintiff's arguments that the arbitration provision is unconscionable and applies to them by the operation of law. The judge also rejects the plaintiff's arguments that the arbitration agreement includes oppressive limitations on discovery and punitive damages.

The judge grants the motion to compel arbitration because the arbitration provision is enforceable by the court as an implied contract under 46 U.S.C. § 40501, and the plaintiff's claims are embraced within the arbitration clause at issue. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's claims are arbitrable and that the defendants have not waived their right to compel arbitration.

The judge's decision is based on the following authorities: Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Center, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 754, 758; Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp. (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 234, 242; AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion (2011) 563 U.S. 333, 339; Medical Staff of Doctors Medical Center in Medesto v. Kamil (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 679; Ajamian v. CantorCO2e, L.P. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 771, 795; Dotson v. Amgen, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 975, 982.
