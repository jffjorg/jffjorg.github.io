And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Ali Shapouri, has moved for summary judgment and adjudication on all claims brought by plaintiff, Maryam Farr, in her First Amended Complaint. The basis for the motion is that the plaintiff's claims are based on oral agreements between her and the decedent, Bahram Shahian, and that these agreements are not sufficiently definite to be enforceable.

The judge has denied the motion. The judge finds that the oral agreements between the parties are enforceable, citing cases such as Marvin v. Marvin and Byrne v. Laura. The judge notes that the decedent promised the plaintiff an interest in the Thurston Property, and that the plaintiff understood this to mean a division between herself and the decedent's children. The judge also finds that the lack of specificity in the decedent's promises does not necessarily render them unenforceable, citing cases that have held that extrinsic evidence can be used to clarify the terms of an agreement.

The judge concludes that the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish a triable issue of material fact and that the motion for summary judgment and adjudication must be denied.
