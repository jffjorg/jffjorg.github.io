```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the first amended complaint and the motion to strike. The demurrer, filed by Doe 1, challenges the third and fourth causes of action for negligent hiring and/or retention, negligent supervision, and negligence. The judge finds that the operative complaint sufficiently articulates these claims and overrules the demurrer.

The motion to strike, also filed by Doe 1, challenges certain paragraphs of the complaint as being based on invalid and unreliable information. The judge denies this motion, finding that the allegations are sufficient and that the motion improperly tries to recharacterize the basis of the complaint.

The judge orders Doe 1 to answer the operative complaint within 10 days of this order and denies the motion to strike.
