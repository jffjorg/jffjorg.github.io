```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents, without prejudice. The judge finds that the responses provided by the defendant were sufficient and compliant with the relevant statutes and regulations. The judge also declines to consider unpublished authority and notes that the motion only addressed the amended responses, which included a mix of representations regarding the lack of documentation under certain key word search terms with identified databases, and a promise of further production. The judge encourages the parties to continue to meet and confer and suggests that a referee may be necessary to supervise electronic production and other court-intensive requests. The trial is set for August 19, 2024.
