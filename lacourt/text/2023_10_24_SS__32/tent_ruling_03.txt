CASE NUMBER:


21STCV44574




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Set Aside Dismissal




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the
  Automobile Club




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
BACKGROUND
 
On December 7, 2021, Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the
Automobile Club (Plaintiff) filed a subrogation action against Defendants
Lisandro Perez, Rosa Fuentes Gonzalez, and Does 1 to 10. 
 
On June 6, 2023, the case was called for trial. Counsel for plaintiff
did not appear and the Court dismissed the complaint without prejudice pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 581(b)(3). (Min. Order, June 6, 2023.) 
 
On July 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to set aside the
dismissal. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a
dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  This application must
be filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
A
mistake is a basis for relief under section 473 when by reason of the mistake a
party failed to make a timely response.  Surprise occurs when a party is
unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without any negligence of his
own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the party has shown some
reasonable excuse for the default.  (Credit Managers Association of
California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d
1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 905.) An “excusable” error means one which a reasonably prudent
person under the same or similar circumstances might have made. (Solv-All v. Superior Court (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1003,
1007.)  Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the
moving party bears the burden of demonstrating an excusable ground, such as
fraud or mistake, justifying a court’s vacating a judgment.  (Basinger
v. Roger & Wells (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)  
 
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) However mandatory relief is only
available when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are
procedurally equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief provision
does not apply to dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals
for failure to serve a complaint within three years [citations omitted],
dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations [citations omitted],
and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement [citations omitted].”
(Id.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Procedurally,
the present motion is timely because it was filed within six months after the
case was dismissed. 
 
            The
Declaration of Judi A. Bailey states that she failed to make sure the final
status conference and trial date in this case were calendared. (Bailey Decl. ¶
5.) She declares this was caused by her “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” (Id.)  The Court
finds that the failure to appear was due to excusable neglect and grants the
motion to set aside the dismissal  
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal.
 
 
The Final Status Conference is set for November 27, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. in
Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Trial is set for December 11, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the
Spring Street Courthouse.
 
            Plaintiff
shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
