And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by a judge regarding a motion to compel subpoenas for records sent to non-party Diagnostic Imaging Networks (DIN). The defendants, Quick Silver Towing, Inc. and Javier Espinoza, filed the motion, but no opposition was filed. The judge finds that the motion is untimely, as it was not brought within 60 days of the completion of the deposition record, and that the meet and confer efforts were insufficient. The judge also notes that the motion was not personally served on the non-party DIN. As a result, the motion is denied. The judge orders that defendants provide notice of the ruling and file proof of service.
