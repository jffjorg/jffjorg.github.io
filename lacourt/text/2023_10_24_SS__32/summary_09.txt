Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a complaint filed by Lizzie Johnson against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA). The demurrer argues that the complaint is uncertain and fails to state facts that Johnson complied with Government Code sections 905 and 945.5. The judge finds that the complaint fails to state facts to constitute a cause of action and sustains the demurrer with leave to amend. The judge also notes that the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to determine if a resolution may be reached, and that any amended complaint must be filed and served within 30 days.
