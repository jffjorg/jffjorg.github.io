And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for terminating sanctions filed by Defendant Executive Investments, Inc. against Plaintiff Robert Myrick. The motion was filed on September 25, 2023, and the hearing is scheduled for October 24, 2023. The judge notes that the Court granted Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff's deposition on August 16, 2023, and that Plaintiff failed to appear for deposition on September 13, 2023.

The judge finds that Plaintiff's failure to appear for deposition is a willful violation of the Court's order and that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. Therefore, the judge is inclined to grant the motion for terminating sanctions, which would result in striking Plaintiff's Answer and granting default judgment in favor of Defendant.

The judge orders Defendant to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such. The judge also notes that if Plaintiff does not appear for deposition and does not contact defense counsel to schedule the deposition, the Court will grant the motion for terminating sanctions.
