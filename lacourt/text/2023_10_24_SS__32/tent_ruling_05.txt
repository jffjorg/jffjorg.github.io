RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


October
  24, 2023




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV16711




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Executive Investments, Inc. 




OPPOSING PARTY:


None
  



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendant Executive Investments, Inc. (Defendant) moves for
terminating sanctions, or in the alternative, monetary sanctions, against
Plaintiff Robert Myrick (Plaintiff) pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450(h). 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
If a party or party-affiliated deponent fails to obey an order
compelling attendance, testimony, and production, a court may impose issue,
evidence, or terminating sanctions against the party who failed to appear.
(Code Civ. Proc., section 2025.450(h).) A court may impose monetary sanctions
in lieu of or in addition to non-monetary sanctions in favor of any party who
attended the deposition in expectation that the deponents testimony would be
taken pursuant to that order. (Id.) 
 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390,
quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores,
supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra, 77
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating
sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and subsequently granting
default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997)
16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the plaintiff
for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various
discovery statutes].)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
On August 16, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel
Plaintiff’s deposition. Plaintiff had previously not appeared at a January 24,
2023 deposition. Plaintiff’s deposition was ordered to occur on September 13,
2023 or another date not to exceed 60 days that the parties agreed to in
writing. (Min. Order, August 16, 2023.) 
 
Defendant provided Plaintiff with notice of the Court’s order on
August 17, 2023 by mail. Counsel for Defendant declares that Plaintiff did not
appear for deposition on September 13 and counsel has received no
communications from Plaintiff to schedule the deposition. (Capra-Cunningham
Dec. ¶ 12.) Trial is presently set for November 17, 2023. No opposition to this
motion has been filed.
 
According to the Court’s prior order, the deposition must occur by October
16, 2023. The motion was filed on September 25, 2023. At the hearing on the
motion, Defendant shall confirm that Plaintiff has still not appeared for
deposition. If Plaintiff has neither contacted defense counsel to schedule a
deposition nor appeared, then the Court will grant the motion for terminating
sanctions.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
