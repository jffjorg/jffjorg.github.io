And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff seeks to stop the foreclosure sale of his real property and enjoin the defendants from selling, trying to sell, or causing to be sold the property. The plaintiff claims that he and his wife will suffer irreparable harm if they are foreclosed upon and evicted, and that losing his residence would disrupt his social network, uproot his family, and subject him to the uncertainty of finding alternative housing. The defendants argue that money is the remedy and that the plaintiff can pay and cancel the foreclosure sale at any time. The court finds that irreparable injury will occur if the sale continues because the plaintiff derives intrinsic value from his home, and therefore grants the motion for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause for a preliminary injunction.
