v. Cervantes, Case No. 22NWCV02905
 
This
is a quiet title action. Plaintiff seeks ex parte relief to amend the
complaint.  
 
Parties
appearing at the ex parte hearing must serve the ex parte application on all
other appearing parties at the first reasonable opportunity. Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1206.) Absent exceptional circumstances, no hearing may be
conducted unless such service has been made. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1206.) 
 
Here,
Plaintiff has not filed proof of service of the ex parte application upon all
parties.    
 
Thus,
the ex parte application is DENIED.  
 
Clerk
