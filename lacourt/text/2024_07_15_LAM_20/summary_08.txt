And here is the English summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' Default Judgment Application against Defendant Fame Gardens LP. The Plaintiffs are seeking a default judgment for $540,000 in damages, but their Complaint fails to make a specific request for damages. The Judge holds that under California Civil Procedure Code ยง 580, the relief granted to the plaintiff cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint if there is no answer. Since the Complaint does not specify a specific amount of damages, the Plaintiffs can either accept the jurisdictional minimum of $25,001 in damages or amend the Complaint's allegations as to damages, which would be a material change opening the Defendant's default. The Default Judgment Application is denied without prejudice, and the Plaintiffs are required to give notice.
