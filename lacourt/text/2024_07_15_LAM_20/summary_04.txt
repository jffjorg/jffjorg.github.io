And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in an employment action case. The plaintiff, Laurie Ramsey, is seeking to compel the defendants, Clearmark Title Company and John Macias, to provide further responses to her form interrogatories. The defendants have failed to provide timely and complete responses, and the judge has determined that their responses show an intent to obstruct discovery. The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel in part, ordering the defendants to provide additional information. The judge has also awarded the plaintiff reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,250. The motion is denied as to some of the interrogatories, and the defendants are ordered to provide responses to the remaining ones.
