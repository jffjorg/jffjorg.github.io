This is an employment action.  Plaintiff Laurie Ramsey seeks to compel Defendants Clearmark Title Company (“Clearmark”) and John Macias to provide further responses to her form interrogatories (“FI”), set one—general and employment.  The Court rejects Defendants’ arguments about a meet and confer effort because Defendants received multiple extensions of time and failed to even provide supplemental responses to all discovery at issue.  Also, Defendants’ responses often show an intent to obstruct discovery.  Plaintiff does not have a duty to play cat-and-mouse games in perpetuity. The Motion is denied as to FI nos. 4.1 and 214.1 because Clearmark indicates that the declarations page of its liability insurance has now been provided.The Motion is granted as to FI nos. 2.5 and 2.6 because Macias’ address and basic employment information is discoverable. The Motion is granted as to FI no. 2.11 because Macias failed to explain his duties and the interrogatory quite clearly relates to the time of the incident.  The Motion is granted as to FI no. 201.6 because the answer provided is evasive and non-responsive.  The Motion is granted as to FI no. 207.1 because the reference to documents has no specificity.The Motion is granted as to FI no. 209.2 because the objections to an approved form interrogatory lack merit under the circumstances here.In sum, the Motion is granted in part as set forth herein.  The Court awards Plaintiff reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,250.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
