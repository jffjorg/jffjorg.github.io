And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on several motions filed by the defendants. The demurrer filed by Dash Radio, Inc. and Kevin Tsujihara was found to be moot due to the filing of the First Amended Complaint. The defendants Matt Michelsen, Ron R. Goldie, Scott P. Keeney, and Michael Zeisser moved to quash service of summons, claiming that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over them. Since the plaintiffs did not file an opposition to this motion, the burden to demonstrate facts justifying jurisdiction in California was not met. Therefore, the motions to quash service of summons were granted. The judge encourages counsel to submit on the tentative or appear remotely via LACourtConnect instead of in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
