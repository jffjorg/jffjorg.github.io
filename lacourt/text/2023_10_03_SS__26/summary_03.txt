And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to the demand for production of documents and to deem requests for admission admitted. The defendant, Quinetta Wright, is ordered to serve verified responses to the demand for production without objection within 20 days of service of this order. The defendant is also ordered to pay sanctions of $715.00 to the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days of service of this order. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to timely respond to the requests for production constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and that sanctions are appropriate.
