 Case Number:  21STLC07880    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  26   
Hardy Bros. Equipment Co., Inc. v. 3531 Trucking,
Inc., et al.MOTION
TO VACATE JUDGMENT; QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS
(CCP §§ 473.5, 473(b), (d), 418.10)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant 3531 Trucking, Inc.’s Motion to Vacate
Default and Default Judgment; and Quash Service of Summons is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Hardy Bros Equipment Co., Inc., (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for breach of contract against Defendants 3531
Trucking Inc. (“Defendant”), Miguel Miranda, Peter Cruz, Jr., and Peter Cruz (“the
individual Defendants”) on November 3, 2021. The individual Defendants were
dismissed on October 13, 2022. Following Defendant’s failure to file a
responsive pleading, the Court entered its default on October 13, 2022 and
default judgment on November 8, 2022. 
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Vacate Default
Judgment, additionally seeking to quash service of the Summons, on May 4, 2023.
The Motion came for hearing on June 6, 2023 at which time the Court continued
the matter to allow Defendant to serve the papers on Plaintiff and obtain
counsel. (Minute Order, 06/06/23.) 
 
To date, no substitution of attorney nor proof of service of
the motion papers has been filed by Defendant. 
 
Discussion
 
As the Court previously noted, the Motion involves
procedural defects that must be corrected before it can be heard on the merits.

 
First, the Motion was filed by
Defendant, a corporation, in properia persona through its agent for service of
process, the now-dismissed Defendant Miguel Miranda. (Motion, p. 1; Miranda
Decl., ¶7.) However, it is black letter law that a
corporation cannot represent itself in court. (Clean Air Transport Systems
v. San Mateo County Transit Dist. (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 576, 578 (citing Merco
Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 729-730).)
This rule applies to all entities regarded as separate from their owners,
including partnerships and unincorporated associations. (See Clean Air
Transport Systems, supra, 19 Cal.App.3d at 578.) Defendant filed the
instant Motion without proper legal representation, and it must appear
through an attorney going forward. 
 
Second, the Motion is not
accompanied by a proof of service demonstrating that it, or notice of the
hearing date, was served on Plaintiff. Failure to give notice of a motion is
not only a violation of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) 
 
Despite a four-month opportunity
to correct these defects, Defendant has not done so. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore,
Defendant 3531 Trucking, Inc.’s Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment;
and Quash Service of Summons is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
