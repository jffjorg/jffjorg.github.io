ANALYSIS:
 
On October 8, 2021, Plaintiffs Tanya
Smith, Jayla Smith, by and through guardian ad litem Tanya Smith, and Janiyah
Burr, by and through guardian ad litem, Tanya Smith
(“Plaintiffs”), filed the
instant action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendants Santrell
Robinson and Jakes Gist (“Defendants”). Defendants have not filed a responsive
pleading and the case came for trial on April 7, 2023. When Plaintiff failed to
appear at trial, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice. (Minute
Order, 04/07/23.) 
 
Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on
July 24, 2023. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this
statute, an application for relief must be made no more than six months after
entry of the order from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an
affidavit of fault attesting to the moving party’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON
Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) When based on attorney
fault with respect to entry of default, default judgment, or involuntary
dismissal, a timely request for relief must be granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the provision for discretionary
relief based on party fault, the request must have been filed within a
reasonable amount of time. 
 
The Motion was timely filed within six months of dismissal
of the action and is supported by an affidavit of attorney fault. Plaintiffs’
counsel declares that they did not appear at the April 7, 2023 trial date due
to a calendaring error. (Motion, Yeager Decl., ¶¶2-3.) Therefore, the case must
be reinstated under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).

through guardian ad litem, Tanya Smith, to Vacate Dismissal is GRANTED. THE
DISMISSAL ENTERED ON APRIL 7, 2023 IS HEREBY VACATED.
