ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Westlake Services, LLC dba Westlake Financial
Services (“Plaintiff”) propounded Demand for Production of Documents, Set One,
and Requests for Admission, Set One, on Defendant Quinetta Wright (“Defendant”)
on April 27, 2023. (Motions, Friedman Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer
effort, to date, no responses have been served. (Id. at ¶3 and Exh. B.)
 
Plaintiff filed the instant (1) Motion To Compel Responses
To Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request For Sanctions; and
(2) Motion To Deem Requests For Admission, Set One, Admitted and Request For
Sanctions on August 7, 2022. To date, no opposition has been filed. 
 
Discussion
 
Based on Defendant’s failure to serve initial responses, the
Motions to compel responses to the demand for production, and to deem
admissions admitted, are granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.300; 2033.280.)
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to
compel initial responses or deem admissions admitted can be filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; 2033.280.) Further, the motions can be brought at
any time after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2031.300; 2033.280.) Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to an order
compelling Defendant to serve verified responses to the demand for production
without objections. The Court also deems the requests for admission admitted
against Defendant. 
 
Defendant’s failure to timely respond to the requests
constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2033.280, 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed. However, the
amount sought is excessive under a lodestar calculation. Therefore, the
requests for sanctions are granted against Defendant in the total amount of
$715.00 based on one hour of attorney time billed at $595.00 an hour, plus $120.00
in costs. (Motions, Friedman Decl., ¶5.) The sanctions are to be paid within 20
days’ service of this order.
 
Conclusion

Services’ (1) Motion Compelling Responses
to Demand for Production of Documents,
Set One, and for Monetary Sanctions; and (2) Motion Deeming Requests for
Admission, Set One, Admitted and for Monetary Sanctions are GRANTED.
DEFENDANT QUINETTA WRIGHT IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO
THE REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT QUINETTA

WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
