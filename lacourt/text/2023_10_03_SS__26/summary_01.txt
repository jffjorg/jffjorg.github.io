And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of the plaintiffs, Tanya Smith, Jayla Smith, and Janiyah Burr, to vacate the dismissal of their action against the defendants, Santrell Robinson and Jakes Gist. The action was originally dismissed without prejudice on April 7, 2023, after the plaintiffs failed to appear at trial. The plaintiffs have now filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, alleging that their attorney made a calendaring error and that they did not intend to miss the trial date. The judge has found that the motion was timely filed and that the plaintiffs' attorney has provided an affidavit attesting to the mistake. As a result, the judge has vacated the dismissal and set an order to show cause for December 4, 2023, to determine whether the defendants will be entered with default or the case will be dismissed.
