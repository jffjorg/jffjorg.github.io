The judge has granted the motion of the plaintiffs, Tanya Smith, Jayla Smith, and Janiyah Burr, to vacate the dismissal of their action against the defendants, Santrell Robinson and Jakes Gist. The action was originally dismissed without prejudice on April 7, 2023, after the plaintiffs failed to appear at trial. The plaintiffs have now filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, alleging that their attorney made a calendaring error and that they did not intend to miss the trial date. The judge has found that the motion was timely filed and that the plaintiffs' attorney has provided an affidavit attesting to the mistake. As a result, the judge has vacated the dismissal and set an order to show cause for December 4, 2023, to determine whether the defendants will be entered with default or the case will be dismissed.

## English Text Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiffs' Motion to Vacate Dismissal in the case of *Smith, et al. v. Robinson, et al.*  

The case was originally dismissed without prejudice on April 7, 2023, because the Plaintiffs failed to appear at the trial. The Plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the dismissal on July 24, 2023, attributing their absence to a calendaring error. 

Since the motion was filed within the required six-month timeframe and supported by an affidavit of attorney fault, the judge is obligated to grant the motion under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). 

The judge has vacated the dismissal and set an Order to Show Cause hearing for December 4, 2023, to address the possibility of default or dismissal in the future.
