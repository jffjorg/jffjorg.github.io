And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, 3531 Trucking, Inc., has filed a motion to vacate the default judgment and quash the service of summons. The court has reviewed the motion and finds that it is defective and must be denied. The defendant has failed to appear through an attorney, as required by law, and has not provided proof of service of the motion papers on the plaintiff. The court has given the defendant four months to correct these defects, but it has failed to do so. Therefore, the motion is denied.
