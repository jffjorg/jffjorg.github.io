## English Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant 3531 Trucking, Inc.'s Motion to Vacate Default Judgment and Quash Service of Summons.

The Judge finds that the Motion has several procedural defects. First, the Defendant, a corporation, filed the Motion in propria persona (without an attorney), which is not allowed. Second, the Defendant failed to provide proof of service showing that the Motion and hearing notice were properly served on the Plaintiff. 

The Judge previously granted the Defendant additional time to correct these defects but they have not done so. Therefore, the Motion is denied.

English text:
The Judge's tentative ruling in Case Number 21STLC07880, scheduled for a hearing on October 3, 2023, in Dept 26, denies Defendant 3531 Trucking, Inc.'s Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment; and Quash Service of Summons. The Plaintiff, Hardy Bros Equipment Co, Inc., filed a breach of contract action against Defendants 3531 Trucking, Inc., Miguel Miranda, Peter Cruz, Jr., and Peter Cruz on November 3, 2021. Defendants failed to file a responsive pleading, leading to a default and default judgment. Defendant filed the instant Motion on May 4, 2023, without proper legal representation and without serving notice to Plaintiff. Despite a four-month opportunity to correct these defects, Defendant has not done so. The Motion involves procedural defects, and the Court cannot hear it on the merits until these are corrected.
