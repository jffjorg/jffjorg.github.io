And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Joseph Sudol against Defendant Synchrony Bank. The dispute arises from alleged dental malpractice and subsequent claims against a financial institution.

The Court finds that the demurrer is sustained due to the following reasons: (1) the statute of limitations for personal injury claims, including intentional torts, is two years, and Plaintiff did not file the original complaint until March 8, 2024, well beyond the two-year deadline; (2) the FAC fails to allege any specific facts that would support a claim for intentional tort against Defendant; (3) the claim for general negligence is time-barred by the statute of limitations and fails to allege sufficient facts to establish the elements of negligence.

The Court also notes that Plaintiff's allegations primarily concern the conduct of the Dental Office, not Defendant, and that Plaintiff acknowledges having already recovered damages from the Dental Office, which precludes seeking double recovery.

Based on these findings, the Court sustains the demurrer to the FAC without leave to amend.
