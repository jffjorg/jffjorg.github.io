  Case Number:  24NNCV00112    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEFENDANT’S
DEMURRER TO FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMENDI.         INTRODUCTION
This action arises from a dispute
involving alleged dental malpractice and subsequent claims against a financial
institution. Plaintiff Joseph Sudol (“Plaintiff”), acting in pro per, alleges
that in August and September 2021, he received dental treatment at a practice
owned or operated by Michael Balikyan and Alan Lavian (“Dental Office”).
Plaintiff contends that the dental treatment was improperly performed, causing
him harm.
On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed
this lawsuit against Defendant Synchrony Bank (“Defendant”), the issuer of the
credit card used to pay for the dental services, asserting that Defendant is
liable for damages related to the dental treatment. 
On June 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint (FAC), asserting causes of action for (1) Intentional Tort
and (2) General Negligence. On July 10, 2024, and October 8, 2024, Defendant
filed a demurrer, arguing that Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the statute of
limitations and fail to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.
Plaintiff filed an opposition on September 9, 2024, October 9, 2024, and November
25, 2024.
 
Meet and Confer
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a), the demurring party is required to meet and
confer with the party who filed the pleading at least five days before the
responsive pleading is due. This must occur in person, telephone or by video
conference with the aim of resolving any objections raised in the demurrer.
Additionally, the demurring party must file and serve a declaration detailing
the meet and confer efforts. It should be noted, however, that the failure to
meet and confer is not itself grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer
or granting or denying a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd.
(a)(4), 435.5, subd. (a)(4).)
Here, Defendant filed a declaration
of meet and confer in compliance with the statutory requirements. The
declaration indicates that on September 30, 2024, counsel for Defendant emailed
Plaintiff at the address provided in the pleadings outlining the basis for the
intended demurrer and inviting Plaintiff to discuss the matter. (Warner Decl.,
¶ 2b.) Later that same day, at 10:55 a.m., Defendant’s counsel attempted to
contact Plaintiff by telephone at the number listed in the complaint to further
discuss the issues raised. (Warner Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff did not respond to
the email or telephone call as of the time the declaration was executed.
(Warner Decl., ¶ 4.)
The Court finds that Defendant has
complied with the meet and confer requirement.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. A plaintiff’s allegations
must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable”
they are. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be
accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.) 
Pleadings are to be broadly
construed (Code Civ. Proc., § 452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the
facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.)
Pursuant to CCP § 335.1, an action
for injury to an individual cause by the neglect of another must be filed
within two years. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain. Demurrers
for uncertainty are disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible
a defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
III.      ANALYSIS
Defendant demurs to the first and
second causes of action, arguing that they are time-barred and fail to state
sufficient facts to constitute a claim against Defendant. Additionally,
Defendant contends that the request for punitive damages is unsupported by
sufficient factual allegations.
The Court notes discrepancies in
the causes of action alleged by Plaintiff in the FAC Plaintiff lists “general
negligence” and “intentional tort” as causes of action, while the attached
declaration references additional claims, including “discrimination” and
“personal injury.” For purposes of this ruling, the Court will address only the
causes of action expressly identified in the FAC: intentional tort and general
negligence.
 
First cause of action: Intentional Tort
Defendant argues that the first
cause of action for intentional tort is barred by the applicable statute of
limitations. Under California Code of Civil Procedure § 335.1, the statute of
limitations for personal injury claims, including intentional torts, is two
years. This means that a plaintiff must file their complaint within two years
of the date the injury occurred or the wrongful act giving rise to the claim
took place.
In this case, Plaintiff alleges
that the dental treatment at issue occurred in August and September 2021. As
such, any claims arising out of these events must have been filed by September
2023. However, Plaintiff did not file the original complaint until March 8,
2024—well beyond the two-year deadline.
In Opposition, Plaintiff contends
that the claim arose on September 6, 2022, based on Defendant’s alleged failure
to respond to a request for records. Plaintiff appears to argue that this later
date triggers a new statute of limitations period. However, the statute begins
to run when the alleged wrongful act or injury first occurs, which in this case
is tied to the dental treatment performed in 2021 and the associated claims of
harm stemming from that treatment.
In addition to being time barred,
the Court finds that the FAC fails to allege any specific facts that would
support a claim for intentional tort against Defendant. Plaintiff does not
identify any intentional acts by Defendant, nor does he articulate how such
acts caused his alleged harm. The Court further notes that Plaintiff’s
allegations primarily concern the conduct of the Dental Office, not Defendant.
Plaintiff’s assertions of wrongdoing by Defendant, unsupported by factual
allegations, are insufficient to state a claim for intentional tort.
Accordingly, the demurrer to the
first cause of action is sustained without leave to amend.
Second cause of action: General Negligence
Defendant demurs to this cause of
action, arguing that Plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to meet
the required elements of negligence and that the claim is time-barred by the
statute of limitations.
The elements for negligence are:
(1) a legal duty owed to the plaintiff to use due care; (2) a breach of that
duty; (3) causation; and (4) damage to the plaintiff. (County of Santa Clara
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318.) Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 335.1, any action for negligence must be commenced
within two years. For a demurrer to a complaint to be sustained on the basis of
the statute of limitations, the defect must be clearly and affirmatively set
forth in the pleadings. (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007)
153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1316.)
The Court finds that as discussed
above, the two-year limitation applies here since Plaintiff alleges that the
dental treatment at issue occurred in August and September 2021. Consequently,
the two-year statute of limitations expired no later than September 2023. Since
Plaintiff did not file the original complaint until March 8, 2024, the claim is
time-barred.
In addition to being time-barred,
Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to establish the elements of
negligence. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant had a duty to investigate and
evaluate the quality of dental services paid for using Defendant’s credit card
services. For breach, Plaintiff does not allege specific actions or omissions
by Defendant that would constitute a breach of duty. General claims that
Defendant “neglected disputes” or failed to act in Plaintiff’s favor are
insufficient to establish actionable conduct.
Plaintiff also fails to demonstrate
how Defendant’s actions or omissions were the proximate cause of his injuries.
The FAC attributes Plaintiff’s harm primarily to the conduct of the Dental
Office, not to Defendant. Without a direct causal link between Defendant’s
actions and Plaintiff’s injuries, the negligence claim cannot stand.
Finally, while Plaintiff alleges
damages, including punitive damages, pain and suffering, and financial losses,
he fails to provide specific facts linking these damages to Defendant’s
conduct. Furthermore, Plaintiff acknowledges that he already recovered damages
from the Dental Office. Under California law, a plaintiff cannot seek double
recovery for the same harm. (Tavaglione v. Billings (1993) 4 Cal.4th
1150, 1158; Sanchez v. Martinez (2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 535, 544; Heller
v. Pillsbury Madison & Sutro (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1390; Plotnik
v. Meihaus (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1590, 1602.)
Based on the foregoing, the Court
SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to the second cause of action without leave to
amend.
