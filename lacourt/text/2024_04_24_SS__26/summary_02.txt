The plaintiff, Pacific Coast Highway Powersports, LLC, seeks attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $208,770.49. The defendant, Piaggio Group Americas, Inc., opposes the plaintiff's request. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney's fees and grants the plaintiff's motion in the amount of $208,770.49. The court reduces the amount of attorney's fees billed by the plaintiff's counsel for the trial proceedings prior to the appeal and for the appeal of the initial motion for attorney's fees. The court also finds that the plaintiff's counsel's billing records are unreasonable and reduces the amount of attorney's fees awarded accordingly.
