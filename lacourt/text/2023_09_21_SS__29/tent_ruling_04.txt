The motions to compel are GRANTED. The
requests for sanctions are GRANTED in part.
 
Background
 
On January 20, 2021, Plaintiff Carmen
Libaridian (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Charles
Huenergardt (“Defendant”) for damages arising from a motor vehicle collision.
The Complaint asserts two causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and
general negligence. 
 
On August 28, 2023, Defendant filed motions
to compel initial responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One). Defendant
also requests monetary sanctions. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
A
party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
A
party must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).) In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” Where a party or
attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a
monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
 
Discussion
 
On March 16, 2023, Defendant served Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One) on Plaintiff.
(All Nachiappan Decl. Ex. A.) Defense counsel granted several extensions to
allow time for Plaintiff to serve responses. (All Nachiappan Decl. ¶¶ 5-8.)
However, as of the date of filing the motion, Defendant has not received a
response to the discovery requests. (All Nachiappan Decl. ¶ 10.) 
 
Defendant need show no more. The Court grants Defendant’s motions to
compel initial responses. 
 
The Court also grants, in part, Defendant’s requests sanctions. In light
of the relatively straightforward nature of a motion to compel initial
responses, as well as the economies of scale associated with preparing multiple
parallel discovery motions, the Court awards sanctions on each motion in the
amount of $412.50 (calculated based on 1.5 hours for each motion, multiplied by
counsel’s billing rate of $235 per hour, plus the filing of fee of $60). 
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motions to compel.
 
Plaintiff is ORDERED to provide verified, code-compliant, written
responses, without objection, to Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One) within 30 days
of notice of this order.
The Court GRANTS in part Defendant’s requests for sanctions.
 
Plaintiff is ORDERED to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant in the total
amount of $1,237.50 ($412.50 per motion, multiplied by three motions) within 30
days of notice of this order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
