 Case Number:  20STCV49708    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
The motion to be relieved is denied
without prejudice.
 
Background
 
On December 29, 2020, Plaintiff Lavel
Flowers filed a complaint against Defendants City of Los Angeles and Donald
Dozier for (1) negligence and (2) vicarious liability for injuries arising from
a motor vehicle collision. 
 
Trial is currently set for September 21,
2023.
 
On September 12, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel,
Theida Salazar filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. No opposition has
been filed. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
The court may order that an attorney be
changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted
to withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it
unreasonable to continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof.
Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion
to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must
be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
The requisite forms must be served on the
client and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order
relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the
client has been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has filed the requisite forms pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362.
Counsel has served the forms on Plaintiff and confirmed Plaintiff’s address by
mail with return receipt requested. 
Counsel has also explained that there has been a breakdown in
communication between attorney and client, which is often a sufficient basis to
grant a motion to be relieved.
 
For at least two reasons, however, the Court cannot grant the motion at
this time.
 
First, counsel has presented no proof of service or evidence showing that
the motion and supporting papers were served on opposing counsel. That is
required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).  
 
Second, trial is currently scheduled for September 21, 2023, the same day
as the hearing on the motion to be relieved. Absent a continuance of trial, the
Court has substantial concerns about potential prejudice to the client.
 
Finally, the Court notes that counsel has attached to the motion an email
from counsel to the client. The Court directs counsel to review the email to
determine whether it may inadvertently include any material that is protected
by the attorney-client privilege.
 
Conclusion
 
The motion to
be relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Moving party
to give notice.
