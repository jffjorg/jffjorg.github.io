The motion was filed by Theida Salazar, counsel for Plaintiff Lavel Flowers, who seeks to withdraw due to a breakdown in communication between attorney and client. The Judge notes that the requisite forms have been filed and served on the client, but that proof of service on opposing counsel has not been presented. Additionally, the Judge is concerned about potential prejudice to the client due to the upcoming trial date of September 21, 2023. The Judge directs counsel to review an attached email to determine whether it may inadvertently include material protected by the attorney-client privilege.
