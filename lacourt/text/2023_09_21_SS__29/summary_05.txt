And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to continue trial to a date convenient to the court on or after May 13, 2024. The judge finds that there is good cause for continuing the trial date due to the hearing on the defendants' motion for summary judgment being set after the current trial date, and the unavailability of the defendants' trial counsel due to health concerns. The parties have stipulated to the new trial date, and it does not appear that the parties would be prejudiced by the continuance.
