## English Summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to continue the trial date in case 21STCV12847. The original trial date was December 5, 2023, but due to scheduling conflicts and the unavailability of defense counsel, the trial will now be held on or after May 13, 2024. The Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which requires a hearing scheduled for December 13, 2023, after the original trial date.  

The Judge considers this a valid reason to continue the trial and notes that all parties have agreed to the new date. The Final Status Conference and other deadlines will be reset based on the new trial date.
