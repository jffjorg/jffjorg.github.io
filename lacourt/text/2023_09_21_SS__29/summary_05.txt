## English Summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to continue the trial date in case 21STCV12847. The original trial date was December 5, 2023, but due to scheduling conflicts and the unavailability of defense counsel, the trial will now be held on or after May 13, 2024. The Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which requires a hearing scheduled for December 13, 2023, after the original trial date.  

The Judge considers this a valid reason to continue the trial and notes that all parties have agreed to the new date. The Final Status Conference and other deadlines will be reset based on the new trial date.

## English Summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the defendants' motion to continue the trial date.  

The defendants requested the continuance because the Court's schedule requires the hearing on their Motion for Summary Judgment to take place after the current trial date. Additionally, the attorney representing the defendants has health concerns that prevent them from being available for trial in March and April 2024. The parties have agreed on a new trial date of May 13, 2024, or later if needed. 

The judge found that good cause exists for the continuance since the hearing on the summary judgment motion is delayed due to a busy court calendar, and the parties have agreed to the new trial date.
