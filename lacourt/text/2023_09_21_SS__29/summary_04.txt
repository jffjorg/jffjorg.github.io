The judge ruled in favor of the Defendant, Charles Huenergardt, and ordered the Plaintiff, Carmen Libaridian, to respond to outstanding discovery requests. The Plaintiff failed to respond to interrogatories and requests for production served by the Defendant in March 2023.

Since the Plaintiff did not oppose the Defendant's motion to compel, the judge granted the motion without further argument. The judge also imposed a monetary sanction of $412.50 on each of the three discovery motions (interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production), totaling $1,237.50. This sanction was awarded due to the straightforward nature of the motions and the efficiency of handling them together.

The Plaintiff has 30 days from the date of the order to provide the requested responses.
