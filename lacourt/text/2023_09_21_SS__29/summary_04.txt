The judge also grants in part the defendant's requests for sanctions, ordering the plaintiff to pay a total of $1,237.50 for failing to respond to discovery requests. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond was unreasonable and that the defendant has shown no substantial justification for the delay. The judge awards sanctions in the amount of $412.50 for each motion, for a total of $1,237.50.
