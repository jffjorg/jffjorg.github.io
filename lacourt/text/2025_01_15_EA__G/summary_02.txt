Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Ana Massiel Garcia Castro to the amended answer filed by Marvin Antonio Hernandez and L.A. Specialty Produce Co. Inc. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the defendants' affirmative defenses.

The court has sustained the demurrer in part, specifically as to the third, seventh, and eighth affirmative defenses, and has granted Garcia Castro 20 days to amend those defenses. The court has overruled the demurrer as to all other grounds.

The court's analysis focuses on the third affirmative defense, which alleges active and passive conduct by Garcia Castro or others. The court finds that this defense is insufficiently pled, as it does not include any supporting allegations.

The court also sustains the demurrer to the seventh affirmative defense, which alleges failure to mitigate, as it fails to include any allegations establishing how Garcia Castro failed to mitigate.

Finally, the court sustains the demurrer to the eighth affirmative defense, which alleges waiver and estoppel, as it does not include any allegations to support these defenses.

The court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 431.30, 430.20, and 431.30, subd. (g), as well as case law.
