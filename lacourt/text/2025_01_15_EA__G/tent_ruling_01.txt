  Case Number:  22PSCV03040    Hearing Date:   January 15, 2025    Dept:  G Plaintiff Theodore Thomas Cucuro’s Motion for Leave to  File A Second Amended Complaint for Damages Respondent: Defendant Doe  Association 1 TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff Theodore Thomas Cucuro’s Motion for Leave to  File A Second Amended Complaint for Damages is GRANTED. Plaintiff Theodore Thomas Cucuro is ordered to file the proposed Second  Amended Complaint separately with the Court  forthwith. BACKGROUND This  is an action for childhood sexual assault. On December 22, 2022, Plaintiff  Theodore Thomas Cucuro filed a complaint against Defendants Doe Association 1,  Doe Association 2, Doe Association 3, Doe National Counsel, Doe Perpetrator,  and Does 6-50, alleging causes of action for (1) sexual assault of a minor and  (2) negligence. On  November 27, 2023, Cucuro filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the  same defendants alleging the same causes of action. On  December 21, 2023, Cucuro dismissed Doe Association 3. On  December 11, 2024, Cucuro filed the present motion. A hearing on the present  motion is set for January 15, 2025, along with a further case management  conference and OSC Re: Default Judgment Setting as to Doe Perpetrator. ANALYSIS Cucuro  seeks leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) that adds Doe Association  4 as a defendant. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS Cucuro’s  motion. Legal  Standard “A  court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow  a party to amend any pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) The  court’s discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit amendments of  the pleadings. (Nestle v. City of Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920,  939.) “A motion to amend a pleading before trial must . . . [s]tate what allegations in the  previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page,  paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations are located; and [s]tate what allegations are  proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page,  paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are located.” (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a).)  The declaration must also specify the  amendment’s effect, why it is necessary and proper, when the facts supporting  the amended allegations were discovered, and why the request was not made  earlier.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).) If  the party seeking the amendment has needlessly delayed, and the delay has  prejudiced the opposing party, the court has the discretion to deny leave to  amend.  (See Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490.)  Prejudice exists where the amendment would require delaying the trial,  resulting in loss of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation.  (Solit v. Tokai Bank, Ltd. New  York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.) Discussion In this case,  Cucuro’s  counsel seeks the proposed amendment based upon recently uncovered facts.  (McIntosh Decl., ¶ 5-7.) During a deposition on June 3, 2024, the Doe  Perpetrator stated the Doe Perpetrator had volunteered as a junior leader for  the San Bernardino YMCA when the Doe Perpetrator was 15 or 16 years old.  (McIntosh Suppl. Decl., Ex. A, p. 10:5-17.) Cucuro’s counsel states this  testimony establishes the Doe Perpetrator was involved with another Doe  Association when the alleged molestation took place and proposes adding the Doe  Association as a defendant. (McIntosh Decl., ¶ 5-7; McIntosh Suppl. Decl., ¶ 3-5.)  On July 1, 2024, Cucuro sought a stipulation from the other Defendants and  circulated a draft copy of the SAC on July 15, 2024. (McIntosh Decl., ¶ 8-9.)  In September 2024, Doe Association 1 notified Cucuro that they would not  stipulate to allowing Cucuro’s amendment. (McIntosh Decl., ¶ 10.) In  opposition, Doe Association 1 opposes Cucuro’s amendment on the grounds that the  same deposition testimony from the Doe Perpetrator allegedly exonerates other  defendants. But even if that is true, such arguments are better raised and  addressed in a separate motion for summary judgment or adjudication. Accordingly, the court GRANTS  Cucuro’s motion. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Cucuro’s motion for leave  to file a SAC is GRANTED and Cucuro is ordered to file the proposed SAC  separately with the court forthwith.
