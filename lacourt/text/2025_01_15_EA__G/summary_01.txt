And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Theodore Thomas Cucuro's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against Defendant Doe Association 1. Cucuro seeks to add Doe Association 4 as a defendant based on recently uncovered facts, including testimony from the Doe Perpetrator that the Doe Perpetrator was involved with another Doe Association when the alleged molestation took place. The judge finds that Cucuro's motion is granted as the court's discretion is exercised liberally to permit amendments to the pleadings. The judge also finds that the proposed amendment is necessary and proper, and that the delay in seeking the amendment was not unreasonable. The judge orders Cucuro to file the proposed SAC separately with the court forthwith.
