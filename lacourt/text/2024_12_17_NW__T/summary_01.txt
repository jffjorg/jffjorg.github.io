And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The case involves a dispute between the plaintiff, Joseph Barkhordari, and the defendants, George M. Eshaghian, Averell E. Eshaghian, and Claude D. Eshaghian, over allegations of unfair or fraudulent conduct. The defendants argued that they had knowledge of a previously unknown road, which led to the repudiation of an agreement to sell the landlocked property. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants unfairly or fraudulently obtained this knowledge, but the Judge found that the evidence presented by the defendants was sufficient to establish that there was no triable issue of fact as to the third cause of action. The Judge also noted that the plaintiff failed to present evidence of wrongdoing by the defendants and that the plaintiff's failure to show an injury in fact was sufficient to show that no triable issue of fact existed as to standing. As a result, the Judge granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and ordered that the plaintiff take nothing on his complaint.
