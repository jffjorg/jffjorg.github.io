 Case Number:  24VECV00256    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  T 24VECV00256
Homayoun v BMW
Tentative
ruling: Motion to advance hearing on MSJ or to continue trial.  DENY. 
The court may, in its discretion, advance the hearing on an MSJ if,
after timely service and filing, there are no available hearing dates for a
motion, or may continue the trial to allow the motion to be heard. 
Here, the
motion was not timely served and filed for a date at least 30 days before
trial.  This is not a case in which due
to busy law and motion dates the court could not hear the motion.  The motion itself was served and filed late
so that it could not have been heard at least 30 days before trial – even if a
date was available. The motion was served by email on December 9th.  The last date for the motion to be heard is
February 5th.   In order for the motion to have been timely heard
by February 5th, it would have had to be served no later than Nov.
20, 2024. 
Because the
motion was filed and served late, there are no grounds for relief.
