```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to advance the hearing on the motion for summary judgment (MSJ) or to continue the trial. The motion was not timely served and filed, and therefore cannot be heard. The last date for the motion to be heard is February 5th, and in order for it to be heard by that date, it would have had to be served no later than November 20, 2024. Since the motion was served and filed late, there are no grounds for relief, and the motion will not be heard at an earlier date.
