 Case Number:  23VECV05380    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  T Gomez
v Morales 23VECV05380
 
Tentative
ruling: Ex parte to continue – DENIED. 
When the court denied the stip to continue, it specifically stated the
following in the order of 12/4/2024:
 
The
stipulation fails to identify what discovery was completed and on what dates,
and specifically what discovery has not been completed and why. There is no
indication that expert designation has occurred.
 
These
inquiries have not been answered.  The
court’s order of 6/3/2024 says that the court does not intend to continue the
trial date.
 
If
plaintiff did not promptly give dates for the deposition of Johanna Serrano and
defendant did not timely file a motion to compel, why should the court grant
relief?  Defendant could have had the
deposition completed by now if a motion had been filed.  
 
Counsel
has other trials scheduled but all trial attorneys have a lot of trials
scheduled.  The court sets 12 trials a
week and most never go to trial.  There
is no guarantee that any of the trials that are “conflicts” are even going to
trial at all, much less start on time.
 
Because the application does not address the
matters above, the court denies the application.
