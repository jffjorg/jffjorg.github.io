```

And here is the English text summary:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application to continue the trial date. The court's previous order to deny the stipulation to continue was based on the lack of information provided regarding the completion of discovery and the absence of expert designation. The plaintiff and defendant failed to comply with the court's orders, including the failure to promptly schedule depositions and the failure to file a motion to compel. The judge also noted that the defense could have completed the deposition by now if a motion had been filed. The court set 12 trials per week, but most do not actually go to trial. Therefore, the court denies the application for continuance.
