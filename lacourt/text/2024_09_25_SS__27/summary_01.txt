And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint to add a new cause of action for "FAILURE TO WARN, NEGLIGENT FAILURE TO MAINTAIN, AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE BY PUBLIC ENTITY" against the City of Los Angeles, as well as claims for punitive damages against Defendant Shelter Clean, Inc. The judge found that the proposed amendment would not cause significant prejudice to the City of Los Angeles, as the pending motion for summary judgment would still address the proposed amendments. The judge also noted that the City has not provided any legal authority to suggest that the complaint cannot be amended while a motion for summary judgment is pending. The judge ruled that the motion was granted in recognition of California's liberal stance on granting amendments.
