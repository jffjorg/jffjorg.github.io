CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV09280 JAHEIM MARTIN vs
MALIN ASSET MANAGMENT, et al.
Moving Party: Defendant Charlavonna Barrett 
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS IS
GRANTED 
 
Background
On June 23, 2023,
Defendant CHARLAVONNA M. BARRETT served her initial discovery requests upon
Plaintiff JAHEIM MARTIN, including Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One). On August 29,
2023, Plaintiff responded with objections only, providing no substantive
answers to these requests. On October 25, 2023, Plaintiff’s attorney withdrew
from the case, leaving Plaintiff to proceed in pro per. On November 30, 2023,
the Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel further responses as to
Defendant’s Special Interrogatories (Set One). Plaintiff was ordered to serve
further responses within 30 days. Notice of this ruling was served on December
8, 2023. However, Plaintiff has yet to provide the further responses. On
January 12, 2024, Defendant sent a meet and confer letter pursuant to the
Court’s order, requesting responses to the discovery initially propounded, but
received no reply from Plaintiff. 
As Plaintiff continued
to disregard court orders and discovery obligations, on March 12, 2024,
Defendant filed a motion for terminating sanctions, which Plaintiff neither
opposed nor appeared at the hearing to contest. The court denied this motion
but indicated that failure to comply with further court orders or engage in
discovery could result in more severe sanctions.
On April 23, 2024, Defendant
served upon Plaintiff a Notice of Taking Deposition, but Plaintiff failed to
appear for her scheduled deposition on May 29, 2024. Two days later, on May 31,
2024, Defendant sent another meet and confer letter requesting available dates
in late June for the deposition. To date, Plaintiff has not responded to any
discovery requests, whether ordered by the court or not, and has made no
attempts to contact Defendant's counsel. Defendant now renews its motion for
terminating sanctions. Plaintiff did not oppose the present motion.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure
§ 2023.030 gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone
engaging in a misuse of the discovery process. Misuse of the discovery process
includes failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying
a court order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d),
(g).) A court may impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the
party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default judgment. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) A violation of a discovery order is sufficient
for the imposition of terminating sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v.
Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.)
The court should
consider the totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to
determine if the actions were willful, the detriment to the propounding party,
and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v.
Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) If a lesser sanction fails to
curb abuse, a greater sanction is warranted. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011)
196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) However, “the unsuccessful imposition of a lesser
sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the ultimate
sanction.” (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787.) Before any sanctions
may be imposed the court must make an express finding that there has been a
willful failure of the party to serve the required answers. (Fairfield v.
Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack
of diligence may be deemed willful where the party understood its obligation,
had the ability to comply, and failed to comply. (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.) The party who failed to comply
with discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure was not
willful. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa
Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.) 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s discovery
has been outstanding since 2023. Plaintiff has failed to comply with court
orders to provide discovery responses, has not responded to defense counsel's
meet and confer letters regarding the discovery, did not oppose or appear at the
prior terminating sanctions hearing, failed to respond to new discovery
requests after the prior terminating sanctions hearing, and did not oppose the
present motion. It appears to the court that Plaintiff has abandoned his case.
Given the presence of a history of discovery abuse in this case, it seems that
no lesser sanctions would curb Plaintiff’s persistent discovery abuse.
Therefore, the present motion is granted.
