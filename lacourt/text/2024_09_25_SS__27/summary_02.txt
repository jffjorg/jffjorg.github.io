And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant Lyft's motion to continue the trial date, but only in part. The motion was previously unopposed. The trial was originally set for November 1, 2024, but the parties agreed to a 6-month continuance due to new medical treatment disclosed by the Plaintiff. However, the Judge finds that the Defendant has not demonstrated a need for additional time to complete discovery and has granted only a 90-day continuance. The new trial date is set for February 3, 2025, and the Final Status Conference is continued to January 20, 2025. The parties are encouraged to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
