MENDEZ XON vs TERRA BELLA PROPERTY MANAGEMENT et al.

Ruling: MOTION TO VACATE DISMISSAL IS GRANTED¿ 
 
Background
 
On March 11, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a
Complaint in the above action naming Terra Bella Property Management, Inc.
(herein "TBPM") as a Defendant. However, subsequent investigation and
discovery revealed that TBPM was not involved with the subject premises.
Consequently, Plaintiff's counsel filed several Doe amendments naming various
real estate companies bearing the Terra Bella name, all of which turned out to
be unrelated to the subject property. On June 17, 2024, at a hearing for an Order
to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to File Entry of Default /
Alternatively Trial Setting Conference, the Court, after conferring with the
parties, ordered the case dismissed without prejudice. Following discussions
with Plaintiff’s uncle and through independent investigation, Plaintiff’s
counsel states that he has identified the correct entity defendants relating to
the subject premises: (1) 922 N. Summit, LLC, and (2) Terra Bella Property
Management, Inc. Defendant now moves the court to vacate its order for
dismissal on the basis that the dismissal was entered as a result of counsel’s
excusable neglect in identifying the correct defendant(s) necessary to
prosecute this case. No opposition was filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
Section 473, subdivision (b) states in
pertinent part: “The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order,
or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.... Notwithstanding any other
requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an application
for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in
proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to
his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1)
resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which
will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default
judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the court
finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney's
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Italics added.)
 
¿           Section 473, subdivision (b), provides for two distinct types of
relief.¿ “Under the discretionary relief provision, on a showing of “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect,” the court has discretion to allow relief from
a “judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against” a party or his or her attorney. Under the mandatory relief
provision, on the other hand, upon a showing by attorney declaration of “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,” the court shall vacate any “resulting default judgment or dismissal
entered.”¿ The range of attorney conduct for which
relief can be granted in the mandatory provision is broader than that in the
discretionary provision, and includes inexcusable neglect.¿ But the range of adverse litigation results from which relief can
be granted is narrower. Mandatory relief only extends to vacating a
default which will result in the entry of a default judgment, a default
judgment, or an entered dismissal.”¿ (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 615–616.)
 
“The¿mandatory¿relief provision of section 473(b) is a “narrow exception to the
discretionary relief provision for default judgments and¿dismissals.” [Citation.] Its purpose “‘was to alleviate the
hardship on parties who¿lose their day in court¿due
solely to an inexcusable failure to act on the part of their attorneys.’”
[Citation.] An application for¿mandatory¿relief must be filed within six months of entry of judgment and be
in proper form, accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his
or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. [Citation.] The defaulting
party “must submit sufficient evidence that the default was actually caused by
the attorney's error. [Citation.] ‘If the prerequisites for the application of
the¿mandatory¿relief provision of section 473, subdivision (b) exist, the trial
court does not have discretion to refuse relief.’” [Citation.]” (Henderson
v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co.¿(2010)
187 Cal.App.4th 215, 226.)
 
Discussion 
 
The Court finds all the requirements for
mandatory relief to have been met. First,
the motion was initially filed on July 26, 2024, but was inadvertently taken
off the calendar. It was subsequently refiled on August 23, 2024. Whether
considering the original filing date of July 26, 2024, or the refiling date of
August 23, 2024, both dates fall within the six-month deadline from when the
dismissal was entered on June 17, 2024. Second,
counsel’s declaration states a legitimate reason for the failure to avoid dismissal.
It was based on a combination of a convoluted corporate history concerning the
subject premises, numerous entities bearing similar names within the industry
and counsel’s neglect in conducting a diligent investigation to locate the
correct entity within two years of the case being filed. The Court finds that a
combination of surprise related to the complexity of identifying the correct
defendant and neglect in conducting a diligent investigation led to the
dismissal of this case. Third, a dismissal is the type of court order
that qualifies for mandatory relief. Thus, the court
GRANTS the present motion and vacates its June 17, 2024 dismissal of this matter.
