  - "The court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect."
  - "The mandatory relief provision of section 473(b) is a 'narrow exception to the discretionary relief provision for default judgments and dismissals.' [Citation.] Its purpose 'was to alleviate the hardship on parties who lose their day in court due solely to an inexcusable failure to act on the part of their attorneys.' [Citation.]"
