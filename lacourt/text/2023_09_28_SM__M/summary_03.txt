Here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling in the case of Farzan v. Passebani (Case Number: 22SMCV01790) was made by the Judge. The defendant, Mahmoud Passebani, moved to compel the plaintiff, Janet Farzan, to respond to a request for production of documents. The request was served on May 10, 2023, and the plaintiff failed to respond. The defendant attempted to meet and confer regarding the non-response, but the plaintiff did not reply. 

As a result, the motion to compel was granted, and the plaintiff is required to respond to the request within 10 days. Additionally, monetary sanctions of $960.00 were granted against the plaintiff, which will be paid to the defendant's counsel within 30 days. The Judge based this decision on the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP), specifically sections 2031.010, 2031.300, and 2030.290(c), which require a party to respond to discovery requests in a timely manner and allow for monetary sanctions if the party fails to do so. The plaintiff's failure to respond and justify their non-response led to the granting of the motion and the imposition of sanctions.
