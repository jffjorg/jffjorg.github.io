And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to the request for production of documents. The plaintiff failed to respond to the request despite being served on May 10, 2023, and the deadline for response was June 9, 2023. The defendant attempted to meet and confer with the plaintiff, but the plaintiff did not reply. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to respond within 10 days.

The judge has also granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $960.00, which includes costs, against the plaintiff. The sanctions are to be paid to the defendant's counsel within 30 days. The judge's decision is based on the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery request and the defendant's request for sanctions.
