And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion to demurrer and the request for judicial notice. The judge grants judicial notice of Exhibits 1 and 2, which are official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments. The judge denies judicial notice of Exhibit 3, which is irrelevant and extrinsic evidence not appropriate at the demurrer/motion to strike stage.

The judge also reviews the third cause of action for dependent adult abuse. The judge finds that the plaintiff does not allege a caretaking relationship that meets the definition of the Elder Abuse Act. Instead, the plaintiff alleges a limited engagement of assistance with the decedent's basic needs, which was incidental to the Hospital's provision of medical care. The judge concludes that the allegations are insufficient under the Act.

The judge also reviews the motion to strike the dependent adult abuse related allegations. The judge grants the motion, as the allegations are moot since the Court granted leave to amend on the demurrer. The judge also grants the defendant's motion to strike the punitive damages, as Code of Civil Procedure section 425.14 bars the claim for punitive damages.

Finally, the judge notes that the Court is unclear whether the plaintiff will be able to amend the complaint to meet the requirements of the Elder Abuse Act. The judge will discuss with the plaintiff whether leave to amend should be granted and what facts may be alleged to satisfy the pleading requirements of the Act.
