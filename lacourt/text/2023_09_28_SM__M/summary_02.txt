```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion to demurrer and the request for judicial notice. The judge grants judicial notice of Exhibits 1 and 2, which are official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments. The judge denies judicial notice of Exhibit 3, which is irrelevant and extrinsic evidence not appropriate at the demurrer/motion to strike stage.

The judge also reviews the third cause of action for dependent adult abuse. The judge finds that the plaintiff does not allege a caretaking relationship that meets the definition of the Elder Abuse Act. Instead, the plaintiff alleges a limited engagement of assistance with the decedent's basic needs, which was incidental to the Hospital's provision of medical care. The judge concludes that the allegations are insufficient under the Act.

The judge also reviews the motion to strike the dependent adult abuse related allegations. The judge grants the motion, as the allegations are moot since the Court granted leave to amend on the demurrer. The judge also grants the defendant's motion to strike the punitive damages, as Code of Civil Procedure section 425.14 bars the claim for punitive damages.

Finally, the judge notes that the Court is unclear whether the plaintiff will be able to amend the complaint to meet the requirements of the Elder Abuse Act. The judge will discuss with the plaintiff whether leave to amend should be granted and what facts may be alleged to satisfy the pleading requirements of the Act.

**English Summary:**

In this case, David Wallach and others (Plaintiffs) are suing Providence Health System So. Cal. and related entities (Defendants) for Dependent Adult/Elder Abuse.  The Defendants have filed a Demurrer and a Motion to Strike challenging the Plaintiffs' allegations.

The Judge is reviewing the matter and has granted the Defendants' request for Judicial Notice of certain documents except for the deposition testimony.

The Judge is hesitant to allow the Plaintiffs to amend their complaint because it seems to blur the line between standard medical negligence and the specific requirements for Dependent Adult/Elder Abuse.

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to strike the Plaintiffs' request for punitive damages because of current California law. However, the Judge denied the motion to strike regarding allegations of fraud. 

The Judge will meet with the Plaintiffs to discuss whether they can amend their complaint to adequately state a claim for Dependent Adult/Elder Abuse.

Case Number: 21STCV07431
Hearing Date: September 28, 2023
Dept: M
Case Name: Wallach, et al., v. Providence Health System So. Cal., et al.

* The Judge is considering a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint regarding the case of Wallach, et al., v. Providence Health System So. Cal., et al.
* The legal standard for a demurrer is whether the complaint states a cause of action.
* The Judge will read the allegations liberally and in context, and will not consider evidence or other extrinsic matters.
* The Judge will grant a special demurrer for uncertainty only if the pleading is so bad that the defendant cannot reasonably respond.
* The Court may strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading upon motion or at any time in its discretion.
* The burden is on the plaintiff to show in what manner they can amend the complaint, and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.
* The Judge has granted a request for judicial notice of the Articles of Incorporation of Providence Health System-Southern California and Providence Saint John’s Health Center, but denied a request for judicial notice of deposition testimony of Plaintiff David Wallach as it is irrelevant and extrinsic evidence not appropriate at the demurrer/motion to strike stage.
* The Judge has demurred to the third cause of action for dependent adult/elder abuse, as the plaintiff has not alleged facts establishing that the defendant had responsibility for meeting the basic needs of the elder or dependent adult, knew of conditions that made the elder or dependent adult unable to provide for his or her own basic needs, and denied or withheld goods or services necessary to meet the elder or dependent adult’s basic needs.
* The Judge has granted a motion to strike the punitive damages claim as it is currently barred by Code of Civil Procedure section 425.14, and the defendant is a religious corporation.
