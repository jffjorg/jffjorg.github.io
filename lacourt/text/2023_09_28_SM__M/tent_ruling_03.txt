 Case Number:  22SMCV01790    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  M CASE NAME:           Farzan, v. Passebani
CASE NO.:                22SMCV01790
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses
HEARING DATE:   9/28/2023

 
Legal
Standard
 
Where
there has been no timely response to a CCP section 2031.010 inspection demand,
the demanding party must seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.)
Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work
product. Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief
from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There
is no deadline for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to
respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court
before filing the motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the
inspection demand, no showing of "good cause" is required.
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant Mahmoud Passebani moves to
compel Plaintiff Janet Farzan’s responses to Request For Production Of
Documents, and for sanctions against Plaintiff in the sum of $1,510.00.
 
            On May 10, 2023, Defendant served
Plaintiff by mail and email with his Request For Production Of Documents.
(Miller Decl., Ex. 1.) Responses were due on June 9, 2023. Defendant attempted
to meet and confer regarding the non-response, but Plaintiff did not reply.
(Id., ¶¶ 3-4.) 
 
            Given Plaintiff’s failure to
respond, the motion to compel is GRANTED. 
Responses are due within 10 days.
 
Monetary sanctions are mandatory,
unless the imposition of sanctions would be unjust or the party subject to the
sanctions acted with substantial justification. (See CCP § 2030.290(c).) As
Plaintiff failed to respond to this motion, they failed to justify their
non-response to the discovery.
 
Defendant requests $1,510.00 in
sanctions, which accounts for 1.8 hours on the moving papers, and an
anticipated 3.2 hours reviewing oppositions to the motions, replying and
appearing at the hearing, at a rate of $300/hr. 
 
The Court will set a reasonable fee
for the motion as follows. The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced
total amount of $960.00, inclusive of costs, against Plaintiff. Sanctions to be
paid to Defendant’s counsel within 30 days.
