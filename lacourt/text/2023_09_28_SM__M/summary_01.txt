The judge has reviewed the motion for new trial and to vacate the judgment and order filed by plaintiff Cyrus Sanai. Sanai seeks to challenge the Court's earlier decisions, including the confirmation of an arbitration award and the denial of his motion to vacate judgment. The judge notes that Sanai's grounds for a new trial are based on sections 657 and 659 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which allow a new trial to be granted if there is an irregularity in the proceedings, misconduct by the jury, accident or surprise, newly discovered evidence, insufficiency of the evidence, or error in law.

After reviewing the motion, the judge finds that Sanai's arguments are without merit. The Court properly granted the arbitration award and the motion for judgment on the pleadings. Sanai does not cite any new or different law or facts that could change the Court's earlier rulings. The judge denies the motion for new trial and to vacate the judgment and order.

English text:
The case is 19SMCV00158, Sanai, et al., v. Kreling, et al., and the hearing date is September 28, 2023. Plaintiff Cyrus Sanai filed a complaint for recovery of attorneys’ fees against defendant Cobrae. The dispute is over unpaid attorneys’ fees in the amount of $25,632.00. Sanai performed legal services for Cobrae in the lawsuit of Kreling v. Cobrae and recommends that Cobrae exercise an option to purchase the Kyberz Property to avoid further litigation. Sanai negotiated, drafted, and finalized a stipulation staying the action while Cobrae sought financing. In order to obtain financing, Cobrae refinanced a motel he owned. The dispute arose when Cobrae paid some of Sanai's fees, but not all of them. Sanai alleges that Cobrae agreed to issue escrow instructions to Defendant The Heritage Escrow Company that Sanai would be paid from the amounts borrowed on one or both items of real property. Sanai served a notice of attorney's lien to Defendants Heritage, Kreling, and Cobrae.

A mandatory attorney’s fee arbitration hearing was held before a three-person panel administrated by the Beverly Hills Bar Association in Case No. 2581-19. The arbitrator rejected Sanai’s claims and awarded Cobrae a refund of $32,502.84. The Court confirmed the award in favor of Cobrae and against Sanai in the amount of $32,502.84 and entered judgment. The Court later denied Sanai’s motions to vacate judgment and for new trial. Sanai appealed these decisions, but the appeal was dismissed. On November 21, 2022, the Court of Appeal issued a remittitur.

Sanai filed and served a notice of his intent to file a motion for a new trial and to vacate the judgment in favor of Heritage. Sanai served a memorandum in support of the motion, but failed to file the memorandum with the Court until September 6, 2023.

The legal standard for a motion for new trial includes irregularity in the proceedings, misconduct of the jury, accident or surprise, newly discovered evidence, excessive or inadequate damages, insufficiency of the evidence, error in law, and abuse of discretion by the court. When ruling on an application for a new trial, the court sits as an independent trier of fact.

The party intending to move for a new trial must file with the clerk and serve upon each adverse party a notice of his intention to move for a new trial, designating the grounds upon which the motion will be made and whether the same will be made upon affidavits or the minutes of the court or both. These time limits are jurisdictional and cannot be extended or waived by stipulation nor court order.

Sanai moves for a new trial and to vacate the judgment and order of the Court entered on July 21, 2023. The grounds notified for a new trial were irregularity in the proceedings, accident or surprise, newly discovered evidence, insufficiency of the evidence, error in law, and abuse of discretion by the court.

The Court has already denied Sanai's argument that the Court improperly granted an underlying arbitration award motion, and the issue was fully litigated. The Court also properly granted Defendant Heritage’s motion for judgment on the pleadings for the reasons the Court provided. Sanai does not cite any new or different law or facts that could change any portion of the ruling. Sanai also argues that the order lacks jurisdiction but reserves this argument for an anticipated motion to vacate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 473(d). Accordingly, the motion for new trial and to vacate the judgment and order of the Court entered on July 21, 2023, is DENIED.
