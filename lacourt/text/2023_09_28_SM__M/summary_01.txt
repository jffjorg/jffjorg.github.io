And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the motion for new trial and to vacate the judgment and order filed by plaintiff Cyrus Sanai. Sanai seeks to challenge the Court's earlier decisions, including the confirmation of an arbitration award and the denial of his motion to vacate judgment. The judge notes that Sanai's grounds for a new trial are based on sections 657 and 659 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which allow a new trial to be granted if there is an irregularity in the proceedings, misconduct by the jury, accident or surprise, newly discovered evidence, insufficiency of the evidence, or error in law.

After reviewing the motion, the judge finds that Sanai's arguments are without merit. The Court properly granted the arbitration award and the motion for judgment on the pleadings. Sanai does not cite any new or different law or facts that could change the Court's earlier rulings. The judge denies the motion for new trial and to vacate the judgment and order.
