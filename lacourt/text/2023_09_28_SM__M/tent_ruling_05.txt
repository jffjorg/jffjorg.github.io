 Case Number:  23SMCV04510    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  M Bank of Southern California v. 1007 Lincoln Boulevard, et
al., 23SMCV04510
 
In its ex parte application, Plaintiff Bank of Southern California
seeks (1) an order appointing a rents, issues and profits receiver, (2) an OSC
why a permanent receiver should not be confirmed, (3) a TRO in aid of the
receiver, and (4) an OSC why a preliminary injunction in aid of the receiver
should not be issued. 
 
As to Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice, that request
is GRANTED. 

            “In this state a receiver may
be appointed only as permitted by Code of Civil Procedure section 564.” Barclays Bank of California v. Superior Court (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 593, 597. Section 564 provides
twelve instances in which a court may appoint a receiver.  Relevant here: the court may appoint a
receiver (1) In an action. . . by a creditor to subject any property or
fund to the creditor's claim. . . on the application of the plaintiff . . .
whose right to or interest in the property or fund is probable, and where it is
shown that the property or fund is in danger of being lost, removed or
materially injured; (6) Where a corporation is insolvent or in immediate danger
of insolvency, or has forfeited its corporate rights; or (9) In all other cases
where necessary to preserve the property or rights of any party.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 564(b)(1, 6, 9)  The appointment may be continued after entry
of a judgment for specific performance if appropriate to protect, operate, or
maintain real property encumbered by a deed of trust or mortgage or to collect
rents therefrom while a pending nonjudicial foreclosure under power of sale in
a deed of trust or mortgage is being completed.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 564(b)(11).)  
 
“[A]ppointment of a receiver is a
drastic remedy to be employed only in exceptional circumstances.” (City and County of San Francisco v. Daley
(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 734, 744.) “‘[T]he availability of other remedies does
not, in and of itself, preclude the use of a receivership.  [Citation.] 
Rather, a trial court must consider the availability and efficacy of
other remedies in determining whether to employ the extraordinary remedy of a
receivership.  [Citation.]’  [Citation.]” 
(Gold v. Gold (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 791, 807.)  “The appointment of a receiver rests within
the discretion of the trial court. 
[Citations.]”  (Id. pp.
807–808.)  “However, such power is not
entirely uncontrolled and must be exercised
with due regard to the facts presented in each particular case.”  (Alhambra-Shumway Mines, Inc. v. Alhambra
Gold Mine Corp. (1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 869, 873.)  “[T]he power should be sparingly exercised,
and never used in a doubtful case . . ..” 
(Koshaba v. Koshaba (1942) 56 Cal.App.2d 302, 314.)
 
The purpose of a preliminary
injunction is to preserve the status quo pending final resolution upon a trial.
(See Scaringe v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc. (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d
1536.) The status quo has been defined to mean the last actual peaceable,
uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy. (14859 Moorpark
Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.)
Preliminary injunctive relief requires the use of competent evidence to create
a sufficient factual showing on the grounds for relief. (See, e.g., ReadyLink
Healthcare v. Cotton (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016; Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.) 
 
The burden of proof is on the
plaintiff as moving party. (O’Connell v. Superior Court (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481.) A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the
absence of an adequate damages remedy at law. (Code Civ. Proc. § 526(4); Thayer
Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 307.)
 
The trial court considers two
factors in determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction: (1) the
likelihood the plaintiff will prevail on the merits of its case at trial; and
(2) the interim harm the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is
denied as compared to the harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the court
grants a preliminary injunction. (Code Civ. Proc. § 526(a); Husain v.
McDonald’s Corp. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 860, 866-67.) The balancing of harm
between the parties “involves consideration of such things as the inadequacy of
other remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity of preserving
the status quo.” (Husain, supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at 867.) Thus, a
preliminary injunction may not issue without some showing of potential
entitlement to such relief.  (Doe v.
Wilson (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296, 304 (“The trial court abuses its
discretion in granting such a preliminary injunction when “there is no
likelihood” that the movants will prevail on the merits of their claims for
relief.”))  The decision to grant a
preliminary injunction generally lies within the sound discretion of the trial
court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. (Thornton
v. Carlson (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.)
 
Here, Plaintiff has established
that it is entitled to a receiver under Code of Civil Procedure § 564(b)(2), (9)
and (11).  Moreover, Plaintiff is
entitled to the appointment of a receiver as a matter of contractual right
based upon the specific provisions of the loan documents, specifically the Deed
of Trust and Assignment of Rents.  (Manjikian
Decl., Exhs. 3-4.) and Defendants. 
Furthermore, Plaintiff has met the requirements for the ex parte
appointment of a receiver set forth in Code of Civil Procedure §§ 564(c), 566
and California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1175.
 
Therefore, the Court orders the
appointment of a Receiver on an ex parte basis. 
The Court further as well as the issuance of a temporary restraining
order and an Order to Show Cause as to why a permanent Receiver should not be
appointed and why a preliminary injunction should not be granted in aid of the
Receiver.  The TRO is narrowly drafted to
ensure that the appointed receiver may perform their job duties without
interference.  In addition to a strong
likelihood of prevailing on the merits, the balancing of the harms weighs in
favor of imposing the requested TRO.  The
matter will be set for an OSC re preliminary injunction on November 14, 2023 at
8:30 a.m.  Oppositions will be due by October
27, 2023, and any reply by November 7, 2023. 

 
The Court finds that a bond in the
amount of $10,000 will be a sufficient undertaking to protect Defendants from
any potential damages as required by Code Civil Procedure section 566(b).  
 
The Court shall sign the proposed
order submitted by Plaintiff.
