Motion to Appoint Arbitrator

Legal
Standard
 
            Owners of an easement or the land to
which it is attached must maintain and repair it. (Civ. Code. § 845(a).) If
there is more than one owner, the costs are shared by agreement or
proportionately to the use by each. (Civ. Code § 845(b).) If any owner refuses
to perform, or fails after demand in writing to pay the owner's proportion of
the cost, an action to recover that owner's share of the cost, or for specific
performance or contribution, may be brought by the other owners. (Civ. Code § 845(c);
see Healy v. Onstott (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 612, 617 [discussing general
guidelines to determine contributions among co-owners of road easement under
former version of statute].) The action must be filed in the superior court of
the county in which the easement is located. (Civ. Code § 845(c)(1)-(3).) 
 
            The action shall be subject to
judicial arbitration pursuant to CCP section 1141.10 et seq. (Civ. Code §
845(c)(2); see Whitson v.
Goudeseune (1955) 137 Cal.App.2d 445, 449 [an owner may apply to the
superior court for the appointment of an impartial arbitrator to apportion costs].)
In judicial arbitration proceedings, relatively small cases—unlimited civil cases
where the amount in controversy does not exceed $50,000 for each plaintiff—are
subject to mandatory diversion for nonbinding arbitration. (Mercury Ins.
Group v. Superior Court (1998) 19 Cal.4th 332, 343; CCP § 1141.11
[establishing criteria for cases subject to judicial arbitration, including the
$50,000.00 cap].) Judicial arbitration may be viewed as an aid to settlement of
litigation by giving the parties an arbitrator's neutral view of all the issues
in a case, including damages and costs. (Stanley v. Superior Court
(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 460, 471.) If no party requests a trial de novo after the
arbitration, the decision of the arbitrator becomes final and binding. (Id.
at 465.) CRC Rule 3.810 et seq. defines the rules and procedures for judicial
arbitration.
 
Analysis
 
This petition arises out of the alleged
duty of all the parties to share in the costs of repairs to a certain Private
Roadway, owned by Petitioners Thomas and Susan Corson, and Respondents Ananthan
Thangavel, Vincent Colin, Lena Colin, Wesley Widjaja, and Azita Razi
Bakhshayandeh. Petitioners and Respondents have easements for ingress and
egress. (Pet. ¶¶ 2-13.) Petitioners have made a good-faith effort to obtain the
participation of Respondents, and each of them, in the necessary repairs to the
Private Roadway but without success (Pet. ¶¶ 19-21.) Petitioners thus request
appointment of an impartial arbitrator in accordance with California Civil Code
§ 845 to determine the appropriate scope of repairs and apportion the costs of
the repairs to the Private Roadway. 
 
On June 1, 2023, the Court heard
this petition.  As set forth in the Court’s
minute order, Petitioners failed to produce evidence that the amount in
controversy did not exceed $50,000.00 as to any petitioner, or a stipulation
from the parties consenting to judicial arbitration. (CRC Rule 3.811(a)(4);
Rule 3.812(a).)  Further, Petitioners had not served all Respondents
subject to this claim. Petitioners have only provided proofs of service as to
Respondents Vincent and Lena Colin. 
There is no update as to the unserved Respondents Thangavel, Widjaja, or
Bakhshayandeh. The Court requires jurisdiction over these Respondents before it
could order judicial arbitration. 
 
            For these
reasons, the Court will continue the application.  Petitioners are ordered to provide the Court
with this requested information five court days before the next hearing.  
 
Accordingly, Petitioners’ motion is CONTINUED to
