## English Summary

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to appoint an arbitrator in a case involving the cost sharing for repairs to a private roadway. 

The Court previously heard the motion on June 1, 2023, but continued it because the Petitioners (Thomas and Susan Corson) failed to provide evidence demonstrating that the amount in dispute was under $50,000, a requirement for judicial arbitration.  They also hadn't properly served all of the Respondents (Ananthan Thangavel, Vincent and Lena Colin, Wesley Widjaja, and Azita Razi Bakhshayandeh) involved in the dispute.

The Court has therefore continued the motion to September 28, 2023, and ordered the Petitioners to provide the missing information five court days before the next hearing.
