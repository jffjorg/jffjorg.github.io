And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the petition to appoint an arbitrator to determine the scope of repairs and apportion the costs of repairs to a private roadway. The petitioners, Thomas and Susan Corson, have made a good-faith effort to obtain the participation of the respondents, but without success. However, the petitioners failed to produce evidence that the amount in controversy did not exceed $50,000.00, as required by California Civil Code ยง 845. Additionally, the petitioners failed to serve all the respondents, and the court requires jurisdiction over the unserved respondents before it can order judicial arbitration. As a result, the court will continue the application and order the petitioners to provide the requested information five days before the next hearing.
