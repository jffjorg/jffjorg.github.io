TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants’ motion to seal is denied in full.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a putative class
action.  The operative complaint alleges:
 
[T]he Farmers
Defendants utilize a software program throughout California known as 360Value
to determine the replacement cost of an insured’s dwelling. The Farmers
Defendants use that replacement cost to set policy limits for the insurance
policies they sell to insureds in California. However, 360Value is inherently
inaccurate.  Nonetheless, despite the
many flaws inherent to both 360Value and the Farmers Defendants’ use of it, the
Farmers Defendants hold themselves out through their agents, marketing
materials, websites (for both the Farmers Defendants and for their agents), and
other publicly available information, as having expertise in the field of
insurance and, more specifically, determining a dwelling’s replacement
cost.  The Farmer Defendants and their
agents tout 360Value as a sophisticated software program that accurately
calculates the replacement cost of a dwelling. . . . By doing so, the Farmers
Defendants and their agents undertake a duty to their insureds and breach that
duty (along with California law) through their persistent and knowing
implementation of their 360Value Scheme.
 
(Second Amended Complaint
(“SAC”), ¶ 2.)
 
On September 18, 2023, the Court
denied Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.
 
Here, the Farmers Defendants move
to seal certain documents that Plaintiffs filed in support of the certification
motion.
 
LAW
 
The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if
it expressly finds facts that establish: 
 
(1)  
There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
 
(2)  
The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; 
 
(3)  
A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; 
 
(4)  
The proposed sealing
is narrowly tailored; and 
 
(5)  
No less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550(d).) “These findings embody constitutional requirements for a request to seal court records,
protecting the First Amendment right of public access to civil trials.  (Edmon
& Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter
Group June 2023 Update) ¶ 9:418, emphasis in original.) 
 
The
parties’ agreement to seal documents is not enough to support a motion to
seal.  (Id. at ¶ 9:417.1 [“Parties
sometimes operate under an informal arrangement pursuant to which documents are
‘deemed filed under seal’ unless an objection is made. Such an arrangement ‘is
entirely inconsistent with the mandatory requirements of rules 2.550 and 2.551
and the constitutional values informing those requirements.’”].)
 
“Only
the specific words of documents that constitute the sensitive material should
be sealed; generally, it is not permissible to seal the entire document.”  (Id. at ¶ 9:418.5.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants move to seal Exhibits
A, M, Y, and AA to the February 10, 2023 declaration of attorney R. Martin
Weber, Jr.
 
The first issue is whether the
motion to seal is timely.  The answer is
no.  “Rule 2.551(b)(3) governs the procedure for a party that files, in an
adjudicatory proceeding, records that were subject to a confidentiality
agreement or protective order, but does not intend to request the sealing of
such records.”  (Savaglio v. Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 588, 601.)  “Such party must notify the party that
produced the records that the records will be placed in the public files unless
the producing party brings a motion to seal within 10 days (or duly authorized extension) of receiving
such notice.”  (Ibid., emphasis in
original.)[1]  Plaintiffs lodged Exhibits A, M, Y, and AA on
February 10th. The notice of lodging states: “Plaintiffs
hereby give notice under Rule 2.551(b)(3)(A)(iii) that the unredacted materials
lodged conditionally under seal will be placed in the public court file unless
the party concerned files a timely motion or application to seal all or part of
the unredacted copies.”  (2/10/23 Notice
of Lodging, p. 2.)  Defendants did not
file the motion to seal until January 31, 2024, nearly a year later, so it is
late.  (See Savaglio, supra, 149
Cal.App.4th at 601 [recognizing “a 10-day time frame” for filing
motions to seal]; see also 1/31/24 Motion to Seal, p. 7 [same].)
 
However, Defendants request
relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b).  They claim they filed the motion to seal late
because of a calendaring error.  (See
1/31/24 Motion to Seal, pp. 7-8 [asserting mistake and excusable neglect].)
 
Plaintiffs contend “[t]he 10-day
time frame . . . is ‘mandatory’ and cannot be extended.”  (2/21/24 Opposition, p. 4.)  Citing Savaglio, they claim the Court
“lack[s] discretion” to hear the motion to seal.  (Ibid.)
 
Defendants disagree.  They assert that Savaglio is
distinguishable and that there is no authority that bars application of section
473(b) to their motion.  (See 2/27/24
Reply, pp. 2-4.)
 
Savaglio was a wage-and-hour class action
against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”).  “After the
case had been pending for over three years – and after substantive motions had
been heard and decided – a local newspaper that attempted to review papers
filed in connection with Wal–Mart’s summary adjudication motion “learn[ed] that
‘virtually all’ [pleadings and motion papers] had been filed conditionally
under seal.”  (Mercury Interactive
Corp. v. Klein (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 60, 88 [summarizing and
quoting Savaglio].)  “Prior to the
newspaper’s attempt to gain access to court records, Wal–Mart, in two separate
proceedings, had sought writ review of trial court rulings on the plaintiffs’
motion for class certification and its motion for summary adjudication.”  (Ibid.) 
“Large portions of the appendices to its writ petitions were filed in
the appellate court without having been sealed.”  (Ibid.) 
“The appellate court rejected Wal–Mart’s attempt to assert
confidentiality as to those portions of the appendices that had included
documents that had been previously filed conditionally under seal in
the trial court.”  (Ibid.)  “It concluded that there had been a waiver,
based upon Wal–Mart’s (1) failure to obtain a sealing order in the trial court
as required by the sealed records rules, (2) failure to obtain a sealing order
in the appellate court as required by the rules, and (3) unreasonable
assertion, in a letter to the appellate court in which it claimed inadvertence,
that it had complied with the rules in obtaining a sealing order from the trial
court.”  (Ibid.)  “It therefore
reversed the trial court’s finding that there had been no waiver, concluding
that ‘Wal–Mart’s conduct was so inconsistent with an intent to enforce its
rights to obtain sealed records under the Rules of Court as to induce a
reasonable belief that it had relinquished such right. [Citation.]’”  (Ibid. [quoting Savaglio], footnote
omitted; see also Lopez v. United Parcel Service, Inc. (N.D. Cal. Mar.
1, 2010) No. C08-05396 SI, 2010 WL 728205, at *8 n. 12 [noting: “In Savaglio,
the state appellate court held that a party had
waived its right to obtain a court order sealing certain documents where it
failed to move the trial court for a sealing order, could point to ‘no court
order granting the nonexistent motion,’ and had publicly filed the materials it
sought to seal on the dockets of two parallel cases”], underlined case name
added.)
 
“[I]rrespective of the
waiver,” the appellate court also found that “the trial court lacked discretion
to entertain a belated motion to seal.” 
(Savaglio, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at 601.)  The opinion states:
 
As noted by the trial
court, effective January 1, 2004, former rule 243.2(b)(3)(B) (current rule
2.551(b)(3)(B)) sets forth a 10–day time frame (subject to extension of time by
court order) for bringing a motion to seal under circumstances that the court
apparently deemed applicable to the instant matter. Rule 2.551(b)(3) governs
the procedure for a party that files, in an adjudicatory proceeding, records
that were subject to a confidentiality agreement or protective order, but does
not intend to request the sealing of such records. Such party must notify the
party that produced the records that the records will be placed in the public
files unless the producing party brings a motion to seal within 10 days (or
duly authorized extension) of receiving such notice. [Citation.]
 
In its order on the Daily
Planet's motion to unseal, the trial court concluded, given the understanding
the parties were operating under, that it would work an “injustice” to find
that they waived any opportunity to file a motion to seal. Of course, whether
there has been a waiver of a known right is a factual matter. More to the
point, regardless of waiver, the court had no power under the Rules of Court to
entertain a grossly untimely motion to seal. First, no one followed the 10–day
time frame set forth in rule 2.551(b)(3). Second, heeding the call to construe
our rules broadly to further the people’s right of access, we conclude that any
reading of rules 2.550 and 2.551 that encourages an open-ended time frame
for filing a motion to seal records long after the underlying substantive
matter has been decided would defeat the purpose of the rules. Without the
accountability of reasonable time frames for bringing such motions in
conjunction with adjudicatory as opposed to discovery proceedings, the
presumptive openness of court records would be subject to the whim of the
parties, without regard to the public.
 
(Ibid., emphasis in
original.)
 
Four points stand out:
 
* the Court of Appeal analyzed Wal-Mart’s
inadvertence argument in connection with the waiver issue (see id. at 598-600);

 
* the timeliness analysis is independent
of the waiver analysis (see id. at 601); 
 
* the opinion emphasizes – three times –
that, notwithstanding the waiver, the trial court lacked discretion to consider
Wal-Mart’s motion (see id. at 593 [stating: “We conclude that Wal-Mart waived
its right to file that motion and in any event the trial court lacked
discretion to entertain it”]; see also id. at 601 [stating: “Further, irrespective of the waiver, the trial court lacked
discretion to entertain a belated motion to seal”]; ibid. [stating: “More to
the point, regardless of waiver, the court had no power under the Rules of
Court to entertain a grossly untimely motion to seal”]); and
 
* Defendants fail to
cite a case finding section 473(b) applicable to an almost one-year-late motion
to seal.
 
These points compel the
Court to deny Defendants’ motion to seal.
 
Alternatively, the Court
finds section 473(b) unsatisfied.  Section
473(b) “offers two kinds of relief.  One
is discretionary.  The other is
mandatory.”  (Shayan v. Spine Care
& Orthopedic Physicians (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 167,
170.)  “Discretionary relief may be
granted for excusable neglect, and is available in connection with any order.”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 5:290.)  “Mandatory relief may be sought only from
defaults, default judgments and dismissals and requires an ‘attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,’
including inexcusable neglect [citation].”  (Ibid., emphasis in original; see also Shayan,
supra, 44 Cal.App.5th at 170 [holding that mandatory relief is only
available for “defaults, default judgments, and dismissals”].)  “While both types of motions must be made
within [six] months of the order or default at issue, discretionary relief may
as a practical matter have to be sought far earlier.”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 5:290; see
also id. at ¶ 5:374 [instructing that a motion for discretionary relief must be
filed within a “reasonable time”].) There is no default, default judgment, or
dismissal here; thus, the question is whether Defendants should get
discretionary relief.  The Court answers
no for two reasons.  One, Defendants
filed their request for relief more than six months after the 10-day
period.  Two, Defendants’ excuse is
unavailing.  A calendaring error might be
sufficient to explain missing a filing deadline by a few weeks but not by a
year.  To repeat, Plaintiffs lodged
Exhibits A, M, Y, and
AA on February 10th
in support of the certification motion. The Court held three
certification-related hearings and ordered two rounds of supplemental
briefing.  (See 4/19/23 Minute Order; see
also 6/21/23 Minute Order; 9/13/23 Minute Order.) Then Plaintiffs filed an
appeal and designated Exhibits A, M, Y, and AA part of the appellate record.  (See 11/9/23 Appellant’s Notice Designating
Record on Appeal, Attachment 4b, p. 1.) 
Then the parties engaged in private mediation. (See 2/27/24 Reply, p.
1.)  During all that time, Defendants
knew that Exhibits A, M, Y, and AA remained unsealed and that Plaintiffs were
using them for adjudicatory purposes in adjudicatory proceedings, yet they did
nothing.  Defendants’ inaction went
beyond mistake or excusable neglect and does not qualify for section 473(b)
relief.
