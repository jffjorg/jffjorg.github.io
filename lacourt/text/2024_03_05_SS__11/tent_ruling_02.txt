(3) Procedure for party not intending to file motion or application
 
(A) A
party that files or intends to file with the court, for the purposes of
adjudication or to use at trial, records produced in discovery that are subject
to a confidentiality agreement or protective order, and does not intend to
request to have the records sealed, must:
 
(i) Lodge
the unredacted records subject to the confidentiality agreement or protective
order and any pleadings, memorandums, declarations, and other documents that
disclose the contents of the records, in the manner stated in (d);
 
(ii) File
copies of the documents in (i) that are redacted so that they do not disclose
the contents of the records that are subject to the confidentiality agreement
or protective order; and
 
(iii)
Give written notice to the party that produced the records that the records and
the other documents lodged under (i) will be placed in the public court file
unless that party files a timely motion or application to seal the records
under this rule.
 
(B) If
the party that produced the documents and was served with the notice under
(A)(iii) fails to file a motion or an application to seal the records within 10
days or to obtain a court order extending the time to file such a motion or an
application, the clerk must promptly transfer all the documents in (A)(i) from
the envelope, container, or secure electronic file to the public file. If the
party file a motion or an application to seal within 10 days or such later time
as the court has ordered, these documents are to remain conditionally under
seal until the court rules on the motion or application and thereafter are to
be filed as ordered by the court.
