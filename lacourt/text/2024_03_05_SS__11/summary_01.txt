Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to seal certain documents filed by the defendants, Farmers Insurance Company, Inc., et al. The motion was filed late, nearly a year after the exhibits were lodged with the court, and the defendants failed to demonstrate excusable neglect. The judge finds that the defendants' inaction was not a mistake or excusable neglect, but rather a deliberate decision to delay filing the motion. The judge also notes that the defendants failed to cite any authority supporting their claim that section 473(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure applies to their motion. The judge concludes that the motion to seal is untimely and that the court lacks discretion to consider it.
