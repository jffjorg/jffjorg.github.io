The judge's tentative ruling outlines the procedure for parties that do not intend to file a motion to seal records produced in discovery, which are subject to a confidentiality agreement or protective order. The party must lodge the unredacted records and redacted copies with the court, and give written notice to the party that produced the records. If the party that produced the records fails to file a motion to seal the records within 10 days, the clerk must transfer the documents to the public file. The judge's ruling is based on California Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(3).
