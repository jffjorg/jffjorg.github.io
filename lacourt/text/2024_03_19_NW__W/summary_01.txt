And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Knolton, Inc.'s motion to quash service of summons, citing insufficient evidence that the service was proper. The judge found that Knolton, Inc. presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that service was proper, and that the service attempt by the process server was defective. The judge notes that Knolton, Inc. is required to comply with the requirements of Corporations Code section 1502 and provide the plaintiff with the updated address for its agent for service of process. If Knolton, Inc. fails to comply, the plaintiff may serve process on Knolton by service on the Secretary of State.
