And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Matthew Larez and others versus Kayry Gonzalez. The case involves a vehicle collision and the parties' disputes over the deposition of Dr. Jon Greenfield, a non-retained expert witness. The defendant had initially scheduled Dr. Greenfield's deposition for June 5, 2024, but the deposition did not proceed as scheduled. The defendant then attempted to reschedule the deposition, but Dr. Greenfield's administrator indicated that he was unable to participate due to medical issues. The defendant has moved to compel Dr. Greenfield's deposition, arguing that they would be prejudiced without his testimony. The judge has ruled that the deposition shall take place via video conferencing and that Dr. Greenfield must sit for his deposition within 20 days of the hearing. The judge has also ordered the moving party to give notice to opposing counsel and Dr. Greenfield.
