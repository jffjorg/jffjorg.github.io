```

And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Karen Moskowitz, has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for terminating sanctions filed by Cross-Defendant Jeff Leal against Plaintiff Carlos Rolando Rodriguez. The motion is based on Plaintiff's failure to appear for his deposition on September 23, 2024, and his refusal to participate in the litigation. The Court has previously ordered Plaintiff to appear for his deposition, but he failed to comply. The Judge finds that Plaintiff's conduct is willful and that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. Therefore, the Court grants the motion for terminating sanctions and dismisses Plaintiff's operative complaint without prejudice.
