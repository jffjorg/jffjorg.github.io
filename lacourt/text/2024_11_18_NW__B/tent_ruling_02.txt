BACKGROUNDOn July 27, 2021, Plaintiff Carlos Rolando Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Tyler Bruce Mason (“Mason”) and Does 1 to 50 alleging three causes of action: (1) negligence; (2) negligence per se; and (3) statutory liability. Plaintiff alleges that, on or about August 2, 2019, Mason negligently operated his vehicle, colliding with Plaintiff’s vehicle and causing injury thereof.On January 24, 2023, Mason filed a cross-complaint for indemnity, declaratory relief, and apportionment of fault against Cross-Defendant Jeff Leal (“Cross-Defendant”).On June 5, 2024, the action was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.On October 18, 2024, Cross-Defendant Leal filed the instant motion for terminating sanctions.The motion remains unopposed.II. LEGAL STANDARDCal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2023.030 permits the Court, in its discretion, to impose the following types of terminating sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a “misuse of the discovery process”:(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.(2) An order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is obeyed.(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party.(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.(CCP § 2023.030(d).) Conduct that is a “misuse of the discovery process” includes failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery and disobeying a court order to provide discovery. (CCP § 2023.010(d) and (g).)“Imposition of sanctions for misuse of discovery lies within the trial court's discretion,and is reviewed only for abuse.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 991.) “The trial court should consider both the conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party seeking discovery[.]” (Ibid. at 992.) Sanctions should be tailored to the harm created by the withheld discovery and should not be used as punishment. (Ibid.)The court should also consider whether the discovery misconduct was “willful” and whether the requesting party was prejudiced by the other’s failure to comply. (Do It Urself Moving & Storage, Inc. v. Brown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 27, 37.)Lastly, courts have held that terminating sanctions are warranted when a party repeatedly fails to propound adequate discovery responses, even after the court imposed monetary sanctions. (Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrations, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1093.) For example, in Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, the Court of Appeal held that five motions to compel created a record “replete with evidence of [appellant’s] failures to answer discovery requests.” (Ibid. at 279–280.)III. DISCUSSIONCross-Defendant makes this motion on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to appear for his Court-ordered deposition on September 23, 2024, and because Plaintiff has “altogether abandoned the litigation.” (Motion p. 4:11.) Due to a significant breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, Plaintiff’s former counsel was relieved as counsel for Plaintiff in March 2024. (Englet Decl. ¶ 3.) On or about March 8, 2024, Cross-Defendant properly noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for March 26, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 4.) Plaintiff did not object but still failed to appear. (Ibid.) On August 22, 2024, the Court granted Cross-Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition and ordered Plaintiff to appear for his deposition within 30 days. (Ibid; Exh. A[August 22, 2024 Minute Order].) On September 11, 2024, Cross-Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for September 23, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 5.) Again, Plaintiff failed to appear, this time in violation of Court order. (Ibid.)“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) Here, Plaintiff did not comply with the Court’s August 22, 2024, order. Additionally, Plaintiff refuses to participate in this litigation, indicating that less severe sanctions would fail to produce Plaintiff’s compliance. Therefore, the Court finds terminating sanctions appropriate.IV. CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, Cross-Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s operative complaint is dismissed without prejudice.Moving party is ordered to give notice to Plaintiff Carlos Rolando Rodriguez and Defendant Tyler Bruce Mason.Dated: November 15, 2024 __________________________________Hon.
