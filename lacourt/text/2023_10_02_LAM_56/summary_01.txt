* "The Court finds that nothing alleged in the FAC changes this conclusion."
* "Plaintiff alleges that she was not involved in the prior planning or the commission of the theft of Moving Defendant’s bulldogs, but does not deny that at the time she claimed the reward she knew that they were stolen from Moving Defendant, nor does she deny that she received them with that knowledge."
* "If anything, the FAC makes even clearer than did the original Complaint that Plaintiff has unclean hands that prevent her from profiting from her actions."
* "The Court thus finds that all of Plaintiff’s claims as alleged in the FAC are barred under the unclean hands doctrine as a result of Plaintiff’s no contest plea to the Penal Code § 496 charge."

Summary:
The Judge has tentatively ruled that the Plaintiff's claims are barred by the unclean hands doctrine due to her no contest plea to the Penal Code § 496 charge. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's allegations do not change the conclusion that she has unclean hands and is not entitled to relief. The Judge sustains the Demurrer to the FAC without leave to amend.
