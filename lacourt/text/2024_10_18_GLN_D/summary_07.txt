And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Avalon Promenade Inc. v. Heislop, et al. The case involves a dispute over an unlawful detainer, with the defendants demurring to the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff, Avalon Promenade Inc., lacks the capacity to sue due to its suspended corporate status. The plaintiff alleges that it is the owner of premises in Burbank, California, and that the defendants, David Heislop and Renee Heislop, are in breach of a written agreement to rent the premises. The plaintiff requests past due rent, reasonable attorney fees, and damages.

The Judge has granted the defendants' unopposed request for judicial notice and has sustained their demurrer to the complaint. However, the Judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for a short continuance to permit it to seek revivor of its corporate status. The Judge has ordered that the matter be continued to December 20, 2024, to permit the plaintiff to effect reinstatement of its corporate status.

The Judge has also noted that the normal practice is for the trial court to permit a short continuance to enable the suspended corporation to effect reinstatement, and that the purpose of the Revenue and Tax Code suspension provision is to put pressure on corporations to pay taxes. The Judge has emphasized that the suspended status of the plaintiff does not preclude it from participating in the litigation, and that it may be allowed to carry on the litigation once it has paid its taxes and obtained a certificate of revivor.
