And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to deem requests for admission admitted. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Artin Megerdomian and Astekhik Namagerdi, against the defendant, Armen Hakopyan. The plaintiffs requested that the court deem admitted the matters set forth in their requests for admissions (Set One) served on the defendant. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the requests for admissions were not properly served until September 10, 2024, the same date the motion was filed, and that the moving papers did not include proof of service confirming when the requests for admissions were in fact served on the defendant.

The judge found that the defendant had served proposed responses to the requests for admissions prior to the hearing on the motion, and that the responses were in substantial compliance with the provisions of CCP § 2033.220. The judge accordingly denied the motion to deem the requests for admissions admitted.

The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, as the notice of motion did not request sanctions and did not specify the type of sanction sought or the party or parties against whom sanctions were sought. The judge noted that the plaintiff had failed to properly request sanctions in the notice of motion, and that this gave rise to due process concerns.

The judge denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions as well, as the request was based on CCP § 2030.300, which applies to document demands, not requests for admissions. The judge also noted that the opposition suffered from notice irregularities and due process concerns.

The judge ordered that the parties make arrangements in advance if they wish to appear via LACourtConnect, and that the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative if no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect or otherwise made.
