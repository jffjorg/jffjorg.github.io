And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants plaintiff's motion to compel defendant's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) to appear for deposition and produce documents requested in the deposition notice. The court orders the PMK to appear for deposition and to give testimony on a mutually convenient date and time as to the matters requested in the Second Amended Notice of Deposition served on May 24, 2024, no later than December 13, 2024. The court also orders the PMK to produce for inspection at the deposition any and all materials described in the subject notice which are consistent with the court's Standing Order Re Discovery (Song-Beverly Litigation).

The court finds that defendant has failed to show good cause for delaying over a year in providing a date for the PMK deposition and in continuing to fail to fully comply with the court's Order. The court awards monetary sanctions to plaintiff in the amount of $3,150.00 (6 hours @ $525 per hour) plus a filing fee of $60.00, for a total of $3,210.00.

The court notes that the parties have agreed to the terms of the Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation) and that the PMK depositions will be conducted in accordance with the court's Standing Order Re Discovery (Song-Beverly Litigation) and the Notice to All Counsel Re: Lemon Law Cases for Department D, Customary Rulings Re Document Requests (Song Beverly Litigation).
