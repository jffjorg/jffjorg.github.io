And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling discloses that Judge Elaine Lu owned a condominium unit as an investment property in 2019. The unit had a termite infestation, which was not successfully treated through local means. Judge Lu requested authorization from the Homeowners Association (HOA) to fumigate the entire building, but was initially refused. After retaining counsel and negotiating with the HOA, authorization was granted, and Judge Lu paid for the fumigation. The unit was subsequently sold in July 2020. The Court is making this disclosure to ensure that all parties are aware of the relevant facts and to address potential concerns about Judge Lu's impartiality. The Court has determined that it has no basis to recuse itself and can remain fair and impartial to all parties. At the upcoming hearing on Defendant Do Hwan Kim's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint, the Court will provide all parties with an opportunity to seek a continuance to file and serve a statement of disqualification, if desired. The hearing will proceed as scheduled on January 23, 2024, only if all parties waive their right to file and serve a statement of disqualification.
