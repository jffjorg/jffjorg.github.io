 Case Number:  22STCV36524    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  26 Prior to the commence of the hearing on
Defendant Do Hwan Kim’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint, the Court (Judge
Elaine Lu) posted the following disclosure on the Court’s tentative ruling
website:
 
In 2019, Judge Lu owned a unit within a
condominium as an investment property.  Judge
Lu’s tenants complained of termites within the unit.  Several rounds of local treatment of the
termites were ineffective in eradicating the termite infestation.  Judge Lu requested that the HOA for the
condominium authorize Judge Lu to retain a termite company to fumigate the entire
building.  The HOA refused.  Judge Lu retained counsel to negotiate with
the HOA.  The HOA reconsidered and
granted Judge Lu authorization to fumigate the entire building.  Judge Lu paid for the fumigation.  Judge Lu subsequently sold her unit in July
2020.  Judge Lu did not engage in any litigation
against the HOA.  
 
The Court makes this disclosure so that
all parties are aware of all facts reasonably related to the issue of
disqualification.  The Court has no basis
to recuse itself.  The Court can remain
fair and impartial to all parties.  
 
At the outset of the hearing
on Defendant
Do Hwan Kim’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint,
the Court will provide all parties with an opportunity to seek a continuance:
(1) to file and serve a statement of disqualification before proceeding with
the hearing and/or (2) to consider whether to file and serve such a statement
of disqualification seeking to disqualify the court.
 
The hearing on Defendant Do Hwan
Kim’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint will
proceed as scheduled on January 23, 2024 only if all parties expressly waive
their right to file and serve a statement of disqualification.
