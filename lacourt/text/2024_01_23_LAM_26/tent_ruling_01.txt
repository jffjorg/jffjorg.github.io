 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
Plaintiff’s motion to compel defendant’s
  further responses to special interrogatories, set two 



 
Procedural
Background
            On April 7, 2022, Plaintiff Daniel
Figueroa (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant wrongful termination action against
Defendant Mohini, LLC dba 37694A 7-Elven and 7-Elven Store 37694A
(“Defendant”).  The complaint asserts seven
causes of action for (1) Discrimination in Violation of the Fair Employment and
Housing Act (“FEHA”), (2) Retaliation in Violation of FEHA, (3) Failure to
Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation in Violation of FEHA, (4) Failure to
Provide Reasonable Accommodations in Violation of FEHA, (5) Failure to Engage
in a Good Faith Interactive Process in Violation of FEHA, (6) Wrongful
Termination in Violation of Public Policy, and (7) Declaratory Relief.
            On July 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Special Interrogatories,
Set Two (“SROGs”).  On July 18, 2023,
pursuant to the parties’ stipulation, the Court set an advanced briefing
schedule for the instant motion.  (Minute
Order 7/18/23.)  Pursuant to this
advanced briefing schedule, on July 27, 2023, Defendant filed an
opposition.  On August 2, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a reply.
 
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300
provides that “[o]n receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding
party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; [or] (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate; [or] (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” 
(CCP § 2030.300(a).)
Notice of the motion must be given within 45
days of service of the verified response, or upon a later date agreed to in
writing.  Otherwise, the propounding
party waives any right to compel a further response.  (CCP § 2031.310(c).)  The motion must also be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration.  (CCP §
2031.310(b)(2).)
The burden is on the responding party to
justify any objection or failure to fully answer the interrogatories.  (Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (Stendell)
(2000) 22 Cal. 4th 245, 255.)
 
Meet
and Confer
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300(b)(1) a motion to
compel further responses to interrogatories “shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” 
(CCP § 2030.300(b)(1).)  “A meet
and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.”  (CCP §
2016.040.) “The level of effort at informal resolution which satisfies the
‘reasonable and good faith attempt’ standard depends upon the circumstances. In
a larger, more complex discovery context, a greater effort at informal
resolution may be warranted. In a simpler, or more narrowly focused case, a
more modest effort may suffice. The history of the litigation, the nature of
the interaction between counsel, the nature of the issues, the type and scope
of discovery requested, the prospects for success and other similar factors can
be relevant.”  (Obregon v. Superior
Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)
            On April 24, 2023, Plaintiff served
the SROGS at issue on Defendant.  (Haddad
Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. 3.)  On May 25, 2023,
Defendant requested a two-week extension to respond.  Plaintiff refused unless Defendant agreed to
respond fully and provide all the name and contact information of each requested
individual.  (Haddad Decl. ¶ 5, Exh.
4.)  Defendant did not respond.  (Haddad Decl. ¶ 5.)  On May 26, 2023, Defendant electronically
responded to the SROGs at issue and objected to each request.  (Haddad Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. 6.)  After receiving the responses, on May 26,
2023, Plaintiff emailed Defendant requesting further responses by May 30,
2023.  (Haddad Decl. ¶ 7, Exh. 5.)  Later that day, Defendant sent a meet and
confer letter offering to supplement in part, and the parties furthered
conferred through email.  (Haddad Decl. ¶¶
8-10, Exh. 5.)  On June 2, 2023,
Defendant electronically served supplemental responses to the SROGs at issue.  (Haddad Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. 8.)  However, as some responses still only
contained objections, Plaintiff requested further responses, but Defendant did
not respond.  (Haddad Decl. ¶ 12, Exh.
5.)  Considering the above attempts at
informal resolution, Plaintiff has sufficiently met and conferred.
 
Discussion
            Plaintiff seeks to
compel Defendant’s further responses to SROGs No. 49-54, 56-61.
 
SROGS No. 49-54 and 56-61
            “IDENTIFY all PERSONS
YOU hired in November 2020.”  (SROG No.
49.)
            “IDENTIFY all PERSONS
YOU hired in December 2020.”  (SROG No.
50.)
            “IDENTIFY all PERSONS
YOU hired in January 2021.”  (SROG No.
51.)
            “IDENTIFY all PERSONS
YOU hired in February 2021.”  (SROG No.
52.)
            “IDENTIFY all PERSONS
YOU hired in March 2021.”  (SROG No. 53.)
            “IDENTIFY all PERSONS
YOU hired in April 2021.”  (SROG No. 54.)
            “IDENTIFY all PERSONS
YOU TERMINATED in November 2020.”  (SROG
No. 56.)
            “IDENTIFY all PERSONS
YOU TERMINATED in December 2020.”  (SROG
No. 57.)
            “IDENTIFY all PERSONS
YOU TERMINATED in January 2021.”  (SROG
No. 58.)
            “IDENTIFY all PERSONS
YOU TERMINATED in February 2021.”  (SROG
No. 59.)
            “IDENTIFY all PERSONS
YOU TERMINATED in March 2021.”  (SROG No.
60.)
            “IDENTIFY all PERSONS
YOU TERMINATED in April 2021.”  (SROG No.
61.)
            
            In response to each
of these requests, Defendant’s supplemental response identically states that:
            “Defendant hereby
incorporates the preliminary statement set forth above. Defendant further
objects because this request: (1) is vague and ambiguous; (2) is overbroad; (3)
calls for information that is neither relevant, nor reasonably calculated to
lead to admissible evidence; (4) calls for information that is proprietary
and/or confidential; (5) calls for information that is protected by the right
to privacy; (6) calls for information that is protected by the attorney-client
privilege and/or the attorney work product doctrine; and (7) calls for a legal
conclusion.”  (Supp. Response to SROGs
Nos. 49-54, 56-61.)
 
            Preliminary
Objections
            General objections to
are per se improper.  (CCP §
2030.300(a)(3), [“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling a further response if … [a]n objection
to an interrogatory is … too general.”]; see also Korea Data Systems Co. v.
Superior Court (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1516.)  Rather, objections must be separately stated
to each request.  (CCP §
2030.210(a)(3).)  Accordingly,
Defendant’s preliminary statement objections are overruled.
 
            Vague and
Ambiguous
            Here, the requests
are plainly neither vague nor ambiguous. 
The SROGs plainly and clearly set forth the sought information – i.e.,
the name and contact information of employees whom Defendant hired or
terminated between November 2020 and April 2021.  “A party may not deliberately misconstrue a question
for the purpose of supplying an evasive answer. (Deyo v. Kilbourne
(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783.)  “Indeed, where the question is somewhat
ambiguous, but the nature of the information sought is apparent, the proper
solution is to provide an appropriate response.”  (Ibid.)
            There
is no basis for Defendant’s objection based on vagueness or ambiguity.  These objections are overruled.

            Relevance and Overbroadness
            “[A]ny party may obtain discovery regarding
any matters, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in
the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in that action,
if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  (CCP §
2017.010.)  “[A]n implicit waiver of a party's constitutional rights
encompasses only discovery directly relevant to the plaintiff's claim and
essential to the fair resolution of the lawsuit.”  (Vinson v. Superior
Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 842.)  However, discovery should not be
denied if the information sought has any relevance to the subject
matter. Thus, while relevancy is a possible ground for an objection, it is
difficult to adequately justify it.  (See generally Coy v. Superior Court of
Contra Costa County (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 217.)  “These rules are applied liberally in favor
of discovery, and (contrary to popular
belief), fishing expeditions are permissible in some
cases.”  (Gonzalez v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th
1539, 1546 [internal citation omitted].)  
            Here,
the identity of employees Defendant hired and fired is relevant to the instant
action.  In relevant part, the complaint alleges
that Plaintiff requested reinstatement on December 1, 2020, and Defendant responded
that it did not have any availability for Plaintiff and that Plaintiff had to
be let go.  (Complaint ¶ 21.)  The complaint further alleges that Plaintiff
was denied reinstatement.  (Id. ¶¶
35, 45.)  These allegations are further
bolstered by the April 19, 2023 deposition of Defendant’s person most
knowledgeable, who testified that in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Defendant
did not have work for Plaintiff and did not hire any people to replace
Plaintiff.  (Haddad Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. 2
[PMK Depo at p.192:1-21].)  Defendant’s
person most knowledgeable further testified that if there was work for
Plaintiff, Defendant would have rehired him. 
(Haddad Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. 2 [PMK Depo at p.195:1-6].)  Defendant’s person most knowledgeable testified
 that it was not until some point in 2021
that Defendant began hiring new employees, and Defendant did not reach out to
Plaintiff because he was “out of sight, out of mind.”  (Haddad Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. 2 [PMK Depo at
p.196].)
            Whether
Defendant hired new employees during the period in question and when Defendant
began hiring new employees is plainly relevant as to the veracity of the
testimony of Defendant’s person most knowledgeable.  Similarly, these SROGs are relevant as to
Plaintiff’s allegation requesting reinstatement.   However,
these SROGs do appear slightly overbroad as they are not limited to hiring for
Plaintiff’s prior role with Defendant or a similar such role with
Defendant.  Accordingly, SROGs Nos.
49-54, and 56-61 are limited to store clerks or employees of a similar position
as Plaintiff whom Defendant hired/terminated.
            
            Confidentiality is not a Proper Objection
            No
case holds that confidentiality is a proper basis for an objection to an
otherwise proper interrogatory.  (Columbia
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1968)
263 Cal.App.2d 12, 23.)  Rather,
“[a]ssuming that the information called for by this interrogatory is of a
confidential nature which defendants do not want to have included in a public
record, they presumably could have applied for a protective order[.]”  (Ibid.)   “An objection to any interrogatory … is not
the equivalent of a motion for a protective order.”  (Ibid.)  
            Here, Defendant did not timely
move for a protective order. 
Accordingly, Defendant may not refuse to respond to a SROG on this
basis.  
 
            Third Party Privacy
            The right of privacy in the
California Constitution (art. I, § 1), “protects the individual's reasonable
expectation of privacy against a serious invasion.”  (Puerto v. Superior Court (2008) 158
Cal.App.4th 1242, 1250 [italics in original]; See Williams v. Superior Court
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552 [“In Hill, we established a framework for evaluating
potential invasions of privacy. The party asserting a privacy right must
establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable
expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion
that is serious.  The party seeking
information may raise in response whatever legitimate and important
countervailing interests disclosure serves, while the party seeking protection
may identify feasible alternatives that serve the same interests or protective
measures that would diminish the loss of privacy. A court must then balance
these competing considerations.”].)
            As the Supreme Court has “previously
observed, the right of privacy extends to sexual relations (Vinson
v. Superior Court, supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 841, 239) and medical
records (Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7
Cal.4th 1, 41.).”  (John B. v.
Superior Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1198.)  Similarly, the constitutional right to
freedom of association requires protection of a person’s membership in
associations, whether they pertain to religious, political, economic, or even
purely social matters.  (Britt v.
Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 852; see also Pacific-Union
Club v. Superior Court (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 60, 71.)  Further, “‘Courts have frequently recognized
that individuals have a substantial interest in the privacy of
their home.’ [Citation.]”  (Puerto,
supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at p.1252.)  
            In establishing a privacy interest
“the burden [is] on the party asserting a privacy interest to establish
its extent and the seriousness of the prospective invasion, and against that
showing must weigh the countervailing interests the opposing party identifies,
as Hill requires.”  (Williams,
supra, 3 Cal.5th 531, 557.)  “Only
obvious invasions of interests fundamental to personal autonomy must be
supported by a compelling interest.”  (Ibid.)
            Critically,
“[t]he constitutional provision simply does not apply to corporations. The
provision protects the privacy rights of people.” (Roberts v. Gulf Oil Corp.
(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 770, 791.) 
However, while no constitutional right of privacy exists as to
corporations, “‘the nature and purposes of the corporate entity and the nature
of the interest sought to be protected will determine the question whether
under given facts the corporation per se has a protectible privacy
interest....’ [Citation] It is clear to us that the law is developing in the
direction that the strength of the privacy right being asserted by a nonhuman
entity depends on the circumstances. Two critical factors are the strength of
the nexus between the artificial entity and human beings and the context in
which the controversy arises.” (Ameri-Medical Corp. v. Workers' Comp.
Appeals Bd. (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1288.)
            As
Defendant is an entity, it has no constitutional right to privacy.  The sole privacy right that may exist is as to
third parties.  Here, the only invasion
of privacy would be the disclosure of the employee’s contact information that
were hired and terminated by Defendant from November 2020 the April 2021.  (Puerto, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at
p.1252.)  However, “[c]entral to the
discovery process is the identification of potential witnesses. ‘The disclosure
of the names and addresses of potential witnesses is a routine and essential
part of pretrial discovery.’ [Citation.] Indeed, our discovery system is
founded on the understanding that parties use discovery to obtain names and
contact information for possible witnesses as the starting point for further
investigations[.]”  (Puerto, supra, 158
Cal.App.4th at pp.1249–1250.)  “The fact
that we generally consider residential telephone and address information
private does not mean that the individuals would not want it disclosed under
these circumstances.”  (Id. at pp.1252–1253.)  In fact, “if any of the current and former [Defendant]
employees are similarly situated to the plaintiffs, they may reasonably be
supposed to want their information disclosed to counsel whose communications in
the course of investigating the claims asserted in this lawsuit may alert them
to similar claims they may be able to assert.” 
(Id.
at p.1253.)  Moreover, contact
information is not particularly sensitive information.  (Ibid.)  
            Here, employees of a similar
position as Plaintiff who were hired/terminated soon after Plaintiff was
terminated may be potential witnesses.  Moreover,
the identification of potential witnesses is generally discoverable and not
overly invasive.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
need for relevant discovery overrides Defendant’s claim of third-party privacy.

 
Attorney Client Privilege/Work Product Privilege Objections
“In general, when a party asserts the
attorney-client privilege, that party has the burden of showing the preliminary
facts necessary to support the privilege.” 
(Venture Law Group v. Superior Court (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 96,
102.)  “The party asserting the privilege
need only present facts which ‘support a prima facie claim of privilege.”  (OXY Resources California LLC v. Superior
Court (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 874, 894.) 
“After this burden is met, or where there is no dispute concerning the
preliminary facts, the burden shifts to the party opposing the privilege to
show either the claimed privilege does not apply, an exception exists, or there
has been an express or implied waiver.” 
(Venture Law Group, supra, 118 Cal.App.4th at p.102.)  Moreover, “the identity and
location of witnesses is discoverable regardless of attorney work that went
into locating them.  (See Aerojet-General
Corp. v. Transport Indemnity Insurance (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 996,
1004.)  
Here, the requests seek the identification of potential
witnesses.  Accordingly, the objections
as to work product and attorney client privilege are unsupported.
 
            Legal Conclusions
            The fact that a
request may call for an opinion or legal conclusion is not a basis for an
objection to an interrogatory.  (West
Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Superior Court In and For Los Angeles
County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417 [“Moreover, even if it be conceded that
the question does call for an opinion and conclusion, that fact, of itself, is
not a proper objection to an interrogatory.”].) 
 
            Accordingly, as the
objections are unsupported or invalid, a further code-complaint response without
objections is required.


Sanctions
Plaintiff seeks sanctions of $2,943.91
against Defendant and its counsel of record for eight hours of attorney time preparing
and appearing for the instant motion and filing and reservations fees.  (Panosian Decl. ¶ 4; Haddad Decl. ¶ 13.)  
            “The
court shall impose a monetary sanction … against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response
to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(CCP § 2030.290(c).)  Further, it
is an abuse of discovery to make an evasive response or make unsubstantiated
objections to discovery.  (CCP §
2023.010(e)-(f).)
            Here,
Defendant asserted objections that were unsupported, and sanctions are
warranted.  However, in light of the fact
that Defendant did provide a supplemental response that substantively responded
and resolved some requests and in light of the overall simplicity of the
instant motion, the Court finds that the sanctions are slightly excessive.  Based on the totality of the circumstances the
Court finds that sanctions of $2,068.91 are warranted.
            Defendant Mohini, LLC dba 37694A 7-Elven and 7-Elven
Store 37694A and Defense Counsel Lyne A. Richardson and Daniel E. Valenti are
jointly liable and severable and ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the
amount of $2,068.91
to Plaintiff Daniel Figueroa, by and through counsel, within thirty (30)
days of notice of this order.
