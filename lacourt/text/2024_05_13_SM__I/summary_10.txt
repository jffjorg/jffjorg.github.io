And here is the English-text summary:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a case where the defendant demurred to a Unlawful Detainer (UD) action. The defendant filed the demurrer on March 4, 2024, but reserved a hearing date for July 2/3, 2024, which the judge considers an attempt to "game the system" rather than a legitimate request for a hearing. The plaintiff filed an opposition, but it did not address the issue raised in the demurrer. The judge is inclined to tell the parties to try harder and warns that games will not be tolerated. The judge grants an order shortening the time to the next hearing, where the parties are expected to have resolved the case or approached it in a professional manner.
