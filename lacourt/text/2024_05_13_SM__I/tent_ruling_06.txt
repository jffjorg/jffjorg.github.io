 Case Number:  22SMCV01594    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  I The court has reviewed the declarations.  Other than finger-pointing, the declarations
do little to clarify the situation or persuade the court that either party
really took the court’s order seriously. 
Having said that, the court puts a bit more of the blame on defendant
than plaintiff.
 
The court will CONTINUE the TSC for 1 month.  During that time, lead counsel will meet and
confer every Wednesday, all day, in person (alternating between plaintiff’s
office and defendant’s office) until the trial materials are ready to be
filed.  When they are ready to be filed,
and only then, will the court set a trial date. 

 
Because neither side has established cause for their failure
to be ready for trial, each party and their counsel are sanctioned in the
amount of $999, payable to the court within 10 days.
