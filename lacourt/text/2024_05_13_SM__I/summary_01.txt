And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has reviewed the materials submitted for the FSC and has identified several issues that need to be addressed. The court is missing several documents, including a deposition chart, jury questionnaire, and verdict form. The court is also missing good faith estimates of trial length and trial briefs. The court has asked the parties to meet and confer on a form of verdict and to submit a joint statement of the case. The court has also asked the parties to submit their estimates of trial length and to provide a good faith estimate of trial length.

The court will discuss options for the trial date, including holding a TSC on May 20, 2024, at 9 am to allow the parties to meet and confer and get schedules from their key witnesses as to availability. The court will also rule on the motions in limine.
