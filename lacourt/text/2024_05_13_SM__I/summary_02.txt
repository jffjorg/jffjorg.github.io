And here is the English-text summary:

The judge is considering a motion to quash a deposition subpoena. The judge rules that the motion is premature because the subpoena has not been issued. However, if the subpoena had been issued, the judge would have denied it because the discovery cut-off has come and gone. The judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel agreed to accept the subpoena, but the defendant's counsel requested to take the depositions. The judge is disappointed that the matter needs to be litigated and wants to hear more about the witnesses' potential testimony and the reasons why they were not deposed earlier.
