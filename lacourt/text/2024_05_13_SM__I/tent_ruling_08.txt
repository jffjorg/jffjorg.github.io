 Case Number:  23SMCV06028    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to GRANT the application and set trial
for Friday, May 17, 2024 at 1:30.  FSC
materials may be filed unilaterally no later than noon on Thursday, May 16,
2024, with a courtesy copy in court.  The
court is somewhat bewildered that defendant did not do as the court had thought
defendant had promised to do—deposit the money into court.  In any event, defendant has waived jury by
failing to post fees and the case will go forward.
