And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has reviewed the demurrer brought by the defendants and has made a tentative ruling. The Judge agrees with the defense that there are no sufficient allegations against the individuals, and that the entity is responsible for product defects, not the individual employees. The Judge has sustained the demurrers to the causes of action for products liability and general negligence. However, the Judge has given the plaintiff leave to amend their allegations for intentional infliction of emotional distress, as more is needed to prove this tort. The Judge has also overruled the demurrer as to the cause of action for fraud, finding that the allegations meet the requirements for fraud. The Judge has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend their allegations.
