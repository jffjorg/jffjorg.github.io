And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the admissibility of settlement communications between the parties' counsel. The plaintiff wants to introduce substantive communications and attachments between the parties' Texas counsel, but the defendant opposes. The communications in question are substantive and concerned the dispute now in trial. The court notes that the communications include a statement "*** TRE 408 COMMUNICATION ***" which references Texas Rule of Evidence 408, which provides that evidence of certain aspects of settlement communications are inadmissible at trial. The court concludes that the communications fall within Rule 408 and would be inadmissible at trial. The court will not rule on the attached documents at this time, pending further information.
