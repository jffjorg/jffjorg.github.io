During this time, the lead counsel for both parties must meet and confer every Wednesday in person, alternating between the plaintiff's and defendant's offices. The goal of these meetings is to prepare the trial materials, which will be filed when they are ready. The Judge has imposed sanctions of $999 on both parties for their failure to comply with court orders and prepare the trial materials. The Judge has also scheduled a trial date, which will be set once the trial materials are ready.
