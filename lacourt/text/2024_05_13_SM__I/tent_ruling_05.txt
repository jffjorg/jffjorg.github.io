 Case Number:  22SMCV01576    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  I The court has seen the parties’ stipulation to continue the
trial.  The court does not believe that
good cause has been shown.  But that
said, the court is currently engaged in trial, and will very likely be engaged
in trial on May 20.  The court will,
therefore, GRANT the request to continue the trial.  The court will discuss new trial dates with
the parties.  Through more luck than
anything else, the trial will be continued.
