And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, recognizing the six money judgments obtained by the plaintiff in Singapore against the defendant. The defendant has failed to provide competent evidence to establish that the Singaporean court did not provide a fair judicial process or that the judgment is repugnant to public policy. The judge has also rejected the defendant's affirmative defenses, finding that they are not recognized in the context of this litigation. The plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication of 18 issues is now moot, but the judge notes that affirmative defenses 2 to 5, 8, 10, 11, and 17 are not recognized affirmative defenses.
