And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Ford Motor Company's Motion to Strike and Tax Costs. The motion was filed in response to the court's earlier order granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs. Ford Motor Company argued that Plaintiffs' costs related to three depositions were unnecessary and unreasonable because they attached excessive and duplicative exhibits to the depositions. However, the court found that Plaintiffs adequately established that the costs were reasonable and necessary. The court noted that Plaintiffs were entitled to meticulously prepare for the depositions by making any pertinent documents and exhibits available, and that it was proper for Plaintiffs to prepare the documents and exhibits for use at the depositions for authentication and foundation purposes. Therefore, the court denied Ford Motor Company's Motion to Strike and Tax Costs.
