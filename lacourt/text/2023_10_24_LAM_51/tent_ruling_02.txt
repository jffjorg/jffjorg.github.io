Plaintiff argues bad faith by Kolay & Modm for failing to raise
cross-complaint issues until well-after they were forced to oppose Plaintiff’s
attachment application – but this could just as easily be poor time management
by the lawyers.

of trial in and of itself, without the risk of losing critical evidence or
adding costs of trial preparation, does not constitute prejudice.  (See Morgan
v. Superior Court (1959) 1972 Cal.App.2d 527, 530-31; Magpali v. Farmers Ins. Grp., Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471,
486-87.) Plaintiff’s reliance on Crocker
Nat. Bank v. Emerald (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 852 is misplaced because the party
filed a cross-complaint five times and each time the responding party
successfully demurred. Additionally, the proposed causes of action in the
cross-complaint there accrued two years after the party made his appearance. (Id. at 864.) Here, Moving Defendants
show that their causes of action arose at the time of their answer and
Plaintiff only challenged supposed delay in moving for leave to file the
cross-complaint.
