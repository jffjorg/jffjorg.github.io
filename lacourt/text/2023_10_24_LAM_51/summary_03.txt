And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Upinder S. Kalra in the case of Engle v. Fair Financial Group, case number 23STCV02615. The plaintiff, Kevin Engle, filed a complaint against the defendants, including Fair Financial Corp., Shift Technologies Inc., Brad Stewart, and George Arison, alleging various causes of action, including discrimination, harassment, and retaliation based on his mental health. The defendants filed demurrers to the complaint, and the plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint and a request for dismissal of certain causes of action. The judge ruled that the defendants' demurrers are sustained without leave to amend as to the sixth cause of action, which alleges a violation of the Private Attorneys General Act. The judge held that the plaintiff failed to state sufficient facts to support this cause of action, as PAGA does not allow claims for violations of the Labor Code's notice requirements.
