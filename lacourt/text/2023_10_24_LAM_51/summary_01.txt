And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in favor of the defendants, Kolay Flooring International, LLC and MODM Kolay Manufacturing, LLC, who have filed a motion for leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint against Tri-West, Ltd., Allen Gage, Larry Johnson, Dave White, and ROES 1-50. The court has granted the motion, ruling that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the underlying Complaint.

The court has found that the defendants have demonstrated good faith in their request to file the cross-complaint, and that Tri-West will not suffer undue prejudice by allowing the cross-complaint to be filed. The court has also noted that Tri-West has not shown that the defendants acted in bad faith in requesting leave to file the cross-complaint.

The ruling states that the court shall grant leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint if the party demonstrates that the motion is brought in good faith, and that the court may grant leave to file a permissive cross-complaint in the interest of justice at any time during the course of the action. The court has also cited case law in support of its decision, including Silver Orgs. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal. App. 3d 94 and Banerian v. O’Malley (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 604.

The case involves a dispute between Tri-West, Ltd. and Kolay Flooring International, LLC, MODM Kolay Manufacturing, LLC, and Daniel Mitchell over a purchase and supply agreement. Kolay had misrepresented its manufacturing capabilities and failed to deliver products, and Tri-West is seeking recovery of advance payments and damages. The defendants have filed a cross-complaint against Tri-West, alleging claims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence as the underlying Complaint.
