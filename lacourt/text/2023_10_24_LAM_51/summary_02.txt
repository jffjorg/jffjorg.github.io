And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that a delay in trial, in and of itself, does not constitute prejudice, unless there is a risk of losing critical evidence or adding costs of trial preparation. The Judge is skeptical of the Plaintiff's argument that Kolay & Modm acted in bad faith by failing to raise cross-complaint issues until after the Plaintiff's attachment application. The Judge notes that this could simply be poor time management by the lawyers. The Judge also rejects the Plaintiff's reliance on Crocker Nat. Bank v. Emerald, pointing out that the causes of action in that case accrued two years after the party made their appearance, whereas in this case, the causes of action arose at the time of the answer.
