Summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for summary adjudication filed by Sandra Norlund, an individual, and Sandra Norlund, Trustee of the Norlund Family Trust, on five issues related to the breach of contract and judicial foreclosure claims against the Norlund Defendants. The court finds that the motion does not specify any issues of duty or cause of action sought to be adjudicated and that summary adjudication may only be granted as to questions of duty, damages, or affirmative defenses. The court also notes that the motion does not seek summary adjudication of affirmative defenses raised by the Norlund Defendants and that the issues are not properly framed for summary adjudication. The motion is denied without prejudice.
