Summary:

The court also notes that the motion does not seek summary adjudication of affirmative defenses raised by the Norlund Defendants and that the issues are not properly framed for summary adjudication. The motion is denied without prejudice.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: 

**Case Number:** 20STCV27665
**Hearing Date:** October 3, 2023

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiffs:** Sandra Norlund (individually) and Sandra Norlund (Trustee of the Norlund Family Trust Dated September 15, 2000)
* **Defendants:** Richard L. Norlund, Sharon K. Bacon-Norlund, various trusts Richard L. Norlund is involved with, and Nominal Defendants Nancy Hymas.

**Background:**

* This case involves a dispute over a promissory note (the "Note") and a settlement agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") between Sandra Norlund and Richard Norlund. 
* Sandra Norlund alleges Richard Norlund defaulted on the Note and breached the Settlement Agreement.
* The original complaint included claims of Judicial Foreclosure, Fraud, and Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage.
* The Fraud and Intentional Interference claims were stricken in 2021, leaving only the Judicial Foreclosure claim.

**Motion:**

* Sandra Norlund moved for summary adjudication on five specific "issues" related to the alleged breaches of the Note and Settlement Agreement.

**Ruling:**

* **Denied, Without Prejudice:** The Court denied the motion because Sandra Norlund did not properly frame her request for summary adjudication.
* The Court found that the motion did not seek relief related to issues of duty, cause of action, damages, or affirmative defenses, which are the types of issues proper for summary adjudication.

**Key Points:**

* The Court emphasized the importance of properly framing requests for summary adjudication.
* The remaining cause of action is Judicial Foreclosure, which the Court interprets as a breach of contract claim.
* The Court suggests that Sandra Norlund refile her motion with proper framing and supporting arguments.

Summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication of five "issues" related to the breach of contract and promissory note default. The court finds that the motion does not properly request summary adjudication of a cause of action, affirmative defense, or duty, and that the issues presented are not proper matters for summary adjudication. The court also notes that the motion does not seek summary adjudication of damages and that the plaintiff's points and authorities do not address the elements of the first cause of action. The ruling is without prejudice.

english:
The tentative ruling denies the motion for summary adjudication made by plaintiff Sandra Norlund against defendants Richard L. Norlund, Sharon K. Bacon-Norlund, and Nancy Hymas in the case 20STCV27665. The motion, filed on June 23, 2023, sought summary adjudication of five issues related to a note and a settlement agreement. Norlund defendants opposed the motion on August 31, 2023, and filed objections to parts of the plummer and okerlund declarations attached to the reply and to parts of the September 7, 2023 notice of errata. The court denied the motion, without prejudice, due to procedural issues and because the motion did not specify any issues of duty or cause of action sought to be adjudicated. The court also noted that plaintiffs' motion did not seek summary adjudication of affirmative defenses raised by the Norlund defendants in their Answer to the FAC.
