And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the Plaintiff's opposition, which was filed late due to court-wide connectivity issues. The judge will consider the opposition, but notes that the Plaintiff's complaint does not specifically allege a negligent entrustment cause of action. However, the Defendant does not dispute that this cause of action is "within the pleadings" for purposes of a summary judgment motion. The judge also notes that the Defendant did not verify the driver's license of the person renting the vehicle, Prete. The judge's ruling suggests that the negligent entrustment cause of action may be a relevant issue to consider in the case.
