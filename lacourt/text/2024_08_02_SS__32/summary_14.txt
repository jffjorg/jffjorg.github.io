And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion filed by Plaintiff Jose Virgilio Lopez's counsel, Narimon Pishnamaz/Law & Pish, Injury Trial Lawyers, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is granted conditionally pending the filing and service of an updated proposed order, which must include information about all future hearings and proceedings noticed by any party. The Court finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is a valid reason for withdrawal. However, Counsel must make reasonable efforts to avoid prejudice to the client's interests, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, and complying with applicable laws and rules.
