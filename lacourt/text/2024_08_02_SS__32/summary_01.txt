```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has ruled that the motion for determination of good faith settlement is granted. The defendant, Continental Elevator Services, Inc., has agreed to settle with the plaintiff, Scott Lazar, for $39,000 following a mediation. The settlement was proportioned based on the fact that the defendant does not own or control the premises where the injury occurred and did not operate the subject elevator. The defendant argues that the settlement amount is proper as it avoids the cost and uncertainty of trial and is below its insurance policy limit of $1,000,000. The judge has considered the Tech-Bilt factors and found that the settlement was made in good faith.
