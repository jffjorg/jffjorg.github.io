And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant to continue the trial date and partially reopen discovery. The defendant argues that they need to depose the plaintiffs and complete expert discovery before the trial. The plaintiffs oppose the motion, citing the defendant's belated filing of the answer and lack of motions to compel discovery.

The judge notes that the parties previously stipulated to conduct depositions on June 18 and June 19, 2024, but the plaintiffs did not appear for the depositions. The defendant argues that they exercised sufficient diligence in light of the plaintiffs' unexplained unavailability.

The judge grants the motion to reopen discovery in part, allowing the defendant to conduct the plaintiffs' depositions. The plaintiffs are ordered to appear for deposition within 10 days. The trial date is set for September 25, 2024, and a final status conference is set for September 11, 2024.
