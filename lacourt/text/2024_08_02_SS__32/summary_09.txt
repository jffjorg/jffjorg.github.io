And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petition filed by Petitioner Sheryl Tan on behalf of Claimant Imogen Tan-Ching, a 9-year-old minor. The petition seeks a compromise of the claim, and since it is unopposed, the Court grants the petition. The Court notes that the proposed order clarifies that the $112.40 in medical expenses was paid by Meritain Health to provider Dr. Miriam Chan, and therefore, the entry in item 12b(5) suggesting a medical lien held by Dr. Miriam Chan is excused. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to determine if a resolution can be reached, and if not, they must submit on this tentative ruling or appear in person or remotely at the hearing on August 2, 2024.
