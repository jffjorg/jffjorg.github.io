Significant Statements:
  - "To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may imposeâ€¦sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process."
  - "Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or disobeying a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a misuse of the discovery process."
  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'"
```

And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff. The defendant had requested the sanction due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with a discovery order. The plaintiff had been ordered to provide discovery responses within 30 days, but did not do so until July 17, 2024. The defendant argues that the responses are deficient, but the court finds that the failure to obey the order was not willful. The court also notes that the plaintiff's failure to pay monetary sanctions does not warrant terminating sanctions, as the remedy is to obtain a writ of execution to enforce payment. The court denies the defendant's request to re-order the monetary sanctions and denies the request to award additional monetary sanctions.
