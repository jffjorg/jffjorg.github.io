[1] The
Court notes that Plaintiff’s opposition was due July 19, 2024, but was filed
July 24, 2024. Nevertheless, the Court exercises its discretion to consider
Plaintiff’s opposition, absent prejudice to Defendant, in light of the
court-wide connectivity issues experienced from July 19 through July 23.


[2] Though
Plaintiff’s complaint does not allege a negligent entrustment cause of action,
he alleges that Defendant negligently entrusted the vehicle to Prete.
(Complaint ¶ 11.) Additionally, Defendant does not assert that the negligent
entrustment cause of action is not “within the pleadings” for purposes of a
summary judgment motion. 


[3] While
Defendant asserts in reply that Prete had a drivers’ license, it presents no
evidence that it verified the license prior to renting the vehicle. (See Reply,
7-8.)
