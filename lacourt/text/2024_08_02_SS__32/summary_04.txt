And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to compel compliance with a demand for a physical examination. The motion was filed by defendants Lillian Lugosi and Jeff Lugosi against plaintiff Anthony Lightfoot. The defendants sought to compel the plaintiff to appear for a physical examination with Dr. Paul E. Kaloostian, which was originally scheduled for March 13, 2024. The plaintiff failed to appear for the examination and did not respond to the demand.

The Judge granted the motion to compel compliance, ordering the plaintiff to appear for a physical examination within 15 days, unless the defendants stipulate otherwise. The Judge also awarded monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,185 to the defendants' counsel, representing 1.5 hours of attorney time, the $750 no-show fee, and the $60 filing fee. The plaintiff and his counsel are jointly and severally responsible for paying the sanctions within 30 days.
