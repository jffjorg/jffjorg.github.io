And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion to compel further responses to the deposition subpoena for production of business records issued to non-party David Vesco, M.D. The Defendant filed the motion on April 4, 2024, but no opposition was filed. The Judge found that the proof of service attached to the motion indicates service by mail only, which is insufficient for personal service. Additionally, the Judge noted that a separate statement was required for the motion, which was not provided. Therefore, the Judge denied the motion.
