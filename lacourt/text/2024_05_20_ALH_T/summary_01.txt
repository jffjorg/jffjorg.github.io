  - Defendant: seeking summary judgment, alleging that the plaintiff's injury was caused by a trivial defect
Significant Statements:
  - "The trivial defect doctrine applies to a property owner who is not liable for damages caused by a minor, trivial, or insignificant defect in property unless a plaintiff can plead and prove additional factors bearing on whether the defect presented a substantial risk of injury."
  - "A party seeking summary judgment must offer admissible evidence about the surrounding context that would allow the factfinder to know if the defect is more dangerous than the tape measure would suggest."
```

Note: The court's tentative ruling is to deny the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the defendant's duty to maintain the premises safely and the plaintiff's injuries.
