BACKGROUND
On November 5, 2020, Plaintiff
Adrianne Pearson filed this trip and fall negligence action against Defendant
Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. 
On February 21, 2024, Defendant
filed a Motion to Compel Nonparty David Vesco, M.D. to Comply with the
Subpoena. On February 27, 2024, Dr. Vesco responded to the Subpoena with an
Affidavit of No Records.
On April 4, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant Motion to Compel Further Responses to Deposition Subpoena for Production of Business Records Issued to
Non-Party David Vesco, M.D. No opposition has been filed. 
LEGAL STANDARD
             Personal service of any deposition subpoena
is effective to require a deponent who is a resident of California to:
personally appear and testify, if the subpoena so specifies; to produce any
specified documents; and to appear at a court session if the subpoena so
specifies. (CCP § 2020.220(c).)
CCP § 2025.480(a) provides that
“[i]f a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information,¿or tangible thing under the deponent's
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production.” Unlike CCP § 1987.1, CCP § 2025.480 also includes a time
limit. If a nonparty disobeys a deposition subpoena, the subpoenaing party may
seek a court order compelling the nonparty to comply with the subpoena
within¿60 days¿after completion of the¿deposition record. (CCP §
2025.480(b); Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 CA4th 123, 127.)
The deposition record is “complete” either on the date documents are specified
for production or on the date objections are served. (Board of Registered
Nursing v. Sup.Ct. (Johnson & Johnson (2021) 59 CA5th 1011,
1032-1033.)  
A motion to compel production of
documents described in a deposition notice must be accompanied by a showing of
“good cause”—i.e., declarations containing specific facts justifying
inspection of the documents described in the notice. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(1)).
“A written notice and all moving papers supporting a motion to compel an
answer to a deposition question or to compel production of a document or
tangible thing from a nonparty deponent must be personally served on the
nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees to accept service by mail
or electronic service at an address or electronic service address specified on
the deposition record.” (CRC Rule 3.1346.) 
A separate statement is required for motions to compel further responses
to a demand for inspection of documents or tangible things. (CRC Rule
3.1345(a)(3).)
DISCUSSION
Defendant moves to compel further
responses to the deposition subpoena
for production of business records issued to non-party David Vesco, M.D. 
            As Dr. Vesco is a non-party,
personal service of the motion is required. (CRC Rule 3.1346.) The proof of
service attached to the motion indicates service by mail only. Further, it is
unclear if Dr. Vesco was even personally served with the deposition subpoena or
only served by mail based on the proof of service of deposition subpoena.
(Lopez Decl., ¶5, Exh. 2A.) Lastly, there is no separate statement as required
by CRC Rule 3.1345(a)(3).
Based on
the foregoing, the motion is DENIED.
