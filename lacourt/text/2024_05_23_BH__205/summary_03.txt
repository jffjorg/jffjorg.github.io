And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling grants the petition to release the mechanic's lien. Petitioner Diya Finance LLC seeks to release the lien because Respondent All California Constructions, Inc. failed to enforce the lien within 90 days of recording the lien, as required by Civil Code § 8460. Petitioner complied with the necessary service requirements and sent a written demand letter to Respondent to remove the lien, which was ignored. The court finds that the lien is invalid and orders its release. The prevailing party is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees."
