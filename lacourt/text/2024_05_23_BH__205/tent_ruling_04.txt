  order RE:
  Defendant joseph hallberg’s 
  MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF 
  SUMMONS
 



 
BACKGROUND
 
This is an unlawful detainer action.  The real property at issue is located at
13455 Maxella Avenue, Space No. 206-260 also known as Space No. 260B, located
in the City of Marina Del Rey in the County of Los Angeles (the
“Premises”).  (Compl. ¶ 7.)  Plaintiff RAR2-Marina Marketplace LLC leased
the Premises to Phenix Salon Suites, Marina Del Rey, LLC (“Phenix”) and Doe
Defendants (collectively “Defendants”) pursuant to a written commercial lease
agreement (“Lease”).  (Id. ¶ 8.) 
Under the Lease, Defendants were obligated to
pay rent as well as common area operating costs, taxes and other expenses
(collectively “Rent”).  (Id. ¶ 10.)  Plaintiff alleges that as of February 14,
2024, Defendants have failed to pay Rent in the amount of $49,252.06.  (Id. ¶ 12.)  
On February 15, 2024, Plaintiff caused to be
served upon Defendants a written Notice to Pay Rent or Surrender Possession
(the “Notice”) by sending the notice to Defendants via FEDEX.  The Notice sets forth the nature of
Defendants’ default, requires Defendants to pay the Rent due or deliver
possession of the Premises within five days, and states Plaintiff’s election to
declare a forfeiture of the Lease.  (Id.
¶13.)  More than five days have elapsed
since the service of the Notice, but Defendants have not paid the full amount
of Rent due nor have they vacated the Premises. 
(Id. ¶14.)
Plaintiff filed the instant Complaint against
Phenix on February 29, 2024.  Plaintiff,
through a registered process server, executed substitute service on Phenix.  Further, on March 4, 2024, Plaintiff, via its
registered process server, executed service on “all unknown occupants” at the
Premises by leaving a copy of the prejudgment claim form attached to the summons
and complaint on a person of suitable age and discretion and in charge of the
Premises.  (Wright Decl. ¶ 2.)  The registered process server then affixed a
copy of the prejudgment claim form, summons and complaint to a conspicuous
place on the Premises.  (Id.)  The registered process server also mailed a
copy of the prejudgment claim form, summons and complaint to all unnamed
occupants of the premises.  (Id. ¶3.)
This hearing is on Defendant Joseph
Hallberg’s motion to quash service of summons. 
Hallberg claims he is an unnamed occupant.  Hallberg argues that service should be
quashed because he was not personally served. 
Rather, the complaint and summons were dropped between the screen and
the door, and such posting is not allowed absent Court order.  
 
DISCUSSION
“Service
of process, under longstanding tradition in our system of justice, is
fundamental to any procedural imposition on a named defendant.”  (AO
Alfa-Bank v. Yakovlev (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 189, 202.)  “To
establish personal jurisdiction, compliance with statutory procedures for
service of process is essential.”  (Kremerman v. White (2021). 71
Cal.App.5th 358, 371.)  
But
the statutory requirements are to be liberally construed to uphold
jurisdiction, rather than defeat it.  (Pasadena
Medi-Center Assocs. v. Sup.Ct. (Houts) (1973) 9 Cal.3d 773, 778 (“The provisions of this chapter should
be liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold the jurisdiction of the
court if actual notice has been received by the defendant, and in the last
analysis the question of service should be resolved by considering each
situation from a practical standpoint.”) 
Defendant’s
knowledge of the action does not dispense with statutory requirements for
service of summons.  (Kappel v. Bartlett (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d
1457, 1466.)  However, as long as the
defendant receives actual notice of the lawsuit, substantial compliance with the Code provisions governing
service of summons will generally be held sufficient.  (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 410-411 (“It is well settled that strict compliance
with statutes governing service of process is not required.  Rather, in deciding whether service was
valid, the statutory provisions regarding service of process should be
liberally construed to effectuate service and uphold the jurisdiction of the
court if actual notice has been received by the defendant.”).)
“A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow” may move “to quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him
or her” that results from lack of proper service.  (Code of Civ. Proc.
§418.10(a)(1).  A defendant has 30 days after the service of the summons
to file a responsive pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§412.20(a)(3).)  
“When a defendant challenges the court’s personal
jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the
facts requisite to an effective service.’” (Summers, 140
Cal.App.4th at 413.)      
DISCUSSION
Pursuant
to Code Civ. Proc. §1174.25,
an occupant who is served with a prejudgment claim of right to possession is
required to file a claim with the court within 10 days of the date of service
of the prejudgment claim, which period shall include Saturdays and Sundays but
exclude all other judicial holidays.  Further,
the claimant shall answer or otherwise respond to the summons and complaint
within five days after filing a prejudgment claim, which period shall include Saturdays
and Sundays, but exclude all other judicial holidays.  (Code Civ. Proc. §1174.25.)
Here,
the prejudgment claim was served on all occupants on March 4, 2024.  (Wright Decl. ¶ 2.)  Accordingly, Defendant was required to file a
claim no later than March 14, 2024. 
However, Defendant filed his prejudgment claim on March 27, 2024, nearly
two weeks after the due date.
Further,
Defendant was required to file any response to the Complaint within five days
after filing a prejudgment claim, which should have been no later than April 1,
2024.  Defendant failed to do so.  Defendant filed his motion to quash on April
4, 2024, three days after his response deadline expired.  Accordingly, his motion is untimely.  
Even
if timely, Defendant’s motion to quash is without merit.  Defendant argues that he was not properly
served pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §415.45 because Plaintiff failed to secure the Court’s authorization to
post the summons and complaint.  But the
service here was pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §415.46(c)(3), not §415.45.  Code Civ. Proc. §415.45 applies to
named parties only.  Section 415.46(c)(3) authorizes
service of unknown occupants by “affixing” copy of the summons and complaint, “in
a conspicuous place on the premises.”  This
does not require court authorization.  As there is no dispute the summons
and complaint were posted in a “conspicuous place,” the Court denies
Defendant’s motion to quash service of summons. 

The Court
next considers Plaintiff’s request for sanctions pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §128.5.  Plaintiff seeks sanctions on the ground
Defendant is not even an occupant of the Property, and his motion is therefore
frivolous.  Plaintiff’s request is
procedurally improper.   Plaintiff
was required to have filed a separate motion for sanctions, rather than seeking
the sanctions in its opposition.  (Code
Civ. Proc. §128.5(f)(1)(a).)  
Moreover, where the alleged bad faith or frivolous action
or tactic is the filing of a motion, Plaintiff must follow a two-step procedure.  First, the moving party must serve on the offending party a motion for sanctions.  Service of the sanctions motion triggers the
21-day safe harbor period during which the moving party may not file the
motion. (Code Civ. Proc. §128.5(f)(1)(b).)  That
is because the offending party may avoid sanctions by withdrawing the
challenged pleading during the 21-day period. 
Second, if the offending party does not withdraw the challenged pleading
during that period, then the moving party may file the sanctions motion. (Id.)
The “21 days is not a notice
period. … It defines when the target of a sanctions motion can act without
penalty and withdraw” an objectionable document.  (Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Structured Asset Sales, LLC (2022) 75 Cal.App.5th 596, 606.)  The moving party must file the motion “outside the safe harbor period,”
not “on day one of the safe harbor period, day 21 of the safe harbor period, or
any day in between.” (Id.)  In
other words, the “sanctions motion cannot be filed until the 22nd day after
service of the motion, i.e., after the 21-day safe harbor period expires.”
 (Id. at
605.)
Moreover,  the law
requires strict compliance with the safe harbor provisions. (Li v. Majestic Industry
Hills LLC (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th
585, 593.)  Failure to comply with
the safe harbor provisions “precludes an award of sanctions.”  (Martorana v.
Marlin & Saltzman (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 685, 700.); see also Li, 177
Cal.App.4th at 594 (“compliance with the safe harbor is a prerequisite to
recovering sanctions”).)  Here,
Plaintiff did not comply with the safe harbor provision, and therefore, its
request for sanctions must be denied.  
CONCLUSION
            For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Defendant
Joseph Hallberg’s motion to quash service of summons and Plaintiff’s request
for sanctions.
