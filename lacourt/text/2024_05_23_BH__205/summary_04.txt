And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Joseph Hallberg. The case involves an unlawful detainer action between Plaintiff RAR-2 Marina Marketplace LLC and Defendant Phenix Salon Suites Marina Del Rey, LLC. The dispute centers around the service of summons and complaint on Defendant Hallberg, who claims he was not properly served. The Court held that the service was proper and denied the motion to quash. The Court also denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions, as Plaintiff failed to comply with the safe harbor provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5. The case involves a lease agreement between the parties, a notice to pay rent or surrender possession, and a complaint filed by Plaintiff. The Court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections related to service of process, as well as case law and statutory provisions.
