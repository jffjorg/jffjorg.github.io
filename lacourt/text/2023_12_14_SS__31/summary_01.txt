And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the motion to quash a subpoena for prior defense counsel's appearance at trial without prejudice. The motion was filed by the defendants, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, et al., who are seeking to quash the subpoena issued by the plaintiff, Grady Dillon. The plaintiff opposes the motion, and the court has considered the arguments made by both parties. The court finds that it is appropriate for the trial judge to determine the issue of prior defense counsel's appearance, as it is a matter that should be addressed in the context of motions in limine. The motion is denied without prejudice, allowing the defendants to raise the issue again at the time of the trial judge's ruling on motions in limine.
