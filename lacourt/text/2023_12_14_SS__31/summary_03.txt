And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to take the motion for summary judgment off-calendar due to insufficient statutory notice. The moving parties filed their motion and supporting papers late, and the original papers did not include expert witness declarations. This late service and lack of declarations give the plaintiff insufficient time to prepare an opposition and hire her own experts to contest the motion. The statute requires at least 75 days' notice before a summary judgment hearing, and the moving parties did not provide this notice. The judge has ordered the moving parties to give notice, and the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with specific information. If the parties do not submit or appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off-calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
