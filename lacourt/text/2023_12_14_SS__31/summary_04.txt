And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's unopposed motion to compel the plaintiff to serve verified responses to discovery requests. The defendant propounded discovery requests on June 8, 2022, and the plaintiff served unverified responses on October 6, 2022. The defendant requested verified responses by February 3, 2023, but the plaintiff has not served verified responses. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to provide timely and verified responses to the discovery requests, and therefore grants the defendant's motion to compel. However, the court denies the defendant's request for sanctions due to lack of compliance with CCP § 2023.040. The court orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the defendant's discovery requests.
