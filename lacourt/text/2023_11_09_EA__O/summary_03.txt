And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several issues related to a future court hearing. The court will not provide an analysis on the motion for punitive damages against a healthcare provider because the plaintiffs did not obtain leave of court as required by CCP section 425.13. The court also notes that the parties should have filed a stipulation and taken the matter off calendar after the plaintiffs filed a notice of non-opposition. The court directs the parties to previous rulings for a detailed discussion of the law and analysis regarding Dr. Badday's demurrer and motion to strike. The court also addresses the plaintiffs' argument that Dr. Badday failed to incorporate paragraph 33 into its analysis, stating that incorporation by reference imposes a burden on the court and defendant to search through the pleadings. The court finds that the plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient for elder abuse purposes and that the Winn court disapproved the holding in Mack v. Soung. Finally, the court notes that the defendant's demurrer to the 2nd cause of action for negligence is waived because no analysis was provided.
