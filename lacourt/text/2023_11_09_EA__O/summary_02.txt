The ruling also sustains the demurrer filed by Dr. Hussein Abidali, D.O. to the first through third causes of action (elder abuse, negligence, and willful misconduct) with leave to amend. The motion to strike filed by Dr. Abidali is granted with leave to amend.

The ruling is based on the Elder Abuse Act (EADACPA) and California Civil Procedure Code Section 430.10, which exclude liability for acts of professional negligence, simple or even gross negligence by health care providers. The ruling also cites to various California Supreme Court and Court of Appeal cases, including Delaney v. Baker (1999), Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004), and Johnson v.
