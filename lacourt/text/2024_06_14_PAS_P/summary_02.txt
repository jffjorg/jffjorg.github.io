And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has denied the Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the Court's prior order denying their motion to compel arbitration. The Plaintiffs argued that new evidence, in the form of declarations from their counsel, showed that there was an open extension of the two-year statute of limitations for arbitration. The Defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the new evidence was not new or different and was improperly filed. The Court found that the Plaintiffs had not made the required showing to warrant reconsideration and denied the motion.
