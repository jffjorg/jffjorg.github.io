ORDER SUSTAINING THE DEMURRER TO THE COMPLAINT WITH LEAVE TO AMEND AS TO THE
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AND OVERRULING THE DEMURRER TO THE SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
AS MOOT I.        INTRODUCTION
          In this personal injury action, Plaintiff Ruben Trinidad
alleges that, on or about November 13, 2022, he sustained a fall on an
unleveled, uneven, and sunken roadway located at or near 528 N. Chandler Ave.,
Monterey Park, CA 91754 (the “Subject Property”). (Complaint, ¶ 6.) 
          On May 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against
Defendants City of Monterey Park (“City”), County of Los Angeles (“County”),
and DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) Liability
for Dangerous Condition of Public Property Pursuant to Gov. Code § 835 et
seq.; and (2) Public Employee Liability for the Wrongful Acts or Omissions
Pursuant to Gov. Code § 840.2. 
          On July 14, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiff’s Request for
Dismissal, the Court dismissed the second cause of action without prejudice. 
          Also, on July 14, 2023, Defendant City filed a
Cross-Complaint against ROES 1 through 10, inclusive. Also, on such date,
Defendant City filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
On
March 21, 2024, Defendant County filed and served the instant demurrer to the
first and second causes of action in the Complaint on the grounds that the
Complaint contains a misjoinder of Defendant County pursuant to CCP §
430.10(d). 
As
of June 12, 2024, the demurrer is unopposed. Any opposition to the demurrer was
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the
hearing pursuant to CCP § 1005(b). 
II.      DEMURRER
A. Legal Standard
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on the basis that a
complaint fails to state a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A demurrer tests
the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer is treated as “admitting all
material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth of “contentions, deductions
or conclusions of law.” (Aubry v. Tri-Defendants Hospital Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) The general rule on demurrer is that the pleadings are
“deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th 593, 604.) A demurrer
may also be brought on the grounds that “[t]here is a defect or misjoinder of
parties.” (CCP § 430.10 (d).) 
Questions
of plaintiff’s ability to prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
213-214.)
Allegations
need not be accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable
facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462,
1474.) 
          Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where
there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Ibid.) “If there is any reasonable possibility that the
plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer
without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70
Cal.2d 240, 245.)  
          B. Meet and Confer Requirement Not
Met
          The Court notes that the meet and confer requirement has
not been met. Counsel for Defendant County, Tasha T. Salveron, Esq.
(“Salveron”), declares that on March 12 and 13, 2024, she attempted to contact
Plaintiff’s counsel to meet and confer to attempt to resolve the matters raised
in the demurrer. (Salveron Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s counsel failed to respond
to the request to meet and confer. (Id.) 
The
meet and confer requirement has not been met pursuant to CCP § 430.41. The lack
of meet and confer, however, does not affect the merits of the Court’s analysis
as to the demurrer. The Court, however, reminds the parties of the need to
comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure.  
C.
Judicial Notice 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant County’s request for judicial notice. (Evid. Code §§
452, 453.)  
Initially,
the Court notes that one of the documents to which Defendant County requests
judicial notice of is the Declaration of Carol Chaparro (“Chaparro”). Defendant
County offers such declaration to support the argument that the Subject
Property is located entirely within the jurisdiction of Defendant City.
(Request for Judicial Notice at p. 2:1-6.)
While
the Court can and does take judicial notice of the existence of the statements
contained in the declaration of Ms. Chapparo, the truth of the statements in
the declaration of Ms. Chaparro are not subject to judicial notice. (Big
Valley Band of Pomo Indians v. Superior Court (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1185,
1192.) 
          D. Demurrer
          Defendant County contends that the demurrer to the entire
Complaint should be sustained because various judicially noticeable documents
indicate that it has no jurisdiction over the Subject Property. 
          According to the judicially noticeable documents, the
Subject Property is located in the jurisdiction of Defendant City. (RJN at ¶¶
2-4; Exhs. B, C, and D to Salveron Decl.) 
          As to the first cause of action, Plaintiff must allege that
Defendant County owned the Subject Property. (Gov. Code § 835.) 
          As to the second cause of action for public employee
liability for wrongful acts or omissions, such cause of action was dismissed on
July 14, 2023. (07/14/23 Request for Dismissal.) 
          Here, judicially noticeable documents indicate that
Defendant County does not own the Subject Property as it is in the jurisdiction
of Defendant City. 
          Furthermore, given that the demurrer is unopposed, the
Court finds that Plaintiff has conceded to the arguments raised therein as
“[c]ontentions are waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned
argument and citations to authority.” (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo
(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.) 
          The
demurrer is sustained as to the first cause of action with leave to amend.
There is a possibility, with successful amendment, that Plaintiff may be able
to state a cause of action against Defendant County. 
          As to the second cause of action, Defendant County’s
demurrer thereto is overruled as moot due to Plaintiff’s dismissal of such
cause of action.  III.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 Defendant County’s demurrer is sustained with
leave to amend as to the first cause of action and overruled as moot as to the
second cause of action. 
Plaintiff
Ruben Trinidad is given 30 days to amend his Complaint. 
          Counsel for Defendant County of Los Angeles to give notice
of this order.
