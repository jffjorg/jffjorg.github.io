motion.
          On December 28, 2023, Symphony Asset Pool XIII LLC
(“Symphony”) filed an unlawful detainer complaint against Lucinda Sky (“Sky”)
under case number 23PDUD04606. Judgment was entered against Sky on May 15,

          On February 13, 2024, Sky filed a complaint against
Foothill L.A.P.D., Officer Juan Rico, and Capitan Marco Lozano under case
number 24BBCV00353. Sky alleges a police report she had taken was created
falsely as it omitted evidence she emailed in, and the police detective
disregarding the motives of the apartment building management harming Sky and
her son. Sky raised a CA Penal Code section 13510.8(a)(1), recklessly

of action against Officer Juan Rico: (1) abuse of power, (2) perjury, (3)
conspiracy, (4) concealment, (5) accessory to crime, (6) accessory to second
degree murder, and (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress.
          On May 23, 2024, all defendants in 24BBCV00353 were
dismissed without prejudice as the court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte
motion to dismiss.
          On March 5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against
Symphony and Otilia Rosenburg under case number 24NNCV00030. Plaintiffs contend
numerous events have transpired at their apartment including having documents
go missing from their unit, their dog being poisoned, burglary, car theft, to Plaintiffs
being poisoned by the building manager, Ms. Rosenburg. Plaintiffs also contend
there is a drug trafficking ring in the building.
Plaintiffs
asserted the causes of action of: (1) infliction of emotion distress, (2)
withholding victim’s Civil Rights, (3) concealment, (4) forgery, (5)
conspiracy, (6) racketeering and criminal profiteering, (7) housing
discrimination, and (8) injunctive relief against Symphony. Plaintiffs asserted
the causes of action of: (1) infliction of emotion distress, (2) poisoning
someone’s animal, (3) grand theft auto, (4) withholding victim’s right to their

II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
          Code Civ. Proc. §1048 provides as follows:       
(a) When actions involving a
common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a
joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it
may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
(b) The court, in furtherance
of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive
to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any cause of action,
including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate
issue or of any number of causes of action or issues, preserving the right of
trial by jury required by the Constitution or a statute of this state or of the
United States.
III.     ANALYSIS
          Plaintiffs seek an order consolidating 24NNCV00030,
23PDUD04606, and 24BBCV00353.
The
motion is denied. The cases have not yet been deemed related, with each of the
matters in different departments, 24NNCV00030 is in Dept. P at the Pasadena
Courthouse, 24BBCV00353 is in Dept. A at the Burbank Courthouse, and
23PDUD04606 is in Dept. R at the Pasadena Courthouse.  Pursuant to Local Rule 3.3(g)(1), which
requires cases to be pending in the same department before being consolidated,
the motion is denied. Further, judgment has been entered in 23PDUD04606 and
defendants dismissed in 24BBCV00353. Therefore, there are no matters to
consolidate with 24NNCV00030 at this time.         
The
motion to consolidate is denied.
In
Plaintiffs’ motion, Plaintiff Leonardo Nishanov states that he wishes to be
represented by his mother, Lucinda Sky. (Motion, 2:6-14.) The courts DENIES
this request as it would be the unauthorized practice of law under Business and
Professions Code §§ 6125 & 6126.
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          Plaintiffs Lucinda Sky and Leonardo Nishanov’s motion to
consolidate 24NNCV00030, 23PDUD04606, and 24BBCV00353 is DENIED.
