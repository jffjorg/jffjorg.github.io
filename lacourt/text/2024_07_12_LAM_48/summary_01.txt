And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions against the defendants. The defendants have failed to comply with a court order to produce discovery and have not responded to the plaintiff's initial discovery requests. The plaintiff has been unable to prepare for trial as a result of the defendants' non-compliance and has requested sanctions. The judge has imposed issue sanctions, prohibiting the defendants from supporting or opposing certain claims or defenses, and has ordered the defendants to take certain facts as established in accordance with the plaintiff's claims. The judge has also ordered the defendants to produce the requested discovery and has scheduled a hearing to confirm the sanctions.
