And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion for reconsideration filed by the plaintiffs is denied. The plaintiffs had requested that the court reconsider its previous order dismissing the Doe defendants from the case without prejudice. The judge found that there was no new information that would warrant reconsideration of the order. The judge notes that the plaintiffs had failed to file a reply explaining their delay in attempting to serve the Doe defendants with process. The judge granted the defendants' request for judicial notice and sustained their evidentiary objection. The judge also reminded the parties to comply with the technical requirements for e-filing documents, as set forth in the court's First Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil.
