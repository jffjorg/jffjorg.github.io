ANALYSIS: 
 
                   
I.Background  
On June 2, 2021, Plaintiff Command Fire Solutions, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
filed an action against Buckeye Fire Equipment Company (“Defendant”) for breach
of contract. The complaint alleges that Command Fire is in the business of
installing, servicing and repairing fire suppression systems for commercial
businesses. It further alleges that in 2014, the parties agreed to enter a
distributorship agreement to obtain access to Buckeye’s firefighting equipment.
Plaintiff claims that beginning in November of 2020, Buckeye refused to fill
further orders for Command Fire, breaching the parties’ distributorship
agreement. 
                On
April 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Enforce Settlement
Agreement and Enter Judgment. No opposition has been
filed. 
 
                
II.Legal Standard
 
CCP § 664.6, provides a summary
procedure that enables judges to enforce a settlement agreement by entering a
judgment pursuant to the terms of the parties’ settlement.  In particular,
the statute provides: 
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. 
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by a
party if it is signed by any of the following: 
 
(1) The party. 
(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized
in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf. 
 
(CCP¿§
664.6(a)-(b) (emphasis added).)
 
In
hearing a CCP § 664.6 motion, the trial court may receive evidence, determine
disputed facts, and enter terms of a settlement agreement as a judgment. 
(Bowers v. Raymond J. Lucia Companies, Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th
724, 732.) The Court may also receive oral testimony in addition to
declarations. (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th
1530, 1533.) The Court may interpret the terms and conditions to settlement (Fiore
v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the Court may not create
material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties
themselves have previously agreed upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v.
Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810). 
 
Strict compliance with the
statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce a settlement
agreement under this statute.  (Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) The party seeking to enforce a settlement “must first
establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed by the
parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the court. 
[Citation.]”  (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74
Cal.App.4th 299, 304.)  
 
             
III.Discussion 
 
 Plaintiff moves for an order enforcing its written
settlement agreement with Defendant pursuant to CCP § 664.6. 
 
Plaintiff
is entitled to an order enforcing the settlement agreement with
Defendant.  Plaintiff submitted evidence it entered into a written settlement
agreement with Defendant.  (Declaration of Madoni ¶ 4; Exh. A.) The
Settlement Agreement is signed by both Plaintiff and Defendant. (Id.) “The Parties
agree this Agreement may be enforced pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
Section 664.6 and consent to the Superior Court of California’s retention of
jurisdiction to enforce this Agreement.”  (Id., pg. 6.)  Under the
terms of the Settlement Agreement, Defendant agreed give Plaintiff credit in
the amount of $18,000 with Buckeye, which may be used to purchase material from
Buckeye over a 3-year period of time. (Id., pg. 2:14-22) The settlement
Agreement was executed in November 2023.  (Id., Exh. A. pg. 7.) 
 
On January
23, 2023, Plaintiff exercised its right to use the $18,000.00 credit by sending
an email to Buckeye's counsel providing a list of products Plaintiff sought to
order in the total amount of $16,460.00. (Madoni Decl., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff s
counsel then sent a follow-up email on February 17, 2024, because he had not
received a response from Buckeye’s attorney. (Id., ¶ 6.) After sending a third
email on March 11, 2024, Buckeye’s attorney responded indicating that he was
following up with his client. (Id., ¶ 7.) Counsel for the parties’ communicated
again on March 13, 2024, with Buckeye’s counsel indicating he was still
awaiting a response. (Id., ¶ 8.)
Additionally,
attorneys’ fees are enforced in the event of a dispute. (Id., Exh. A, pg. 6.)
 
Based on
the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement is
granted.
 
             
IV.Conclusion & Order 
 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement is
granted.  The Court enters Judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant in the amount of $18,000.00, plus $2,265 in attorney fees and costs
for a TOTAL of $20,265.00.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
