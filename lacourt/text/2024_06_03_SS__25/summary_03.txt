And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendants to respond to the inspection demand. The defendants, Felix and Yelena Bobritsky, have failed to respond to the plaintiff's request to inspect writings to enforce judgment. The court finds that the defendants have waived all objections by failing to respond to the inspection demand. As a result, the court orders the defendants to serve initial responses, without objections, to the plaintiff's request to inspect writings to enforce judgment within 30 days of this ruling. Additionally, the court orders the defendants to pay sanctions of $750 to the plaintiff within 30 days of the notice of this order.
