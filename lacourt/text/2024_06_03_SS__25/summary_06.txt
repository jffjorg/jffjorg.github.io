And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has denied without prejudice the motion to deem requests for admission (RFA) admitted set one. The defendant failed to serve responses to the RFAs, which waived any objection to the requests. The plaintiff requested monetary sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $1,410.00, but the court denied this request as well. The court noted that there was an inconsistency in the sanction amount requested, but ultimately found that the defendant's failure to serve responses to the RFAs did not warrant sanctions.
