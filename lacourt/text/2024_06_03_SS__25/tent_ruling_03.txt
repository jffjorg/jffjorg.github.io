(Complaint, ¶ 1.)   On  September 28, 2021, default was entered against Felix Bobritsky, Yelena  Bobritsky and Cooper Dietz. On October 26, 2021, default was entered against  Daniala Bobritsky. Default was entered again against Defendants Felix Bobritsky,  Yelena Bobritsky, Cooper Dietz, and Daniala Bobritsky on June 13, 2022.   On  July 11, 2022, Shoshana Bobritsky and Does 1 to 5 were dismissed.   On  January 24, 2023, this case was reclassified to Limited Jurisidction.   On  March 22, 2023, Default Judgment was entered against all remaining Defendants.    On  May 2, 2024, a stipulation for the appointment of Court Commissioner as  Temporary Judge was signed allowing Commissioner Latrice A. G. Byrdsong to hear  post judgment proceedings.   On  May 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Order Compelling Responses to  Plaintiff’s Request to Inspect Writings to Enforce Judgment (Set One).     No  opposition has been filed.     MOVING PARTY  POSITION               Plaintiff  moves the Court to order Defendants Felix and Yelena Bobritsky to respond to  Plaintiff’s Request to Inspect Writings to Enforce Judgment (Set One) as  Plaintiff Pensco Trust Company FBO Caesar Berger served the request on  Defendants Felix and Yelena and both failed to respond.   OPPOSITION                No opposition has been filed.    REPLY                No reply has been filed.   ANALYSIS   I.          Legal Standard   “The judgment  creditor may demand that any judgment debtor produce and permit the party  making the demand, or someone acting on that party’s behalf, to inspect and to  copy a document that is in the possession, custody, or control of the party on  whom the demand is made . . . if the demand requests information to aid in  enforcement of the money judgment.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.030, subd. (a).)  “The judgment  creditor may not serve interrogatories or inspection demands pursuant to this  section or Section 708.020 within 120 days after the judgment debtor has  responded to the interrogatories or demands previously served pursuant to this  section or Section 708.020, or within 120 days after the judgment debtor has  been examined pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 708.110), and the  judgment debtor is not required to respond to any discovery so served.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 708.030, subd. (b).) “Inspection  demands served pursuant to this section may be enforced to the extent  practicable, in the same manner as inspection demands in a civil action.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 708.030, subd. (c).)    Where there has  been no timely response to a demand for the production of documents, the  demanding party may seek an order compelling a response. (Code Civ. Proc. §  2031.300, subd. (b).) Failure to timely respond waives all objections,  including privilege and work product. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (a).)  Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from  waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is  no deadline for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond,  the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before  filing the motion.¿ II.        Discussion On December  11, 2013, the court in Pensco Trust Company FBO Caesar Berge IRA50%, et al. v.  Felix Bobritsky; et al., Los Angeles Superior Court Case Number #13R02212,  entered judgment against Felix Bobritsky for $23,492.96 and spouse Yelena  Bobritsky for $11,440.50 (Gentino Decl., ¶ 1.) The defendants disobeyed orders  to appear for examination in the Santa Monica Action, resulting in bench  warrants being issued against them. (Gentino Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) On December 14,  2020, Plaintiff filed this action for statutory damages resulting from the  defendants’ disobedience of subpoenas and court orders. (Gentino Decl., ¶ 5.)  On March 22, 2023, this Court entered judgment against the defendants for  $7,412, which remains unsatisfied. (Gentino Decl., ¶ 6.) On May 15, 2023,  counsel propounded a set of Plaintiff Pensco Trust Company FBO Caesar Berger’s  “Request to Inspect Writings to Enforce Judgment” on each defendant, but the defendants  did not respond. (Gentino Decl., ¶ 7.) In light of counsel’s declaration and the defendants’  failure to oppose the motion, the Court finds it proper to grant the request to  compel the defendants’ initial responses to Plaintiff’s request to inspect.     Plaintiffs seek sanctions relying on Code Civ. Proc.,  §2030.290, subd. (c). However, this section does not apply as the subject  motion concerns an inspection demand under Article 1.   The  court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)   Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d) provides that a misuse of the discovery  process is “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of  discovery.” Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(h) states that a misuse of the discovery  process includes “[m]aking or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial  justification, a motion to compel or limit discovery.” “The court may impose a  monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery  process, or any attorney advising that conduct” under Code Civ. Proc. §  2023.030(a). A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary  sanctions. Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc.  (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.   The Court finds it reasonable to impose sanctions in the  amount of $750 against Defendants Felix Bobritsky and Yelena Borbritsky.     III.       Conclusion               Plaintiff Pensco Trust Company LLC fbo Caesar Berger  IRA50%’s Motion for Order Compelling Defendants’ Responses to Plaintiff’s Request  to Inspect Writings to Enforce Judgment (Set One) is GRANTED.     Defendants Felix Bobritsky and Yelena Bobritsky are ordered  to serve initial responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Request to  Inspect Writings to Enforce Judgment within 30 days of this Court’s ruling.     The defendants, jointly and severally, are further ordered  to pay sanctions of $750 to the plaintiff within 30 days of the notice of this  Court’s order.    Moving party is ordered to give notice and to attach a copy of the Court's tentative Ruling as and exhibit, which now becomes the order of the Court.
