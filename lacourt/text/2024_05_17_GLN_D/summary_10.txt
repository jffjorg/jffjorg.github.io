```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling denies the defendant's claim of exemption, which is directed at a levy of a bank account. The defendant failed to provide sufficient documentation to support the claim, and the court finds that the defendant has not met the burden of proof to establish the right to exemption. The court also finds that the statute relied upon by the defendant, CCP section 703.140(b)(5), does not apply to this case. The claim of exemption is denied, and the matter is continued for further proceedings."
