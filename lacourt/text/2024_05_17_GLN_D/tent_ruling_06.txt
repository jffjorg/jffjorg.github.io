Hernandez     RELIEF REQUESTED:Order compelling plaintiffs to attend and testify at a deposition and produce documents.MONETARY SANCTION:None sought DECLARATION SUPPORTING MOTION:Reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally:  Yes, Ex. C FACTUAL BACKGROUND:Plaintiffs Ana I. Martinez and Alvaro O. Hernandez allege that in October of 2022, plaintiffs purchased a 2022 Kia EV6 with an accompanying written warranty issued by defendant Kia America Inc., pursuant to which Kia America, Inc. agreed to preserve or maintain the utility or performance of the vehicle or provide compensation if there was a failure in such utility or performance. Plaintiffs allege that the vehicle was delivered to plaintiffs with serious defects and nonconformities to warranty and developed other serious defects and nonconformities, including electrical and suspension system defects.     Plaintiffs allege that the defects and nonconformities to warranty manifested themselves within the express warranty period, and substantially impair the use, value, or safety of the vehicle.  Plaintiffs delivered the vehicle to manufacturer’s authorized repair facility for repair of the nonconformities, and defendant has been unable to conform plaintiffs’ vehicle to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of repair attempts.  The complaint alleges that notwithstanding plaintiffs’ entitlement, defendant has failed to either promptly replace the new motor vehicle or to promptly make restitution in accordance with the Song-Beverly Act.  The complaint alleges three causes of action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, for Breach of Express Warranty, Breach of Implied Warranty, and Civil Code section 1793.2. ANALYSIS:Defendant Kia Motors America, Inc. seeks by this motion to compel plaintiffs to attend and testify at deposition and produce documents.  CCP § 2025.450 (a) provides, in pertinent part:“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action…, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”Defendant indicates that defendant has served a Notice of Taking Deposition of Plaintiffs and Request for Production of Documents at Time of Deposition, plaintiffs have served objections to the notice on the ground the depositions were unilaterally set on a date and time that plaintiffs and plaintiffs’ counsel were unavailable, and also objected to the requests for production of documents.  [Rabiee Decl., paras. 2, 3, Exs. A, B]. Defendant indicates that counsel has emailed plaintiffs’ counsel on three occasions requesting dates for plaintiffs’ depositions, but has not received a response to the emails.
