Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The defendant, Kia America, Inc., seeks to compel the deposition of the plaintiffs, Ana I. Martinez and Alvaro O. Hernandez, and to produce documents. The court notes that this matter is subject to the Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation) applicable to Song-Beverly Litigation. The Order provides that the parties are to provide copies of certain documents, including warranty policy and procedure manuals, repair orders, and invoices.

The defendant has served a Notice of Taking Deposition of Plaintiffs and Request for Production of Documents, and the plaintiffs have served objections to the notice on the ground that the depositions were unilaterally set on a date and time that the plaintiffs and their counsel were unavailable. The defendant indicates that counsel has emailed the plaintiffs' counsel on three occasions requesting dates for the depositions, but has not received a response to the emails.

The court grants the motion to compel deposition and orders the plaintiffs to appear for deposition and give testimony by June 21, 2024, at 9:00 a.m., at the law offices of the plaintiff's counsel. The parties are also directed to the Notice to All Counsel Re: Lemon Law Cases for Department D, entitled Customary Rulings Re Document Requests (Song Beverly Litigation).
