And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's decision on a demurrer filed by defendant Sarkis Minasyan. The demurrer challenged the sufficiency of the allegations in the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiff on the fraud, conspiracy to defraud, and intentional misrepresentation causes of action, overruling the demurrer. However, the judge has sustained the demurrer on the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action, finding that the plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege the existence of a fiduciary duty owed by Minasyan to the plaintiff. The judge has also denied the motion to strike punitive damages. The ruling is subject to change based on any further briefing or motions filed by the parties.
