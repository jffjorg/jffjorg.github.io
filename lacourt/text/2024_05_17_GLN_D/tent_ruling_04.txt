Spinnaker Insurance Company, et al.  MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSELMoving Party: Buscemi Hallet LLP   Name of Client: Plaintiff  Paul J. Abramson (No Opposition)  Correct address in proof of service?     Client: ok    Other parties:  ok 16/+5 day lapse? ok   RELIEF REQUESTED: Order permitting attorney to be relieved as attorney of record in this action GROUNDS FOR MOTION:Conduct making unreasonably difficult continue effective legal representation, breakdown in attorney-client relationshipDECLARATION BY MOVING ATTORNEY: Reasons why motion is necessary:    ok  Address recently confirmed (within last 30 days) By confirmation of the client in writing via email    PROPOSED ORDER:Address and phone number of client set forth:    ok   Proper warning:  ok Future dates filled in:     Confusing   ANALYSIS:The proposed order is confusing here, as in connection with the Final Status Conference, the order states it is set for January 9, 2024, when the date is January 9, 2025.   [Order, para. 8].  In addition, with respect to the trial in this action, the order states it is set, “Trial Call scheduled for January 21, 2025…”  [Order, para. 9b].  This is confusing, as it is not clear what a “Trial Call” would be, and the client should be notified that this date is the time the trial will commence, and that the party must appear prepared for trial on that date.  Counsel is ordered to modify the order before the motion will be granted. RULING:[No Opposition]UNOPPOSED Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED. The Court will sign the proposed Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel-Civil with the following modifications: (1) in paragraph 8, the Order will indicate there is a Final Status Conference scheduled in this matter on January 9, 2025, not 2024; (2) in paragraph 9b the word “Call” will be deleted from the Order. The word must be completely blacked out.    As so modified, the Court will sign the Order and counsel will be relieved effective upon the efiling of the proof of service of the signed order upon the client.  DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCESPlease make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.  Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.  However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED. If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.
