          Plaintiff
Katherine Bigelow (“Bigelow”) (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel the deposition of Defendant Western Asset Management
Company, LLC’s (“WAM”) (“Defendant”) person most knowledgeable (“PMK”) to
appear for deposition to provide further testimony on Plaintiff’s Topic
Nos. 37, 38, and 39 (“Disputed Topics”).  (Notice of Motion,
pg. 2; C.C.P §2070.010.)[1]  Plaintiff further requests sanctions of no
less than $8,482.50 against Defendant.  (Notice
of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P §§2023.010 et seq., 2030.030(a), 2031.310(h).)
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Defendant’s PMK to Attend Deposition, the Court rules as follows.
          In
April 2021, Plaintiff served a Notice of Deposition of Defendant’s PMK.  (Decl. of Boyamian ¶12.)  Initially, Defendant only agreed to produce
deponents on topic Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 12-15, and 25-26 (out of 39).  (Decl. of Boyamian
¶12.) Defendant’s refusal to produce a PMK deponent on the remaining topics
resulted in an IDC on June 22, 2022, with Judge Bachner, and Judge Bachner
agreed in full to proceed with an PMK deposition on all topics. (Decl. of
Boyamian ¶12, Exh. G.) 
On December 20, 2022, Defendant served its
responses and objections to Plaintiff’s PMK Deposition Notice.  (Decl. of Boyamian ¶13, Exh. H.)  
On December 23, 2022, Defendant produced
Robert Sibbrel (“Sibbrel”) as Defendant’s PMK.  (Decl. of Boyamian ¶13.)  However, at the deposition, Plaintiff’s
Counsel learned that Defendant would not subject Sibbrel to a variety of topics,
which again resulted in meet and confer efforts.  (Decl. of Boyamian
¶13.)
While the Parties were able to resolve a
majority of the outstanding topics, there remains three categories, the
Disputed Topics, for which Defendants will not produce a PMK.  (Decl. of Boyamian ¶13, Exh. I.)
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on October 13, 2023. 
Defendant filed its opposition on November 1, 2023.  Plaintiff filed her reply on November 7,
2023.
          The
Court grants Plaintiff’s motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders Defendant’s
PMK to appear for deposition and provide testimony on the Disputed Topics in 20
days.  Plaintiff has demonstrated good
cause to order Defendant to produce a PMK witness on Topic Nos. 37, 38,
and 39 of Plaintiff’s notice.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions
totaling $8,482.50. 
          The
Court awards sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2023.030 in the amount of $8,542.50, calculated as follows:
($725/hour x 11.7 hours) = $8,482.50 for
attorney’s fees
$8,482.50 + $60.00 filing fee = $8,542.50
fees and costs
Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
Moving Party is to give notice of this
ruling.
