Summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained with 20 days leave to amend the defendant's demurrer to the 4th cause of action for fraudulent concealment. The plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient particularity for allegations against the defendant. The defendant's motion to strike is denied as moot in light of the court's ruling on the demurrer.
