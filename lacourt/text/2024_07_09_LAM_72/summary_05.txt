And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Juan Jose Hernandez v. Ford Motor Company, et al. The case involves a warranty contract between Plaintiff and Ford, and Plaintiff alleges that Ford knew about defects in the vehicle's transmission. Ford and Galpin demurred to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state a claim for relief.

The Court has overruled the demurrer to the fifth and sixth claims, finding that Plaintiff has specifically alleged defects and Ford's knowledge thereof. The Court also concludes that Plaintiff has pled adequate facts to support a claim for fraudulent inducement.

The Court has also rejected Ford's argument that the economic loss rule precludes recovery in tort, finding that concealment-based claims for fraudulent inducement are not barred by the economic loss rule.

The case will proceed to the next stage, where the parties will have the opportunity to present further evidence and arguments.
