And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by Kevin Laughlin against Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, Ohio Casualty Insurance Company, and Ohio Security Insurance Company. The court has also sustained the demurrer to certain claims without leave to amend, including fraud (concealment), abuse of process, unfair competition, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and promissory estoppel.

The court has granted leave to amend the complaint to the extent that Laughlin may seek to add new claims, including constructive fraud and unfair competition, but only if he seeks leave to amend by a noticed motion.

The court has also found that the federal court's judgment on the merits, which held that Laughlin was not actually insured under the policy, is preclusive in this case.

The court has further found that the Ohio Insurers had a duty to defend Laughlin, but failed to do so in a timely and reasonable manner, and that Laughlin reasonably believed he was insured under the policy.
