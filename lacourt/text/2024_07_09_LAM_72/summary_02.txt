Summary in English:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for terminating, issue, and evidentiary sanctions against the defendant. However, the judge orders the defendant to provide supplemental responses compliant with the April 2, 2024 discovery order within 15 days, and if the defendant fails to do so, the judge will issue evidentiary sanctions prohibiting the defendant from introducing any documents not yet produced and from calling any witnesses not yet identified. The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,800.00, which is equivalent to 8.0 hours of attorney's fees. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to comply with the discovery order has been willful and that sanctions are warranted.
