Background
 
Plaintiff filed this action on April 24, 2017, raising a
number of claims under FEHA.
 
On January 12, 2024, following a jury trial, Plaintiff
obtained judgment in her favor for sexual harassment, gender discrimination,
retaliation, and failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and
retaliation. Plaintiff obtained a total judgment of $445,064.17.
 
Plaintiff filed this motion on June 10, 2024. No party filed
an opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
The lodestar method for calculating attorney fees applies to
any statutory attorney fees award, unless the statute authorizing the award
provides for another method of calculation. (Glaviano v. Sacramento City
Unified School Dist. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 744, 750-751.) “Under the
lodestar method, the trial court must first determine the lodestar figure—the
reasonable hours spent multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate—based on a
careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of
each attorney involved in the presentation of the case.” (Id. at p.
751.) 
 
The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)  
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) 
 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California
Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) When items are
properly objected to, the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
Discussion
 
Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees
 
“In civil actions brought under this section, the court, in
its discretion, may award to the prevailing party, including the department,
reasonable attorney's fees and costs, including expert witness fees, except
that, notwithstanding Section 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a prevailing
defendant shall not be awarded fees and costs unless the court finds the action
was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless when brought, or the plaintiff
continued to litigate after it clearly became so.” (Gov. Code, § 12965, subd.
(c)(6).)
 
Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this FEHA action. The
Court therefore awards attorney’s fees.
 
Amount of Attorney’s Fees
 
Lodestar
 
Plaintiff requests the following hourly rates and time
expenditures:
 
For Julia Z. Wells, admitted 2017, $725.00 per hour for
506.0 hours;
 
For Dalia Khalili, admitted 2007, $975.00 per hour for 52.6
hours;
 
For Vanessa M. Rodriguez, admitted 2011, $725.00 per hour
for 183.6 hours;
 
For Debra J. Tauger, admitted 1989, $1,050.00 per hour for
117.4 hours;
 
For Andrew Sokolowski, admitted 2003, $900.00 per hour for
128.2 hours;
 
For Tagore Subramaniam, admitted 2011, $775.00 per hour for
83.1 hours;
 
For Sydney Adams, admitted 2018, $625.00 per hour for 21
hours; and 
 
For legal assistants, $250.00 per hour for 329 hours.
 
 
            As
an initial matter, the Court finds these hourly rates to be reasonable.
 
            The
number of hours, while high, appear justified under the circumstances of this
case. This case was filed in 2017 and came to trial in January 2024, over six
years later. Defendants vigorously litigated this case and denied liability up
to trial. The parties engaged actively in discovery, with Plaintiff taking four
depositions in addition to substantial written discovery. Defendants filed a
comprehensive motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication as to each
of Plaintiff’s claims. Plaintiff opposed the summary judgment and prevailed on
all but one of thirteen claims.
 
            Further,
Plaintiff’s lawyers faced substantial risks at trial that would understandably
require additional attorney work to mitigate. Plaintiff did not have
eyewitnesses corroborating her harasser’s physical assaults on her, heightening
the risk of loss if the jury did not find Plaintiff’s testimony to be credible.
Further, because Plaintiff does not speak English as a primary language and
required an interpreter, there were concerns that the jurors may not be able to
fairly evaluate her testimony. Additionally, as outlined in Plaintiff’s brief, there
were significant concerns that jurors could react poorly or apathetically to
the particular facts of Plaintiff’s case.
 
            In
spite of these strategic difficulties, Plaintiff’s attorneys were able to
obtain a favorable result in this case. 
 
For these reasons, the Court finds the time expenditures to
be reasonable.
 
Plaintiff’s lodestar is $949,672.50.
 
Lodestar Multiplier
 
Plaintiff requests a lodestar multiplier of 2.0. The Court
does not agree that  a multiplier is
appropriate.  
 
It is true that the sheer length of this litigation
necessarily created unavoidable risk – Defendants never offered more than
$30,000.00 in settlement discussions – that could not be absorbed with
additional hours, and in fact is to some extent the cause of the high time
expenditures. Because this is a contingent fee case, Plaintiff’s attorney’s
expended considerable time at the risk of not being paid at all.
 
However, while Plaintiff faced vigorous litigation from
Defendants and substantial risk at a jury trial, much of that risk can be seen
to be accounted for in Plaintiff’s high time expenditures and moderately heavy
staffing of the trial team, which consisted of four attorneys. That Plaintiff’s
counsels obtained the result they did is significant. The numbers and hours
required to do so make it less so, however, and necessarily dampen both the
risk and skill required by any one attorney.
 
Under the facts of this case, the Court does not find a
lodestar multiplier to be necessary or appropriate.
 
Expert Witness Fees
 
            Plaintiff
incurred $13,782.50 in expert witness fees for experts who were key to
establishing her emotional distress damages. (Wells Decl. ¶ 11.) The Court
finds this amount to be reasonable.
