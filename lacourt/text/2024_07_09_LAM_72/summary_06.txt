English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and expert witness fees in the amount of $1,899,345.00 and $13,782.50, respectively. The court finds the time expenditures to be reasonable, citing the complexity and duration of the case, as well as the risk and skill required to obtain a favorable result. The court also finds the expert witness fees to be reasonable, as they were key to establishing the plaintiff's emotional distress damages. The court does not agree that a lodestar multiplier is appropriate, as the high time expenditures are partly due to the risk and complexity of the case.
