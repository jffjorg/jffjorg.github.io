And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants Defendant Lee Kum Kee USA, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff Jose Antonio Arroyo's individual PAGA claims. The arbitration agreement signed by Plaintiff excludes representative PAGA claims from arbitration, but does not mention individual PAGA claims. Defendant argues that the agreement only excludes representative PAGA claims, and Plaintiff's individual claims are therefore subject to arbitration. The Court finds that the FAA and Cal. Labor Code do not bar arbitration in this case, and that the arbitration agreement is otherwise enforceable.
