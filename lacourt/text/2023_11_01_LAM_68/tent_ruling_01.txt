  Case Number:  22STCP02330    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  68 Motion to Dismiss
Vonneisha McMurray vs. Officer Nicholas Hernandez, et al.,
22STCP02330

Moving Party: Defendant City of
Lancaster

Motion
            Defendant
City of Lancaster (Defendant) moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s action pursuant to
CCP §§ 581(f)(2) and 581(f)(4). Defendant moves for dismissal on the basis that
the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to every one of the causes of action
in Plaintiff’s complaint and granted a motion to strike, but Plaintiff failed
to amend within the time allowed by the Court. The demurrer was sustained on
July 11, 2023, with 20 days leave to amend, and since then, Plaintiff has not
filed an amended complaint.
            CCP § 581
provides in pertinent part:
“(f) The court may dismiss the
complaint as to that defendant when:…
(2) Except where Section 597
applies, after a demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave to amend,
the plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed by the court and either
party moves for dismissal…
(4) After a motion to strike the
whole of a complaint or portion thereof is granted with leave to amend the
plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed by the court and either
party moves for dismissal.”
            CCP § 597
does not apply in this case because that section concerns answers that plead
that the action is barred by the statute of limitations or by a prior judgment or
that an another action is pending on the same cause of action. None of those
are applicable to this case.
            Because
Plaintiff failed to amend her complaint in the time given, the Court grants
Defendant’s motion to dismiss.
Order
1.      Defendant
City of Lancaster’s motion to dismiss is GRANTED.
2.      The
complaint is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE as to Defendant City of Lancaster.
