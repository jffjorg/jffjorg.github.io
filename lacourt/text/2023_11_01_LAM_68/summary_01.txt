And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The City of Lancaster (Defendant) moves to dismiss the complaint filed by Vonneisha McMurray (Plaintiff) pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 581(f)(2) and 581(f)(4). The Defendant argues that the Court sustained its demurrer to every cause of action in the Plaintiff's complaint and granted a motion to strike, but the Plaintiff failed to amend the complaint within the time allowed by the Court. The Court finds that CCP section 597 does not apply in this case, as it concerns answers that plead that the action is barred by the statute of limitations or by a prior judgment or that another action is pending on the same cause of action. Therefore, the Court grants the Defendant's motion to dismiss and dismisses the complaint with prejudice as to the Defendant City of Lancaster.
