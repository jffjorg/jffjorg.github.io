BACKGROUND
 
Procedural
Background
On
June 20, 2022 Dr. Henry Kozachkov (Petitioner) filed a petition for writ of
administrative and ordinary mandate and complaint for injunctive relief (the “Initial
Petition” or “Pet.”). The Initial Petition alleged three causes of action –
administrative mandate under Code Civ. Proc. §1094.5, traditional mandate under
Code Civ. Proc. §1085, and declaratory relief. 
            The County of Los Angeles, and
Marcia Mayeda in her capacity as Director of the County of Los Angeles
Department of Animal Care and Control (Respondents) demurred to the Initial Petition.
On January 6, 2023, the Court sustained Respondents’ demurrer to the second
cause of action for traditional mandate and ordered the proceedings on
Petitioner’s third cause of action stayed pending resolution of the first cause
of action. The third cause of action contends Los Angeles County Code (LACC)
section 10.37 (LACC §10.37) is unconstitutional in part. Respondents demurred
to the third cause of action, and on August 20, 2024 this Court sustained the
demurrer granting Petitioner thirty (30) days leave to amend.
            Petitioner filed their First Amended
Complaint for Injunctive Relief (FAC) on September 17, 2024. The motions now
before the Court are Respondent’s Demurrer to the FAC and Respondent’s Motion
to Strike. No oppositions have been filed.   
 
Factual
Background
            Both the Initial Petition and the
operative FAC stem from the adoption of a dog. On September 27, 2021,
Petitioner adopted a dog named Jake through the organization AllJoy4Paw. (Pet.
¶1.) Later, Petitioner received a call from Respondent’s Department of Animal
Care & Control (DACC) informing him the DACC had initiated an investigation
into a bite incident involving Jake that occurred on July 27, 2021, prior to
Petitioner’s adoption of Jake. (Pet., ¶¶1, 9-16.)
            On December 1, 2021, the DACC served
Petitioner with a petition for administrative hearing to determine whether Jake
was “vicious”. (Pet., ¶¶1-2.) The hearing took place on March 8, 2022 and upon
the DACC issuing its decision on March 21, 2022, Jake was declared a vicious
dog, and restrictions on Petitioner’s ownership and maintenance of Jake were
imposed. (Pet., ¶32.)
[Tentative] Ruling
Respondents’
demurrer to the FAC is SUSTAINED. Respondents’ Motion to Strike
is DENIED as moot. Leave to amend is DENIED. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
“[A] demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235
Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in
ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not
subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a
complaint are assumed to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the
truth of conclusions of law. (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
ANALYSIS
            In filing their FAC,
Petitioner provides no new facts nor remedies the deficiencies of the Initial
Petition. The FAC’s primary contention is that LACC §§10.37.140(e) and
10.37.130(d) are unconstitutional, Petitioner relies on a non-binding District
Court case titled Doe v. City of Simi Valley (2012) WL 12507598 (“Simi
Valley”) in making this argument. 
In Simi Valley,
the plaintiffs – a group of Simi Valley registered sex offenders and their
family members – filed suit against the City of Simi Valley arguing that the
signage they were required to post on Halloween night infringed on their First
Amendment rights. The signage read “no candy or treats at this residence.”
Although the Simi Valley Court denied the plaintiffs request for a
temporary restraining order (TRO) as to its other claims, the plaintiffs were
granted a TRO as to the signage requirement because the signage requirement was
not narrowly tailored. (Simi Valley, supra at 7.)      
            Like
the argument made in opposition to the demurrer to the Initial Petition, the
argument here fails. Not only is the case non-binding, but it is also not
analogous. A notable distinction here is that the signage at issue was not
related to any conduct but was simply mandated as a stand-alone statement
plaintiffs were to make. The Simi Valley Court deemed this compelled
speech subject to strict scrutiny. (Simi Valley, supra at 7-8.)
In contrast, the designation here of Jake being a “vicious dog” is a legal
designation placed on the animal after Petitioner had the opportunity to
contest the designation. This is aimed at regulating Petitioner’s pet ownership,
which has an incidental effect – if any – on Petitioner’s speech. (Sorrell
v. IMS Health Inc. (2011) 564 U.S. 552, 567. [“It is also true that the
First Amendment does not prevent restrictions directed at commerce or conduct
from imposing incidental burdens on speech.”].) Additionally, in Simi Valley
there was already a publicly available list of sex offenders in the area
provided by California's Megan's Law website. Here, no such list exists for dogs
with the “vicious” designation. 
Finally, as
mentioned in the Court’s prior decision, the Court agrees with Respondents in
that the warnings required by LACC §§10.37.140(e) and 10.37.130(d) are simply a
safety regulations that counties may utilize for the safety of the general
public. Petitioner has provided no new information that changes this.  
 
Leave to Amend
Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment”]. As there is no reasonable possibility of successful amendment,
leave to amend is denied.
 
CONCLUSION
Accordingly, Respondents’
demurrer to the FAC is SUSTAINED. Respondents’ Motion to Strike
is DENIED as moot. Leave to amend is DENIED.
