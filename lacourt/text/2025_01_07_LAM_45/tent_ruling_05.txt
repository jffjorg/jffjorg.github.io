FACTUAL
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs
Mohammad Chaudhry, Bushra Chaudhry, and Hassun Chaudhry filed this action on
March 12, 2018. Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on April 27, 2018
and a Second Amended Complaint on June 20, 2018. Plaintiffs filed a Third
Amended Complaint on December 22, 2020. After sustaining a demurrer to the
Third Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint on
February 22, 2022. Plaintiffs filed a Fifth Amended Complaint (“5AC”) on March
9, 2022.
 
The
5AC is against defendants Greenbridge Management Company, KTown Metro Plaza,
LLC, and Sean Hashem, alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Written Lease
Agreement; (2) Constructive Eviction (Before March 13, 2018); (3) Retaliatory
Eviction; (4) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing;
(5) Nuisance; (6) Financial Elder Abuse; (7) Battery; (8) Gross Negligence; (9)
Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.; (10) Declaratory Relief;
and (11) Accounting.
 
This
action involves a lease agreement dispute between lessees who operated a Flame
Broiler franchise and landlord at a commercial space located at 3500 Wilshire
Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA. Plaintiffs allege that there were several issues
with how Defendants maintained and repaired the common areas, prolonged
construction of a food hall near Plaintiffs’ premises, and wrongfully denied
Plaintiffs from assigning the lease or changing the use of the premises.
 
On
September 21, 2018, Ktown Metro Plaza LLC filed a cross-complaint for breach of
contract. Ktown Metro dismissed the cross-complaint on January 22, 2020.
