            Background
            On

Baird Brown, a Professional Corporation, and Ann Brown (“Plaintiffs”) filed a
Complaint against defendants Donald G. Norris, an individual; Donald G. Norris,
a Law Corporation (“Norris Defendants”); Michelle Pak (“Pak”), an individual; and

manager and Robinson, Mr. Brown’s former legal assistant conspired with Norris
Defendants to transfer Mr. Brown’s clients and his practice to Norris
Defendants. (Compl., ¶¶12-14.) Furthermore, defendants conspired to divert Mr.
Brown’s legal fees and breached ethical responsibilities to timely sent two of
Mr. Brown’s clients shares of their settlement funds. (Id. at ¶17.)
            On
January 12, 2024, Norris Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs;
Andrew M. White, an individual; Jonathan N. White, an individual
(“Cross-Defendants”), and ROES 1-10, inclusive, alleging causes of action

            On
June 3, 2024, Plaintiff Baird A. Brown, a Professional Law Corporation, and Ann
Bown (“Brown Law”) filed the instant Motion to Compel Further Responses and
Compliance from Donald G. Norris, A Law Corp., to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set 1.  Defendants filed an opposition
to the motion on December 23, 2024. Plaintiffs filed a reply on December 30,
2024. 
 
Legal
Standard
            Requests
for Production
Code of Civil
Procedure § 2031.310(a) permits a party to move the court to compel further responses
where the party requesting responses deems that “a statement of compliance with
a demand is incomplete.” Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.310(b)
permits a party to move the court to compel further responses where the
responding parties’ representation of “inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete or evasive.”
The motion must
be made within 45 days after service of the verified response or any
supplemental verified response. (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 2033.290, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (c).)
Finally, California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving
further discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request,
the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling
further responses. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3)).¿
 
Meet and Confer 
The motion must
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration in compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure Section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).)
Plaintiffs provided
the declaration of their counsel of record, Jonathan N. White, attesting to
meet and confer made prior to the filing of the instant motions. Attorney White
sent a meet and confer letter on May 17, 2024. (White Decl., ¶14, Ex. K.) On
May 28, 2024, Attorney Oh served a response to the meet and confer letter which
did not provide any new documents.  (Id.
at ¶15, Ex. L.)
Additionally, Defendants
do not dispute that they engaged in a meet and confer. Thus, Plaintiff
sufficiently met and conferred in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
Section 2016.040. 
 
Discussion
            
Requests for Production of Documents (Set One)
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses from Defendant
Donald Norris to Requests for Production of Documents (Set One).  Plaintiffs seek code-compliant responses to
Requests for Production of Documents (“RFPDs”) in the following six (6)
categories: (1) Financial transactions between Norris/Norris Corp. and Ms. Pak
– RFPDs No. 1 and 7; (2) Settlement agreements/proposals in cases Norris/Norris
Corp. took over from Brown/Brown Law– RFPDs No. 3, 4, 10, 15, and 16; (3)
Defendants’ solicitations to persuade Brown/Brown Law clients to sign new
Representation Agreements with Norris/Norris Corp. – RFPD No. 17; (4) Client
Lists and Representation Agreements for clients which Norris/Norris Corp. took
over from Brown/Brown Law – RFPDs No. 2 and 5; (5) Documents related to the Roh
Case – RFPDs No. 10-14; and (6) Production of documents in their native format
with all relevant metadata.
            In
response to each of these requests, Defendants state that Plaintiffs now
possess all responsive documents from either the initial production of
documents, the supplemental production on August 19, 2024, or in compliance
with the November 18, 2024, Court Order, Defendants produced all further
responsive documents on and/or after December 18, 2024.  Further, Defendants state that Plaintiffs
have all the same documents as Defendants as Attorneys Andrew White and
Jonathan White took possession of Defendant Norris’ client files on October 21,
2023. In a sworn declaration, Attorney Marius Jungk states that Plaintiffs
produced nearly 277,000 documents to Defendants on September 19, 2024.  (Opp. Jungk Decl. ¿ 5.)  Additional further documents were produced on
December 18, 2024 pursuant to the November order of this court.  (Id. at Exh. C.)
            In
reply, Plaintiffs argue that the Defendant’s supplemental production is inadequate
and is only a “miniscule drop from the buckets of documents” involved in the
November 18 court order.  Plaintiff
asserts that Defendant’s supplemental response was made in bad faith.
             However, the moving party does not identify
specific documents which were not produced but focuses on what was produced by
the Defendants.  Thus, the Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production Set One is DENIED as MOOT. 
 
Request for
Monetary Sanctions  
The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to request for admissions and
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).)
Attorney White
seeks $1,500 in attorney’s fees for preparation of this motion and appearing at
the hearing, as well as the $60.00 filing fee. 
As all of the relevant production was made subsequent to the motion
being filed, but due to another Order for which sanctions were previously
contemplated, the sanctions request for this motion is therefore moot. 
The Court DENIES
Plaintiffs’ request for sanctions.
