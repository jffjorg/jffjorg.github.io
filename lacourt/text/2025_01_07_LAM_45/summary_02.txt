And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Sawdust Custom Cabinets, Inc. (Sawdust). The motion seeks a determination that the settlement between Sawdust, Plaintiff Carin Meyer, CRM Trust, and Defendant Larry Benson Construction, Inc. and Larry Benson is in good faith, and that all actual and potential claims against Sawdust by Plaintiff, Defendants, Cross-Defendants, Cross-Complainants, intervenors, lien holders, and insurance carriers, and by any other actual or potential party for partial or comparative equitable contribution, including whole or total contribution, and/or for partial or comparative indemnity, including whole or total indemnity, are forever barred.

The settlement was achieved through negotiations at mediation on March 9, 2024, and took into account all information and investigation known to the parties at the time of the settlement. The settlement amount of $45,000.00 is reasonable and made in good faith in light of the potential liability of Sawdust and the risks of litigation. The court finds that the settlement meets the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure sections 877 and 877.6, and that the burden remains on any challenging party to establish a lack of good faith.
