And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge sustains Respondents' demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and denies Petitioner's request for leave to amend. The Judge finds that the FAC fails to provide new facts or remedies the deficiencies of the Initial Petition. The Judge also denies Respondents' Motion to Strike as moot.

The Judge rules that the designation of Jake as a "vicious dog" is a legal designation aimed at regulating Petitioner's pet ownership, and that it is not subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. The Judge also finds that the warnings required by LACC §10.37 are simply safety regulations and not unconstitutional.

Finally, the Judge denies Petitioner's request for leave to amend, finding that there is no reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
