The plaintiff failed to appear at a Case Management Conference, which led to the case being dismissed without prejudice. The plaintiff's attorney, Pauliana N. Lara, has attested that the failure to appear was due to a mistake and has filed a motion to set aside the dismissal. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the plaintiff's failure to appear was due to excusable neglect and that the motion was filed within the six-month time limit. The case is ordered restored to the civil active list.
