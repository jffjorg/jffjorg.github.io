**English Summary:**

In Case 21PSCV00574, Judge (name not specified) granted Plaintiff Terry Halley's motion to set aside the dismissal of his case against Nuovo Milennio Auto Group LLC dba Avision Auto and Hudson Insurance Company.

The case was originally dismissed on March 10, 2023, for Plaintiff's failure to prosecute. Plaintiff's attorney, Pauliana N. Lara, explained that the case was inadvertently overlooked and not properly scheduled on the firm's calendar, leading to Plaintiff's absence from a December 2022 Case Management Conference and a subsequent missed hearing.

Because the motion was filed within six months of the dismissal and accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit, the court granted the motion under Code of Civil Procedure § 473, subd. (b), which allows for relief from dismissals due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 


The case is now restored to the civil active list.
