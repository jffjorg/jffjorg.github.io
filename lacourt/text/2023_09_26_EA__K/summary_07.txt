## English Summary:

The judge in this case is issuing a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Emanate Health. A demurrer is a legal argument that says a lawsuit shouldn't be heard because the claims are not valid. 

Emanate Health argues that the third cause of action against them, which alleges medical negligence and wrongful death, is time-barred. 

The judge agrees with Emanate Health, stating that the lawsuit was filed more than three years after the death of Alice Mao, the plaintiff's mother.  

This means the judge is likely to dismiss the third cause of action against Emanate Health unless the plaintiff can provide a compelling reason why the time limit shouldn't apply in this case.

The judge agrees with Emanate Health's demurrer, finding that the third cause of action is time-barred by Code of Civil Procedure § 340.5.

The court has sustained Emanate Health's demurrer, finding that the third cause of action is indeed time-barred. The court notes that the third cause of action sounds in medical negligence and/or wrongful death, but the plaintiff has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
