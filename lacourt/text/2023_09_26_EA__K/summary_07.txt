## English Summary:

The judge in this case is issuing a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Emanate Health. A demurrer is a legal argument that says a lawsuit shouldn't be heard because the claims are not valid. 

Emanate Health argues that the third cause of action against them, which alleges medical negligence and wrongful death, is time-barred. 

The judge agrees with Emanate Health, stating that the lawsuit was filed more than three years after the death of Alice Mao, the plaintiff's mother.  

This means the judge is likely to dismiss the third cause of action against Emanate Health unless the plaintiff can provide a compelling reason why the time limit shouldn't apply in this case.

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the issues raised in the case. The plaintiff, William Chen, is suing Emanate Health and others for the death of his mother, Alice Mao, who died on January 25, 2021. The plaintiff alleges that Mao was misdiagnosed with hemorrhoids by Altamed Health Services Corporation, and that the diagnosis led to two unnecessary surgical operations, which ultimately led to Mao's death.

Emanate Health has filed a demurrer, arguing that the third cause of action, which is labeled as "general negligence," fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The judge agrees with Emanate Health's demurrer, finding that the third cause of action is time-barred by Code of Civil Procedure § 340.5. The judge notes that the pleadings do not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and are uncertain.

Here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:
The plaintiff, William Chen, has filed a complaint against Altamed Health Services Corporation, Doctor Jared Sze Wei Wong, Emanate Health, and B.P. Care, Inc., alleging general negligence in the care of his mother, Alice Mao. Alice Mao was misdiagnosed with hemorrhoids at an AHSC clinic and was later diagnosed with colorectal cancer at Emanate Health Queen of the Valley Hospital. She underwent two unnecessary surgical operations and contracted COVID-19 at a nursing home. She died on January 25, 2021. Emanate Health has demurred to the third cause of action, alleging that it is time-barred by Code of Civil Procedure § 340.5. The court has sustained Emanate Health's demurrer, finding that the third cause of action is indeed time-barred. The court notes that the third cause of action sounds in medical negligence and/or wrongful death, but the plaintiff has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court's decision is based on the liberal construction of the allegations in the complaint and the applicable law, including Code of Civil Procedure § 340.5 and relevant case law.
