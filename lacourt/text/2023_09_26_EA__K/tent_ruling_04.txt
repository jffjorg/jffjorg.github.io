[1] The
motion was filed on August 30, 2023 and served via mail and email on August 31,
2023. The motion should have been electronically served no later than August
29, 2023. (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 12c, 1005(b), and 1010.6(a)(3)(B)). September
4, 2023 and September 22, 2023 are court holidays and are thus excluded from
notice calculations. With that said, the motion has been opposed on the merits:
It is well
settled that the appearance of a party at the hearing of a motion and his or
her opposition to the motion on its merits is a waiver of any defects or
irregularities in the notice of the motion.” (Tate v. Superior Court
(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 925, 930.)
