And here is a brief summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests in part, and denies it in part. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Albertina Acevedo, against General Motors LLC, seeking further responses to discovery requests related to the subject vehicle, a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado. The defendant objected to the requests, claiming they were overbroad, unduly burdensome, and sought confidential and proprietary information. The court rejects the defendant's objections, finding that the requests are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and that the defendant's concerns of confidentiality and privilege can be addressed through a protective order. The court grants the motion as to certain requests and denies it as to others, and orders the defendant to provide further, code-compliant responses within 20 days.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests in part, subject to certain limitations. The plaintiff had requested various documents from the defendant, including documents regarding the defendant's warranty and repurchase policies, procedures, and practices. The defendant had objected to producing many of these documents, claiming that they were overbroad, unduly burdensome, oppressive, vague, and ambiguous, and that they sought confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information.

The court has agreed that some of the requests were overbroad and has limited them in time and scope. The court has also rejected the defendant's objections to producing documents regarding the defendant's knowledge of the defects at issue and the defendant's policies and procedures for handling complaints from consumers.

The court has granted the motion to compel further responses in part, as to Requests Nos. 4, 8, 9, 11, 12, 17-26, 30-33, and 37, and has denied it in part, as to Requests Nos. 1-4, 16, 27-29, and 34-36. The defendant is to provide further, code-compliant responses within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.
