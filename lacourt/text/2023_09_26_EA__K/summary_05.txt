And here is a brief summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests in part, and denies it in part. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Albertina Acevedo, against General Motors LLC, seeking further responses to discovery requests related to the subject vehicle, a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado. The defendant objected to the requests, claiming they were overbroad, unduly burdensome, and sought confidential and proprietary information. The court rejects the defendant's objections, finding that the requests are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and that the defendant's concerns of confidentiality and privilege can be addressed through a protective order. The court grants the motion as to certain requests and denies it as to others, and orders the defendant to provide further, code-compliant responses within 20 days.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests in part, subject to certain limitations. The plaintiff had requested various documents from the defendant, including documents regarding the defendant's warranty and repurchase policies, procedures, and practices. The defendant had objected to producing many of these documents, claiming that they were overbroad, unduly burdensome, oppressive, vague, and ambiguous, and that they sought confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information.

The court has agreed that some of the requests were overbroad and has limited them in time and scope. The court has also rejected the defendant's objections to producing documents regarding the defendant's knowledge of the defects at issue and the defendant's policies and procedures for handling complaints from consumers.

The court has granted the motion to compel further responses in part, as to Requests Nos. 4, 8, 9, 11, 12, 17-26, 30-33, and 37, and has denied it in part, as to Requests Nos. 1-4, 16, 27-29, and 34-36. The defendant is to provide further, code-compliant responses within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.

**Hearing Date**: September 26, 2023
**Dept**: K

**Plaintiff**: Albertina Acevedo
**Defendant**: General Motors LLC

**Background**: Plaintiff purchased a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado from Defendant and alleges that the vehicle has engine, electrical, and emission system defects that have not been adequately repaired. Plaintiff filed a complaint asserting causes of action against Defendant and others.

**Legal Standard**: Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.310 and 2031.320 provide that a demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to a demand if the demanding party deems that the statement of compliance is incomplete, a representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.

**Motion**: Plaintiff moves the court for an order striking Defendant's objections and compelling Defendant's further responses to Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents, Set One.

**Discussion**: The court addresses the merits of the motion and grants it in part (i.e., as to Requests Nos. 4, 8, 9, 11, 12, 17-26, 30-33, and 37) and denies it in part (i.e., as to Requests Nos. 1-4, 16, 27-29, and 34-36).

**Evaluation**: The court evaluates the discovery requests and determines that they are relevant to a determination of Defendant's good faith and are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

**Prior Knowledge**: The court addresses the discovery requests related to prior knowledge and determines that they are relevant to a determination of Defendant's knowledge of the defects at issue.

**Ruling**: The court grants the motion, subject to the limitations set forth herein, and orders Defendant to provide further, Code-compliant responses within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.

**Significant Statements**:

* The court believes that Defendant's objections based on confidentiality are not proper grounds for withholding responsive information.
* The court determines that any confidentiality concerns may be adequately safeguarded upon the parties' entry into a protective order.
* The court rejects Defendant's objections and determines that further responses are warranted to Requests Nos. 17-26, 30, and 31.
