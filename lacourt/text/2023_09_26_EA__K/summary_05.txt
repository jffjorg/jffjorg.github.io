And here is a brief summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests in part, and denies it in part. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Albertina Acevedo, against General Motors LLC, seeking further responses to discovery requests related to the subject vehicle, a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado. The defendant objected to the requests, claiming they were overbroad, unduly burdensome, and sought confidential and proprietary information. The court rejects the defendant's objections, finding that the requests are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and that the defendant's concerns of confidentiality and privilege can be addressed through a protective order. The court grants the motion as to certain requests and denies it as to others, and orders the defendant to provide further, code-compliant responses within 20 days.
