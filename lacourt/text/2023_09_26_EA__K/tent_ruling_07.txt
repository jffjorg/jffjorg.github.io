 Case Number:  23PSCV01126    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  K Background    
Plaintiff William Chen (“Plaintiff”)
alleges that his mother, Alice Mao (“Mao”), went to the Altamed Health Services
Corporation (“AHSC”) clinic in West Covina on October 23, 2019, April 7, 2020,
July 22, 2020 and October 5, 2020 with complaints of weight loss and pain to
her buttocks area, but was misdiagnosed with hemorrhoids. Mao was diagnosed
with colorectal cancer on October 7, 2020 at Emanate Health Queen of the Valley
Hospital (“Hospital”). Mao subsequently underwent two unnecessary surgical
operations performed by Doctor Jared Sze Wei Wong (“Wong”) at Emanate Health
Queen of the Valley Hospital, which left Mao in a vulnerable condition that led
her to contract COVID-19 at a nursing home she had been sent to afterwards. Mao
was rushed to the Emanate Health Inter-Community Hospital on December 21, 2020,
but received negligent care from nursing staff while in the ICU there. Mao died
on January 25, 2021.
On April 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a complaint, asserting causes of action against AHSC, Wong, Emanate Health and
B.P. Care, Inc. (“B.P. Care”) for:
1.                 
General Negligence
2.                 
General Negligence
3.                 
General Negligence
4.                 
General Negligence
 
A Case Management Conference is
set for September 26, 2023.
Legal Standard
A demurrer may be made on the grounds that
the pleading, inter alia, does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action and/or is uncertain. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e)&(f).)
When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis
for the claim against him. (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer does not,
however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in
the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded therein, or
facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may
take judicial knowledge.” (S. Shore Land
Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations omitted].)
Discussion
Emanate Health demurs to the first through third causes of
action in Plaintiff’s complaint, on the basis that they each fail to state
facts sufficient to constitute causes of action and are uncertain.
At the outset, the court notes that only the third cause of
action appears to be directed against Emanate Health; the first cause of action
is directed against AHSC (See Complaint, Page 4, ¶ GN-1), the second cause of
action is directed against Wong (Id., Page 5, ¶ GN-1) and the fourth
cause of action is directed against B.P. Care (Id., Page 7, ¶ GN-1). The
following analysis, then, is limited to Plaintiff’s third cause of action,
Although the third cause of action is labeled as “general
negligence,” it sounds in medical negligence and/or wrongful death. Plaintiff
has alleged that his mother, Alice Mao (“Mao”), was diagnosed with colorectal
cancer at Emanate Health Queen of the Valley Hospital (“Queen of the Valley”) on
October 7, 2020 (Complaint, Page 6, ¶ GN-1); that even though Mao had underwent
a colostomy surgical operation on October 7, 2020 and “expressed apparent signs
of weakness” and was unable to stand on her own, hospital staff at Queen of the
Valley called Plaintiff to take Mao back home on October 9, 2020 (Id.); that
Mao developed an infection that could have been avoided had she not been forced
out of care immediately by hospital staff (Id.); that Mao was
transferred from the hospital to Garden View Post-Acute Rehab (“Rehab”) on
November 30, 2020 without any written consent (Id.); that Mao was
thereafter “rushed” to the Emanate Health Inter-Community Hospital
(“Inter-Community”) emergency room on December 21, 2020 because she had
contracted COVID-19 at Rehab on December 15, 2020 and was having trouble
breathing (Id.) and that the nursing staff at Inter-Community were
“clearly negligent” towards Mao while she was in the ICU for COVID-19
treatment, in that Mao was not “attended to 24/7” and had her ventilator tube
removed on December 27th (Id.); and that Mao died on January
25, 2021 (Id.).
Emanate Health asserts that the third cause of action is
time-barred by Code of Civil Procedure § 340.5. Section 340.5 states, in
relevant part, that “[i]n an action for injury or death against a health care
provider based upon such person's alleged professional negligence, the time for
the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of injury or one
year after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence
should have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first. . .” (Emphasis
added)
Again,
Mao died on January 25, 2021. Plaintiff filed this instant complaint, however,
over two years later, on April 17, 2023. Emanate Health’s demurrer to the third
cause of action is sustained.
