demurrer was filed (and electronically served) and set for hearing on October
19, 2021. On October 19, 2021, the court continued the hearing to January 27,
2022. On January 27, 2022, the court granted Rajinder’s “Motion to Compel
Mediation and Stay then Pending Action and in the Alternative Motion to Compel
Arbitration” as to Vasisht and stayed the remainder of the case pending
completion of Arbitration/Mediation; in doing so, the court continued the
hearing on the instant demurrer to June 27, 2022. On June 27, 2022, the court
continued the hearing on the instant demurrer to November 16, 2022. On November
16, 2022, the court vacated the hearing on the instant demurrer; notice was
waived. The court’s January 17, 2023 minute order reflects that counsel, with
the consent of their clients, agreed to terminate the prior order regarding
arbitration and stipulated to place the case back on the court’s calendar; on
that date, the court lifted the stay on the case in its entirety and set the
instant demurrer for hearing on April 18, 2023. The court provided notice. On
March 28, 2023, a “Notice Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order” was filed,
wherein the April 18, 2023 scheduled hearing date was continued to May 11,
2023; notice was given to counsel. On April 7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed (and
served via email) a “Notice Re Continuance of Hearing,” advising therein of the
re-scheduled May 11, 2023 hearing date. On May 5, 2023, the court continued the
May 11, 2023 scheduled hearing on the demurrer to June 15, 2023. On June 15,
2023, the court took the hearing on the instant demurrer off-calendar after
Defendants failed to appear; Plaintiffs’ counsel was ordered to give notice. On
June 16, 2023, Defendants filed a new demurrer, which was set for hearing on
September 13, 2023.
 
On June 20, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed (and email-served) a “Notice of Ruling on Hearing on Demurrer Without
Motion to Strike,” advising that the demurrer had been taken off-calendar.
 
On July 28, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed an “Ex Parte Application for Order to Permit Entry of Default” (“Ex Parte
Application”); on August 3, 2023, the court, after reviewing the Ex Parte
Application, ordered defendants’ June 16, 2023 demurrer stricken and vacated
the September 13, 2023 hearing date, vacated the June 15, 2023 order taking the
instant demurrer off calendar, rescheduled the hearing on the instant demurrer
for September 26, 2023 and ordered that the opposition and reply be filed and
served in accordance with the new September 26, 2023 hearing date; notice was
waved.


[2]              Plaintiffs’ opposition was untimely
filed (and served via email) on September 13, 2023 (due September 12, 2023).
While the court has elected to consider the merits of the opposition, the court
admonishes Plaintiffs’ counsel for the untimely filing and cautions counsel
that any future untimely filings may not be considered.


[3]              Civil Code § 1689, subdivision (b) provides, in relevant part that “[a] party to a
contract may rescind the contract in the following causes: (1) If the consent
of the party rescinding, or of any party jointly contracting with him, was
given by mistake, or obtained through duress, menace, fraud, or undue
influence, exercised by or with the connivance of the party as to whom he
rescinds, or of any other party to the contract jointly interested with such
party. . .”
