And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has been considering a demurrer filed by the defendants in a case where the plaintiffs are seeking to rescind a contract. The court has continued the hearing on the demurrer several times, and the defendants have failed to appear at one of the hearings. The plaintiffs have filed an ex parte application to permit the entry of default, and the court has struck the defendants' demurrer and vacated the hearing date. The court has also considered the plaintiffs' opposition to the demurrer, despite it being filed untimely. The court is applying Civil Code § 1689, subdivision (b), which allows a party to rescind a contract if the consent was given by mistake or obtained through duress, menace, fraud, or undue influence. The judge's tentative ruling is based on the facts and law presented, and the court will consider the merits of the opposition despite the untimely filing.
