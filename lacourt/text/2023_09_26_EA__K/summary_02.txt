The judge has been considering a demurrer filed by the defendants in a case where the plaintiffs are seeking to rescind a contract. The court has continued the hearing on the demurrer several times, and the defendants have failed to appear at one of the hearings. The plaintiffs have filed an ex parte application to permit the entry of default, and the court has struck the defendants' demurrer and vacated the hearing date.
