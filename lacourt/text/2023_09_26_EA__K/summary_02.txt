And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has been dealing with a demurrer filed by the defendants, which has been continued and vacated multiple times due to various agreements and orders made by the parties and the court. The demurrer was initially granted and stayed pending arbitration/mediation, but the stay was later lifted and the case was placed back on the court's calendar. The defendants filed a new demurrer, which was struck and vacated after the court ordered the opposition and reply to be filed and served in accordance with the new hearing date. The court notes that the opposition was filed untimely, but has chosen to consider the merits of the opposition despite this. The court admonishes Plaintiffs' counsel for the untimely filing and warns that any future untimely filings may not be considered.
