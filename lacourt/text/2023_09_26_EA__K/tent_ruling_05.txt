1.                 
Violation of Song-Beverly Act—Breach of Express
Warranty
2.                 
Violation of Song-Beverly Act—Breach of Implied
Warranty
3.                 
Violation of the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2
 
A Case Management Conference is set
for September 26, 2023.
Legal Standard
“[T]he
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that. . . (1) A statement of compliance with the
demand is incomplete[,] (2) A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive [and/or] (3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)
The moving party must demonstrate a
“reasonable and good faith attempt” at an informal resolution of each issue
presented. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) “In lieu of
a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(3).)
A motion to compel further responses to a demand for
inspection or production of documents must “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) If the moving party has shown good cause for the
production of documents, the burden is on the objecting party to justify the
objections. (Kirkland v. Superior Court
(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) 
Notice
of the motion must be provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.310, subd. (c).)
“[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction. . . against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (h).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the
court, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2031.310 and 2031.320, for an
order striking Defendant’s objections and compelling Defendant’s further
responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One (i.e.,
Nos. 1-4, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 16-37).
Plaintiff’s counsel
Nicholas Yowarski (“Yowarski”) represents as follows:
On
September 23, 2022, Plaintiff propounded the subject discovery on Defendant.
(Yowarski Decl., ¶ 14, Exh. 1.) On April 19, 2023, Defendant provided responses
thereto. (Id., ¶¶ 15-16, Exh. 2.) On May 16, 2023, Defendant served
verifications. (Id., ¶ 16.) On June 5, 2023, Yowarski sent Defendant’s
counsel a meet and confer letter, requesting therein that Defendant’s counsel
provide a written response thereto by June 12, 2023. (Id., ¶ 22, Exh. 3.)
On June 12, 2023, Defendant’s counsel Jesse Valencia (“Valencia”) provided a
response. (Id., ¶ 26, Exh. 4.) The instant motion followed on June 20,
2023.
Plaintiff represents that Nos. 1-4, 8, 9, 11 and 12 pertains
to her own vehicle, that Nos. 16-31 pertain to Defendant’s warranty and repurchase policies, procedures and practices,
and that Nos. 32-37 pertain to Defendant’s knowledge of the same or similar
defects in other vehicles of the same year, make, and
model as Plaintiff’s vehicle. The court addresses these categories as follows:
At the outset, the court notes that Yowarski’s June 5, 2023
meet and confer letter does not specifically reference Requests Nos. 1-3 and
16; accordingly, the motion is summarily denied in this regard for insufficient
meet and confer. Additionally, Plaintiff’s separate statement fails to address
Request No. 4; as such, the motion is summarily denied as to this request.
The court otherwise addresses the merits of the motion as
follows:
Plaintiffs’ Vehicle (i.e., Requests Nos. 8, 9, 11 and 12)
Request No. 8 seeks all documents regarding repairs or
service performed on the subject vehicle at any time and by any person.
Request No. 9 seeks all documents regarding Plaintiff’s
request for refund of the price Plaintiff paid for the subject vehicle.
Request No. 11 seeks all documents regarding any CONTACT[1] between
Plaintiff and Defendant.
Request No. 12 seeks all documents regarding any contract
with any person and relating and referring to Plaintiff or the subject vehicle.
Defendant asserts that it has already produced documents in
response to Requests Nos. 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12 and that “ordering [it] to produce
more would be unnecessary.” (Opp., 4:18-19). Defendant’s “comply in part”
response to Request Nos. 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12, however, reflect non-compliance
with Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.210[2] and
2031.220[3]. Further
responses are warranted.
Evaluation
Discovery (i.e., Requests Nos. 17-31)
Request No. 17 seeks Defendant’s warranty claims policy and
procedure manual(s) from 2010 to the present.
Request No. 18 seeks Defendant’s rules, policies, or
procedures since 2010 concerning the issuance of refunds to buyers or providing
replacement vehicles to buyers in the State of California under the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
Request No. 19 seeks procedures used by Defendant for the
handling of complaints by consumers regarding vehicles Defendant manufactured
or distributed.
Request No. 20 seeks Defendant’s policies, procedures,
and/or instructions which Defendant’s employees and authorized agents should
follow after a decision has been made by Defendant to authorize either a refund
of the purchase price, or a replacement vehicle, to Defendant’s customer.
Request No. 21 seeks Defendant’s policies, procedures,
and/or instructions since 2010 that Defendant’s employees and agents should
follow when evaluating a customer request for their money back or a replacement
of a motor vehicle manufactured or distributed by Defendant.
Request No. 22 seeks Defendant’s training materials related
to Defendant’s policy regarding how to calculate a repurchase.
Request Nos. 23 seeks Defendant’s policies, procedures, or
guidelines for determining whether a vehicle is eligible for a vehicle
repurchase.
Request No. 24 seeks Defendant’s training material related
to Defendant’s policy to encourage customers to give Defendant another
opportunity to repair their vehicles.
Request No. 25 seeks Defendant’s policy defining what
constitutes a repair to determine eligibility for repurchase or replacement in
California.
Request No. 26 seeks Defendant’s policies, procedures and/or
instructions since 2010 which Defendant’s authorized repair facilities should
follow regarding customer requests for a refund of the price paid for a vehicle
or a replacement vehicle.
Request No. 27 seeks Defendant’s Lemon Law Escalation
Process.
Request No. 28 seeks Defendant’s call center escalation
process.
Request No. 29 seeks any predictive model used to determine
if one of Defendant’s vehicles is a candidate for escalation.
Request No. 30 seeks documents any CONSULTANT[4] provided
Defendant from 2010 to present that are related in any way to the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act.
Request No. 31 seeks Defendant’s policies, procedures, or
guidelines provided to any agency regarding what constitutes a substantial
nonconformity under the Song-Beverly Act from 2010 to present.
Defendant refused to produce any documents in response to
Requests Nos. 17-31 on the basis that the requests were overbroad, unduly
burdensome, oppressive, irrelevant, sought confidential, proprietary and trade
secret information and sought information protected by the attorney-client
privilege and/or work-product doctrine.
Defendant also refused to produce documents in response to
many of the aforesaid requests on the basis that certain terms contained
therein were vague and ambiguous. The court believes Defendant’s objection on
this basis is well-taken as to Requests Nos. 27-29 (i.e., as to “Lemon Law
Escalation Process,” “call center escalation process” and “candidate for
escalation”, respectively) only. No further responses are warranted as to these
requests.
The court agrees that the requests are overbroad as to time.
Plaintiff purchased the subject vehicle on November 3, 2020. (Complaint, ¶ 3). The
request, then, is limited in time from November 3, 2020 to August 9, 2022
(i.e., the date Plaintiff’ filed his complaint). The court also agrees that the
requests are overbroad as to scope, inasmuch as it is not limited to the
defects and vehicle type at issue for California consumers. The Song-Beverly
Act and its lemon law provisions limits its application to goods sold in
California and has certain provisions that afford protections greater than the
requirements of the federal Magnuson Moss Act. (See Civil Code §§
1792, 1792.1; Atkinson v. Elk Corp of
Texas (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 212, 231.) As the statute’s
application to lemon law is for vehicles “sold in this state” such phrase is
interpreted to restricting the scope to goods sold in California. (California State Electronic Ass’n v. Zeos
Int’l Ltd. (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1277.)  The court
determines that such a limitation is warranted.
Defendant claims that the requests are overly burdensome and not
proportional to the needs of this matter. However, “[t]he objection based upon
burden must be sustained by evidence showing the quantum of work required,
while to
support an objection of oppression there must be some showing either of an
intent to create an unreasonable burden or that the ultimate effect of the
burden is incommensurate with the result sought.” (West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Superior Court In and For Los
Angeles County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) Defendant has not provided any
such evidence. At any rate, the court determines that Defendant’s concerns of
overbreadth and undue burden have been sufficiently addressed via the
limitations imposed above.
Next, Defendant’s policies are relevant to a determination of
Defendant’s good faith. (See e.g. Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc.
(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1105 (finding car manufacturer’s internal policy
relevant to whether it evidenced an “unreasonable and not a good faith effort
to honor its statutory obligations to repurchase defective cars.”).)  The documents are reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence regarding whether Defendant
knew of the defects at issue yet failed to repurchase the subject vehicle. In Donlen v. Ford Motor Company (2013) 217
Cal.App.4th 138, 143, the appellate court upheld a trial court’s determination
that evidence of “the transmission model Ford installed in plaintiff’s truck
and other vehicles” should not be excluded from trial as prejudicial in a
Song–Beverly Act case brought by a single plaintiff.  (Id.
at 154.)  Donlen thus provides a basis for permitting discovery to extend
beyond Plaintiff’s specific vehicle.  A
defendant’s knowledge of the defect is relevant to whether Defendant willfully
violated the statute.  (Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc.
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 136; Kwan v.
Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 186 [“A
decision made without the use of reasonably available information germane to
that decision is not a reasonable, good faith decision.”].)
Defendant claims that documents Plaintiffs are seeking are
confidential, proprietary, and commercially sensitive trade secrets. Objections
based on confidentiality are not proper grounds for withholding responsive
information. (See Columbia Broadcasting
System, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 23 [“We know of no
case holding that this is a proper ground for objection to an otherwise proper
interrogatory. Assuming that the information called for by this interrogatory
is of a confidential nature which defendants do not want to have included in a
public record, they presumably could have applied for a protective order. .
.”].) Defendant did not seek a protective order. The court believes that any
confidentiality concerns may be adequately safeguarded upon the parties’ entry
into a protective order.
Finally, although Defendant interposed an objection on the basis
of the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product doctrine, Defendant has
not met its burden of justifying this objection. Any documents withheld from
production on this basis must be accompanied by a privilege log.
Further responses to Nos. 17-26, 30 and 31 are warranted,
subject to the limitations identified above.
Prior Knowledge
Discovery (i.e., Requests Nos. 32-37)
Request No. 32 seeks documents evidencing statistics for the
number of repurchases and replacements Defendant has made in California in
response to consumers’ personal requests (i.e. a consumer request without an
attorney) from 2010 to present.
Request No. 33 seeks documents evidencing the numbers of
owners 2021 Chevrolet Silverado vehicles who have complained of any of the
conditions, defects, or nonconformities for which Plaintiff presented the
subject vehicle to Defendant or Defendant’s authorized repair facility for
repair.
Request No. 34 seeks Technical Service Bulletins (“TSBs”)
issued for 2021 Chevrolet Silverado vehicles.
Request Nos. 35 seeks Recalls which have been issued for
2021 Chevrolet Silverado vehicles that involve any part, component,
sub-component, system, assembly, or sub-assembly for which the subject was
subject to one or more repair attempts as reflected in Defendant’s Warranty
Claim Records or in the repair orders produced during discovery in this case.
Request No. 36 seeks documents discussing above-average
repair rates to 2021 Chevrolet Silverado vehicles.
Request No. 37 seeks sales brochures, literature or any
other promotional materials provided or distributed by Defendant regarding
vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the subject vehicle.
Defendant refused to produce any documents in response to
Requests Nos. 32, 33 and 36 on the basis that the
requests were overbroad, unduly burdensome, oppressive, vague and ambiguous
irrelevant, sought confidential, proprietary and trade secret information and
sought information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or work-product
doctrine.
The court believes Defendant’s vague and ambiguous objection
is well-taken as to Request No. 36 (i.e., as to “above-average repair rates”)
only. No further response is warranted as to this request.
The court agrees that the requests are overbroad
as to time and scope and limits the requests in time from November 3,
2020 to August 9, 2022 and in scope to the defects and vehicle type at
issue for California consumers. The court otherwise rejects Defendant’s
objections, for the reasons set forth above. Further responses to Request Nos. 32
and 33 are warranted, subject to the limitations set forth above.
As to Request No. 34, Defendant agreed to provide a list of
TSBs for vehicles of the same year, make and model as the subject vehicle and
to search for, and produce, at Plaintiff’s request, copies of TSBs, if any,
that Plaintiff has identified as relevant to the conditions alleged in
Plaintiff’s complaint. The court determines that Defendant’s response is
appropriate and that no further response is warranted.
As to No. 35, Defendant advised that “the SUBJECT VEHICLE
has no current record of field actions, including recalls,” as shown in an
image from the Global Warranty History Report. The court determines that
Defendant’s response is appropriate and that no further response is warranted.
Defendant’s “comply in part” response to Request No. 37
reflects non-compliance with Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.210 and 2031.220;
as such, a further response is warranted.
The motion, then, is granted in part (i.e., as to Requests Nos.
4, 8, 9, 11, 12, 17-26, 30-33 and 37), subject to the limitations set forth
herein, and denied in part (i.e., as to Requests Nos. 1-4, 16, 27-29 and 34-36).
Defendant is to provide further, Code-compliant responses within 20 days from
the date of the notice of ruling.
