And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of its complaint. The Plaintiff, Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club, filed the complaint on March 4, 2022, against Fernando Vasquez, Manuel Mendoza, and Does 1 through 10. The Plaintiff then filed a request for dismissal on January 5, 2024, which was granted on January 8, 2024. However, the Plaintiff has now filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, alleging that the dismissal was due to a mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Court has found that the Plaintiff has established that the dismissal was indeed due to one of these circumstances and has therefore granted the motion. The Court sets aside the dismissal and vacates the entry of dismissal. The Court also sets a Trial Setting Conference in approximately 60 days.
