for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions
 
Tentative
 
The motion for terminating sanctions is denied.
 
The motion for monetary sanctions is granted in part.
 
Background
On December 28, 2020, Micael Nystrom
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Margaret E. Davis (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 through 50 asserting one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence
arising out of an accident on December 28, 2018, near the intersection of
Ventura Boulevard and Sepulveda Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. Defendant filed her
answer on March 14, 2022.
On March 27, 28, and 29, 2024, the Court
granted Defendant’s discovery motions and: (1) ordered Plaintiff to serve
verified responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) within 30 days of notice;
(2) ordered Plaintiff to serve verified responses to Requests for Production
(Set One) within 30 days of notice; (3) ordered Plaintiff to serve verified
responses to Requests for Production (Set Two) within 30 days of notice; and
(4) ordered that Plaintiff was deemed to have admitted the truth of the matters
specified in certain Requests for Admission. 
Plaintiff has not complied with the Court’s orders
to respond to the interrogatories or requests for production.  (Korff Decl., ¶ 16.)
On May 16, 2024, Plaintiff’s attorney was
relieved as counsel.
On May 9, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for terminating
sanctions. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling answers to
interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to,
that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
When a plaintiff fails to obey an order compelling responses to
requests for production, “the court may
make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,
an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in
addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.030 provides
for monetary, evidence, issue, and terminating sanctions for any “misuse of the
discovery process,” “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  A “misuse of
the discovery process” is defined to include (among other things) failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to a discovery request; disobeying a court order to provide
discovery; and making or opposing, unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without
substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
It is “never
justified” for a court to impose a terminating sanction “solely because of a
failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
Defendant contends terminating sanctions are warranted due
to Plaintiff’s failure to comply with this Court’s orders dated March 27 and
28, 2024 compelling Plaintiff to provide responses to interrogatories and
requests for production.  Defendant also
requests monetary sanctions. 
 
Plaintiff failed to comply with her obligations under the
Civil Discovery act to respond to written discovery, including interrogatories
and requests for production.  Those are
serious instances of misuse of the discovery process.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd.
(d).)  Plaintiff then compounded her
abuse by failing to comply with two Court orders compelling him to provide the
responses.  (Id., subd. (g).)  Serious sanctions are warranted for this
discovery abuse.  
 
For terminating sanctions, however, a party
must present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process,
as well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Defendant has not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing, for example, that
nonmonetary sanctions short of a terminating sanction have not cured (or would
not cure) Plaintiff’s misconduct. 
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this
time, a terminating sanction would create such a windfall for Defendant.
Accordingly,
the Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
Defendant
does not seek lesser nonmonetary sanctions.
Defendants
does seek further monetary sanctions. 
That request is granted in part. 
Defendant’s motion is brought because of Plaintiff’s ongoing misuses of
the discovery process.  The Court sets further
monetary sanctions in the amount of $560, based on 2.5 hours of attorney time,
multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $200 per hour, plus a $60
filing fee.  (See Korff Decl., ¶ 18.)
 
The
denial as to terminating sanctions is without prejudice to Defendant seeking
other non-monetary sanctions or seeking a terminating sanction at a later stage
of the proceedings, based on a further showing of misuse of the discovery
process.
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions
is DENIED. Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions if
GRANTED IN PART.
Plaintiff
is ORDERED to pay $560 in monetary sanctions to Defendant under the Civil
Discovery Act within 30 days of notice of this order.
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
