to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One)
Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Special Interrogatories (Set One)
Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Requests for Production of Documents
(Set One)
Tentative Ruling
The
motions are denied without prejudice.
Background
On September 21, 2021, Josue Alvarez-Baez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Guillermo Carrillo Velazquez, Eduardo Soya, Eddie’s Trucking, Inc., and
Does 1 through 10 for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising
out of an automobile accident occurring on August 5, 2020. 
The three named defendants filed an answer on December 10, 2021.
On March 25, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel was relieved as counsel of
record.  Plaintiff has been representing himself, in pro per, since
then. 
On January 28, 2022, Defendant Guillermo Carrillo Velazquez (“Defendant”)
served Plaintiff with written discovery, including Form Interrogatories (Set
One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set
One).  (Kubec Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff never
served responses to these discovery requests.  (Id., ¶¶ 6-7.)
On May 6,
2024, Defendant filed motions to compel responses to the form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for
production.  Sanctions are requested in all three motions.
Attached
to each of the three motions is a proof of service, signed by an employee of
Defendants’ counsel, stating that she “caused to be delivered each … document
by hand.”  
No
opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
A party
must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to
provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party
must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate
statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Discussion
Defendant
served Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and
Request for Production of Documents in January 2022. (Kubec Decls., ¶ 2 &
Exhs. A.) No responses have been received. (Id.¸¶¶ 6-7.)
These motions to compel
were filed on May 6, 2024.  No valid proof of service is
attached.  An employee of Defendants’ counsel declares that she
“caused to be delivered” the documents “by hand” to Plaintiff, but a “caused to
be delivered” declaration by a law firm employee is not a valid or proper proof
of service; if offered to prove that someone else delivered the documents to
Plaintiff outside of the presence of the declarant, it is inadmissible hearsay.
Accordingly, the Court
must deny these motions without prejudice, for failure to file a valid proof of
service.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES
without prejudice the Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Form
Interrogatories (Set One).
The Court DENIES
without prejudice the Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Special
Interrogatories (Set One).
The Court DENIES without
prejudice the Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Requests for Production
of Documents (Set One).
