And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a petition for approval of a compromise for a person with a disability (Lucia Ramirez, age 89). The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. The court has reviewed the petition and proposed order and finds the settlement and fees fair and reasonable. The petitioner was appointed conservator of the claimant's estate in April 2024, and a bond was posted in that matter. The petitioner requests that the settlement funds be paid to the conservatorship account. The court finds that all substantive and procedural requirements are satisfied, and the petition to approve the minor's compromise is approved. An order to show cause (OSC) re deposit of funds into conservatorship account is set for June 2024 at 8:30 AM in Department 29 at the Spring Street Courthouse.
