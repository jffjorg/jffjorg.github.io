And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is as follows: The Court excuses the personal appearance of Lucia Ramirez, the claimant, and her guardian ad litem, and allows counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. The Court has reviewed the Petition and Proposed Order filed on June 12, 2024, and finds the settlement and fees fair and reasonable. The Petitioner, who was appointed conservator of Lucia Ramirez's estate in April 2024, requests that the settlement funds be paid into the conservatorship account. The Court finds that all substantive and procedural requirements are satisfied, and therefore approves the Petition to Approve Minor's Compromise. An OSC (Order to Show Cause) re Deposit of Funds Into Conservatorship Account is set for a future date at 08:30 AM in Dept. 29 at the Spring Street Courthouse.
