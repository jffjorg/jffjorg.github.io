Aside Judgment filed by Plaintiff Brenda Wells, successor in interest to Richard
Wells
Tentative
The Court CONTINUES the hearing on Plaintiff’s
motion to set aside the judgment.
The Court, on its own motion, sets an ORDER
TO SHOW CAUSE why the Judgment Entered on January 3, 2024, and the Minute Order
Dated October 20, 2023 (Granting Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment) Should
Not Be Set Aside Based on the Death of Plaintiff on August 13, 2023.
Background
This case arises out of an alleged slip and fall on March 25,
2018, at a Burger King location on Cherry Avenue in Long Beach,
California.  
On March 23, 2020, Plaintiff Richard Wells (“Plaintiff”) filed a
Complaint against Defendants Burger King Corporation, California Food
Management, LLC (collectively “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 25 asserting
causes of action for general negligence and premises
liability.  Defendants filed an Answer on January 25, 2021.
On August 22, 2022, Defendants filed a motion for summary
judgment. The motion was unopposed.  On October 20, 2023, the Court
granted Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.
The Court entered judgment in favor of Defendants, and against
Plaintiff, on January 3, 2024.
Plaintiff died on August 13, 2023. 
On November 21, 2023, Defendants filed a notice of Plaintiff’s death. 
On April 11, 2024, the Court granted the motion of Brenda Wells (“Successor”)
to substitute for the deceased Plaintiff as the plaintiff in this action. 
On April 16, 2024,
Successor filed this motion to set aside the judgment. Defendant filed an
opposition on June 6.  No reply was
filed.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), provides
for mandatory and discretionary relief from dismissal:
“The court may, upon any terms
as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. …  Notwithstanding any other requirements of
this section, the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no
more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is
accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by
the clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a
default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered
against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal
was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
neglect. ….”
Although not cited by the parties, the Court notes that
subdivision of section 473 provides as follows:
“The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own
motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as
to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either
party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.” 
Discussion
Successor seeks relief
(specifically, an order setting aside the judgment entered on January 3, 2024) under
both the mandatory and discretionary provisions of Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b).
Mandatory
relief from a “default” or “default judgment or dismissal” based on an attorney
affidavit of “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect” does not apply to
summary judgments as it neither a default judgment nor dismissal. (Las Vegas Land & Development Co., LLC v. Wilkie Way, LLC (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1086, 1091-92.)  Accordingly, the request for relief under the
mandatory provisions of section 473, subdivision (b), is denied.  Discretionary relief, however, may still be
available.
Before reaching that issue,
the Court notes that Plaintiff died on August 13, 2023, before the Court
granted the motion for summary judgment and before the Court approved and
entered the judgment.  
The general rule is that “judgment
cannot be rendered for or against a decedent.” 
(Sacks v. FSR Brokerage (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 950, 957; accord Grappo
v. McMills (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 996, 1004-1005.)  A judgment entered after the death of a party
is not necessarily void, but it is voidable, and it will be set aside unless
there is no prejudice to the interests of the decedent or his successors.  (Sacks, supra, 7 Cal.App.4th at
pp. 957-959 [collecting cases].) 
In their briefing on this
motion, the parties recount the death of Plaintiff but do not address its significance
(if any) to (1) the subsequent order granting Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment and (2) the subsequent entry of judgment against Plaintiff.
Accordingly, the Court sets an ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE why the Judgment Entered on
January 3, 2024, and the Minute Order Dated October 20, 2023 (Granting
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment) Should Not Be Set Aside Based on the
Death of Plaintiff on August 13, 2023.
The Court also CONTINUES the hearing on this Plaintiff’s
motion to set aside the judgment.
Conclusion
The Court sets an ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE why the Judgment Entered on
January 3, 2024, and the Minute Order Dated October 20, 2023 (Granting
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment) Should Not Be Set Aside Based on the
Death of Plaintiff on August 13, 2023. 
The hearing on the OSC is set for _______________, 2023, at 1:30 pm, in
Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
Any response is to be filed and served no less than nine court days
before the hearing.  Any reply is to be
filed and served no less than five court days before the hearing.
The Court also CONTINUES
the hearing on this Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the judgment to the same
hearing date, time, and location.
