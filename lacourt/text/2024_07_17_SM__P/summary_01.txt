Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of E-Advance Services, LLC v. Healthymouth, LLC, et al. The case involves a dispute over a credit card receivable agreement between the parties, and the plaintiff, E-Advance Services, LLC, is seeking summary judgment against the defendant, Healthymouth, LLC, and its guarantor, Albert.

The Judge has ruled that the plaintiff has met its burden of proof on the first and second causes of action, which allege breach of contract and breach of guaranty, respectively. However, the Judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the third and fourth causes of action, which allege breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and unjust enrichment, respectively.

The Judge has found that the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish that the defendant modified credit card processing operations, preventing the plaintiff from collecting receivables, and that the defendant breached the agreement and guaranty. However, the Judge has also found that the plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that the defendant's actions were in bad faith or that the plaintiff is entitled to relief based on unjust enrichment.

The case is set for further hearing on July 17, 2024.
