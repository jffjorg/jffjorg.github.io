And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is to deny the petition for approval of compromise without prejudice. The petition was filed by Zahir Dadabhoy, the guardian ad litem of minor plaintiff A.D., seeking court approval of a $50,000 settlement reached between A.D. and Defendants Waste Management and Anthony Fuller. The settlement was reached after a motor vehicle collision in April 2022. The judge's decision is based on several defects in the petition, including the lack of supporting documentation for the attorney fees requested and the failure to provide an itemization or estimate of the total hours worked. The court also notes that the settlement agreement is voidable by the minor's guardian ad litem and that the court must use a reasonable fee standard when approving and allowing attorney's fees payable from money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a disability.
