Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to set aside default and the plaintiff's application for default judgment. The defendant, Maria del Socorro Munoz Suarez, moves to set aside the entry of default, arguing that she was not served with the complaint. However, the court finds that the defendant has failed to rebut the presumption of proper service and has not provided evidence of excusable neglect. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion to set aside default without prejudice.

The plaintiff, Aurora Munoz Suarez, seeks default judgment against the defendant in the amount of $25,000 in damages. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's declaration only supports a claim for $17,000 in damages. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's application for default judgment in the reduced amount of $17,000.
