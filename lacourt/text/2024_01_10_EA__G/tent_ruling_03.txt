 Case Number:  23PSCV02109    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant Maria del Socorro Munoz Suarez’s Motion to  Set Aside Judgment and Default Respondent: Plaintiff Aurora  Munoz Suarez TENTATIVE RULING Defendant Maria del Socorro Munoz Suarez’s Motion to  Set Aside Judgment and Default is DENIED without prejudice. BACKGROUND This  is a breach of contract and fraud action arising from a loan agreement. In July  2019, Plaintiff Aurora Munoz Suarez agreed to loan funds to Defendant Maria del  Socorro Munoz Suarez. In exchange, Del Socorro Munoz Suarez allegedly agreed to  repay double the amount borrowed within one year. Subsequently, Munoz Suarez  alleges Del Socorro Munoz Suarez failed to repay the amounts owed. On July  14, 2023, Munoz Suarez filed a complaint against Del Socorro Munoz Suarez,  alleging (1) breach of contract and (2) fraud. On September 6, Munoz Suarez’s process server served  Del Socorro Munoz Suarez with substitute service in San Bernardino. On October 24, 2023, default was entered against Del  Socorro Munoz Suarez. On November 16, Munoz Suarez filed an application for  default judgment against Del Socorro Munoz Suarez. On  November 21, 2023, Del Socorro Munoz Suarez filed the present motion. A hearing  on the motion is set for January 10, 2024, along with a case management  conference. ANALYSIS Del  Socorro Munoz Suarez seeks to set aside the entry of default on the grounds  that Del Socorro Munoz Suarez was not served. For the following reasons, the  court DENIES Del Socorro Munoz Suarez’s motion. Legal Standard Whenever  an application for relief from default judgment is made no more than six months  after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by the moving  party’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,  surprise, or excusable neglect, the court may vacate any (1) resulting default  entered by the clerk against the moving party or (2) resulting default judgment  or dismissal entered against the moving party, unless the court finds that the  default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the moving party’s mistake,  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., §473, subd.  (b).) “The six-month time limit for granting statutory relief is jurisdictional  and the court may not consider a motion for relief made after that period has  elapsed.” (Manson, Iver & York v. Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36,  42 (Manson).) That “six-month period runs from entry of default, not  entry of judgment.” (Id.) Courts  liberally grant motions to vacate default judgments when relief is promptly  sought and the opposing party is not prejudiced as the law strongly favors  resolution on the merits. (Kramer v. Traditional Escrow, Inc. (2020) 56  Cal.App.5th 13, 28.) Courts only require “slight evidence” to support vacating  a default and resolve all doubts in favor of the party seeking relief. (Ibid.)  However, “[t]he only occasion for the application of section 473 is where a  party is unexpectedly placed in a situation to his injury without fault or  negligence of his own and against which ordinary prudence could not have  guarded.” (Hearn v. Howard (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1206, quoting Elms  v. Elms (1946) 72 Cal.App.2d 508, 513.) Discussion In  this case, Del Socorro Munoz Suarez argues Del Socorro Munoz Suarez was never  served. Generally, proof of service signed by a registered process server  creates a rebuttable presumption that service was valid, and defendant must  produce evidence establishing defendant was not properly served. (Evid. Code, §  647; American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383,  390.) Here,  Munoz Suarez provided a proof of substitute service signed by a registered  process server who claimed to serve a Lucy Mendoza at a residence in San  Bernardino on September 6, 2023. Prior to the substitute service, Munoz Suarez’s  registered process server visited the residence on two different days but was  unable to get an answer. Subsequently, Munoz Suarez’s registered process server  mailed copies of the summons and Complaint to the San Bernardino property via  first class mail. In response,  Del Socorro Munoz Suarez fails to produce any evidence rebutting this  presumption of proper service. Nor does Del Socorro Munoz Suarez provide any  evidence establishing how default was entered as a result of Del Socorro Munoz  Suarez’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. While Del  Socorro Munoz Suarez does provide a purported declaration signed under the  penalty of perjury, it cannot be considered as evidence because it does not  state it was made in California or that it is “under penalty of perjury under  the laws of the State of California” as required by Code of Civil Procedure  section 2015.5. (Bombardier Recreational Products, Inc. v. Dow Chemical  Canada ULC (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 591, 604.) Accordingly,  because Del Socorro Munoz Suarez fails to rebut the presumption of proper  service or establish grounds for vacating the entry of default, the court DENIES Del Socorro Munoz Suarez’s  motion. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Del Socorro Munoz Suarez’s motion to  set aside default is DENIED without prejudice.________________________________________________________________________________________________________Plaintiff Aurora Munoz Suarez’s Application for
Default Judgment

Respondent: NO OPPOSITION

TENTATIVE RULING

Plaintiff Aurora Munoz Suarez’s Application for
Default Judgment is GRANTED in the
reduced amount of $17,000.

BACKGROUND

This
is a breach of contract and fraud action arising from a loan agreement. In July
2019, Plaintiff Aurora Munoz Suarez agreed to loan funds to Defendant Maria del
Socorro Munoz Suarez. In exchange, Del Socorro Munoz Suarez allegedly agreed to
repay double the amount borrowed within one year. Subsequently, Munoz Suarez
alleges Del Socorro Munoz Suarez failed to repay the amounts owed.

On
July 14, 2023, Munoz Suarez filed a complaint against Del Socorro Munoz Suarez,
alleging (1) breach of contract and (2) fraud. On September 6, Munoz Suarez’s
process server served Del Socorro Munoz Suarez with substitute service in San
Bernardino.

On October 24, 2023, default was entered against Del
Socorro Munoz Suarez. On November 16, Munoz Suarez filed the present application
for default judgment against Del Socorro Munoz Suarez.

On
November 21, 2023, Del Socorro Munoz Suarez filed a motion to vacate the entry
of default. A hearing on Del Socorro Munoz Suarez’s motion and a case
management conference are set for January 10, 2024.

LEGAL STANDARD

Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)

ANALYSIS

Munoz
Suarez seeks default judgment against Del Socorro Munoz Suarez in the total amount
of $25,000 in damages. But while the application for default judgment seeks
$25,000 in damages, Munoz Suarez’s declaration states Munoz Suarez only agreed
to pay $17,000 to Del Socorro Munoz Suarez and does not explain why Munoz
Suarez seeks an additional $8,000 in damages. (Munoz Suarez Decl., ¶ 1-3.) And while
Munoz Suarez’s declaration includes a request for prejudgment interest, the
court declines to award any as Munoz Suarez’s CIV-100 application does not
include a requested amount for prejudgment interest in item 2(c).

Accordingly,
because the court otherwise finds Munoz Suarez has submitted sufficient
evidence, the court GRANTS Munoz Suarez’s application for default judgment in
the reduced amount of $17,000.

CONCLUSION

Based on the foregoing, Munoz
Suarez’s application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced
amount of $17,000.
