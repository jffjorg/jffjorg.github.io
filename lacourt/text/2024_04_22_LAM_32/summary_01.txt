And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiffs, including Craig Sallin, Croesus Investments, LLC, Linda Snyder-Kelbaugh, Sun Coast Distributing, Inc., Sun Pacific Group, Inc., and Jerry James, seek to amend their complaint to add 11 new causes of action. The defendants, Joe Samuel Bailey and Renew Spinal Care, Inc., oppose the motion. The Judge has denied the motion, citing unjustified delay, futility, and retaliatory intent. The Judge finds that the proposed amendments are not justified because of the long delay in filing the motion, the proposed amendments would require significant discovery and could cause prejudice to the defendants, and the plaintiffs' motion is conditional on the defendants filing a cross-complaint.
