And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that Plaintiff's motions to quash or modify the subpoenas issued to her medical providers are denied. The court finds that the subpoenas are justified by the breadth of Plaintiff's claimed injuries and that Defendant has established the direct relevance of the requested documents. The court also finds that Plaintiff has waived her privacy interest in the medical records by placing her medical condition at issue in her claims. As a result, the court concludes that Defendant's interest in disclosure outweighs Plaintiff's privacy interest.
