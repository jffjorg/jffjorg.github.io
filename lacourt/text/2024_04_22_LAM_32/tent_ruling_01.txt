     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
     plaintiff’s motion for leave
  to 
     file second amended
  complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 27, 2020, Plaintiffs Craig
Sallin, Croesus Investments, LLC, Linda Snyder-Kelbaugh, Sun Coast
Distributing, Inc., Sun Pacific Group, Inc., and Jerry James filed this action
for breach of contract against Defendants Joe Samuel Bailey and Renew Spinal
Care, Inc. The operative First Amended Complaint was filed on March 27, 2020.
The purported Second Amended Complaint on July 31, 2023 was not properly filed
because a party may only amend a complaint once without leave of court. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 472(a).)   
            The FAC asserts a single cause of
action for breach of written settlement agreement. The FAC alleges that
Plaintiffs provided money to Defendants and that the parties reached a
settlement resolving disputes over the amount owed. This action stems from
Defendants’ alleged failure to pay the amounts required by the settlement
agreement.  
            On March 28, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
the instant motion for leave to file the second amended complaint. Defendants
filed their opposition on April 8, 2024. Plaintiffs filed their reply on April
12, 2024.  
LEGAL STANDARD
The court may, in furtherance of justice,
and on such terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc, §§ 473, subd. (a), 576.) Courts must apply a policy of liberality in
permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding, including during trial,
when no prejudice to the opposing party is shown. (Duchrow v. Forrest
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377.) In determining the extent of prejudice to
the opposing party, the court must consider various factors, such as whether
the amendment would delay trial or increase the discovery burden. (Demetriades
v. Yelp, Inc. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 294, 306.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Unjustified Delay
“A long unexcused delay may be the basis
for denying permission to amend pleadings, especially where the proposed
amendment interjects a new issue, which may require further investigation or
discovery procedures.” (Rainer v. Community Memorial Hosp. (1971) 18
Cal.App.3d 240, 258.) An amendment is properly denied “when offered after long
unexplained delay or on the eve of trial.” (Royal Thrift & Loan Co. v.
County Escrow, Inc. (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 24, 41.) 
Here, Plaintiffs acknowledge that they
have intended to file a second amended complaint since 2020 and that they
exchanged a copy of the proposed SAC with current defense counsel more than one
year ago. (Notice of Mtn. ¶ 7.) Even accepting as true that Plaintiffs did not
file the SAC back in 2020 because they believed the matter would be settled,
Plaintiffs had decided by early 2023 that the SAC should be filed. (Kent Decl.
¶ 16.) Plaintiffs then waited until July 2023 to attempt to file the SAC. This
attempt was rejected because a party may only amend its pleading “once” without
leave of court, regardless of whether the amendment is filed before or after a
demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 472.) This is Plaintiffs’ Second Amended
Complaint. Plaintiffs then waited nearly one more year after that to file this
motion. 
This delay is unreasonable and
unjustified, especially because it adds eleven causes of action a mere four
months before the trial date of August 20, 2024. Whereas the operative FAC
concerns Defendants’ purported breach of the 2019 settlement agreement, the new
proposed causes of action pertain to the underlying transactions predating the
2019 agreement. The new claims are unrelated to Defendants’ breach of the 2019
agreement and constitute an unwarranted expansion in the scope of the case at
this late stage. The proposed claims would substantially increase the discovery
burden close to trial and result in undue prejudice to Defendants.
II.
Futility 
“[L]eave to amend should not be granted
where, in all probability, amendment would be futile.” (Foroudi v. The
Aerospace Corp. (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th 992, 1000.) A plaintiff “has the
burden to establish how the complaint can be amended to state a valid cause of
action.” (Sanowicz v. Bacal (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 1027, 1044.) Because
Plaintiffs now seek to recover for conduct predating the 2019 settlement
agreement, the SAC implicates statute of limitations issues.   
Relation back only applies if the
allegations in an amended complaint “(1) rest on the same general set of facts,
(2) involve the same injury, and (3) refer to the same instrumentality, as the
original one.” (Norgart v. Upjohn Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 409.) “[T]he
critical inquiry is whether the defendant had adequate notice of the claim
based on the original pleading.” (Pointe San Diego Residential Community,
L.P. v. Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves & Savitch, LLP (2011) 195
Cal.App.4th 265, 277.) 
Here, the new claims do not relate back
because they are based on a different set of facts, i.e., Defendants’
alleged misconduct in the underlying transactions dating back to 2014. Again,
the current FAC is based on Defendants’ breach of the 2019 settlement
agreement. The new claims also involve a different injury and instrumentality
because the SAC seeks to recover for alleged fraud and securities violations.
This substantially differs from the FAC, which merely seeks damages for
Defendants’ alleged failure to pay the amount due under a contract. The
original pleading which sought recovery for breach of the settlement agreement
could not have fairly placed Defendants on notice of claims based on conduct
predating the agreement. 
Because the proposed claims are
time-barred on their face, leave to amend is unwarranted for the independent
reason that the amendment would be futile.   

III.  Retaliatory  
Lastly, Plaintiffs inexplicably condition
their motion on Defendants’ filing of a cross-complaint. (See Notice of Mtn.,
p. 2.) The viability of the proposed SAC does not depend on whether Defendants
file a cross-complaint. As mentioned above, Plaintiffs admit that they have
intended to file the SAC since 2020. Defendants did not move to file their
cross-complaint until March 2024. The extensive and unexplained delay in filing
the SAC, plus Plaintiffs’ willingness to forgo the amendment so long as
Defendants do not file a cross-complaint, suggests that the amendment is not
crucial or necessary to a fair resolution of the case. The fact that Plaintiffs
only wish to file the SAC if Defendants file their cross-complaint suggests
that the motion is retaliatory. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file
a second amended complaint is DENIED.
