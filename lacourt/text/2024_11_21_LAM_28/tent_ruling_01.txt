BACKGROUND
 
On December 1, 2023, Plaintiff TH Auto LLC
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Arman Avetich Avetisyan an individual
doing business as Auto Galleria (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 25. Plaintiff
alleged causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) fraud and intentional
misrepresentation, (3) negligent misrepresentation, (4) conversion, and (5)
violation of Business and Professions Code Section 17200. 
 
Plaintiff alleges it purchased three separate
2023 Mercedes-Benz GLS 450w4 vehicles from Defendant and paid 95% of the
purchase price for each vehicle. Plaintiff claims that it was supposed to pay
the final 5% once Defendant transferred title of the vehicles to Plaintiff.
Allegedly, after multiple inquiries, Defendant failed to transfer the titles,
causing damages to Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff substitute served Defendant on December
18, 2023. The Clerk entered default against Defendant on July 8, 2024. This is
Plaintiff’s firs request for entry of default judgment.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) Section 585
permits entry of a judgment after a defendant’s default has been entered.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of
the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the
judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of
costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought; (7) a dismissal of all parties
against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
under CCP Section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8)
exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties. 
CRC 3.1800. 
 
JC Form CIV-100 must be used to request court
judgment.  Item number 2 must be
completed.  Item number 8 must be
completed if the Defendant is an individual. 
Plaintiff must submit a proposed form of judgment.  
 
Here, Plaintiff has filed CIV-100 Forms for
Defendant and completed item 2 and 8 on the form. However, Plaintiff has not dismissed
the Doe Defendants from this action. Similarly, Plaintiff’s proposed form of
judgment on the JUD-100 form leaves item 6 blank. Given these deficiencies, the
Court cannot enter default judgment. To obtain default judgment, Plaintiff must
dismiss the Doe defendants from this case and refile a completed JUD-100 form.
The amount of damages on the JUD-100 form must match Item 2 of the CIV-100 form
exactly.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment in its favor and against Defendant Arman Avetich Avetisyan is
DENIED.
