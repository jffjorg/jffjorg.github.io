Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Rupert A. Byrdsong, has issued a tentative ruling in the case TH Auto LLC v. Avetisyan, et al. (Case Number: 23STCV29486). The Plaintiff, TH Auto LLC, is seeking entry of default judgment against the Defendant, Arman Avetich Avetisyan, for alleged breach of contract, fraud, and other causes of action. The Defendant failed to transfer titles of three 2023 Mercedes-Benz GLS 450w4 vehicles to the Plaintiff, despite multiple inquiries. The Plaintiff filed a complaint on December 1, 2023, and substitute served the Defendant on December 18, 2023. The Clerk entered default against the Defendant on July 8, 2024. However, the Judge has denied the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment because the Plaintiff failed to dismiss the Doe defendants from the case and did not provide a complete proposed form of judgment. The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to refile a completed JUD-100 form and dismiss the Doe defendants from the case.
