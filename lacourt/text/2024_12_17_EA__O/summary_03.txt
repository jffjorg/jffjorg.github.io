And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants to the District's cross-complaint. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. The court finds that the cross-complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court notes that the cross-complaint does not plead a statute that establishes how a school district can file a cross-complaint for indemnity against a minor and their mother. The court also finds that the cross-complaint does not allege the ultimate facts to apprise Cross-Defendants of how the mother actually knew of L.R.'s alleged tendencies to sexually assault students with special needs. The court notes that liability for such conduct cannot be imposed merely on the basis of constructive knowledge or information that the defendant should have known. The court grants leave to amend to allow the District to include the statute and case authorities cited in its opposition to demonstrate the viability of its claims.
