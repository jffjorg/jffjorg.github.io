And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a consolidated case (Case No. 21STCV02124) involving a site plan and traffic control approved by CITY. The plaintiff, the sole child of a decedent, claims that CITY's approval of the site plan and traffic control is negligent. The defendant, CITY, argues that its compliance with the approved site plan exonerates it from any negligent conduct. The judge has overruled the plaintiff's objection that the defendant misstates evidence and notes that the plaintiff does not address the cited authority. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's requests for relief without prejudice.
