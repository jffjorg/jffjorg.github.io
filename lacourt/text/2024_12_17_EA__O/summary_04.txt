And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in response to a complaint filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants, ROES 1-5, are jointly and severally responsible for the misconduct committed by L.R., a minor, also known as JOHN ROE 1. The judge notes that the District did not file a notice of a related case, which has caused confusion. The judge also expresses concern that the parties' meet and confer effort lasted only two minutes and orders that, in the future, parties must make a good faith effort to meet and confer before filing motions.

The judge is focusing on the foreseeability of the particular criminal act itself, rather than the general nature of the harm that resulted, citing the California Supreme Court case Wiener v. Southcoast Childcare Centers. The judge's tentative ruling aims to clarify the issues and ensure that the parties are working together in good faith.
