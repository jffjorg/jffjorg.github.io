CROSS-DEFENDANTS' DEMURRER
TO WALNUT VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT'S CROSS-COMPLAINT is SUSTAINED
with leave to amend. 
 
Background
 
This case
arises from a student’s alleged sexual assault by another student while on
campus. Plaintiff Y.O., a minor, and by and through her Guardian Ad Litem,
Beatriz P. filed suit against Defendants WALNUT VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
(“District”) and SUSAN ARZOLA (the “Principal”) alleging the following:
Plaintiff, a minor female special needs student attending the eighth grade at
South Pointe Middle School, was sexually abused on multiple occasions by a
fellow student, L.R., during school hours, on the South Pointe Middle School
campus. (Second Amended Complaint (SAC) ¶24.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
had actual and constructive notice that L.R. was a danger to other students,
specifically other special needs students, because in August 2020, Defendants
received written complaints describing L.R.’s sexual misconduct with other
students of the District, including another special education student, E.C. (¶¶29-34.)
Despite the aforementioned actual knowledge of L.R.’s propensities for sexual
misconduct with other special needs students and several written accounts of
such acts while, Defendants failed to appropriately care for, supervise, and
monitor Plaintiff. (SAC generally pp. 9-11.) 
 
 
On December
28, 2023, Plaintiff filed suit. 
 
On January
30, 2024, Plaintiff filed her first amended complaint (FAC) against the same
Defendants for: 
 
1.     Negligent Supervision Of Students
[Gov. C. §§ 815.2, 815.6, And 820];
2.     Negligent Hiring, Supervision,
Training And Retention [Gov. C. § 815.2 And 820];
3.     Public Disclosure Of Private
Information [Gov. C. § 815.6 And 820];
4.     Intentional Infliction Of Emotional
Distress
 
On March 18,
2024, the District filed a demurrer and motion to strike (MTS). 
 
On May 1, 2024, the court sustained the 3/18/24 demurrer with leave to
amend. The court did so on two grounds. First, that the pleading conclusively
alleges that defendants knew or were on notice of the perpetrator’s past
unlawful sexual assault, notably when Plaintiff alleges that the District
should have been aware of. L.R’s dangerous propensities prior to 2/14/22 but
the alleged assaults started on 2/14/22. Second, the pleading failed to
comply with CCP section 425.10 subdivision (a), subsection (1), which provides
that a complaint “shall contain . . . [a] statement of the facts constituting
the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language,” in that the FAC is
largely a recitation of law. 
 
On May 31,
2024, Plaintiff filed a SAC against the same Defendants for:
 
1.     Negligent Supervision Of Students
[Gov. C. §§ 815.2, 815.6, And 820]
2.     Negligent Hiring, Supervision,
Training And Retention [Gov. C. § 815.2 And 820]
3.     Public Disclosure Of Private
Information [Gov. C. § 815.6 And 820] And
4.     Intentional Infliction Of Emotional
Distress (IIED) 
 
On August 21,
2024, Plaintiff dismissed, without prejudice, Plaintiff’s complaint only as to
Arzola; The District filed its answer; and the District filed a cross-complaint (CC) against
L.R., a minor, a.k.a. JOHN ROE 1, by and through his guardian ad litem JENNIFER
BUTLER and JENNIFER BUTLER, an individual, and Roes 1 through 30 (collectively,
“Cross-Defendants”)[1]
for: 
1.     INDEMNITY
2.     EQUITABLE CONTRIBUTION
3.     PRORATION OF FAULT AND DAMAGES
4.     DECLARATORY RELIEF 
5.     PRORATION OF DAMAGES BASED ON CIVIL
CODE §1431 et seq
 
On October 2,
2024, Cross-Defendants filed an ‘OPPOSITION TO CROSS-COMPLAINANT'S NOTICE OF
RELATED CASE.’[2]
 
On October 9,
2024, Cross-Defendants filed the instant demurrer to the District’s CC.
 
On November
8, 2024, Cross-Defendants filed an ‘ANTI-SLAPP NOTICE OF AND SPECIAL MOTION TO
STRIKE DEFENDANT AND CROSSCOMPLAINANT WALNUT VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT'S
CROSSCOMPLAINT, PURSUANT TO C.C.P. §425.16.’ (The hearing on the anti-SLAPP
motion is set for 1/15/2025.) 
 
On December
4, 2024, the District filed its opposition to the Cross-Defendants’ demurrer.
 
On December
10, 2024, Cross-Defendants filed their reply. 
 
Discussion[3]
 
The pertinent
allegations in the CC are as follows:
 
As parents and guardians of L.R., a minor, a.k.a. JOHN ROE 1, each
Cross-Defendant named herein were responsible to persuade their child that
such improper sexual behavior misconduct as alleged by plaintiff was and is
improper. Cross-Defendants, and each of them owed a duty of due care to
plaintiff, and owed a similar duty to Cross-Defendant DISTRICT, and
DISTRICT therefore has a right to indemnity against Cross-Defendants and each
of them . . . That the negligence, carelessness and fault of cross-defendants
would be the primary contributing and concurring causes of the injuries and
damages allegedly sustained by plaintiff in the underlying action. That by
reason of the foregoing, the primary liability for injuries or damages, if any,
allegedly sustained by plaintiff rests solely upon the cross-defendants …. (CC
¶¶5-8, emphasis added.) 
 
Cross-Defendants
demur on the grounds that the CC does not state facts sufficient to constitute
any cause of action (COA) pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §430.l0 (e)
and/or that the COAs are otherwise uncertain, ambiguous and unintelligible
pursuant to §430.10 (f). More specifically, Cross-Defendants argue that: 
 
1.     the Cross-Complaint does not provide
any law establishing how a School District can file a cross-complaint for
indemnity against a minor and his mother for indemnity and related claims
(Demurrer p. 3:1-3). 
2.     the District “does not put forth any
law or facts that support their contentions that Cross-Defendants owed a duty
of care and instead provides declaratory statements and unfounded conclusions”
(Demurrer p. 2:26-28) and
 
For
reasons to be discussed below, the court agrees with Cross-Defendants that the
CC fails for insufficient facts. 
 
As to the
first point, the court agrees with Cross-Defendants that the CC fails to
provide an applicable statute for indemnity. To the extent that the District
argues that Civil Code section 1714.1 is a statute that provides for parental liability for the torts of a child, the statute and the references
subdivisions in opposition are not pled in the CC. Accordingly,
while the District may heavily reference the statute in its opposition, a trial
court is bound by the allegations in the complaint and “cannot consider the
outré-judicial statements of counsel nor the additional facts found in the
briefs.” (Melikan v. Truck Ins. Exchange (1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 113,
114.) 
 
With that,
the District’s heavy reliance upon Curry v. Superior Ct. (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 180 is equally unavailing. While Curry involved nearly identical facts, the school district
there pled a fifth cause of action for indemnification based on section
1714.1 (Id. at pp. 182-183.) The specific issue before the
appellate court was “whether a tortfeasor seeking partial equitable indemnity
may claim the benefit of Civil Code section 1714.1.” (Id. at p. 182.) “A
case is not authority for a proposition not considered therein or presented by
its own particular facts.” (McConnel v. Advantest America, Inc. (2023)
92 Cal.App.5th 596, 611.) Perhaps in recognition of the foregoing, the
District asks for leave to amend to “include the statute and the case
authorities cited herein to demonstrate the viability of its claims.” (Opp.
p. 7:3-5, emphasis added.)
 
Therefore, to
the extent that the District relies upon Curry and section 1714.1 as law
that allow the District to sue L.R. and his mother, the demurrer is sustained
with leave to amend because said statute is not pled in the CC.  
 
As to the
second point about insufficient facts, both parties’ arguments warrant
discussion. 
 
The demurrer
argues that Cross-Complaint is entirely devoid of allegations regarding why or
how Cross-Defendants may be liable. That argument appears to be made based upon
Cross-Defendants’ position that L.R. was the victim of repeated sexual
assaults by another student on school grounds.[4]
However, as noted by both parties, on a demurrer, material facts alleged
in the cross-complaint are assumed true. (See e.g., Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 26 311, 318.) Effectively, as both the SAC and CC allege that L.R.
was the perpetrator, then the court so to be true. For Cross-Defendants to essentially
ask the court to make an evidentiary finding to determine otherwise is
improper on a demurrer. 
 
Notwithstanding, the CC does not allege the
ultimate facts to apprise Cross-Defendants of how the Jennifer Butler/the
mother actually knew of L.R.’s alleged tendencies to sexually assault students
with special needs.[5]
As noted by Cross-Defendants and not otherwise disputed by the District, to
impose liability for the conduct of a third party, foreseeability must be
measured by what the parent actually knew; liability for such conduct
cannot be imposed merely on the basis of constructive knowledge or information
that the defendant should have known. (Demurrer p. 4, citing to Margaret W
v. Kelley R., (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 141, 156-157.) Here, there are no
facts as to how the mother actually knew of L.R.’s alleged dangerous
propensities. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, as the CC does not clearly set forth the facts and law that
establish a duty owed to the District, the demurrer is sustained in its
entirety with leave to amend.
