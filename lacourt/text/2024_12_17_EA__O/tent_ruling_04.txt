[1] According to Paragraph 2 of the CC,
“JENNIFER BUTLER is the natural parent of L.R., a minor, a.k.a. JOHN ROE 1.
ROES 2 through 5, inclusive, are parents, stepparents and otherwise guardians
of L.R., a minor, a.k.a. JOHN ROE 1. All such defendants are jointly and
severally responsible for the misconduct alleged by plaintiff herein as
committed by L.R., a minor, a.k.a. JOHN ROE 1.”
 


[2] This filing is
unclear as the District did not file a ‘notice of a related case.’ The CC was
filed in this case; the District did not file a separate case for
there to be a related case. 


[3] According to the
Reply, the parties meet and confer effort lasted two minutes. (Reply p.
3:10-11.) For any future
motions or filings, even if not required, the failure to meet and confer in
good faith (i.e., telephone call with an in-depth discussion of the issues and
pertinent law) will result in the motion being taken off calendar or otherwise
continued. 


[4] Though the demurrer
states that this argument is stated in the demurrer (Demurrer p. 4:16-17), the
details are found in the anti-SLAPP motion. 
 


[5]  The focus needs to be on the foreseeability of
the particular criminal act itself, not the general nature of the harm that
resulted. (See Wiener v. Southcoast Childcare
Centers (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1138, 1148.)
