“A reverse auction . . . occur[s] when ‘the defendant in a series of class actions picks the most
ineffectual class lawyers to negotiate a settlement with in the hope that the
district court will approve a weak settlement that will preclude other claims
against the defendant.’”  (Amaro v.
Anaheim Arena Management, LLC (2021) 69 Cal.App.5th 521, 544.)

Plaintiffs claim they did not receive service of the moving papers until September
9, 2024.  (See Plaintiffs’
Opposition, p. 5.)

The current record does not establish a reverse auction.  Proposed Intervenors offer little more than
conjecture to support their position. 
(See Motion, pp. 11-12 [discussing Defendant’s participation in a failed
mediation in a case called Magallon v. XPO Logistics Freight, Inc.
(21STCV46330)].)
