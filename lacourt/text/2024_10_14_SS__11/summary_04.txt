And here is the summary in English text:

The judge is considering a tentative ruling regarding a court hearing. The defendant, GXO Logistics Supply Chain, Inc., is accused of engaging in a "reverse auction" in which they chose weak class lawyers to negotiate a settlement with in hopes of getting a weak settlement approved by the court. The plaintiffs claim they did not receive service of the moving papers until September 9, 2024. The judge has reviewed the record and finds that there is no evidence to support the claim of a reverse auction. The proposed intervenors' claims are based on conjecture and lack evidence. The judge will consider this information and make a final ruling at the court hearing.
