TENTATIVE RULING
 
Proposed Intervenors’ motion to intervene is denied.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a wage-and-hour
action.  Plaintiff alleges class and
representative claims under the Labor Code, Unfair Competition Law, and Private
Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”).
 
Plaintiffs and Defendant entered
into a settlement in July 2023.[1]
 
Plaintiffs’ motion for
preliminary approval is set for hearing on October 14, 2024.
 
Here, Proposed Intervenors move
to intervene. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Proposed Intervenors contend the
motion to intervene should be granted because, if approved, the settlement
would improperly release: 
 
* Proposed Intervenors’ class and
representative quota-law claims (see Motion, pp. 1-5); and
 
* Defendant’s successors,
predecessors, subsidiaries, affiliates, and related companies.  (See id. at pp. 1-3, 5-8.)  
 
Proposed Intervenors also contend
the motion should be granted to prevent a reverse auction.  (See id. at pp. 11-12.)[2]
 
Timeliness
 
The
first issue is whether the motion is timely. 
The answer is no.  The Court set a
briefing schedule for this motion, requiring the moving papers to be filed by
August 30, 2024 (see 7/3/24 Minute Order, p. 2), but the eCourt docket
indicates that Proposed Intervenors did not e-file the moving papers until
September 3rd.  This is one
reason for denying the motion.
 
The
Court sees a second reason.  “Whether intervention is of right, or
only permissive, the party seeking to intervene must make ‘timely’ application
to the court.”  (Edmon & Karnow, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2024 Update)
¶ 2:438.)  “Timeliness . . . is
determined by the totality of the circumstances, with a focus on three primary
factors: [1] the stage of the proceedings; [2] the prejudice to other parties
from the delay in seeking to intervene; and [3] the reason for the delay.”  (Ibid.) 
Importantly, timeliness “is measured . . . from the date the intervenors
‘knew or should have known their interests in the litigation were not being
adequately represented.’”  (Id. at ¶
2:439.)  Plaintiffs and Defendant reached
the settlement at the mediation on July 12, 2023 (see Moon Decl.,
¶¶ 14-15), and the Moon declaration suggests that Proposed Intervenors’ counsel
knew about the settlement, the purported collusion, and the alleged
deficiencies by August 9, 2023. 
(See id. at ¶¶ 18-25; see also Defendant’s Opposition, p. 7.)  However, Proposed Intervenors did not file
their ex parte application until July 2, 2024 and did not e-file
the moving papers until September 3, 2024, more than a year
later.[3]  These facts show that the motion is late.
 
Reply
Briefs
 
The
next issue concerns the reply briefs.  On
the night of October 2, 2024, Proposed Intervenors e-filed two replies, one at
10:29 p.m., and one at 11:12 p.m.  The
Court declines to strike them – and did read them – despite the fact that they
were filed after close of business.
 
Mandatory
Intervention
 
“[A]
nonparty has the right to intervene . . . where the nonparty claims an interest
in the property or transaction involved in the litigation, and is so
situated that any judgment rendered in the nonparty's absence ‘may impair or
impede that person's ability to protect that interest.’”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 2:407,
emphasis in original.)  
 
“There
is no right to intervene if the court finds that the nonparty’s interests are
being adequately
represented by one or more of the existing parties to the litigation.”  (Id. at ¶ 2:409.1, emphasis in original.)
 
Proposed
Intervenors claim they must be allowed to intervene to preserve their quota-law
claims and to narrow the settlement’s definition of released parties.  (See, e.g., Motion, pp. 10-11 [arguing that
Plaintiffs lack standing to bring the quota-law claims and are atypical
representatives].) 
 
The
Court disagrees.  Yes, Proposed
Intervenors “have an interest in preserving their claims and rights[,]” but, as
Plaintiffs and Defendant point out, their “ability to protect their interest
would not be practically impaired or impeded by the settlement . . . because
they could opt out of or object to the settlement.”  (Edwards v. Heartland Payment Systems,
Inc. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 725, 733; see also Plaintiffs’
Opposition, p. 6; Defendant’s Opposition, pp. 8-9.)  Given these options, “formal intervention is
unnecessary” to achieve Proposed Intervenors’ goals.  (Edwards, supra, 29 Cal.App.5th
at 733.)
 
Indeed,
when deciding whether to approve a settlement, the Court is obligated to
“prevent fraud, collusion or unfairness to the class.”  (Ibid.) 
It is standard for the Court to analyze the scope of the release as part
of the approval process.  Any objection
to the scope here would be scrutinized by the Court and could result in the
release being narrowed.  This could be
done without intervention.
 
The
same goes for the reverse-auction argument. 
Proposed Intervenors do not need mandatory intervention to raise a
reverse-auction objection.  If raised,
the Court could decide the objection on a developed record prior to granting
final approval.[4]

 
As a matter of guidance, the Court is leaning toward removing the
quota-law language from the release because Plaintiffs concede that they do not
allege quota-law claims in their operative complaint (see, e.g., Plaintiffs’
Opposition, p. 12), and the quota-law claims arose after the alleged class
period commenced.  (See First Amended
Complaint, ¶ 2 [alleging that the class period is “from October 30, 2020 . . .
into the present and ongoing”]; see also Plaintiffs’ Opposition, p. 7
[conceding that the quota-law statutes “were not in effect until 2022”].)  On balance, the Court tends to believe that carving
out the quota-law claims while approving the settlement as to the other
wage-and-hour claims would provide the best benefit to the class.  
 
Such a carveout would also probably take care of the parties’ dispute
concerning the Labor and Workforce Development Agency’s interest in the
quota-law claims.
 
Nevertheless, a quick discussion of Turrieta v. Lyft, Inc.
(2024) 16 Cal.5th 664 is warranted. 
Three Lyft drivers each filed a representative PAGA action against “the
same employer for the same alleged Labor Code violations.”  (Turrieta, supra, 16 Cal.5th
at 676.)  One of the drivers
settled.  The other two drivers sought to
intervene and to file objections to the settlement.  The California Supreme Court held that PAGA’s
legislative scheme does not permit intervention and a right to object.  (See ibid.)
 
Turrieta might be
distinguishable.  Turrieta governs
when the representative PAGA claims overlap and involve the same alleged
violations of the Labor Code.  (See
ibid.)  Again, Plaintiffs’ operative
complaint does not allege the quota-law claims, and they arose after the start
of the alleged class period.
 
Ultimately, though, Turrieta does not change the result.  Proposed Intervenors have the option to
either opt out or object, so the Court finds that mandatory intervention should
be denied.
 
As for the released-parties definition, Plaintiffs and Defendant claim
the settlement uses the Los Angeles Superior Court’s model definition.  The Court will address this issue with the
attorneys at the hearing.  
 
Permissive
Intervention
 
Permissive
intervention is denied.  The Court “has discretion
to permit a nonparty to intervene” where:
 
*
“[t]he nonparty has a direct and immediate interest in the litigation” (Truck
Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 342, 346,
emphasis in original);
 
*
“[t]he intervention will not enlarge the issues in the case” (ibid.,
emphasis in original); and
 
*
“[t]he reasons for intervention outweigh any opposition by the existing
parties.”  (Ibid.)
 
At
minimum, intervention would enlarge the issues by adding the quota-law claims,
which would necessitate a reopening of discovery, creating delay and a
potential unraveling of the settlement of the non-quota-law claims.  Proposed Intervenors’ threat to file a motion
to stay Plaintiffs’ case following intervention would add to the delay.  (See Motion, p. 13; see also Defendant’s
Opposition, pp. 7-8.)  Moreover, the
Court reiterates that “formal intervention is unnecessary” since Proposed
Intervenors could either opt out of the settlement or object to it.  (Edwards, supra, 29 Cal.App.5th
at 733.)
