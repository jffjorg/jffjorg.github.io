And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the hearing on the motion for leave to amend the complaint will be continued. The motion is to add Sara Sobenes as a new representative and to dismiss Silvestre Martinez as a plaintiff. The judge notes that the policy favoring amendment is strong and that leave to amend should be granted unless the facts are not in dispute and the nature of the claim is clear.

The judge also notes that the proposed third amended complaint (TAC) is defective because it does not allege facts demonstrating relation back and PAGA standing. The judge grants Plaintiff's Counsel leave to pursue either option: to redraft the TAC to allege facts demonstrating relation back and PAGA standing, or to conduct discovery to find a different new representative.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that Silvestre Martinez has disappeared and that Plaintiff's Counsel has tried to contact him multiple times without success. The judge also notes that Sara Sobenes is a potential new representative who has not signed an arbitration agreement.
