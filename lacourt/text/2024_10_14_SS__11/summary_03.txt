Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The proposed intervenors, Diana Cardenas and Luis Ramirez, have moved to intervene in the case to preserve their quota-law claims and to narrow the settlement's definition of released parties. The court has denied the motion to intervene, finding that the proposed intervenors' motion is untimely and that they do not have a sufficient interest in the litigation to warrant mandatory intervention.

The court notes that the proposed intervenors' counsel knew about the settlement, the purported collusion, and the alleged deficiencies by August 9, 2023, but did not file their motion to intervene until July 2, 2024, more than a year later. The court also finds that the proposed intervenors' interests are being adequately represented by the existing parties to the litigation.

The court will address the scope of the release and the definition of released parties at the hearing. The court is leaning towards removing the quota-law language from the release because the quota-law claims arose after the alleged class period commenced and because the proposed intervenors could opt out of the settlement or object to it.

The court also notes that the proposed intervenors' threat to file a motion to stay the case following intervention would add to the delay and that formal intervention is unnecessary. The court will deny the motion to intervene and will consider the proposed intervenors' objections at the hearing.
