Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants Defendant Pouya Benyamini's motion for summary judgment, finding that there is no triable issue of fact regarding whether he breached a duty of care owed to Plaintiffs. The Court relies on the uncontroverted testimony of Dr. Frank Candela, an expert witness, who establishes that Defendant Benyamini did not breach any duty of care owed to Plaintiffs. The Court finds that Plaintiffs fail to sustain their burden to demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of fact, and therefore grants Defendant Benyamini's motion for summary judgment.
