And here is a brief summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to set aside the default judgment and vacate the default. The defendants, Paul Ward and Nathan Beavers, had failed to timely respond to the complaint, and the court had entered a default judgment against them. The defendants claimed that the default judgment was entered due to excusable neglect or mistake, and that the Clerk's Judgment was void. The judge agreed with the defendants and found that the entry of the default judgment was caused by the defendants' failure to appear at hearings, despite notice, and that the Clerk's Judgment was void because the defendants had filed a motion to quash service of summons that had not been denied by the court. The judge granted the defendants' motion and ordered that the default judgment be set aside and the default be vacated.
