This action arises out of alleged fraud. Plaintiff Black
Lives Matter Grassroots, Inc. (“Plaintiff” or “BLM Grassroots”) brings suit
against Defendants Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. (“GNF”), BOWERS*

(the “Original Motion”), awarding $100,602.15 in attorney’s fees and $95.95 in
costs. (January 9, 2024 Minute Order, pp. 1, 6.) 
Accordingly, on March 13, 2024, the Court entered the
“Amended Judgment of Dismissal, Awarding Attorney’s Fees” (the “Amended

GROUNDS FOR MOTION 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c), Defendant Bowers Consulting moves
for an award of ¿$12,153.80
in attorney’s fees and $130.80 in costs incurred in defending against
Plaintiff’s appeal. 
DISCUSSION 
 
I.              
ATTORNEYS’ FEES 
A.   
Entitlement To Attorney’s Fees 
Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16, subdivision (c) provides, in relevant part, that in any action subject
to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (b), “a prevailing
defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover that
defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16(c)(1).) 
As explained by the Court of
Appeal in Dove Audio, Inc. v. Rosenfeld, Meyer & Susman (1996) 47
Cal.App.4th 777:
 
“A statute
authorizing an attorney fee award at the trial court level includes appellate
attorney fees unless the statute specifically provides otherwise.” (Evans
v. Unkow (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1499….) Since section 425.16,
subdivision (c) provides for an award of attorney fees and costs to a
prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike, and does not preclude
recovery of appellate attorney fees by a prevailing defendant-respondent, those
fees are recoverable. (38 Cal.App.4th at p. 1500.)
(Id. at 785; accord, Wilkerson
v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448; Rosenaur v. Scherer
(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 260, 287.) 
Defendant Bowers Consulting
prevailed on its anti-SLAPP motion and therefore is entitled to recover its
attorney’s fees and costs, including those incurred on appeal. 
Plaintiff does not contest
Defendant Bowers Consulting’s right to recover reasonable attorney’s fees
incurred in defending against the appeal. (See Opposition, p. 1.) 
B.   
Reasonableness Of Requested Fees 
1.    
Legal Standards 
As explained by the Court of
Appeal in Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1315: 
A trial court
assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on
the careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of
each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the case. The court tabulates
the attorney fee touchstone, or lodestar, by multiplying the number of hours
reasonably expended by the reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the community
for similar work. [T]he lodestar figure may be increased or decreased depending
on a variety of factors, including the contingent nature of the fee award. …absent
circumstances rendering the award unjust, an attorney fee award should
ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent, including
those relating solely to the fee. … ‘padding’ in the form of inefficient or
duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation. 
(Id. at 1321 (internal
citations and quotations omitted). 
A trial court has broad
discretion to award attorney fees in an amount that is less than the lodestar
amount and, to discourage claimants from making an unreasonable demand, may
deny altogether a fee request that appears unreasonably inflated. (Id.
at 1321-1322; see Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635 (quoting Brown
v. Stackler (7th Cir.1980) 612 F.2d 1057, 1059). 
“The basis for the trial court's calculation must be the
actual hours counsel has devoted to the case, less those that result from
inefficient or duplicative use of time.” (Horsford v. Board Of Trustees Of
California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395.) “The law is
clear, however, that an award of attorney fees may be based on counsel's
declarations, without production of detailed time records.” (Raining Data
Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.) “[T]he verified
time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford,
supra at 396; City of Colton v. Singletary
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 785 (same).)
“‘In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice. Failure to raise specific challenges in the trial court forfeits
the claim on appeal.’” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488 (quoting Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564).) 
“[T]he trial court is in the best
position to value the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her
courtroom, and this includes the determination of the hourly rate that will be
used in the lodestar calculus.” (569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 436-437
(internal citation omitted); see, e.g., Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448 [“The reasonableness of
attorney fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from
a consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity
of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time
involved. The court may also consider whether the amount requested is based
upon unnecessary or duplicative work.”]; Christian Research
Institute, supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at 1321-1322 [ascertaining the amount of
attorney’s fees to be awarded is left to the sound discretion of the trial
court and the trial court need not simply award the sum requested].) 
In setting the hourly rate
for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “fees
customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar
work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App.
4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin
v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664; see also Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009 [“[R]ate
determinations in other cases, particularly those setting a rate for the
plaintiffs' attorney, are satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market
rate.”].) “In making its calculation, the court may rely on its own
knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the experience,
skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees, the difficulty or
complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied, and affidavits
from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate
determinations in other cases.” (569 East County Boulevard LLC, supra, 6
Cal.App.5th at 437 (internal citations omitted).) 
2.     Analysis 
Defendant Bowers Consulting requests a lodestar figure
of $12,513.80, comprising of (1) $3,691.00 in attorneys’ fees incurred in
connection with its defense/opposition in response to Plaintiff’s appeal; (2) $4,997.00
in attorney’s fees incurred in the preparation and prosecution of the instant
Motion; and (3) $3,695.00 in anticipated fees incurred to review and research
any Opposition papers, prepare and file an expected Reply memorandum, and
participate in further court proceedings in connection with the instant Motion.
(Motion, pp. 2, 7.) 
i.              
Hourly Rates 
Defendant Bowers Consulting requests the following hourly
rates for attorneys, (Lawrence Segal Decl., ¶ 8):
 
·      
Lawrence
Segal: $565/hour in 2023 and $585/hour in 2024
 
·      
Andrew
Shupe: $465/hour in 2023 and $485/hour in 2024
 
·      
Tabitha
Chan: $365/hour in 2023 and $385/hour in 2024
 
Plaintiff does not challenge the hourly rates requested. 
The hourly rates requested in the instant Motion are the
same hourly rates requested by Defendant Bowers Consulting in the Original
Motion, (Lawrence Segal Decl. Attached to Original Motion, ¶ 4), and approved
by the Court. (January 9, 2024 Minute Order, pp. 5-6.)
 After consideration of the evidence filed in support of
the instant Motion, (Segal Decl. at ¶¶ 8-9; Andrew D. Shupe Decl., ¶ 2; Tabitha
Chan Decl., ¶ 2), and relying on its own knowledge and familiarity with the
legal market, the Court awards the requested hourly rates. 
ii.             
Hours Requested 
Plaintiff does not challenge (1)
the $3,691.00 in attorneys’ fees requested in connection with Defendant Bowers Consulting’s defense
of Plaintiff’s appeal; or (2) the $4,997.00 in attorney’s fees requested
in connection with the preparation and prosecution of this Motion. 
Thus, the Court finds that
Plaintiff fails to sustain its burden to challenge these fees. The Court finds
these fees reasonable. 
However, Plaintiff challenges the
$3,695.00 in anticipatory attorney’s fees that Defendant Bowers Consulting contends it will incur to review
and research opposition papers to the instant Motion, to file a reply
memorandum, and to participate in further court proceedings on this Motion.
(Opposition at p. 1.) 
The $3,695.00 in anticipatory
attorney’s fees requested by Defendant
Bowers Consulting reflect four (4) hours of Andrew Shupe’s time “to review the
Opposition and prepare a Reply brief,” plus three (3) hours of Lawrence Segal’s
time “in connection with reviewing any Opposition, editing the Reply, and
attending the hearing on this Motion.” (Segal Decl. at ¶ 15.) 
Since Plaintiff’s limited
opposition is only one sentence, and Defendant Bowers Consulting did not file any reply brief, the Court
agrees with Plaintiff that the $3,695.00 in anticipatory attorney’s fees
requested by Defendant Bowers
Consulting should be reduced.
 Given the limited Opposition and
lack of Reply brief, the Court awards $485.00 of the $3,695.00 requested, representing
one (1) hour of Andrew Shupe’s
time to prepare for and attend the hearing, but does not award any other of the
anticipated attorney’s fees requested by Defendant Bowers Consulting.
 
Thus, the Court reduces the requested lodestar by
$3,210.00, and awards attorney’s fees in the reduced amount of $9,303.80. 
II.           
COSTS 
Defendant Bowers Consulting also requests $130.80 in
costs. (See Motion at p. 2.) 
Plaintiff does not oppose Defendant Bowers Consulting’s
request for $130.80 in costs, and Defendant Bowers Consulting provides evidence
showing that the requested costs are recoverable. (Segal Decl. at ¶ 14; see id.
at ¶ 11, Ex. D at p. 19.) 
Thus, the Court awards Defendant Bowers Consulting
$130.80 in costs. 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the
Motion and awards a total amount of $9,434.60.
