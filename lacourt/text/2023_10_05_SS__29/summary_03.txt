And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion for leave to take a subsequent deposition of the Plaintiff. The Defendant claims that the Plaintiff's discovery responses were vague, evasive, and not helpful in evaluating her claimed damages and residual limitations, and that a second deposition will speed up the process and minimize inconvenience to all parties. The Judge finds that the Defendant has made a showing of good cause justifying a subsequent deposition of the Plaintiff, and limits the deposition to 2.5 hours, excluding breaks, and to topics related to treatment occurring after the original deposition and facts occurring after April 7, 2022 that relate to the Plaintiff's claims for damages. The Plaintiff is ordered to appear for further deposition and answer questions on a date to be arranged by counsel within 30 days of notice of this order.
