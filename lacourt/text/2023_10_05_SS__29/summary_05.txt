Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's four motions to compel, ordering the defendant to respond to the interrogatories within 30 days. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in part, awarding $4,000 to the plaintiff. The judge finds that the defendant failed to respond timely to the interrogatories and that the responses were inadequate. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's filings were excessive and unnecessary, and awards sanctions accordingly.
