And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The plaintiff alleges that she was injured in a slip and fall at a CVS Pharmacy on May 22, 2021, due to the defendant's negligence and breach of duty of care. However, the judge finds that the allegations do not provide a basis for an award of punitive damages, as they do not involve intentional wrongdoing, oppression, fraud, or malice. The judge has granted the motion to strike without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot re-file the request for punitive damages.
