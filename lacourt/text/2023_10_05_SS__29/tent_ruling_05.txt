 Case Number:  21STCV02737    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
Plaintiff’s four
motions to compel are GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff’s requests
for sanctions are GRANTED in part.
 
Background
On January 22, 2021, Plaintiff Iuliia Platokhina
Wright (“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint in this action against Defendant
Philip Spencer Wright (“Defendant”). More than two years later, on July 28,
2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (the “FAC”).  In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges the following
causes of action: (1) battery; (2) assault; (3) false imprisonment; (4)
intrusion of privacy; (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (6)
negligence; and (7) unlawful eviction.  Defendant
filed an answer to the FAC on September 29, 2023.
The parties were previously married.  On April 2, 2019, Defendant filed a petition to
have the marriage annulled on the ground of fraud (Los Angeles Superior Court
Case No. 19STFL03890).  Plaintiff filed a
response to the petition seeking to dissolve the marriage.  The dissolution proceeding has been extraordinarily
contentious, with multiple requests for restraining orders, numerous appeals,
and an additional request for a restraining order between counsel (and a
successful appeal of that ruling). 
Judgment in the dissolution action was entered on September 20, 2021,
vacated on February 10, 2022, and a new judgment was entered on March 3, 2022
(with a nunc pro tunc date of September 20, 2021).  Pursuant to that judgment, the parties’
marriage was dissolved.  The judgment
states that the parties were married for only 18 days (from February 14 to
March 4, 2019).  The parties continue to engage
in extensive litigation of post-judgment matters in the family law case.
On September 13, 2023, Department 1 ruled that this
civil action and the family law action are not related cases within the meaning
of California Rule of Court, rule 3.300.
Numerous motions are currently pending before this
Court.  
Set for hearing on October 5 are four of these
motions: (1) Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant to respond to Special Interrogatories
(Set One); (2) Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant to respond to Form
Interrogatories (Set One); (3) Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant to
respond to Form Interrogatories (Set Two); (4) Plaintiff’s motion to compel
Defendant to respond to Form Interrogatories (Set Three).  In all four motions, Plaintiff also seeks
sanctions.
Plaintiff served all four sets of interrogatories by
email on July 31, 2023.  (Volkov Decl., ¶ 2
& Exhs. 5-8.)  As of the time of filing,
on September 5, 2023, no response had been received.  (Id., ¶ 3.)
On that same date, September 5, 2023, Defendant did serve
responses to the interrogatories by FedEx overnight delivery.  (Aisen Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. B.)  The responses consist only of
objections.   (Id., Exhs. B.)
Plaintiff filed her motions to compel on September 5,
2023.  Defendant filed oppositions on
September 21, 2023.  Plaintiff filed replies
on September 28, 2023.
Legal
Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290,
subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and
no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories,
“the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil
Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the
trial court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even
if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and] substantially
resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses … the trial court
retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important incentive for parties to
respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,”
the trial court may “deny the motion to compel responses as essentially
unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)  
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff served
the interrogatories by email on July 31, 2023. 
(Volkov Decl., ¶ 2.)  Normally,
responses are due 30 days after service. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).)  Thirty days after service was Wednesday, August 30, 2023.
 
Because the interrogatories
were served by email, Defendant, by statute, had two additional court days to
respond to the interrogatories.  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 1010.6., subd. (a)(3)(B).)  That
means that the responses were due on Friday, September 1, 2023.
 
Defendant did not
serve his responses on September 1. 
Instead, he served them one court day later, on Tuesday, September 5,
2023.  (Aisen Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs.
B.)  (Monday, September 4, was a court
holiday.)
 
The consequences
for failing to serve a timely response to interrogatories are set forth in Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290: the responding party waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a); see also Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Super. Ct. (2015) 242
Cal.App.4th 1116, 1125 [discussing requests for production].)  There is no exception in the statute, even
when responses are served only one court day late (as Defendant may contend).  The Court may grant relief from the waiver of
objections, but the responding party must seek such relief by motion and must
make the showing required by statute.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Defendant
did serve untimely responses, but those responses consisted entirely of
objections that have been waived by operation of law.  That is tantamount to no response at all.  The other arguments in the Opposition
(including that a meet and confer and a separate statement are required) are
simply incorrect.  Accordingly, the Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s motions to compel. 
 
As to sanctions, the
Legislature has directed that the Court “shall” award sanctions unless
the Court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c).)
As to the amount
of sanctions, however, the Court must limit the sanction to the amount of
“reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of [the sanctionable] conduct.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $10,000, but that
is far beyond what is reasonable.
 
A motion to compel
initial responses to discovery is a simple motion.  All that needs to be shown is that the
interrogatories were properly served and no response was received within the
statutory time period.  Plaintiff’s
filings (including a 99-paragraph declaration) far exceed what is reasonable
and necessary for Plaintiff’s motion. 
(The Court also notes that where, as here, a party is filing multiple,
parallel discovery motions, the work required can be divided among the motions.)
 
Discovery sanctions are not intended “to provide
a weapon for punishment” but rather to “prevent abuse of the discovery process
and correct the problems presented.” (Parker
v. Wolters Kluwer U.S., Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 285.)  Sanctions should be no greater than what is necessary
to accomplish the purposes of the Civil Discovery Act. (Newland v. Superior Court (1995)
40 Cal.App.4th 608.)
Accordingly, the
Court awards sanctions for each motion in the amount of $1,000, calculated as 2.0
hours of reasonable attorney time for this each, multiplied by counsel’s
reasonable billing rate of $500 per hour.
 
Plaintiff’s
request for a multiplier is unsupported by facts or law and is denied.
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s four motions to compel.
 
Defendant is
ORDERED to serve, within 30 days of notice of this order, code-compliant
written responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories (Set One), Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Form Interrogatories (Set Two), and Form
Interrogatories (Set Three).
 
The Court GRANTS
in part Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
Defendant and counsel of record the Law Office of Jacquelynn L. Hansen,
APC are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff
under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $4,000 ($1,000 for each motion,
multiplied by four motions) within 30 days of notice of this order.
 
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
