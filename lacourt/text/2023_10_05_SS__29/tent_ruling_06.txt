 Case Number:  21STCV09505    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
Defendant’s motion
is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
 
Background
 
On March 10, 2021, Plaintiff Ramona Simpson (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendant 
Michael Cross (“Defendant”) stemming from a traffic
collision that occurred on April 7, 2019. 
 
On February 16, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer to the
action.
 
On February 22, 2023, March 2, 2023, and March 9, 2023,
Defendant’s assistant, Ty Davis 
emailed Plaintiff’s counsel to arrange a date for
Plaintiff’s deposition. Plaintiff’s counsel did not 
reply to Davis’s meet and confer efforts. (Maxwell Decl.
Ex. A.)
 
On April 5, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with a Notice
of Taking Deposition and to Produce 
Documents, which was scheduled for May 17, 2023. (Maxwell,
Decl. Ex. B.)
 
On May 3, 2023, the parties orally agreed to settle the
matter. (Maxwell Decl. ¶ 4.)
 
On May 4, 2023, Defendant’s counsel emailed Plaintiff’s
counsel regarding the settlement agreement and attached the settlement release
for Plaintiff’s review and signature. (Maxwell 
Decl. Ex. C.) Plaintiff has never returned the signed
settlement agreement and release. (Maxwell 
Decl., ¶ 6.)
 
On June 29, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with a second
Notice of Taking Deposition and to 
Produce Documents, which was set for July 19, 2023, at
10:00 a.m. at Defendant’s counsel’s 
office. (Maxwell Decl. Ex. D.) Plaintiff did not serve
Defendant with an objection to the 
deposition before July 19, 2023.
 
Defendant’s counsel and the court reporter appeared for
Plaintiff’s deposition on July 19, 2023, 
at 10:00 a.m. Around 10:50 a.m., neither Plaintiff or
Plaintiff’s counsel appeared for the 
deposition. (Maxwell Decl. Ex. E.)
 
Defendant has incurred costs for the court reporter in the
amount of $572.30. (Maxwell Decl. Ex 
F.) 
 
On August 3, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel
deposition of Plaintiff and requested 
sanctions. No opposition was filed.
 
This matter came on
for hearing on September 8, 2023.  Defendant
had not submitted evidence showing compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.450, subdivision (b); after hearing argument, the Court continued
the hearing to October 5 to give Defendant the opportunity to remedy that
defect.
 
Defendant has not filed any further papers since September
8.
 
Legal Standard
 
Any party may obtain discovery... by taking the oral
deposition of any person, including any 
party to the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)
 
Where a party objects to the deposition, the proper remedy
is an objection under Code of Civil 
Procedure section 2025.410. If such an objection is made
within three calendar days before the 
deposition date, the objecting party must make personal
service of that objection. (Code Civ. 
Proc. 2025.410, subd. (b).)
 
CCP section 2025.450(a) provides: “If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the 
action..., without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for 
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for
inspection any document... described in the 
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for
an order compelling the deponent’s 
attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection
of any document... described in the 
deposition
notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
 
CCP section 2025.450(b) provides: “A motion under
subdivision (a)… shall be accompanied by 
a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or,
when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in 
the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to 
inquire about the nonappearance.” (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (b).)
 
Discussion
 
On June 29, 2023, Defendant served
Plaintiff with a second notice of taking Plaintiff’s 
deposition set for July 19, 2023 at 10:00
a.m. (Maxwell Decl., Ex. D.) However, on July 19, 
2023, Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel did
not appear at the deposition and Defendant’s counsel 
obtained a certificate of nonappearance.
(Maxwell Decl. Ex. E.)
 
Plaintiff was properly served with the
deposition notice, failed to object, and failed to appear for 
deposition. Defendant has still not,
however, submitted a declaration that complies with Code of 
Civil Procedure section 2025.450,
subdivision (b). There is no indication in the declaration 
submitted in support of the motion that
Defendant’s counsel “contacted the deponent [or, in this 
case, deponent’s counsel] to inquire about
the nonappearance.”  The Defendant has
failed to file any supplemental documentation to correct these issues.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED without
prejudice.
 
Conclusion
 
Accordingly, the Defendant’s Motion to
Compel the Deposition of the Plaintiff is DENIED without prejudice.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
