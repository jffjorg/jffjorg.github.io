  Case Number:  20STCV38569    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  28 On  October 7, 2020, Plaintiff Janice Michelle Supe (“Plaintiff”) filed this action  against Defendants City of Los Angeles (“City”), County of Los Angeles  (“County”), and Does 1-50 for general negligence and premises liability.  On  May 6, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against the City, the  County, and Does 1-50 for premises liability.  On  June 10, 2022, the City filed an answer and a cross-complaint against  Cross-Defendants Roes 1-10 for indemnification, apportionment of fault, and  declaratory relief.  On  August 10, 2022, the Court dismissed the County without prejudice at  Plaintiff’s request.  On  June 27, 2023, the City amended its cross-complaint to include Cross-Defendant  Montshire, LLC as Roe 1 (“Montshire”). On December 15, 2023, Montshire filed an  answer to the cross-complaint.  On  May 8, 2024, the Court (1) granted Montshire’s motion to compel responses to  its request for production of documents, set one, and ordered Plaintiff to provide  verified code-compliant responses without objections and to produce the  documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested  without objections by June 7, 2024, (2) granted Montshire’s motion to compel  responses to its special interrogatories, set one, and ordered Plaintiff to  provide verified code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories  without objections by June 7, 2024, and (3) granted Montshire’s motion to  compel responses to its form interrogatories, set one, and ordered Plaintiff to  provide verified code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without  objections by June 7, 2024.  In addition,  the Court stated:  “Cross-Defendant Montshire, LLC should have filed  three separate motions, one for each type of discovery at issue. The Court  therefore orders Cross-Defendant Montshire, LLC to pay the Court $120.00,  representing two additional filing fees, by June 7, 2024.” On August 27, 2024, Montshire filed another  motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to request for production of documents,  set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set  one.  Even though the Court had informed  Montshire on May 8, 2024 that a separate motion was required for each type of  discovery, Montshire filed only one motion.   The Court therefore denies the motion without prejudice. Moving party is to give notice of the Court’s ruling. Moving party is to file proof of service of the Court’s ruling within five days.
