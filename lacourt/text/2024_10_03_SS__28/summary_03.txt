```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motions, oppositions, and replies filed by the parties and has ruled that the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to appear, testify, and produce documents at a deposition is granted. The plaintiff has been deemed incompetent due to Alzheimer's, but the judge finds that the plaintiff's evidence does not show that he is unable to express himself or understand his duty as a witness. Therefore, the plaintiff's objection based on incompetence is not valid. The court orders the plaintiff to attend a deposition by November 4, 2024.
