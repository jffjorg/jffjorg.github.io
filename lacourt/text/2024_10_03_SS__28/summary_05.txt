And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Mason Perez's claims without prejudice. The petition was filed by Petitioner Veronica Perez on September 4, 2024, seeking approval of the compromise. The judge noted that the petition contains inaccuracies regarding the reduction of medical expenses, which makes it impossible to determine whether all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. The judge ordered Petitioner to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
