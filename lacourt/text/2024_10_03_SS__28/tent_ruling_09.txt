 Case Number:  23STCV29158    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving and late opposition reply papers, the Court rules as  follows.   BACKGROUND  On  November 29, 2023, Plaintiffs Laviyon Myers (“Laviyon Myers”) and Sheryl Myers  (“Sheryl Myers”), as individuals and as successors-in-interest of The Estate of  Dennis Myers, Deceased, filed this action against Defendants Chase Talape  Tacanay (“Tacanay”), 7- Eleven, Inc. (“7- Eleven”), and Does 1-25 for wrongful  death (assault and battery), wrongful death (negligent hiring, training, and  retention), and survival action (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.60).  On  March 6, 2024, Tacanay filed an answer.  On  April 16, 2024, the Court granted the parties’ stipulated request (1) to strike  without prejudice the prayer for punitive and exemplary damages against  7-Eleven contained in the complaint's prayer for relief number 4 and (2) to  strike the prayer for attorney fees against all defendants in paragraphs 23 and  32 of the complaint.  On  May 28, 2024, 7-Eleven filed an answer.  On  August 13, 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendant La Brea  37227 Inc as Doe 1.  On  September 4, 2024, 7-Eleven filed (1) a motion to  compel the responses of Laviyon Myers and Sheryl Myers to requests for production  of documents, set one, and for sanctions, (2) a motion to compel the responses of Laviyon Myers and Sheryl Myers to special  interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions, and (3) a motion to compel the  responses of Laviyon Myers and Sheryl Myers to requests for admission, set one,  and for sanctions.  The motions were set  for hearing on October 3, 2024. On September 30, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a  late declaration opposing the motions.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  7-Eleven  asks the Court to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to requests for production of  documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and requests for admission, set one.  7-Eleven also asks  the Court to impose sanctions.  Plaintiffs  ask the Court to deny the motions.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Inspection demand            Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides:          “If a party to whom a demand for  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely  response to it, the following rules shall apply:  “(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,  copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under  Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve  that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,  2031.240, and 2031.280.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party making the demand may move for an order  compelling response to the demand.  “(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling  a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the  imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in  addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent  exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or  any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored  information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of  the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system.  “(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter  any obligation to preserve discoverable information.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.)  B.   Interrogatories            Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:          “If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails  to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are  directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under  Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including  one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4  (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that  party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and  2030.240.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may  move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling  answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition  of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.290.)            C.  Requests for  admission  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides:  “If a party to whom requests for admission are  directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are  directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege  or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section  2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its  determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The requesting party may move  for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters  specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds  that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has  served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests  for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is  mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to  serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)  DISCUSSION  On June 3, 2024, 7-Eleven served requests for  production of documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and requests  for admission, set one, on Plaintiffs.  7-Eleven contends that Plaintiffs did not serve timely  responses and had not served "any responses" by the time 7-Eleven filed these motions.  (Motions p. 2.)  7-Eleven asks the Court to compel Plaintiffs’  responses to the requests for production of documents, special interrogatories,  and requests for admission.  In his opposing declaration, Plaintiffs’ counsel  asserts: (1) Plaintiffs’ counsel learned “on or about August 2024” that Sheryl  Myers had passed away (Ogbogu dec.¶ 2), (2) Sheryl Myers passed away while  7-Eleven’s discovery requests were “pending” (Ogbogu dec. ¶ 3), (3) Plaintiffs’  counsel informed 7-Eleven’s counsel of Sheryl Myers’ death (Ogbogu dec. ¶ 5),  and (4) on August 8, 2024 – before 7-Eleven filed the motions to compel –  Plaintiffs’ counsel served Laviyon Myers’ verified responses to the requests for production of documents, special  interrogatories, and requests for admission. (Ogbogu dec. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff’s  counsel has attached a copy of Laviyon Myers’ verified responses to the  requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and requests for  admission to his declaration.  Plaintiffs’ counsel also states that he is “currently  waiting to receive the certified copy of [Sheryl Myers’] death certificate  before filing a motion for a successor plaintiff under CCP section 377.30, et  seq.” (Ogbogu dec. ¶ 11.)  7-Eleven has not filed a reply disputing Plaintiffs’  counsel’s contention that he served Laviyon Myers’ verified responses to the requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and requests for  admission before 7-Eleven filed its motions to compel.  On October 2, 2024, at the hearing on 7-Eleven’s  motion to compel Plaintiff’s’ responses to form interrogatories, 7-Eleven’s  counsel acknowledged that Plaintiffs’ counsel served Plaintiff Laviyon Myers’ discovery responses  on one of 7-Eleven’s attorneys before 7-Eleven filed its motions to  compel.  The concession contradicts the assertion in 7-Eleven's motions that, when 7-Eleven filed its motions, it had not received "any responses" to its discovery requests.  (Motions p. 2.)  7-Eleven’s counsel appeared to  contend that the service was ineffective because Plaintiffs’ counsel did not  also serve the other individuals at the same law firm who are assigned to  7-Eleven’s case.  7-Eleven’s counsel  could cite no authority to support his contention that the failure to serve these  other individuals at the same law firm rendered the service ineffective.  The Court denies 7-Eleven’s motion to compel  Plaintiffs’ responses to requests for admission because Code of Civil Procedure  section 2033.280 does not authorize such a motion.  Likewise, Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290,  which 7-Eleven cites in its motion, does not authorize a motion to compel  responses to requests for admission.  The Court denies 7-Eleven’s motions to compel Plaintiffs’  responses requests for production of documents and special interrogatories as  moot.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES Defendant 7- Eleven, Inc.’s motion to compel the responses of  Plaintiffs Laviyon Myers and Sheryl Myers to requests for admission, set one,  and for sanctions.  The  Court DENIES Defendant 7- Eleven, Inc.’s motion to compel the responses of  Plaintiffs Laviyon Myers and Sheryl Myers to requests for production of  documents, set one, and for sanctions.  The  Court DENIES Defendant 7- Eleven, Inc.’s motion to compel the responses of  Plaintiffs Laviyon Myers and Sheryl Myers to special interrogatories, set one,  and for sanctions.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
