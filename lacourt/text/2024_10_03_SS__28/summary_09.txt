And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ruling on the motions to compel responses to discovery requests filed by 7-Eleven, Inc. against the plaintiffs, Laviyon Myers and Sheryl Myers. The plaintiffs had filed a wrongful death action against the defendants, and 7-Eleven had served discovery requests on the plaintiffs. However, the plaintiffs' counsel had not served responses to these requests in a timely manner. 7-Eleven filed motions to compel the responses, and the plaintiffs filed a late opposition reply paper.

The judge notes that 7-Eleven's counsel conceded during the hearing that the plaintiffs' counsel had served Laviyon Myers' verified responses to the discovery requests before 7-Eleven filed its motions. The judge finds that the failure to serve the other individuals at the same law firm who are assigned to 7-Eleven's case does not render the service ineffective.

The judge denies 7-Eleven's motions to compel the responses to requests for admission and special interrogatories, finding that these motions are moot. The judge also denies 7-Eleven's motion to compel the responses to requests for production of documents, finding that the plaintiffs' counsel had served the verified responses before 7-Eleven filed its motions.
