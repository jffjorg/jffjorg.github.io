PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Metro
asks the Court to compel Plaintiff’s responses to requests for production and
for sanctions.  
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
        “If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
DISCUSSION
On March 8, 2024, Metro served requests for production
on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not serve
timely responses and had not served responses by the time Metro filed the
motion to compel.  
The Court grants Metro's motion
and orders Plaintiff to serve verified code-compliant responses to the requests
for production without objections and to produce the documents, electronically
stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by November
4, 2024. 
Plaintiff requests $1,250.00 in sanctions.  Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, the
Court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling unless the Court finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
Plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to compel
responses to Metro’s requests for production.  Therefore, sanctions are not available under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300. 
Other statutes addressing misuse of the discovery
process do not, by themselves, authorize a sanctions award for these
motions.  In City of Los Angeles v.
Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (Aug. 23, 2024) __ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042,
2024 DJDAR 8056, slip opn. pp. 1-42] (PwC), the Supreme Court held: “It
is already well-established that a court may not rely on [Code of Civil
Procedure] section 2023.030 to override the limitations prescribed by any other
applicable sanctions provision in the Act.  A court may invoke its independent
authority to impose sanctions under sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 only when
confronted with an unusual form of discovery abuse, or a pattern of abuse, not
already addressed by a relevant sanctions provision.  And where it invokes that
authority, it is constrained by the long-settled rules generally governing the
imposition of discovery sanctions under the Act.”  (PwC, supra, __ Cal.5th __
[2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066, slip opn. at p. 40].) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision
(c), limits the Court’s authority to impose sanctions when (as here) the
non-moving party does not oppose a successful motion to compel responses to requests
for production.  Because the statute
addresses the issue, the Court may not invoke its independent authority to
impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and
2023.030.  (See PwC, supra,
__ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066, slip opn. at p.
40].) 
The Court denies Metro’s sanctions request. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s
motion to compel Plaintiff Michann Denise Meadows’ responses to requests for
production. The Court orders Plaintiff Michann
Denise Meadows to serve verified code-compliant responses to the requests for
production without objections and to produce the documents, electronically
stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by
November 4, 2024. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s request for sanctions. 
Moving
party is to give notice of the Court’s ruling. 
Moving
party is to file proof of service of the Court’s ruling within five days.
