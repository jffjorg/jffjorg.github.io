 Case Number:  22STCV27823    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  28           Having considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules  as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  August 26, 2022, Plaintiffs Victor Manuel Perez, Veronica Esther Perez, Mason  Manuel Perez, a minor by and through his guardian ad litem Veronica Esther  Perez, and Jaxon Andy Perez, a minor by and through his guardian ad litem  Veronica Esther Perez, filed this action against Defendants Andrea Michelle  Sidman and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence.  On  February 1, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement.  On September  4, 2024, Petitioner Veronica Perez (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to approve  the compromise of minor Plaintiff Mason Perez’s claims.  PETITIONER’S REQUEST  Petitioner  asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff  Mason Perez.  DISCUSSION  The  new petition, like the previous petitions (filed May 2, 2024 and June 28, 2024),  contains the following information about the proposed settlement:  Gross  settlement amount:                                                  $8,000.00 Total  medical expenses:                                                     $25,588.36 Reductions:                                                                        $20,198.00 Payment/reimbursement  from proceeds:                            $2,941.49 Attorney’s  fees:                                                                 $2,000.00 Non-medical  costs:                                                            $273.50 Net  balance:                                                                       $2,785.01  As  the Court noted in its June 14 and July 31, 2024 orders, Section 12a(1) of the  petition states that total medical expenses were $25,588.36. Section 12a(3) of  the petition states that this amount was reduced by $20,198.00 as the result of  negotiated, contractual, and statutory reductions. This should mean that the  remaining $5,390.36 will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section 12a(4) of the petition states that only $2,941.49 of the  medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. As a  result, $2,448.87 of the medical expenses are unaccounted for.  In a  declaration supporting the new petition, Plaintiff’s counsel states that two of  Plaintiff’s medical providers (American Medical  Response/AMR and CEP America California) accepted payments from Medi-Cal and  then reduced their remaining claims for payment to zero.  However, this additional reduction information  is not reflected in Section 12a(3) of the petition.   Instead,  Section 12a(3) appears to reflect only the reduction of $20,198.00 in medical  expenses made by St. Mary’s Medical Center.   Section 12a(3) does not appear to include the reduction in Medi-Cal  charges (from $659.96 to $494.94).  Section  12a(3) also does not include reductions that American Medical Response/AMR and CEP America California made to the  amounts they charged.  Without an accurate reduction figure, the Court cannot determine whether the petition shows that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. The Court can calculate the reduction amount for the Medi-Cal charges.  However, the Court cannot calculate the reduction figures for American Medical Response/AMR and CEP America California.  While  Petitioner has provided some paperwork to demonstrate that American Medical Response/AMR and CEP America  California reduced the amounts they were charging, Petitioner has not provided  information that allows the Court to determine the amount of these reductions.  According to  Petitioner, Medi-Cal paid some of the medical expenses and some of the medical  expenses were reduced, but Petitioner has not specified the amounts which  Medi-Cal paid each provider or the amounts by which each provider reduced the medical expenses.    As  noted, the Court cannot approve a petition unless it shows that all medical  expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from  the settlement proceeds.  The  Court denies the petition without prejudice.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor  Plaintiff Mason Manuel Perez’s action filed by Petitioner Veronica Esther Perez  on September 4, 2024.  Petitioner  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Petitioner  is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within  five days.
