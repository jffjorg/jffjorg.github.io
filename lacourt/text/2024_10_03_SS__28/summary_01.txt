And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on Montshire's motion to compel responses from the plaintiff. The motion was filed again, despite the court's previous order that Montshire should have filed separate motions for each type of discovery. The court denies the motion without prejudice and orders Montshire to pay a $120 court fee for filing only one motion. The court previously granted Montshire's motion to compel responses and ordered the plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to Montshire's requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories.
