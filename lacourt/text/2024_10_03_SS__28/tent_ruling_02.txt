PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Uber

LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored

 “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. . . .” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g)(1).) 
DISCUSSION 
On
July 10, 2024, Uber noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for August 14, 2024.  Plaintiff did not serve objections or advise
Uber that he would not appear.  Plaintiff
did not appear at the noticed deposition. 
On August 22, 2024, Uber’s counsel contacted Plaintiff’s counsel about
the non-appearance but did not receive a response. 
The
Court grants Uber’s motion and orders Plaintiff to appear for a deposition by
November 4, 2024. 
Uber
asks the Court to award $1,800.00 in sanctions based on 5.25 hours of
attorney time at a rate of $300.00 per hour and .5 hours of attorney time at a
rate of $575.00 per hour.  The attorney
whose billing rate is $300.00 per hour spent 4 hours to prepare the moving
papers and .25 hours to meet and confer and anticipated spending one hour to
attend the hearing.  The attorney whose
billing rate is $575.00 per hour spent .5 hours reviewing the motion. 
The
Court grants $750.00 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney time at a reasonable
rate of $250.00 per hour.

attend his deposition by November 4, 2024.
