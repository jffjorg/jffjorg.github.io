And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The case involves multiple related actions filed by different plaintiffs against the same defendants. The case was consolidated, and a motion was filed by Arcia for relief from potential jury trial waiver due to an inadvertent failure to post jury fees. The court finds that granting Arcia relief from waiver of jury trial will not prejudice the other parties and exercises its discretion to grant the motion. The court grants Arcia's motion for relief from jury trial waiver and orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling within five days.
