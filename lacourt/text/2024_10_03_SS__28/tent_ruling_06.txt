On August 30, 2022, Plaintiffs Irmeh Manouki-Massihi,

of Commerce (“City”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), Southern California

emotional distress, survival action, and “California SB 447.” 
On October 11, 2022, Defendant Southern California

filed an answer and a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Kafil Construction
(“Kafil Construction”), Bruce Johan Kafil, an individual, doing business as Kafil

cross-complaint to include Cross-Defendant City as Roe 1.  On February 6, 2024, the City filed an answer
to the cross-complaint. 
On October 12, 2022, Plaintiffs amended the complaint
to include Defendants Kafil Construction as Doe 1, Bruce Kafil as Doe 2, and
Lotus as Doe 3. 
Also on October 12, 2022, the City and County filed answers
to Plaintiffs’ complaint.  On January 5, 2024,
the Court dismissed the County without prejudice at Plaintiffs’ request. 
On June 9, 2023, Kafil

and filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Edison and Does 51-60 for

On November 21, 2023, the City filed a cross-complaint
against Cross-Defendants Edison, Kafil Construction, Bruce Kafil, Lotus, and

filed an answer to the cross-complaint. 
On December 28, 2023, Kafil Construction, Bruce Kafil, and Lotus filed
an answer to the cross-complaint. 
On November 29, 2023, the Court read and considered Edison’s
Notice of Related Case filed on November 28, 2023 and found that case numbers
22STCV28302 and 23STLC03340 are not related within the meaning of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). 
On June 13, 2024, the Court read and
considered Edison’s Notice of Related Case filed on June 11, 2024, which asked
the Court to relate case numbers 22STCV28302, 23STLC03340, and
23STCV22007.  The Court issued a minute
order stating that case numbers 22STCV28302 and
23STLC03340 are not related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300(a). 
On July 30, 2024, Edison filed a motion to have case numbers 22STCV28302, 23STLC03340, and 23STCV22007 related or, in the alternative, for reconsideration of the Court’s June
13, 2024 minute order.  The motion was
set for hearing on August 27, 2024.  On
August 14, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition.  On August 20, 2024, Edison filed a
reply.  The Court continued the hearing
to October 3, 2024. 
On September 11, 2024, the Court denied Edison’s ex
parte application to relate case numbers 22STCV28302, 23STLC03340, and
23STCV22007. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Edison asks the Court to relate case numbers
22STCV28302, 23STLC03340, and 23STCV22007 or, in the alternative, to reconsider
the Court’s June 13, 2024 order. 
Plaintiffs ask the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Los Angeles
Superior Court local rule 3.3(f)(3) provides: 
“In the event that the judge designated under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A)(B)(C) to make the decision, does
not order related any of the cases set forth in the Notice of Related Cases,
any party may file a motion to have the cases related.  Department 1 shall hear
the motion, if the cases are all pending in the Central District . . . .” 
(Los Angeles
Superior Court Local Rule 3.3(f)(3); see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(D)
[“In the event that any of the cases listed in the notice are not ordered
related under (A), (B), or (C), any party in any of the cases listed in the
notice may file a motion to have the cases related. The motion must be filed
with the presiding judge or the judge designated by the presiding judge”].) 
DISCUSSION 
On June 11,
2024, Edison filed a notice of related case asking the Court to relate case
numbers 22STCV28302, 23STLC03340, and 23STCV22007.  On June 13, 2024, the Court denied the
request.  (The Court assumes the omission of case number 23STCV22007 in the June 13, 2024 minute order was inadvertent and the Court
intended to deny Edison’s request to relate all three cases.) 
The three
cases are pending in the Central District of the Los Angeles County Superior
Court.  Case number 22STCV28302 is an
unlimited civil case previously assigned to Department 31 of the Spring Street
Courthouse and now assigned to Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  Case number 23STLC03340 is a limited civil case
assigned to Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  Case number 23STCV22007 is an unlimited civil
case assigned to Department 27 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
After Department
31 declined to relate the three cases on June 13, 2024, Los Angeles Superior
Court Local Rule 3.3(f)(3) permitted Edison to file a motion in Department 1 to
have the cases related.  Instead,
however, Edison filed a motion in Department 28.  The Court denies the motion without prejudice
to Edison filing a motion under Local
Rule 3.3(f)(3) in Department 1. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Defendant Southern California Edison
Company’s motion to relate case numbers 22STCV28302, 23STLC03340, and 23STCV22007 or, in the alternative, for reconsideration of the Court's June 13, 2024 minute order.  The denial is without prejudice
to
Edison filing a motion in Department 1 under Local Rule 3.3(f)(3). 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving party is ordered to file the proof of service
of this ruling with the Court within five days.
