And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Michann Denise Meadows, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro), and others. The defendant Metro filed an answer and a cross-complaint against the cross-defendants. The court has previously dismissed the State of California, the City of Los Angeles, and John Doe from the lawsuit.

Metro filed a motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to requests for production and for sanctions. The plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to the requests for production. The court grants Metro's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to the requests for production and orders the plaintiff to serve verified code-compliant responses to the requests for production without objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by November 4, 2024.

The plaintiff requested $1,250.00 in sanctions, but the court denies Metro's request for sanctions because the court is limited by Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 and cannot impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030. The court finds that the plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to Metro's requests for production, and therefore, sanctions are not available under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300.
