And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Edward B. Moreton, Jr., has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses filed by Plaintiff Leticia Yvetta Dukes-Thomas. The motion was in response to Defendant Midtown Plumbing, Inc.'s failure to provide further responses to a second set of requests for production of documents. However, the Defendant failed to file a joint statement as required by the court's rules, which are necessary for the Court to consider the motion. As a result, the Judge has denied the motion without prejudice, meaning the Plaintiff can refile the motion if the Defendant fails to comply with the court's rules.
