This hearing is on Plaintiff Leticia
Dukes-Thomas’ motion to compel Defendant Midtown Plumbing’s further responses
to Plaintiff’s second set of request for production of documents.  
On a
motion to compel further responses, this Department’s rules require the moving
party to file a joint statement consisting of four columns: the first column will
identify the number of the discovery request; the second, the text of the
discovery request; the third, the text of the response, and the fourth, brief
bullet-point statements, one from each party as to why a further response should
or should not be compelled.  No joint
statement was filed. 
            Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff’s motion to
compel further responses.  
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
