**Significant Statements**

* "The mutual waiver of consequential damages in Section 15.1.6 clearly bars Paseo from recovering its claimed consequential damages from 'lost opportunities to refinance or sell the property' because the waiver specifically identifies 'losses of use, income, profit, [and] financing'."
* "Paseo's reliance on the indemnity provisions of the Prime Contract is unpersuasive because there is no language indicating that they were intended to cover direct claims between Paseo and Penick, in addition to third-party claims."
* "The Court disagrees with Paseo's claim that its consequential damages flow from any tort liability, as the recordation of a mechanics lien is protected by the litigation privilege and the lien ultimately arises from a contractual dispute between the parties."
