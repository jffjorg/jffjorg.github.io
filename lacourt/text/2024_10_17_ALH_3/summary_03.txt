And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the City of Pasadena's motion to dismiss the action filed by Gerardo Martinez, Jr. and Leila Martinez and to impose $960 in sanctions. The motion was filed after the plaintiffs failed to comply with a court order to serve responses to discovery and pay sanctions within 20 days. The judge notes that there is no notice of ruling on file and that the plaintiffs did not appear at the hearing on June 27, 2024, so the court cannot conclude that the plaintiffs were aware of the court's order and willfully failed to comply with their discovery obligations. Therefore, the judge has denied the motion for terminating sanctions without prejudice.
