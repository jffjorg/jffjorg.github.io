The judge has denied the defendant's request to reduce the time spent on routine communications and has reduced the time spent on ministerial and clerical tasks by $168.

The judge has also awarded $2,866.50 for the briefing related to this motion, which includes the time spent by the plaintiffs' counsel reviewing the defendant's opposition brief, preparing the reply brief, and attending the hearing. The total amount awarded is $50,044.50.
