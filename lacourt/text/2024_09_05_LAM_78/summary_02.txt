And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a foreclosure action by U.S. Bank Trust National Association against Lilia Euyoque Galvan. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the third amended complaint without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff's claims are invalid and cannot proceed. The judge has also found that the plaintiff lacks standing to challenge the assignments of the mortgage. Additionally, the judge has determined that the plaintiff's allegations of irregularities in the sale procedure are voidable, not void, and therefore, the plaintiff is not excused from the tender rule.

The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action, which is a claim for fraud by deceit. The judge has found that the plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to maintain this cause of action.

The judge has also found that the plaintiff's claim for quiet title is derivative of the foreclosure and related claims, and since these claims are not viable, neither is the claim for quiet title.

Finally, the judge has found that the plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief is also derivative of the foreclosure and related claims, and since these claims are not viable, neither is the claim for declaratory relief.
