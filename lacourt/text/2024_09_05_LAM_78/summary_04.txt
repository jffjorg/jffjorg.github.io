Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to tax costs filed by the defendants. The court has reviewed the costs claimed by the plaintiff and has found that certain costs are not recoverable. The court has granted the motion to tax costs in part and has reduced the total amount of costs awarded to the plaintiff to $49,925.95.

The court has found that the deposition costs claimed by the plaintiff are excessive and has reduced the amount awarded to $28,244.15. The court has also found that the court reporter fees claimed by the plaintiff are excessive and has reduced the amount awarded to $2,714.85. The court has further found that the costs for models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits claimed by the plaintiff are excessive and has reduced the amount awarded to $11,383.77. Finally, the court has found that the costs claimed by the plaintiff for other expenses are not recoverable and has taxed those costs in their entirety.

The court has also held that the plaintiff cannot recover costs for a discovery referee and mediation, as these costs were incurred in violation of a prior court order.
