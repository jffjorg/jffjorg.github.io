Significant Statements:

  - "Discovery sanctions must be tailored in order to remedy the offending party's discovery abuse, should not give the aggrieved party more than what it is entitled to, and should not be used to punish the offending party."
  - "Although the court has discretion in choosing a sanction, this discretion must be exercised in a manner consistent with the basic purposes of such sanctions, e.g., to compel disclosure of discoverable information."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for terminating sanctions filed by Encino Newcastle Homeowner's Association (Encino) against Del Sol Property Management, Inc. and others. Encino alleged that Del Sol destroyed evidence and failed to preserve records, which is a violation of discovery rules. The judge found that there was insufficient evidence to show that Del Sol intentionally destroyed evidence or was on notice that it needed to preserve records for future litigation. The judge also found that Encino had not provided sufficient evidence to show that Del Sol had a history of abuse or that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance. Therefore, the judge denied the motion for terminating sanctions and also declined to award monetary sanctions to either party.
