And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of PMQ of GM. The deposition is ordered to take place as scheduled on October 28, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. via Zoom or as agreed to in writing between counsel. The motion to compel production of documents at the deposition is denied due to the failure to provide a Separate Statement as required by CRC 3.1345. The judge also denied the motion for monetary sanctions, as the motion did not specify the statute under which the sanctions should be awarded and did not state against whom the sanctions should be awarded. The judge noted that a motion for sanctions should typically include this information.
