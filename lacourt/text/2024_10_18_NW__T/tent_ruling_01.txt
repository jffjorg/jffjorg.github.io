  Case Number:  23VECV04138    Hearing Date:   October 18, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV04138
Schachter v GM
 
Tentative
ruling: Motion to compel deposition of PMQ of GM.  Grant in part. Deny in part.
 
The
court notes that no opposition was filed. 
 
The
deposition of the PMQ is ordered to take place as noticed on 10/28/24 at 9:30
a.m. by Zoom or as may be agreed to IN WRITING, between counsel.  Failure to comply may result in terminating
sanctions against GM.  
 
The
motion to compel production of documents at the deposition is denied for
failure to provide a Separate Statement as required by CRC  3.1345. 

 
Monetary
sanctions are denied.  No mention is made
anywhere in the papers against whom the sanctions should be awarded.  The motion also fails to state the statute
under which the sanctions should be awarded. 
Accordingly, a motion for sanctions should state, ordinarily in the
notice of motion: 1. Against whom the sanctions are requested. 2. The amount of
the sanctions. 3. The statute under which the sanctions are awarded.  In the absence of 1 and 3, the motion is
denied.  
 
It
is so ordered. Clerk to give notice.
