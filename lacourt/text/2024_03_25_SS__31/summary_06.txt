The defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has moved to consolidate two cases, 22STCV33792 and 22STCV37815, which arise from the same automobile accident. The court has deemed the two cases related and pending in the same department. However, the motion is denied without prejudice because the notice of motion was not filed in one of the cases, as required by California Rules of Court. The defendant will be allowed to refile the motion after complying with all Rules of Court. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement. Unless all parties submit to the tentative ruling, they should appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
