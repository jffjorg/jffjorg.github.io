Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim in a case between Mario Fernando Velasquez and Virgie Robrigado Binasahan. Defendant Virgie has moved to compel Plaintiff Velasquez to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and a demand for inspection and production of documents. The requests were properly served on August 2, 2023, but Plaintiff Velasquez has failed to respond. The court grants Defendant Virgie's unopposed motions and orders Plaintiff Velasquez to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days.

The court also awards sanctions to Defendant Virgie in the amount of $565.17, which includes fees for preparing and filing the motions to compel, as well as costs. The court finds that Plaintiff Velasquez and his attorney are responsible for the sanctions and orders them to pay the amount within 20 days. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if they do not, they should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
