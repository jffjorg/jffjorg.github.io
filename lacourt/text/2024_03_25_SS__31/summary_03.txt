The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Jonathan Presto's unopposed motion to compel discovery responses from Plaintiff Estelle Grimes a minor, represented by her guardian ad litem Emily Robinson. Defendant propounded form interrogatories on September 15, 2023, and responses were due on October 17, 2023. Although Plaintiff Grimes failed to serve responses, Defendant sent correspondence requesting responses.

The court also awards Defendant $760 in monetary sanctions, $350 in attorney's fees, and $60 in motion filing fee as costs. The court orders Plaintiff Grimes and her attorney to pay sanctions to Defendant within 20 days. The ruling is subject to change if the parties do not submit or appear at the hearing.
