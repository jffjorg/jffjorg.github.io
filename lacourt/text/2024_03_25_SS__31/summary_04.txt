And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The complaint was dismissed due to the plaintiff's counsel's mistake in calendaring, which resulted in the failure to file proof of service on the defendants. The court finds that the plaintiff has made a timely filing of the motion and that the dismissal was caused by the counsel's mistake. As such, the motion to set aside the dismissal is granted, and the action is reinstated.

However, the court notes that there is no proof of service on the defendants 360 Global Management, Urban Treez, and Herbal Solutions, LLC (Doe 1) to date, and sets an Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal for Failure to File Proofs of Service. The plaintiff's counsel is required to appear at the hearing and provide evidence showing that the defendants have been served with the summons and complaint or why such service has not occurred. If the plaintiff fails to appear and file proper proof of service, the action may be dismissed.
