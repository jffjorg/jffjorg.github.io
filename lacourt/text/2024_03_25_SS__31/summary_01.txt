Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to tax costs filed by plaintiff Celedonio Alabat against defendant Linda Rivero and others. The case involves a motor vehicle incident and a lawsuit filed by plaintiff. Defendant served plaintiff with an offer to compromise, which was not accepted. The case was later dismissed with prejudice, and defendant filed a memorandum of costs seeking $18,011.90. Plaintiff moved to tax costs, arguing that some of the costs were not reasonable or necessary.

The judge has ruled that plaintiff's motion to tax costs is granted in part. The court taxes $4,058.30 from defendant's costs memorandum, which includes deposition costs, attachment expenses, and monetary sanctions. The court also awards defendant her litigation costs in the total amount of $13,953.60. The judge notes that defendant's failure to properly separate expenses into their appropriate categories and cautions defense counsel to provide more accurately itemized costs memorandums in the future. The court also rules that monetary sanctions previously awarded are not appropriate and will not be taxed as costs.
