And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's claim for damages did not fairly reflect the factual basis for recovery, as alleged in the complaint. The judge found that the complaint and the government claims for damages were aligned on the factual premise, date of the incident, and parties involved. The judge determined that the motion for judgment on the pleadings was untimely and did not address the timeliness argument. The judge granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of certain documents, but denied their request for judicial notice of the deposition transcript and other documents. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of certain documents. The case will proceed to trial as scheduled.
