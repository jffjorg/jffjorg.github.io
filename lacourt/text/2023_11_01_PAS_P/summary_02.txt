Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants in part and denies in part the motion to strike filed by the defendants. The judge denies the motion to strike as to the fourth cause of action for declaratory relief, finding that the complaint adequately pleads a basis for injunctive relief. The judge grants the motion to strike as to the request for punitive damages, finding that the complaint does not set forth factual allegations upon which the court may grant punitive damages. The judge also grants the motion to strike as to the request for attorney fees, finding that the complaint does not contain a statutory or contractual basis for attorney fees.
