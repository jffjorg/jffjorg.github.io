And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Carter's motions to quash deposition subpoenas served on Apex Recovery, LLC, Southern California Recovery Centers, LLC, and Las Encinas Hospital. The subpoenas seek evidence relevant to Carter's claims of personal injury and medical treatment. The judge found that the evidence sought is relevant to the issues in the litigation and that Carter has waived his privacy rights by placing his mental and physical state in controversy. The judge also denied Carter's request to modify the subpoena served on Las Encinas Hospital, finding that the employment records sought are relevant to prove or disprove Carter's allegations of harm.

Additionally, the judge ordered Carter to pay monetary sanctions to Monica in the amount of $2,250.00, which is the cost of opposing Carter's motions to quash.
