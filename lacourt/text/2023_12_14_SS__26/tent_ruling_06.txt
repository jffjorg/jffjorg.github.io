Discussion
 
Judgment Creditor moves pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 187 to add “Kenpashi Zee, Inc.” as an additional judgment
debtor.
 
“Under section 187, the trial court
is authorized to amend a judgment to add additional judgment debtors.... As a
general rule, ‘a court may amend its judgment at any time so that the judgment
will properly designate the real defendants.’.... Judgments may be amended to
add additional judgment debtors on the ground that a person or entity is the
alter ego of the original judgment debtor.... ‘Amendment of a judgment to add
an alter ego “is an equitable procedure based on the theory that the court is
not amending the judgment to add a new defendant but is merely inserting the
correct name of the real defendant...
 
(Greenspan v. LADT, LLC
(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486, 508 [citing Hall, Goodhue, Haisley & Barker,
Inc. v. Marconi Conf. Center Bd. (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1551, 1554-1555].)
Alter ego liability exists when there is such “unity of interest” and ownership
that the individuality or separateness of the corporation has ceased to exist
(or never existed in the first place). (Mesler v. Bragg Management Co. (1985)
39 Cal.3d 290, 300.) Also, “the facts of the case must be such that adherence
to the “fiction” of the corporation's “separate existence” would sanction a
fraud or promote injustice.” (Ibid.) 
 
Judgment Creditor moves on the grounds that
Kenpashi Zeee, Inc. is Judgment Debtor Schildhorn’s alter ego. Judgment Creditor presents
evidence that Judgment Debtor Schildhorn is Kenpashi Zee, Inc.’s sole officer
and director as of November 2021. (Motion, Makino Decl., ¶3 and Exh. A.)
Kenpashi Zee has not maintained corporate formalities by failing to provide
updated information to the California Secretary of State since 2020. (Id.
at ¶4 and Exh. B.) It only filed a statement of information on November 5, 2021
after being placed in delinquent status; thereafter it fell out of compliance
by not filing a statement of information due on May 31, 2022. (Ibid.)
Judgment Debtor Schildhorn also treated Kenpashi Zee, Inc. as his alter ego by
transferring the real property 16440 Atherton Mountain, #36, Fountain Valley,
California to Kenpashi Zee, Inc. for no money. (Id. at ¶5 and Exh. C.)
On June 28, 2023, Judgment Creditor’s counsel sent a letter to Judgment Debtor
Schildhorn asking for evidence that Kenpashi Zee, Inc. is a separate legal
entity. (Id. at ¶6 and Exh. D.) To date, Judgment Debtor Schildhorn has
made no response. (Id. at ¶7.) This evidence demonstrates a unity of
interest between Kenpashi Zee, Inc. and Judgment Debtor Schildhorn. 
 
Following entry of default
judgment, Judgment Creditor conducted asset searches for Judgment Debtors on
its own and through investigation firms. (Motion, Supp. Makino Decl., ¶¶4-6.) A
bank levy upon Judgment Debtor Schildhorn’s bank account showed it contained no
funds. The only attachable property of either Judgment Debtor is the Atherton
Mountain property, which has been transferred to Kenpashi Zee, Inc. Therefore, Judgment Creditor has
shown that it has been unable to collect on the judgment against Judgment
Debtors such that injustice would result if the alter ego doctrine is not
invoked. (See Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83
Cal.App.4th 523, 539.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Judgment Creditor McLellan Estate Company’s Motion to Amend Judgment is
GRANTED. JUDGMENT CREDITOR IS TO FILE A PROPOSED AMENDED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20
DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
