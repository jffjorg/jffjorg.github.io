Following Judgment Debtor’s failure  to appear, the Court entered default judgment in Judgment Creditor’s favor on  January 4, 2021. Judgment Creditor filed the instant Motion to Compel Third  Parties to Produce Documents on September 25, 2023. Third-party Bank of Hope  filed an opposition on November 13, 2023 and third-party Sammy Hakim (“Hakim”)  filed a “Response to Subpoena for Production”, which appears to partially  oppose the instant Motion, on December 11, 2023.     Discussion   Judgment Creditor appears to seek an order compelling  various third-party financial institutions to produce documents in their  possession pertaining to Judgment Debtor’s spouse, Sammy Hakim (“Hakim”),  pursuant to subpoenas duces tecum served by Judgment Creditor. The subpoenas  were purportedly served on Bank of Hope, Bank of America, N.A., Capital One,  N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Newrez, LLC, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Chex  Systems, Inc., LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Inc., and Los Angeles County  Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk.    The Motion is brought on the grounds that Hakim is Judgment  Debtor’s spouse and the subpoenaed documents will demonstrate the existence of  community property in the possession of Hakim and his associated business  entities, to which Judgment Creditor is entitled to collect towards the  judgment. The Motion’s underlying premise, that Judgment Debtor and Hakim are  legally married, and that Hakim is in possession of community property assets,  remains unproven. Judgment Creditor cites only to Judgment Debtor’s testimony  regarding the marriage, which she referred to as ceremonial. (Affidavit for OSC  Re Contempt, filed 05/16/23, Exh. D, pp. 12:26-13:3.) Judgment Creditor is not  yet in possession of evidence that Judgment Debtor and Hakim are legally  married, or the date of said marriage. The Motion contends that the Los Angeles  County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk verified the existence of a confidential  marriage license but requires a court order to release a copy. (Motion, Exh.  I.) Judgment Creditor requests a court order to release a copy of the  confidential marriage license pursuant to Family Code section 511, which states  that the county clerk will maintain confidential marriage licenses, which “shall  not be open to public inspection except upon order of the court issued upon a  showing of good cause.” (Fam. Code, § 511, subd. (a).)    The Court finds that good cause exists here for an order  compelling the county clerk to promptly make a copy of the confidential  marriage license of Judgment Debtor and Sammy Hakim available to Judgment  Creditor. Judgment Debtor was previously ordered to produce the marriage  certificate by the Court on February 28, 2023; that order was reiterated on  December 7, 2023. (Minute Orders, 02/28/23 and 12/07/23.) Yet Judgment Debtor  has yet to produce the marriage certificate.    Regarding the subpoenas to the third-party financial  institutions, Judgment Creditor has not shown a basis to compel production of  the documents sought therein. The Court will wait to make a ruling on those  subpoenas until after clarity is provided on the question of the marriage of  Judgment Debtor and Hakim.   Conclusion   Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain’s Motion to Compel Third  Party Production of Documents is GRANTED IN PART AND CONTINUED IN PART.   THE MOTION IS GRANTED PURSUANT TO FAMILY CODE SECTION 511,  SUBDIVISION (A) WITH ORDER TO THE COUNTY CLERK TO PROMPTLY MAKE A COPY OF THE  CONFIDENTIAL MARRIAGE LICENSE OF JUDGMENT DEBTOR ALINA GRYGORYSHYNA AND SAMMY  HAKIM AVAILABLE TO JUDGMENT CREDITOR ANDREW KRAIN.    UPON JUDGMENT CREDITOR’S RECEIPT OF A COPY OF THE  CONFIDENTIAL MARRIAGE LICENSE, HE MAY FILE AN EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR AN IN  CAMERA INSPECTION OF THE CERTIFICATE BY THE COURT.    THE MOTION IS CONTINUED TO MARCH 14, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN  DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBPOENAS  SERVED ON THIRD-PARTY INSTITUTIONS BANK OF HOPE, BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., CAPITAL  ONE, N.A., JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., NEWREZ, LLC, WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A., CHEX  SYSTEMS, INC., LEXISNEXIS RISK SOLUTIONS, INC.   NO FURTHER PAPERS ARE TO BE FILED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS  MOTION.      Court clerk to give notice.  (2 of 2) MOTION
TO QUASH REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS OR PROTECTIVE ORDER(CCP
§§ 708.010, et seq.)



TENTATIVE RULING: Judgment Debtor Alina Grygoryshyna’s Motion to Quash
Production of Documents, or Modify, Protective Order, is DENIED.  ANALYSIS: Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain (“Judgment Creditor”), in pro
per, filed the instant action for fraud against Alina Grygoryshyna (“Judgment
Debtor”), also in pro per, on July 6, 2020. Following Judgment Debtor’s failure
to appear, the Court entered default judgment in Judgment Creditor’s favor on
January 4, 2021.  Judgment Creditor served a Subpoena Duces Tecum for Personal
Appearance and Production of Documents, setting the examination on December 21,
2022. (Subpoena Duces Tecum, filed 10/21/22.) The subpoena sought Judgment
Debtor’s appearance and production of the following documents:  1.     
Driver’s license2.     
Marriage certificate3.     
Prenuptial agreement4.     
Titles for all vehicles owned5.     
Real estate deeds for all property owned6.     
All credit and debit cards issued on name7.     
GIA certificates for all diamond jewelry owned8.     
All bank account statements for the previous two years9.     
Federal and state tax returns for the previous two
years10.  Articles
of incorporation and articles of organization for all businesses owned (Subpoena Duces Tecum, filed 10/21/22, p. 4.) The Court
continued the examination to February 28, 2023, to allow Judgment Debtor to
bring the documents and held the subpoena duces tecum was “to remain in full
force and effect.” (Minute Order, 12/21/22.) On February 28, 2023, the Court
continued the examination to March 28, 2023 and ordered Judgment Debtor to: [B]ring the missing documents, any
documents that show a ceremonial marriage occurred or copy of name change
order, and credit card/bank statements for Bank of America or Wells Fargo, even
if closed; if accounts were closed, judgment debtor shall provide the last four
months of statements for the closed accounts and the closing account
statements. In addition to the judgment creditor bringing all the discussed
documents to the continuance date, the judgment debtor shall send copies of
said documents, via email, to the judgment creditor in advance of the
continuance date. (Minute Order, 02/28/23.) Again, the Court ruled the
subpoena duces tecum was “to remain in full force and effect.” (Ibid.)
On March 28, 2023, the Court found that Judgment Debtor failed to bring the
documents or to serve them on Judgment Creditor, as ordered. (Minute Order,
03/28/23.) The Court set an Order to Show Cause re: Contempt for May 31, 2023.
(Ibid.)  On May 31, 2023, Judgment Debtor represented that she was in
possession of the documents and the Court continued the OSC to June 15, 2023 to
allow Judgment Debtor to serve them on Judgment Creditor. (Minute Order,
05/31/23.) On June 15, 2023, the Court ordered that Judgment Debtor be
represented by a public defender and continued the OSC to July 17, 2023 to
allow time for compliance as guided by the public defender. (Minute Order,
06/15/23.)  On July 17, 2023, the Court granted Judgment Debtor’s
request for a continuance of the contempt hearing to January 18, 2024. (Minute
Order, 07/17/23.) The Court reiterated that Judgment Debtor was to provide
Judgment Creditor with the subpoenaed documents. (Ibid.)  Judgment Creditor filed a Motion to Produce Documents on
July 24, 2023. Judgment Creditor also filed eight Subpoena Duces Tecum for
Personal Appearance and Production of Documents at Hearing on third parties,
setting the hearings for various dates in September 2023. On August 11, 2023,
Judgment Debtor filed the instant Motion to Quash Request for Production of
Documents or Modify Protective Order; Request to Reschedule Hearing.  The Motion to Produce Documents came for hearing on
September 7, 2023 and was continued to November 7, 2023. (Minute Order,
09/07/23.) The Court also set the instant Motion to Quash for hearing on the
same date. (Ibid.) Judgment Creditor filed an opposition to the Motion
to Quash on September 25, 2023.  The Motion initially came for hearing on November 7, 2023
but was continued due to the Court’s unavailability to November 29, 2023.
(Minute Order, 11/07/23.) On November 29, 2023, the hearing was continued to
December 14, 2023. (Minute Order, 11/29/23.)  To the extent third party Bank of Hope filed an opposition
to Judgment Debtor’s Motion to Quash Subpoenas, no such motion is reflected in
the Court’s records.  Discussion Judgment Debtor brings the instant Motion to Quash pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.1, which gives the Court to issue an
order: [Q]uashing the subpoena entirely,
modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as
the court shall declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court
may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from
unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the
right of privacy of the person.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1987.1, subd. (a).) Judgment Debtor argues that the Court should quash
the subpoena for production of documents served by Judgment Creditor on the
grounds that the request for two years’ worth of financial records is not
warranted, harassing, and unduly burdensome. She also argues that the subpoena
is intrusive of the privacy of third parties mentioned in the financial
records. The Motion alternatively asks that if the court does not quash the
subpoena, it issue a protective order redacting the names of any third parties
in the records, prohibiting contact with those individuals, and prohibiting the
use of the records for any purpose other than discovery. Regarding the two-year time period, the Court already
addressed this in its order dated February 28, 2023 and limited production to
the prior four months. (Minute Order, 02/28/23.) The request to quash the
subpoena on this basis, therefore, is moot. As to quashing the subpoena because
it invades the financial privacy of third parties, the Motion does not provide
sufficient argument or evidence regarding in what context the third parties are
named such that they will be embarrassed by the production of the requested
documents. (Motion, ¶3.) Likewise, Judgment Debtor has not shown any reason to
redact the names of third parties from the financial records or prohibit
contact with those third parties.  Conclusion Therefore, Judgment Debtor Alina Grygoryshyna’s Motion to
Quash Production of Documents, or Modify, Protective Order, is DENIED.    Court clerk to give notice.
