ANALYSIS:
 
On February 16, 2023, Defendant Tonika Murray (“Defendant
Murray”) served Special Interrogatories, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set
One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff Bobby
Foster (“Plaintiff”). (Motions, Beck Decl.,
Exh. A.) Despite a meet-and-confer effort extending the
deadline to serve verified responses without objections, Plaintiff has not
served responses. (Id. at ¶¶5-7 and Exh. B-C.) Defendant Murray filed
the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Sanctions; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (3) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on October 3, 2023. No
opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
There is no
requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to compel
initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 20230.290, 2031.300.)
Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding party fails
to provide the responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Based on Plaintiff’s failure to respond to the
propounded discovery, Defendant Murray is entitled to an order compelling
service of verified responses to the discovery requests without objections. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure
to timely respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed.
However, the amount of sanctions sought is excessive under a lodestar
calculation. Sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $784.95
based on three hours of attorney time billed at $200.00 per hour and costs of
$61.65 per motion. (Motions, Beck Decl., ¶10.) 
 
Conclusion
 

Defendant Tonika Murray’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; (2) Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (3) Motion to Compel Responses
to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF BOBBY FOSTER IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE REQUESTS
WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF IS FURTHER ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $784.95 TO DEFENSE
COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
 
Moving party to give notice.
