And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Ghazal Pooya's Motion for Summary Judgment on the claim for negligent entrustment. The motion is granted because the defendant has made a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact. The plaintiff's allegations of negligent entrustment are based on the theory that the defendant knew or should have known that the driver, Hessam Arashfar, was unfit to operate a motor vehicle. However, the defendant has presented evidence that there is no evidence to support this theory, including that Arashfar had a valid California driver's license and was not impaired at the time of the incident. The plaintiff's opposition to the motion is based on an attorney's subjective belief that Arashfar was unfit to operate a motor vehicle, but this is not supported by any competent evidence. The judge finds that the plaintiff's request for a continuance to obtain additional discovery is not justified and therefore denies the motion.
