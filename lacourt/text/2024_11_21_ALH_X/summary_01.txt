And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to file a cross-complaint against Vibhay Prasad, M.D., The Regents of the University of California, and Los Robles Regional Medical Center. The defendants seek leave to file a cross-complaint for indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief, arguing that the cross-complaint arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiffs' claims. The court finds that the proposed cross-complaint is permissive, rather than compulsory, but notes that the oppositions have not shown that an opposing party would be prejudiced by the filing of the cross-complaint. The court grants the motion, ordering the defendants to file the proposed cross-complaint within 10 days.
