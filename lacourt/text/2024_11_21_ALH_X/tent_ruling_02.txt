 Case Number:  23AHCV01650    Hearing Date:   November 21, 2024    Dept:  X PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSESPlaintiff Shakeh Ataian moves for an order compelling Defendant to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories (Set One), Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, and 45.  This is a medical malpractice case arising from Plaintiff Shakeh Ataian’s upper-eyelid surgery with Defendant Richard Weise, M.D.  Plaintiff Shakeh sues for professional negligence and violation of Business and Professions Code section 654.2(a), and her husband Plaintiff Albert Ataian sues for loss of consortium.Tentative RulingPlaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) is granted in part, as to Interrogatory Nos. 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.  The motion is denied as to the remaining requests. Legal Authority and AnalysisEach answer in the response must be “as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits.  If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subd. (a), (b).)  “Where the question is specific and explicit, an answer which supplies only a portion of the information sought is wholly insufficient.  Likewise, a party may not provide deftly worded conclusionary answers designed to evade a series of explicit questions.”  (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783.)  Discovery requests are generally afforded liberal construction. (See Code of Civ. Proc., § 2017.010; Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541.) When the responding party answers with objections, and a motion to compel is filed, the burden is on the objecting party to establish whatever facts are necessary to justify the objection.  (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221; Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)Interrogatory Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 ask for the percentage of surgeries that Defendant performed to treat a patient with (1) blepharoplasty, (2) conjunctivoplasty, (3) ptosis, and (4) ectropion conditions, where Defendant first performed a punctal plugs surgery.  Defendant objects that these requests seek information not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  Defendant also asserts that responding to the interrogatories is also unduly burdensome as it would require a manual review of thousands of patient treatment records.  Lastly, Defendant objects that the interrogatories seek information that is protected from disclosure under both state and federal privacy rights.  The Court determines that no further responses are required.Interrogatory Nos. 9, 14, 15, 16, and 17, which begin with, “After YOU examined plaintiff Shakeh Ataian on March 16, 2022,” and then asks Defendant about the diagnoses, treatment plan, and surgical procedures.  Defendant’s responses response Plaintiff “to her medical records previously produced in this action, which contains information responsive to this request.”  The Court finds these responses insufficient pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230 and grants Plaintiff’s request for further responses.Interrogatory No. 18 asks, “After YOU examined plaintiff Shakeh Ataian on March 16, 2022, if YOU did not discuss with her YOUR treatment plan, did YOU assign anyone to discuss YOU treatment plan with her?”  Defendant’s “Not applicable” response is non-responsive.  Defendant must provide a response in accord with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.220 and 2030.230.Interrogatory Nos. 39, 40, and 41 ask about the $5,000 Plaintiff Shakeh tendered for her September 15, 2022 surgery and to where or whom the money was going.  Defendant responds, the “money is being paid to the practice for the services that are being rendered to her,” or states that the request is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, or seeks information protected by individual privacy rights.  No further responses are required.Interrogatory Nos. 43, 44, and 45 ask if Plaintiff’s health insurance was billed, how much payment Defendant received from Plaintiff’s health insurance company, and what portion of Plaintiff’s surgery was paid by insurance and paid by her $5,000 cash payment.  Defendant “refers Plaintiff to the ledger details maintained by Glendale Eye Medical Group, Inc. and/or Foothill Surgical Center, Inc., which sets forth the information responsive to this request.”  These responses are sufficiently compliant, and no further responses are warranted. Moving Party is to give notice.
