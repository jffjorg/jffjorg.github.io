 Case Number:  23AHCV02923    Hearing Date:   November 21, 2024    Dept:  X DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT; EX PARTE APPLICATION RE: RECONSIDERATIONThis lawsuit arises from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on December 17, 2021.  Plaintiff filed his Complaint on December 19, 2023.  Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s sole cause of action on the grounds that it is time-barred.Tentative RulingDefendant’s Demurrer is sustained with 30 days leave to amend.  An Amended Complaint must be filed on or before December 23, 2024.Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application is denied.The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Hearing re: Amended Complaint for January 30, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Department X of the Alhambra Courthouse.  If the amended pleading is filed by that time, the matter will go off-calendar and no appearance will be necessary.Plaintiff’s Claim Appears To Be Time-Barred; Leave To Amend Is GrantedIn reviewing the legal sufficiency of a complaint against a demurrer, a court will treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions, or conclusions of law.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; C & H Foods Co. v. Hartford Ins. Co. (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1062.)  The Court may only consider the complaint’s allegations or matters which may be judicially noticed.  (Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318.) The Court may not consider any other extrinsic evidence or judge the credibility of the allegations pled or the difficulty a plaintiff may have in proving his allegations.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881.) Turning to the issue of the statute of limitations, where the dates alleged in the complaint show the cause of action is time-barred, a general demurrer is appropriate.  (Vaca v. Wachovia Mortgage Corp. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 737, 746.)  The running of the statute of limitations must appear clearly and affirmatively on the face of the complaint.  (Committee for Green Foothills v. Santa Clara County Bd. of Supervisors (2010) 48 Cal.4th 32, 42.) Defendant demurs to the Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff’s sole cause of action for motor vehicle negligence is time-barred under Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1 which provides a two-year statute of limitations for actions for injury due to negligence.  Defendant contends that the deadline for Plaintiff to file this action was December 17, 2023, based on the accident occurring on December 17, 2021.  Given that Plaintiff filed this action on December 19, 2023, Defendant contends Plaintiff filed past the two-year deadline.No opposition has been filed.  Rather, Plaintiff filed an Ex Parte Application seeking more time to file an opposition to the demurrer and for reconsideration of the Court’s ruling on Defendant’s prior motion to vacate the default judgment entered against him.  The request for additional time to prepare an opposition is denied.  Based on the Court’s review of the Complaint, Plaintiff’s cause of action is time-barred under section 335.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  However, the Court grants leave for Plaintiff to file an amended complaint to the extent that the issue can be corrected.Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application is Denied; Any Request For Reconsideration Is Untimely“When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008.)The 10-day time limit for a motion for reconsideration runs from service of notice of entry of the order.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a).)  This deadline is extended under Code of Civil Procedure section 1013 for service by mail, fax, electronic service, or overnight delivery, which applies “in the absence of a specific exception provided for by this section or other statute or rule of court.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1013(a), (c), (e).  See Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2022) ¶ 9:326.1, p. 9(1)-155 [“Because CCP § 1008 does not contain an express exception, the extensions provided by § 1013 apply to motions under § 1008.”].)Plaintiff seeks to have the Court reconsider its ruling on the Motion to Set Aside/Vacate the Default Judgment against Defendant.  Notice of the ruling was mailed to Plaintiff on October 28, 2024.  Plaintiff had until November 12, 2024 to file a request for reconsideration.  The application was not filed until November 19, 2024, one-week too late.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s ex parte application is denied.  (Marriage of Furie (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 816, 831 [a judge does not have jurisdiction to consider a motion that is untimely].)Defendant is to provide notice of the rulings.
