And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to certain special interrogatories, while denying the motion as to others. The plaintiff, Shakeh Ataian, seeks to compel the defendant, Richard Weise, M.D., to provide further responses to special interrogatories regarding her upper-eyelid surgery. The judge finds that the defendant's responses to certain interrogatories are insufficient and orders the defendant to provide further responses. The judge also finds that the defendant's objections to certain interrogatories are insufficient and orders the defendant to provide further responses. The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and relevant case law.
