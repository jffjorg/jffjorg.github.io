The Judge, Mitchell Beckloff, has made a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's application for four writs of attachment against four defendants. The plaintiff, Karmjeet Chhina as Trustee of the Autar S. Chhina & Karmjeet K. Chhina Revocable Trust dated November 22, 1996, had brought the application against Tina Howland Chhina, Raj Chhina, Tina Marie Howland as Trustee under the Rajdeep Singh Chhina and Tina Marie Howland Living Trust dated July 10, 2007, and Rajdeep Singh Chhina as Trustee under the Rajdeep Singh Chhina and Tina Marie Howland Living Trust dated July 10, 2007. The Judge found that the plaintiff's application was incomplete and did not comply with the law, as it lacked an affidavit in support of the application and a memorandum in support of the application. The Judge also noted that the plaintiff had failed to meet its burden on the application and that the denial was without prejudice.
