And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the petition for writ of administrative mandate filed by Jonathan Bobbio, an Electric Station Operator with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). Bobbio was discharged by LADWP after an incident on June 8, 2020, in which he committed a serious error that caused a transformer bank to relay on overcurrent. The Commission found that Bobbio's discharge was within LADWP's disciplinary guidelines, but the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) recommended a lesser penalty. The Commission imposed a time-served suspension on Bobbio, which the judge has found was not an abuse of discretion. The judge has also found that the Commission's decision was based on a consideration of all the relevant factors and was not arbitrary or capricious.
