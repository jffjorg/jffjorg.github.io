And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the Commission's decision to reduce the penalty with LADWP's consent. The Petitioner disputes Fick's factual representations and claims that LADWP failed to exercise its discretion to grant consent. However, the Judge finds that even if LADWP's decision to grant consent is reviewable, the Petitioner does not demonstrate a prejudicial abuse of discretion. The Judge also notes that the time-served suspension was lengthy, and LADWP consented to it knowing the findings and the Commission's adoption of them. The Judge will review the Commission's final exercise of discretion as to penalty, but finds no evidence that LADWP or the Commission lacked a reasonable basis to believe reinstatement would occur on or about January 2, 2023.
