BACKGROUND
 
This lawsuit arises out of an

Shahrooz Fahimi filed a complaint against Defendant Jessica Gonzalez Mejia and
Does 1 through 50 asserting causes of action for negligence/negligence per se
and battery. Plaintiff alleges he was driving his car when he turned in front
of Doe Defendant and Defendant Mejia, leaving several cars distance between
them. Plaintiff alleges Doe Defendant then sped up and pulled up beside Plaintiff’s
vehicle and then began making threats and cursing at the Plaintiff and told the
Plaintiff to step out of the car. When Plaintiff pulled over and stepped out of
his vehicle, Plaintiff alleges Defendant Mejia, who was a passenger, hit
Plaintiff with the passenger door of her car several times then spit into
Plaintiff’s face. Plaintiff further alleges Doe Defendant then got out of the
car, went up to Plaintiff, punched the Plaintiff on the side of his mouth, and
then attempted to beat Plaintiff with pliers Doe Defendant grabbed from
Defendants’ vehicle. Plaintiff returned to his car and drove away. Thereafter,
Defendants followed Plaintiff and side swiped the Plaintiff’s car. Doe
Defendant then pulled in front of Plaintiff’s car, put the car in reverse, and
ultimately smashed the front of Plaintiff’s car. Plaintiff alleges Doe
Defendant got out of the car and ran away.

Defendant’s

DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Jessica Gonzalez Mejia moves
the court for an order compelling Plaintiff Shahrooz Fahimi to serve answers
without objections to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand
for Production of Documents, Set One served on Plaintiff on September 28,2023
as well as for costs including reasonable attorney fees. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).) Under California law, unsworn responses
are tantamount to no responses.  (See Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 (holding that unverified responses are
tantamount to no responses). 
 
On September 28,2023, Defendant served
her first sets of written discovery upon Plaintiff Shahrooz Fahimi, consisting
of form interrogatories, a demand for production of documents and special
interrogatories. (Mkrtchyan Decl. ¶4, Exh. A.) By letter dated November 8,2023,
Defense counsel advised Plaintiff’s counsel Parham Javaherizadeh that Plaintiff’s
responses to Defendant's written discovery was past due, including Plaintiff’s
answers to Special Interrogatories, Set One and Demand for Production of Documents,
Set One. (Mkrtchyan Decl. ¶6.) Defense counsel requested that responses to the written
discovery be provided within 10 days, so that motions to compel could be
avoided. (Mkrtchyan Decl. ¶6, Exh. B.) Not having received any response from Plaintiff’s
counsel by November 21,2023, Defense counsel again reached out to Parham Plaintiff’s
counsel advising that responses to the written discovery were past due.
(Mkrtchyan Decl. ¶7, Exh. C.) Defense counsel again requested that responses to
the written discovery be provided within 10 days, so that motions to compel
could be avoided. (Mkrtchyan Decl. ¶7, Exh. C.) To date, Plaintiff has failed
to serve responses. (Mkrtchyan Decl. ¶8.) 
 
The court finds Plaintiff Fahimi has
failed to timely respond to Defendant Mejia properly served discovery request. Defendant’s unopposed motions to compel
Plaintiff Fahimi’s responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One and Demand
for Production of Documents, Set One are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to
provide complete responses, without objection, and all documents within 20
days. 
 
Sanctions
 
If a
propounding party moves for and obtains a court order compelling a response,
the court shall impose monetary sanctions against the party failing to timely
respond to interrogatories and demands for inspection unless that party acted
with substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP
§§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), 2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
Defendant seeks sanctions in the amount
of $1,010 for two hours preparing the motion and three hours for attending the
hearing per motion. Counsel’s hourly rate is $190.00. (Mkrtchyan Decl. ¶10.)
Counsel has also incurred $60 filing fee. (Mkrtchyan Decl. ¶10.) 
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is
GRANTED in the reduced amount of $950.00, total ($570 first motion, $380 second
motion).
