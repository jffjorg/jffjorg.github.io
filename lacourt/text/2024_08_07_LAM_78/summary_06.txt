Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Michelle C. Kim has granted Greta Curtis' motion to substitute Charles Hasbun, as the administrator of the Gary Paul O'Connor Estate, as a Cross-Defendant for decedent Gary Paul O'Connor. Curtis had filed a Cross-Complaint alleging that O'Connor breached his fiduciary duty to her, and had previously filed three motions to substitute Hasbun as the personal representative for O'Connor. The Court denied the first two motions because Curtis had not filed a formal creditor's claim against O'Connor's estate, but Curtis subsequently filed a creditor's claim and provided evidence that it was deemed rejected by the court. The Court has granted the third motion, finding that Curtis has satisfied the requirements of Probate Code section 9370. The Court has ordered Curtis to serve Hasbun and Robert Brown, counsel for the Administrator of O'Connor's Estate, with an amended complaint within 20 days of the order.
