And here is the English-text summary:

This is a Tentative Ruling denying without prejudice the Petition for Approval for Transfer of Payment Rights filed by J.G. Wentworth Originators, LLC (Petitioner) on behalf of Angela Johnson (Payee). The Petitioner seeks an Order approving the transfer of payment rights pursuant to Insurance Code section 10134, et seq. The Court finds that the Petition is deficient due to the lack of information from Payee and the failure to comply with certain statutory requirements. Specifically, the Court is unable to determine whether the transfer is in the best interest of the Payee, whether the Payee has been advised to seek independent professional advice, whether the transfer complies with statutory requirements, and whether the Payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement. As a result, the Petition is denied without prejudice, and the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to resolve the issues before the hearing date.
