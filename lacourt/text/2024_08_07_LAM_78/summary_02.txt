The Judge finds that Defendant's non-response is evasive and incomplete, and orders Defendant to provide further verified responses to certain interrogatories. The Judge also imposes sanctions against Defendant and/or its counsel, awarding Plaintiff $800 in attorney fees and $60 in filing fees. The Judge will discuss Special Interrogatories Nos. 26-28 with the parties at the hearing and may adjust the ruling accordingly.
