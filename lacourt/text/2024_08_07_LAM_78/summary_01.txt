The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The hearing, originally scheduled for August 7, 2024, is now continued to a later date to be determined. The Court needs more time to review and consider the parties' briefs. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number. If no party submits, the parties should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
