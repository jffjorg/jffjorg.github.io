The court concludes that Dr. Amani-Yazdi complied with the standard of care in treating Decedent Salvador Velazquez and that his treatment did not cause or contribute to Decedent's death. The court finds that the expert testimony of Dr. Peter A. Singer, M.D., Dr. Amani-Yazdi's expert, conclusively establishes that Dr. Amani-Yazdi's treatment of Decedent was in compliance with the standard of care and that nothing Dr. Amani-Yazdi did or did not do made a difference in Decedent's eventual death.
