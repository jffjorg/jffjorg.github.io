And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment. The plaintiff, Xiuqin Wang, is seeking default judgment against defendants Hao Gong, Zhiyong Fu, and Zhuangzhuang Xu for breach of contract and other causes of action. The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for default judgment against Gong in the reduced amount of $225,979.70. However, the judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against Fu and Xu with prejudice, finding that they are not parties to the repayment agreement and that the plaintiff has not shown that they are liable for breach of contract. The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment, which included a brief summary of the case, supporting declarations and exhibits, and a proposed form of judgment.
