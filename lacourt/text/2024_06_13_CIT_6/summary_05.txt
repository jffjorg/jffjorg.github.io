The plaintiff, Bertold Altamirano, has requested entry of default judgment against defendants Interchange Pallet Solutions and Hugo Vasquez. However, the court finds multiple problems with the plaintiff's request. The service of statements of damages was too close to the request for default, and the plaintiff did not provide sufficient documentation to support the damage claims. Additionally, the plaintiff's declaration regarding nonmilitary status was incomplete, and the proposed judgment was not submitted. Furthermore, the plaintiff did not provide enough information regarding the prejudgment interest calculation and used the incorrect prejudgment interest rate. Finally, the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees did not comply with Local Rule 3.214. Therefore, the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment is denied without prejudice.
