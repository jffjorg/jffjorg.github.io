Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denies Defendant Universal Plastics Recycling, Inc.'s motion for attorney's fees and costs. The Court finds that Defendant is not entitled to recover attorney's fees and costs because the action sounds in contract, and the complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Even if Defendant was the prevailing party, the Court finds that the amount of attorney's fees requested is unreasonable. The Court concludes that the motion is denied.
