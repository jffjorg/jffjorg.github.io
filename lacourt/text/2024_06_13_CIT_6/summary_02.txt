Judge's Tentative Ruling:

[1] Dr. Amani-Yazdi's motion for summary judgment was not timely filed and served. The proper date for the motion would have been March 28, 2024, given the June 13, 2024 hearing date and electronic service of the motion. However, the Court notes that the Plaintiff's notice of non-opposition does not mention this defect. Therefore, the Court finds that the Plaintiff waives any objection to the defect.

[2] The Court also notes that the Second Cause of Action for statutory elder abuse is not alleged against Dr. Amani-Yazdi, so there is no other cause of action to assess in this motion.
