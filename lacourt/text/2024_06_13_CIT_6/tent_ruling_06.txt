 Case Number:  24PSCV00679    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Steve  S. Demircift v. Universal Plastics Recycling, Inc., et al.  Defendant  Universal Plastics Recycling, Inc.’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court DENIES Defendant Universal Plastics Recycling, Inc.’s  motion for attorney’s fees and costs.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is an unlawful detainer action. On March 4, 2024, plaintiff Steve  S. Demircift (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Universal Plastics  Recycling, Inc. (Defendant) and Does 1 to 10, alleging the sole cause of action  for unlawful detainer. On April 11, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed the entire action  without prejudice.  On April 26, 2024, Defendant moved for attorney’s fees and costs. On  May 31, 2024, Plaintiff opposed the motion. On June 6, 2024, Defendant replied.  LEGAL  STANDARD  In any action on a contract, where  the contract specifically provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are  incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the  parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the  party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in  the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in  addition to other costs.  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)  (b) (1) The court, upon notice and  motion by a party, shall determine who is the party prevailing on the contract  for purposes of this section, whether or not the suit proceeds to final  judgment. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the party prevailing on the  contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the  contract. The court may also determine that there is no party prevailing on the  contract for purposes of this section.  (2) Where an action has been  voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant to a settlement of the case, there  shall be no prevailing party for purposes of this section.  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (b)(1), (2).)  The party seeking fees and costs  bears the burden to show "the fees incurred were allowable, were  reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in  amount." (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31  Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) To satisfy this burden, evidence and descriptions of  billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling the court to  evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys spent on specific  claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended. (Lunada Biomedical v.  Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)  “A trial court assessing attorney  fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful  compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each  attorney… involved in the presentation of the case.” (Christian Research  Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness  of attorney fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined  from a consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the  complexity of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the  amount of time involved. [Citation.] The court may also consider whether the  amount requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work. [Citation.]” (Wilkerson  v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)  “The courts repeatedly have stated that the trial court is in the  best position to value the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her  courtroom [citation], and this includes the determination of the hourly rate  that will be used in the lodestar calculus.[Citation.]” (569 E. Cnty.  Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th  426, 436-437.)  REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE              The Court GRANTS  Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice as to Exhibits E and F, and DENIES as  to all other documents. (Evid. Code § 452, subd. (d).) The Court GRANTS Defendant’s  requests for judicial notice. (Id.) However, the Court  takes judicial notice only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of  public records and other specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice  of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)  DISCUSSION  Summary of Arguments  Defendant seeks attorney fees and costs in the amount of  $22,469.01, comprised of $21,745.00 in attorney fees, $547.26 in court costs,  and $236.12 in other litigation costs. Defendant cites paragraph 31 of the  subject lease agreement between Defendant and Plaintiff, which provides for the  recovery of attorney fees to the prevailing party. Defendant contends  Plaintiff’s voluntary dismissal of this action after the Court denied  Plaintiff’s request for leave to amend the complaint entitles it to recover  attorney fees and costs here. Defendant contends the complaint was defective and  that the Court’s denial of the motion for leave to amend meant that Plaintiff  would have had to proceed to trial with a materially defective three-day  notice, and Defendant therefore successfully defended this action. Defendant  further contends the attorney fees it seeks are reasonable.  In opposition, Plaintiff contends Defendant is not entitled to an  award of attorney fees because the complaint was voluntarily dismissed, so  Defendant is not the prevailing party under Civil Code section 1717,  subdivision (b)(2). Plaintiff contends that even if Plaintiff is entitled to an  award of attorney fees, the Court has discretion to deny the fees requested due  to Defendant insufficiently supporting the amount requested. Plaintiff further  contends that Defendant failed to file a memorandum of costs per Rule 3.1700 of  the California Rules of Court, and that Defendant’s attorney was substituted  out as Defendant’s attorney of record in the new unlawful detainer action (LASC  Case No. 24PSCV01208).  Whether Defendant is Entitled to Recovery Attorney Fees and Costs  The Court finds that Defendant is not entitled to recover attorney  fees and costs. In an unlawful detainer action, Civil Code section 1717,  subdivision (b)(2) precludes recovery for voluntary dismissals of contract  claims, but does not preclude recovery for voluntary dismissal of non-contract  claims when the attorney fees provision in the lease covers non-contract  claims. (Drybread v. Chipain Chiropractic Corp. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th  1063, 1071-1072.) “[I]f an unlawful  detainer action is based on an alleged breach of the lease during an unexpired  term (e.g., nonpayment of rent, improper use of the premises), then it is an  action sounding in contract.” (Mitchell Land & Improvement Co. v.  Ristorante Ferrantelli, Inc. (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 479, 486 [analyzing Drybread.])  Here, the complaint is based on Defendant’s failure to pay rent and  other fees required under the lease agreement. Plaintiff served a three-day  notice to pay rent or quit demanding $135,790.20 owed pursuant to the Standard  Industrial/Commercial Single-Tenant Lease – Gross and Addendum thereto, as  amended. (See Compl, ¶¶ 9.a.(1), 9.b., Exh. 2 and Exh. A attached thereto.) Thus,  Plaintiff’s unlawful detainer action sounds in contract.  Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the unlawful detainer action  without prejudice on April 11, 2024. Since the action sounds in contract, Defendant  is not the prevailing party and is not entitled to recover attorney fees and  costs. (See Drybread, supra, 151  Cal.App.4th at p. 1075 [“If the right to recover realty emanates from the  breach of a lease provision occurring during an unexpired term of a lease, then  the right to recover  has its inception  in a contractual arrangement between the parties.”]; see also Mitchell Land  & Improvement Co. v. Ristorante Ferrantelli, Inc. (2007) 158  Cal.App.4th 479, 490 [action was found to be on a contract because the action  was premised on the breach of the lease and therefore attorney fees were barred  under Civil Code § 1717, subd. (b)(2)].)  Even if the Court would have found  that Defendant was the prevailing party, Defendant’s requested attorney fees is  unreasonable.              Reasonableness  of Fees Requested  The Court finds that Defendant’s  request for $21,745.00  in attorney fees is unreasonable. First, Defendant provided nothing to support  this amount. Defendant provided instead a lump sum without any explanation or  documentary evidence. (See Cheng Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. “B”, p. 1.) Defendant did not  provide a verified fee bill or any invoices to evidence services rendered for  specific tasks. (See Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682 [a  verified cost bill is prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and  services listed were reasonable].) Without any such fee bill or other  documentary evidence, the Court is unable to determine whether the amount  requested is reasonable, and the Court will not guess as to what the proper  amount should be here.  Second, the Court further finds this amount unreasonable on its  face given Defendant was involved in this action for one month before Plaintiff  voluntarily dismissed it. (Answer (3/13/24); Request for Dismissal (4/11/24).) The  Court does not find it credible that Defendant’s counsel incurred almost $22,000.00  in attorney fees in the span of one month for an answer, an opposition, and  appearing at the hearing on the opposition. (Answer (3/13/24); Opposition to Ex  Parte (4/10/24); Minute Order (4/11/24); 569 E. Cnty. Boulevard LLC v.  Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc., supra, 6 Cal.App.5th at pp. 436-437  [trial courts are in the best position to determine the reasonable value of  legal services rendered by attorneys in their courtrooms].)  Given the absence of evidence to support the amount requested, the  Court declines to award any attorney fees to Defendant. (See Heritage Pac. Fin., LLC v.  Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1010. [“Trial courts retain  discretion to penalize block billing when the practice prevents them from  discerning which tasks are compensable and which are not. [Citation.]”])              Substitution  of Attorney              The  Court finds Plaintiff’s arguments regarding the substitution of attorney of  Defendant’s counsel in the new unlawful detainer action (LASC Case No.  24PSCV01208) to be unavailing. Plaintiff cites no legal authority to show that  the substitution of attorney in a different action, even if between the same  parties to another action, has any bearing on the legal representation in this  action. (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111  Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 [“Contentions are waived when a party fails to support  them with reasoned argument and citations to authority. [Citation.]”.) LASC  Case No. 24PSCV01208 is a different lawsuit, and as far as the Court is  concerned, Cummins and White, LLP is still Defendant’s counsel of record in  this action and was authorized to bring this motion.              Based  on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the motion.  CONCLUSION  The Court DENIES Defendant Universal Plastics Recycling, Inc.’s  motion for attorney’s fees and costs.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
