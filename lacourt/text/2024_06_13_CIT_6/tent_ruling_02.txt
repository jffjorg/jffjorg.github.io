   [1] Dr. Amani-Yazdi’s motion was not timely  filed and served. The proper date for Dr. Amani-Yazdi’s motion would have been  March 28, 2024, given the June 13, 2024 hearing date and electronic service of  the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(1) [minimum 75 days’ notice for  summary judgment motion]; Id., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B) [extension of  two court days for electronic service].) But, the Court also notes that  Plaintiff’s notice of non-opposition does not mention this defect. (See Notice  of Non-Opposition (5/28/24).) The Court therefore finds Plaintiff waives any  objection to this defect. (See Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th  690, 697 [opposition to motion for summary judgment on the merits, followed by  appearance at hearing on the motion and arguing the merits, waived claim of  improper and untimely service]; see also Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v.  Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 [“Contentions are waived  when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to  authority. [Citation.]”)    [2] The Court notes that the Second Cause  of Action for statutory elder abuse is not alleged against Dr. Amani-Yazdi, so  there is no other cause of action to assess in this motion.
