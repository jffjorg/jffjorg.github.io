Bertold Altamirano’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendants:  Interchange
Pallet Solutions and Hugo Vasquez 
TENTATIVE RULING 
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a negligence case involving workers compensation issues. On September 1,
2023, plaintiff Bertoldo Altamirano (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants
Interchange Pallet Solutions (Interchange), Hugo Vasquez (Vasquez) (collectively,
Defendants), and Does 1 through 10, alleging causes of action for negligence
pursuant to Labor Code section 3706 and negligence.   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff seeks default judgment against Defendants
in the total amount of $9,728,669.91, including $2,745,639.20 in special
damages, $4,146,932.07 in general damages, $78,319.83 in interest, $2,756,988.51
in attorney fees, and $890.30 in costs. The Court finds multiple problems with
Plaintiff’s default judgment request. First, the statements of damages appear
to have been served on Defendants on April 9, 2024, but default was entered two
days later on April 11, 2024. (Declarations of Diligence, Proofs of Service
(4/11/24).) That is not sufficient time between service of the statements of
damages and the request for entry of default. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11; Plotitsa v. Superior Court (1983) 140 Cal.App.3d
755, 761 [default cannot be entered until 30 days after service of Statement of
Damages]; but see Schwab v. Rondel Homes, Inc. (1991) 53 Cal.3d 428, 435
[“A defendant is entitled to actual notice of the liability to which he or she
may be subjected, a reasonable period of time before default may be entered.”]) 
Second,
the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel is insufficient to support the amount of
damages claimed. (Gutierrez Decl., ¶ 6.) These are just numbers without any
documentary evidence to support them, and also lack foundation. Plaintiff must support
his damage claim with admissible evidence. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800, subds. (a)(2), (a)(8); Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [the plaintiff must present evidence sufficient to support
a prima facie case for damages].) 
Third,
Plaintiff did not properly complete the declaration regarding nonmilitary
status. Plaintiff simply put “unknown.” (Request for Entry of Default Judgment,
¶ 8, subd. (f).) 
Fourth,
Plaintiff did not submit a proposed judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800, subd. (a).) 
Fifth,
Plaintiff did not provide enough information regarding the prejudgment interest
calculation, namely the date the damages became certain and the end date for
that calculation. (Civ. Code, § 3287, subd. (a); see Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800, subd. (a)(3).) Moreover, the prejudgment interest rate for tort damages
is 7% per year, not 10%. (Cal. Const., Art. XV, § 1; Civ. Code, § 3287, subd.
(c).) 
Sixth,
the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel attempts to add the $435.00 case
initiation fee, but that amount is not included in the memorandum of costs. (Request
for Entry of Default Judgment, ¶ 7; Gutierrez Decl., ¶ 6, subd. (d).) 
Finally,
Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees does not comply with Local Rule 3.214,
which provides the formula for determining attorney’s fees based on a default
judgment. (See Gutierrez Decl., ¶ 6, subd. (e); Local Rule 3.214.) 
CONCLUSION           
Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
