And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that the meet and confer requirement has been met by the petitioners, and they have also filed a separate statement. The Judge notes that the petitioners concede that CCP § 2019(b)(1) is the predecessor to section 2019.030, and that the appellate courts in GT, Inc. v. Superior Court and Goodman v. Citizens Life & Cas. Ins. Co have discussed the requirements of section 2019(b)(1), which include the need for "good cause" to grant a protective order. The Judge will determine what constitutes "good cause" under CCP § 116.130(j), which defines "good cause" as circumstances sufficient to justify the requested order or other action.
