Background
 
On October 23, 2023, Jess and
Carlos Phoenix (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Defendants
La Tuna Stables LLC, Sheila McClure and Steven McClure (collectively
“Defendants”) and Does 1 to 10. 
 
The Complaint alleges fifteen
causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Implied Contract, (3) Breach
of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (4) Breach of Fiduciary
Duty, (5) Unjust Enrichment, (6) Fraud-False Promise, (7) Fraudulent
Misrepresentation, (8) Fraudulent Concealment, (9) Quantum Meruit, (10)
Promissory Estoppel, (11) Money Had and Received, (12) Accounting, (13) Declaratory
Relief, (14) Specific Performance, and (15) Quiet Title. 
 
On January 10, 2024, Defendants
filed a demurrer to Plaintiffs’ complaint in relation to the Plaintiffs’ fraud
causes of action. On March 12, 2024, the Plaintiffs filed opposing papers. No
reply has been filed. The matter is now before the court. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Summary
of Allegations
 
The Complaint alleges
that Jess Phoenix (“Jess”) and Carlos Phoenix (“Carlos”) (collectively
“Plaintiffs”)  along with Defendants
Sheila (“Sheila”) and Steven McClure (“Steven”) (collectively the “McClures” or
Defendants”) were long-time friends and agreed in 2019  to engage in a joint venture to purchase an
equestrian property and run a horse boarding business together. (Compl. ¶¶ 1,
4, 16, 19.) Defendant Steven is an officer of La Tuna Stables LLC and Defendant
Sheila is an officer and director of La Tuna Stables LLC. (Coml. ¶¶ 8, 9.) La
Tuna Stales LLC is alleged to be the alter ego of Defendants. (Compl. ¶ 12.) 
 
In reliance on the
agreement to be partners in a joint venture, Plaintiffs invested time, funds
and resources into the joint venture only to learn that Defendants
misrepresented their intent to share equally as partners the profits of the
business and thereby breached their agreement to operate as a joint venture.
(Compl. ¶ 1.) Plaintiffs worked countless hours improving and running the horse
boarding business as the McClures had no equine knowledge and relied on the
knowledge and experience of Plaintiffs to run the joint venture/partnership.
(Compl. ¶¶ 1, 3, 17.) 
 
In 2019, Defendants
and Plaintiffs put in at least two offers to buy property for the business with
the understanding that both parties would live on site and co-run the boarding
business, but the offers fell through. (Compl. ¶¶ 21-23.) 
 
Plaintiffs boarded
their houses at 10149 La Tuna Canyon Road, Sun Valley, California 91352,
commonly known as La Tuna Stables (hereinafter “La Tuna Stable” or “the
Property”).  Plaintiffs used their
relationship with the previous owners of the Property to convince them to sell
the Property to Defendants with the understanding between Defendants and
Plaintiffs that Plaintiffs would have an ownership interest in the Property as
managing members of the LLC and that title of the Property would be transferred
to the LLC. (Compl. ¶¶ 24 -27, 32, 37, Ex. 1.) 
 
For purposes of the initial
lender approving the loan, La Tuna Stables, LLC was formed and registered with
the California Secretary of State, with Defendants as its members. (Compl. ¶¶
32, 35.) Defendants represented that Plaintiffs would be added as managing
members and, in reliance on those assurances, Plaintiff Carlos agreed to
co-sign the loan and be added as a borrower as Defendants did not qualify for
the loan without a cosigner. (Compl. ¶¶ 36, 40.) On or about June 29, 2021,
escrow closed, the mortgage loan was funded, and Defendants took possession of
the Property. (Compl. ¶¶ 39, 65.) 
 
By April 2021, the Plaintiffs
had a detailed business proposal for the partnership, with the agreement
established orally on April 3, 2021, but confirmed repeatedly in writing and by
the conduct of the parties. (Compl. ¶¶ 41, 44, 46, 48.) The agreement was that
Plaintiffs and Defendants would share equally in profits, equity, and
opportunity in the joint venture/ partnership. (Compl. ¶ 49.) These
representations were echoed to outside parties, including extended family,
vendors, contractors, and clients along with Plaintiffs being given access to
the company email and software for managing employees, attending formal weekly
meetings to discuss business priorities, revenue, expenses, employee staffing,
marketing, and repairs. (Compl. ¶ 56, 59, 60, 61, 67, Ex. 2.) Plaintiffs
contributed over $25,240.33 of their funds to the joint venture/partnership
along with their equestrian skill and expertise. (Compl. ¶¶ 63, 64, 66, 70-72.)
The parties ran La Tuna Tables as a joint venture/partnership with Plaintiffs
initiating fundraisers, increasing boarding rates, and seeking cost-saving
alternatives to cover gaps in funding. (Compl. ¶ 73.) Plaintiff Jess also
passed revenue from her horse training to the LLC. (Compl. ¶ 76.) 
 
By Fall of 2021, however,
the business relationship began to break down. 
Defendants down-played Plaintiffs’ contributions to the partnership and
refused to add Plaintiffs to the LLC despite Plaintiff’s repeated requests. (Compl.
¶¶ 74, 77.) 
 
In November 2021,
Plaintiffs learned that without their notice or approval, Defendants took out a
$250,000.00 credit line secured by the Property for a total home remodel rather
than the previously discussed mold remediation. (Compl. ¶ 79.) Defendants
continued to promise that Plaintiffs would be added as managing members of the
LLC, with Defendant Shelia promising to handle the LLC setup and registration.
(Compl. ¶¶ 80, 83.) The Defendants also promised that they would refinance the
loan to remove Plaintiff Carlos. (Compl. ¶¶ 84, 85, 93.) 
 
By September 2022, it
became apparent to Plaintiffs that Defendants had no intention of adding
Plaintiffs to the LLC or in removing Carlos as a co-lender.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs decided to proceed
with unwinding the joint venture/partnership. (Compl. ¶¶ 86, 87.) The parties
held a meeting, which was memorized in a September 23, 2022, email with
Defendants responding on or about September 25, 2022, agreeing to unwind the
joint venture/partnership and proceeding with removing Plaintiff Carlos from
the loan. (Compl. ¶¶ 88-90.)  Defendants
did not follow through as agreed and Defendant Sheila “represented
on multiple occasions that she was refinancing the mortgage – February 2022,
October 2022, November 2022, and January 2023.” (Compl. ¶¶ 91, 92, 94 95.) To
date, Defendants continue to reap benefits from Plaintiffs’ contributions to
the partnership to Plaintiffs’ detriment. (Compl. ¶¶ 96-110.)
 
Plaintiffs filed this
action on October 25, 2023.  Defendants
now demurrer to the sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action. 
 
B.        Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Causes of
Action - Fraud Causes of Action 
 
Civ. Code § 1710 defines one
species of deceit as “[a] promise, made without any intention of performing
it.” “A cause of action for promissory fraud requires the plaintiff to allege
that the promissor did not intend to perform at the time the promise was made,
that the promise was intended to deceive and induce reliance, that it did
induce reliance, and that this reliance resulted in damages.” (Fleet v. Bank
of America N.A. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1411.) 
 
“The elements of
fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation
(false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity
(or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable
reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996)
12 Cal.4th 631, 638.) “In California, fraud must be pled specifically; general
and conclusory allegations do not suffice.” (Id. at p. 645.) Specificity
“necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were tendered.” (Id. at p. 631.)
 
The sixth and seventh causes of
action related to Defendants’ promise that Plaintiffs would be partners and
share profits in the enterprise equally by adding Plaintiffs as principles to
the La Tuna Stables LLC. (Compl. ¶¶ 138, 48.) Defendants made these promises
with the intent to defraud and induce Plaintiffs to rely on the promise to
their detriment.  (FAC ¶¶ 139, 145, 149,
150, 152.)  Defendants have instead
repudiated the partnership and have refused to sell the business, buy
Plaintiffs out of the business, or allow Plaintiffs to sell their share of the
business to third parties. (Compl. ¶ 144.)
 
“[T]he elements of an
action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are:(1) the defendant must
have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been
under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have
intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the
plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not
have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and
(5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff
must have sustained damage.” (Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc. (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.)
 
The eighth cause alleges that
Defendants as partners and directors owed a fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs and
failed to disclose their plans for the partnership which was to unlawfully oust
Plaintiffs from the partnership and prevent the Plaintiffs from sharing equally
in the partnership. (Compl. ¶¶ 130, 155, 156.) Plaintiffs did not know this,
and had they known they would have acted differently. (Compl. ¶¶ 157, 158.) 
 
Defendants demur to the sixth,
seventh, and eighth causes of action consist of a single paragraph that states:

 
The Complaint sets forth the factual allegations at
paragraphs 1-110. None provide any details about any alleged fraud, fraudulent
misrepresentation, or fraudulent concealment, hence the Court must sustain
Named Defendants’ demurrers as to the sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of
action, both for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action and for uncertainty. 
 
(Demurrer at p. 6:16-10.)
Defendant fails to state why the Complaint is uncertain and what specific facts
are missing from the Complaint that makes the fraud causes of action
insufficiently pled. The court finds the demurrer is without merit and having reviewed
the Complaint, the court finds that the fraud causes of action are pled with
the requisite specificity and any ambiguity can be clarified via discovery. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is
overruled in its entirety. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’ demurrer is overruled
in its entirety. Defendant to give notice.
