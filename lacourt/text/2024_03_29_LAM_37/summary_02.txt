And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has considered the demurrer to the Complaint filed by the defendants, La Tuna Stables LLC, Sheila McClure, and Steven McClure, and has ruled that the demurrer is overruled in its entirety. The defendants had demurred to the sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action, which relate to fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, and fraudulent concealment. The court found that the Complaint had pleaded the necessary specificity and that any ambiguity could be clarified through discovery. The court also noted that the defendants had failed to state why the Complaint was uncertain and what specific facts were missing from the Complaint that made the fraud causes of action insufficiently pled.
