And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies Petitioner's motion for a protective order, finding that Petitioner has failed to show good cause for the order. The court grants Petitioner's alternative motion to quash the subpoena, finding that Respondent failed to comply with notice requirements under CCP § 1985.3.

The court holds that American International Industries is a consumer under CCP § 1985.3 and is entitled to notice under that section. The court finds that Respondent's failure to provide notice to American International Industries was a violation of CCP § 1985.3, and that Respondent's subpoena requests for document production pertaining to American International Industries' personal records are invalid.

The court orders that Brian Dror, an accountant of American International Industries, be excused from providing personal records under CCP § 1985.3(k). The court also orders that the deposition of Brian Dror be stayed pending compliance with CCP § 1985.3.
