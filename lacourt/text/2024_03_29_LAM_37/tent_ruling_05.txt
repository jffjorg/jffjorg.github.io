Pursuant to CCP § 2016,050, the meet and confer
requirement has been met. (Ashdown Decl. ¶ 11.) Petitioners have also filed a
separate statement. 


[2] Petitioner concedes that CCP
§ 2019(b)(1) is the predecessor to section 2019.030 in its reply. (See Reply at
p. 3:4-5.) In discussing former section 2019(b), the appellate courts in GT, Inc. v. Superior Court (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 748
and Goodman v. Citizens Life &
Cas. Ins. Co. (1967)
253 Cal.App.2d 807,  noted that the
provisions of section 2019(b)(1) required “good cause” to grant a protective
order. 


[3] CCP § 116.130(j)
defines “Good Cause” as “circumstances
sufficient to justify the requested order or other action, as determined by the
judge.”
