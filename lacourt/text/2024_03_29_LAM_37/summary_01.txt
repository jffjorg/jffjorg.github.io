And here is a summary in English text:

The court's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Jason Williams' motion for attorney's fees and costs in the sum of $23,425.00. The court finds that Plaintiff is the prevailing party under the Song-Beverly Act and is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The court deducts $8,802.50 from the lodestar, which is $32,227.50, due to excessive billing entries and other issues. The court also finds that the Clerk's Office will enter costs without the involvement of the court, as there is no motion to tax costs.
