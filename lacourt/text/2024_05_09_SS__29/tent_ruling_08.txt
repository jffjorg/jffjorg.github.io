 Case Number:  22STCV13539    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Determination of Good Faith
Settlement filed by Defendants City Terrace Services, Inc. and Mohammad Amine
Rahmani.



Tentative
 
The motion is granted.
 
Background
This matter involves two cases arising out of an
accident that occurred on June 25, 2020, in which a motorcycle on a tow truck
came loose and injured Sheriff’s Deputy Joel Cohen. (Complaint in lead case, at
4.) In the lead case (Case No. 22STCV13539), Deputy Cohen’s employer, the
County of Los Angeles (“County”) brought a subrogation claim lawsuit on April
22, 2022, against Defendants City Terrace Service, Inc., Mohammad Amine Rahmani
(collectively “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 10, asserting causes of action
for general negligence and breach of contract. Defendants answered on June 30,
2022. On October 14, 2022, plaintiff amended the complaint to correct the
identification of Defendant Rahmani.
On June 7, 2022, Plaintiffs Joel S. and Teresa
A. Cohen filed a lawsuit (Case No. 22STCV18608) against Defendants and Does 1
through 50, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general
negligence. On November 15, 2022, plaintiffs amended the complaint to name
Penske Truck Leasing Co. as Doe 1.
On November 2, 2022, the two cases were related.
On December 5, 2022, the cases were consolidated, with the County’s subrogation
case (Case No. 22STCV13529) designated as the lead case.
On
April 9, 2024, Defendants filed this motion for determination of good faith
settlement. No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
In a case involving two or more alleged joint
tortfeasors, a party may seek a court order under Code of Civil Procedure
section 877.6 determining that a settlement between the plaintiff and one or
more of the alleged tortfeasors is in good faith. A judicial determination of
good faith “bar[s] any other joint tortfeasor … from any further claims against
the settling tortfeasor … for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or
comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6(c).)
In evaluating whether a settlement has been
made in good faith, courts consider the following factors, as set forth by the
California Supreme Court in the landmark case Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d
488: 
             1) “a rough approximation of plaintiffs’
total recovery”;
             2) “the settlor’s proportionate
liability”;
            3)
“the amount paid in settlement”;
     
4) “the allocation of the settlement proceeds among plaintiffs”;
5) “a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement
than he would if he were found liable after a trial”;
             6) the settling party's “financial
conditions and insurance policy limits”;
7) any evidence of “collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to
injure the interests of nonsettling defendants.”
(Id. at 499.) “Practical
considerations obviously require that the evaluation be made on the basis of
information available at the time of settlement.” (Ibid.)
The “good faith” concept in Code of Civil
Procedure section 877.6 is a flexible principle imposing on reviewing courts
the obligation to guard against the numerous ways in which the interests of
nonsettling defendants may be unfairly prejudiced. (Rankin v. Curtis
(1986) 183 Cal. App. 3d 939, 945.) Accordingly, under Tech-Bilt, the party asserting the lack of “good faith” may meet
this burden by demonstrating that the settlement is so far "out of the
ballpark" as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives of the
statute. (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at 499-500.) Such a demonstration
would establish that the proposed settlement was not a “settlement made in good
faith” within the terms of section 877.6. (Ibid.) 
The Supreme Court explained that Code of
Civil Procedure section 877.6 is designed to further two equitable policies: 
1)
encouragement of settlements; and 
2) equitable
allocation of costs among joint tortfeasors. 

(Ibid.)  
Those policies would not be served by an
approach which emphasizes one to the virtual exclusion of the other. (Ibid.)
Accordingly, a settlement will not be found in good faith unless the amount is
reasonable in light of the settling tortfeasor's proportionate share of
liability. (Std. Pac. of San Diego v. A. A. Baxter Corp. (1986) 176 Cal.
App. 3d 577, 589.) Or, as the California Supreme Court has stated, a
“defendant’s settlement figure must not be grossly disproportionate to what a
reasonable person, at the time of the settlement, would estimate the settling
defendant’s liability to be.” (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at 499.)
When a motion seeking a determination under
Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 is not opposed, the burden on the moving
parties to show that the settlement was made in good faith is slight. (City
of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261
[holding that a “barebones motion” including a declaration setting forth “a
brief background of the case is sufficient”].) 
When a good faith motion is contested,
however, the moving parties have the initial burden of producing evidence in
support of the requested good faith determination. (Id. at pp. 1261-1262.)
“Section 877.6 and Tech-Bilt require an evidentiary showing, through expert
declarations or other means, that the proposed settlement is within the
reasonable range permitted by the criterion of good faith.” (Mattco Forge v.
Arthur Young & Co. (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1351.) “Substantial
evidence” is required. (Id. at p. 1352.) A declaration from a settling
defendant’s attorney that states, in conclusory fashion, that the client has little,
or no share of the liability may not be sufficient. (Greshko v. County of
Los Angeles (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 822, 834-35; see also 3 Weil & Brown,
California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023)
¶¶ 12:774, 12:872-873.)  
The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the
party opposing the good faith determination. 
The “party asserting a lack of good faith shall have the burden of proof
on that issue.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §
877.6(d); see also 3 Weil & Brown, supra, at ¶ 12:875.) 
Discussion
Defendants
have agreed to pay County, Joel Cohen, and Teresa Cohen a total of $1,000,000 in
exchange for a full release of their claims against Defendants. Of that amount,
$850,000 will be paid to the Cohens and $150,000 to County. This is the full
amount of Defendants’ insurance policy.
 
As this
motion is not opposed, the burden on the moving parties is slight. The Court
has considered the evidence in the record, the arguments made in the moving
papers, and each of the Tech-Bilt factors. Based upon that
consideration, the Court finds that the settlement is in good faith under Code
of Civil Procedure section 877.6.
 
The motion
is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS
the Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
