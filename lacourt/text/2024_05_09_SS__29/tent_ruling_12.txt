 Case Number:  23STCV29440    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  29 Demurrer filed
by Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District. 
Tentative
The demurrer is
sustained in part and overruled in part.
Background
Penny Lavitt (“Plaintiff”) and Martin Lavitt filed the complaint
in this action on November 30, 2023, against Los Angeles Unified School
District (“LAUSD”) and Does 1 through 25. 
In the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that while she was on the campus of Mt.
Washington Elementary School on June 9, 2023, she suffered a broken hip as a
result of “a high-speed collision” in which “a student ran full speed off the
yard and collided with her.”  (Complaint, ¶ 8.)  In the initial complaint, Plaintiffs asserted
three causes of action: (1) negligence (invoking Government Code section
815.6); (2) failure to perform mandatory duty (invoking Education Code section
44807 and Government Code section 815.6); and (3) loss of consortium.
On February 2, 2024, LAUSD filed a demurrer to the complaint.  Plaintiffs did not file an opposition but
instead filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).  Plaintiffs did not, however, file and serve
the FAC prior to the time that their opposition was due, as required by Code of
Civil Procedure section 472, subdivision (a). 
Accordingly, at the hearing on the demurrer, the Court proceeded to consider
the demurrer and sustained it with leave to amend, based upon the failure to
plead compliance with the claims-presentment requirement of the Government
Claims Act.  (Gov. Code, § 945.4.)  
On March 27, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint
(“SAC”).  In the SAC, Plaintiffs assert
three causes of action: (1) dangerous condition of public property under
Government Code section 835; (2) failure to supervise as required by the
California Code of Regulations, title 5, section 5552; and (3) loss of
consortium.
On April 10, 2024, LAUSD filed this demurrer to the
complaint.  Plaintiffs filed an
opposition on April 26, and LAUSD filed a reply on May 2.
Legal Standard
A demurrer is a pleading used to test the
legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact,
regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint,
answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the
function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and
for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are
assumed to be true. (Id.)  
A demurrer can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters
outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at
p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (Ion
Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to
consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso
v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862
[disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos.
(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court
record].)  
A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of
the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar
recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 94
Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of the complaint” includes material
contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into the
complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v.
Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and
accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the
pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]).  
A demurrer can be sustained only when it
disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) 
"Before filing a demurrer pursuant to
this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for
the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a).)
Preliminary Matters
First, LAUSD has satisfied the meet and
confer requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41.  (Noeil Decl., ¶ 3.)
Second, Plaintiffs have cured the defect that
led the Court to sustain the demurrer to the initial complaint: Plaintiffs now
plead compliance with the claims-presentment requirement of the Government
Claims Act.  (SAC, ¶¶ 17-21.)
Discussion
LAUSD demurs to each of the three causes of
action in the SAC.  The Court considers
each in turn.
First Cause of Action: Dangerous Condition of Government
Property
In their First
Cause of Action, Plaintiffs allege that they were injured as a result of a
dangerous condition of public property under Government Code section 835.  As set forth in the statute,
there are four elements for such a claim: 
“[A] public entity is liable for
injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the plaintiff
establishes [1] that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of
the injury, [2] that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous
condition, [3] that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable
risk of the kind of injury which was incurred, and [4] either: (a) A
negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity
within the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition; or¿(b) The
public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition
under Section 835.2 a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken
measures to protect against the dangerous condition.”
(Gov. Code, § 835; see also,
e.g., Tansavatdi v. City of Rancho Palos Verdes (2023)
14 Cal.5th 639, 653; Thimon v. City of Newark (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 745,
753.)  
The term “dangerous condition”
means a “condition of property that creates a substantial (as distinguished
from a minor,¿trivial¿or insignificant) risk of injury when such property or
adjacent property is used with due care in a manner in which it is reasonably
foreseeable that it¿will be used.”¿ (Gov. Code, § 830, subd. (a); see also Thimon,
supra, 44 Cal.App.5th at p. 754.)¿ “The existence of a dangerous condition
ordinarily is a question of fact, but the issue may be resolved as a matter of
law if reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion.”  (Peterson v. San Francisco Comm. College
Dist.¿(1984) 36 Cal.3d 799, 810; accord Stack v. City of Lemoore (2023)
91 Cal.App.5th 102, 110.)  
Plaintiff
has the burden of pleading, and ultimately proving, the existence of a
dangerous condition and each element of a cause of action under Government Code
835. A court may not presume that there was a dangerous condition merely
because the plaintiff was injured. (Sambrano v. City of San Diego (2001)
94 Cal.App.4th 225, 241 [describing such an argument as “reason[ing]
backwards”].)
“A condition is not dangerous within the meaning of the
statute unless it creates a hazard to those who foreseeably will use the
property ... with due care.  Thus, even though it is foreseeable that
persons may use public property without due care, a public entity may not be
held liable for failing to take precautions to protect such persons.”¿¿(Matthews
v. City of Cerritos¿(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1380, 1384.)  “The condition
of the property involved should create a ‘substantial risk’ of injury, for an
undue burden would be placed upon public entities if they were responsible for
the repair of all conditions creating any possibility of injury however remote
that possibility might be.”¿¿(Fredette¿v. City of Long Beach¿(1986) 187
Cal.App.3d 122, 130, fn.5.)
Here, Plaintiffs allege (among things) that LAUSD personnel
invited Plaintiff and other family members and loved ones of students on to the
Mt. Washington Elementary School campus to celebrate a commencement ceremony
for Pre-K and Kindergarten students while other grades were in session.  (SAC, ¶¶ 8-9.)  LAUSD personnel, according to the SAC,
directed Plaintiff and other guests to take a specific path to the auditorium
in which the ceremony was being held.  (Id.,
¶ 10.)  
“This path was a dangerous condition because it placed
Plaintiff … and other guests of advanced age, in the direct path of a yard
where students were running full speed unsupervised or under-supervised.  In so doing, LAUSD placed Plaintiff … and
other guests of advanced age at risk of serious physical injury.”  
(Ibid.)  Plaintiffs assert that LAUSD personnel had a
duty to protect guest from foreseeable injury and that they breached that duty
“by intentionally directing guests … into an area where they were at risk of
being struck by unsupervised or under-supervised students.”  (Id., ¶¶ 11-12; see also, e.g., id.,
¶¶ 13, 23-27.) 
These allegations are not sufficient to state a claim for a
dangerous condition of public property under Government Code section 835.  To state a claim under section 835, a
plaintiff must plead that “there is some defect in the property itself.”  (Zelig v. City of Los Angeles (2002)
27 Cal.4th 1112, 1135.)  That defect may
be dangerous in and of itself, or it may be dangerous because it increases the
risk of injury caused by third parties, but in either event it must be a defect
in the physical characteristics of the property.  (E.g., id., at pp. 1134-1137; Peterson,
supra, 36 Cal.3d at pp. 812-813; Zuniga v. Housing Authority (1995)
41 Cal.App.4th 82.)  Mere ownership of a
public facility in which other parties injure a plaintiff is not, however,
without more, a dangerous condition giving rise to liability under section
835.  (Zelig, supra, 27 Cal.4th at
pp. 1135-1137.) 
Because Plaintiffs do not allege any physical defect in the
property that was either dangerous in and of itself or increased the risk of
injury from others, the SAC does not state a cause of action for a violation of
Government Code section 835.
The Court’s analysis, however, does not end there.  The California Supreme Court and California
Courts of Appeal have repeatedly stated that a general demurrer may not be
sustained unless the allegations in the complaint fail to state a cause of
action under any available legal theory. 
(E.g., Sheehan v. San Francisco 49ers, Ltd. (2009) 45 Cal.4th
992, 998; Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th
26, 38-39; Adelman v. Associated International Ins. Co. (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 352, 359.)
Here, Plaintiffs do allege facts that state a cause of action
under an available legal theory: the SAC, as pleaded, asserts that LAUSD
personnel had a duty of care to Plaintiff and other family members and friends
invited on to the campus on the day in question and that LAUSD breached that
duty by directing them to walk on a path to the ceremony that exposed them to
an undue risk of harm.  (SAC, ¶¶ 8-13,
23-27.)  Plaintiffs further allege that
they suffered damages proximately caused by that breach of duty by LAUSD
personnel.  (Id., ¶¶ 15-16, 28-30.)  Of course, the Court has no idea about
whether these allegations are true, or whether Plaintiffs will be able to
support them with evidence, but the Court must take these allegations as true
in this procedural posture.
The allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for
negligence by LAUSD personnel.  Reading
the allegations of the SAC in the light most favorable to the pleaders, the SAC
alleges that these negligent acts occurred within the scope of employment of
the LAUSD personnel.  As a result,
Plaintiffs have made sufficient allegations to state a cause of action for the
vicarious liability of LAUSD under Government Code section 815.2.  (See C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 868-870.)  Identifying the personnel, by name, is not
necessary at the pleading stage.  (Id.,
at p. 872.)
For this reason, LAUSD’s demurrer to the First Cause of Action
is overruled.
Second Cause of Action: Failure to Supervise
In their Second
Cause of Action, Plaintiffs allege that LAUSD violated its duty to supervise
the students on school grounds under California Code of Regulations, title 5, section
5552.  Section 5552 states: “Where
playground supervision is not otherwise provided, the principal of each school
shall provide for the supervision by certificated employees of the conduct and
safety, and for the direction of the play, of the pupils of the school who are
on the school grounds during recess and other intermissions and before and
after school.”
Section 5552, on
its face, does not impose any duty on LAUSD. 
Moreover, this is a duty owed to students, to protect students from
injury, not a duty owed to non-student third parties.  (See Forgnone v. Salvador Union Elementary School Dist. (1940) 41 Cal.App.2d 423,
425.)  Although the only authority in
this area is more than 80 years old, it has not been overruled, it provides
some guidance to the Court, and Plaintiffs cite no authority to the
contrary.  
For this reason,
LAUSD’s demurrer to the Second Cause of Action is sustained.  As this is the first challenge to this cause
of action on this ground, the Court will grant Plaintiffs leave to amend.
Loss of Consortium 
The parties agree
that the Third Cause of Action, for loss of consortium, is derivative of the
other causes of action in the SAC.  As
the Court is overruling the demurrer to the First Cause of Action, the Court
will also overrule the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action.
Conclusion
The Court OVERRULES the demurrer to the First
and Third Causes of Action in the SAC.
The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the Second
Cause of Action in the SAC with leave to amend. 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs LEAVE TO AMEND
within 21 days of the hearing.
Moving Party is to give notice.
