And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash or limit a subpoena. The subpoena was issued by the defendants, who are seeking information about the plaintiff's employment, including his job duties, termination, and compensation. The plaintiff objects to the subpoena, arguing that it is overly broad and violates his right to privacy.

The judge has granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The judge has modified the subpoena to limit the scope of the information that must be produced. The judge has struck one category of documents from the subpoena and has ordered the production of other documents and testimony. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to provide notice of the ruling.

The judge has balanced the competing interests of the plaintiff's right to privacy and the defendants' need for the information. The judge has concluded that the defendants' legitimate interest in obtaining the information outweighs the plaintiff's substantial privacy interest in this information. The judge has also considered the importance of the information to the parties' claims and defenses.
