Background
On September 21, 2022, Carla Mayfield
(“Plaintiff”) and Ebony Mayfield filed a complaint against Cheryl Johnson
(“Defendant”), Ernest Johnson, and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of
action for motor vehicle negligence arising from an automobile accident
occurring on May 7, 2021, at or near the intersection of West 54th Street and
11th Avenue in Los Angeles.  On November
18, 2022, Defendant filed an answer to the complaint.
 
On April 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
amendment to the complaint naming Christina Jackson as Doe 1.
 
As is relevant to the matters on calendar
for May 9, Defendant propounded written discovery on Plaintiff on November 18,
2022.  That included Form Interrogatories
(Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set
One).  (Lee Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs.
1.)  On January 24, 2023, Plaintiff
served unverified, objection-only responses. 
(Id., ¶ 3 & Exhs. 2.)
 
On May 17, 2023, Defendant filed
motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Requests for admission may be
propounded on a party without leave of court 10 days after the service of the
summons on, or appearance by that party, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.020(b).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On November 18, 2022, Defendant served
Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set
One), and Requests for Production (Set One). 
(Lee Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. 1.)  Plaintiff
responded, on January 24, 2023, by serving unverified, objection-only
responses.  (Id., ¶ 3 & Exhs.
2.)
 
Defendant now moves to compel
Plaintiff to provide initial responses to the interrogatories (under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2030.290) and initial responses to the document
requests (under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300).  Defendant contends that unverified responses
are the equivalent of no response at all. 
(See Appleton
v. Super. Ct.
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632.)
 
It is true, of course, that
substantive responses to discovery must be verified.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.250, subd. (a) [responses
to interrogatories] & 2031.250, subd. (a) [responses to document requests].  In that context, unverified responses are the
equivalent of no responses at all.
 
But the Civil Discovery Act is very
clear that objection-only responses need not be verified.  “The party to whom
the interrogatories are directed shall sign the response under oath unless the
response contains only objections.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.250, subd. (a).)  “The party to whom the demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed shall sign the response under oath unless the
response contains only objections.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.250, subd. (a).) 
 
Plaintiff served objection-only responses to
the discovery.  The objection-only
responses were signed by Plaintiff’s attorney, as is required.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.250, subd. (c) [& 2031.250, subd. (c).  
 
If, as appears to be the case,
Defendant contends that the objections are without merit, Defendant’s remedy is
(or was) to file a motion to compel further responses, after complying with all
of the requirements for such a motion.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a) & 2031.310, subd. (a).)  A motion to compel an initial response is not
proper in these circumstances, as the responding party has already provided an
initial response. 
 
Accordingly,
the motions are denied.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES the motions to compel.
 
Moving party is ORDERED to
give notice.
