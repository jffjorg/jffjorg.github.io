And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests. The plaintiff had served unverified, objection-only responses to the defendant's requests, which the defendant argued were invalid. The judge found that the plaintiff's responses did comply with the court's rules, as they were signed by the plaintiff's attorney and contained only objections. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's responses were not timely, but the defendant's remedy was to file a motion to compel further responses, rather than a motion to compel an initial response.
