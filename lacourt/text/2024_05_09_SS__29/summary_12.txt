And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Los Angeles Unified School District to the Second Amended Complaint. The court has considered the allegations in the complaint and has determined that the demurrer is sustained in part and overruled in part.

The court has found that the plaintiff's allegations of a dangerous condition of public property under Government Code section 835 are insufficient to state a cause of action. The court has also found that the plaintiff's allegations of failure to supervise under California Code of Regulations, title 5, section 5552 are insufficient to state a cause of action.

However, the court has found that the plaintiff's allegations of negligence by Los Angeles Unified School District personnel are sufficient to state a cause of action. The court has also found that the plaintiff's allegations of loss of consortium are derivative of the other causes of action in the complaint.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the First and Third Causes of Action in the Second Amended Complaint. The court has sustained the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action with leave to amend. The court has granted the plaintiff leave to amend within 21 days of the hearing.
