And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Matthew Butterfield, The Hertz Corporation, and Hertz Vehicles, LLC, have moved for an order to reconsider the court's October 3, 2024 ruling on their motion to set aside the stipulation regarding liability. The court has reviewed the defendants' motion and finds that it is based on the same arguments that were presented in their previous motion, and therefore does not meet the requirements for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The court previously denied the defendants' motion to set aside the stipulation, and the defendants have failed to present new or different facts, circumstances, or law to support their motion for reconsideration. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied.
