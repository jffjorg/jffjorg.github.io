  Case Number:  23AHCV00368    Hearing Date:   November 14, 2024    Dept:  X DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATIONDefendants Matthew Butterfield, The Hertz Corporation, and Hertz Vehicles, LLC move for an Order to reconsider the Court’s October 3, 2024 ruling on Defendants’ Motion to Set Aside the Stipulation Regarding Liability.  Tentative RulingDefendants’ motion for reconsideration is DENIED. Legal AnalysisA motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 must be “based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law,” and the “party seeking reconsideration also must provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at an earlier time.” (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.)  The motion is timely if it is brought within 10 days after service of the notice of entry of the order upon the party.The case involves an auto versus motorcycle accident that occurred on May 27, 2022.  Defendant Butterfield was employed by Defendant Hertz and was driving a Hertz-owned rental car when the accident occurred.  Plaintiff Gonzalez was an on-duty motorcycle traffic officer for the City of Pasadena.    On or about August 21, 2023, defense counsel signed a stipulation concerning liability, which stated “HERTZ and BUTTERFIELD agree to accept full responsibility for causing the accident, and thereby waive any allegation of comparative negligence on the part of either the CITY OF PASADENA or GONZALEZ[.]”  (6/20/24 Woods Decl., Exh. B.)  Defendants moved to have the stipulation set aside on the grounds that (1) newly discovered material facts exist and (2) defense counsel mistakenly signed the stipulation without the express or implied authority of its client The Hertz Corporation.After oral argument was heard on September 24, 2024, the Court took the matter under submission.  On October 3, 2024, the Court denied the motion to set aside the stipulation.  Then Defendants’ instant motion for reconsideration followed.  The Certificate of Mailing indicates the clerk served notice of the 10/3/24 Minute Order on October 11, 2024.  This motion is timely.Here, Plaintiff’s motion is not based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law. According to the motion:Section 473 and extrinsic fraud and mistake are irrelevant with respect to setting aside a stipulation.  Well established case law, not contemplated or recited by the Court, makes this abundantly clear.  In People v. Trujillo (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 547, 555, for example, the court noted that “Even if it is assumed arguendo that the stipulation retained a separate existence after entry of the stipulated judgment, the equitable power of a court to set aside a stipulation exists independent of section 473 and is not limited to a showing of extrinsic fraud or extrinsic mistake. […]Second, and consistent with more than 100 years of case law and the above, stipulations may be set aside in special circumstance rendering it unjust to enforce the stipulation. Sacre v. Chalupnik (1922) 188 Cal. 386; Back v. Farnsworth (1938) 25 Cal.App.2d 212; Sinnock v. Young (1943) 61 Cal.App.2d 130; People v. Trujillo (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 547, 555; Gonzales v. Pacific Greyhound Lines (1951) 34 Cal. 2d 749, 755(Motion, p. 4.)  These two arguments are not new or different facts, circumstances, or law.  The Court already considered these arguments, but determined that under the facts of the case, there were insufficient grounds, including under section 473, to set aside the stipulation.  These arguments do not change the Court’s decision to deny the motion to set aside the stipulation. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied. CONCLUSIONDefendants’ motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
