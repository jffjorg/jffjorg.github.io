And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in response to defendant's motion for sanctions against plaintiff Maria Lizarraga. The defendant seeks contempt, terminating, evidentiary, and/or monetary sanctions due to plaintiff's failure to comply with court orders and provide substantive responses to discovery requests. The court has granted the motion in part, compelling plaintiff to provide further substantive responses and production of documents within 20 days for all deficient responses at issue. The court has also ordered reduced monetary sanctions in the total amount of $1,500 against plaintiff and her counsel. The court's ruling is based on California discovery law and relevant case law, which authorize the court to impose penalties for conduct amounting to "misuse of the discovery process."
