And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The plaintiff, Danise Marler, brought a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and Michelle Brownridge Keller, alleging six causes of action under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA): discrimination, harassment, retaliation, failure to accommodate, failure to engage in the interactive process, and failure to prevent harassment, retaliation, and discrimination.

The judge denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on all claims except for punitive damages, which the judge granted in favor of LAUSD. The judge found that the defendants failed to carry their burden on the harassment claim, and that a jury could find that the defendants' statements constituted unnecessary bullying. The judge also found that the defendants failed to provide a reasonable accommodation to the plaintiff and failed to prevent further attacks on her.

The judge's ruling is based on the evidence presented in the case, including the plaintiff's testimony and the defendants' failure to provide a reasonable accommodation and to prevent further attacks. The judge will issue a final ruling after considering any objections to the tentative ruling.
