And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion by Madison and Randall Kaplan to seal the deposition testimony and accompanying records of Randall's physiatrist, Dr. Winston Alt, which were attached to various discovery briefings in the case. The Kaplans claim that this testimony pertains to confidential medical information and that confidentiality is necessary due to the parties' protective order. However, the judge finds that the Kaplans have failed to establish an overriding interest that would support sealing the records. The judge notes that simply because the information is private or is subject to a protective order does not mean that a sealing order is justified. The judge also finds that the information is highly relevant and that the public should be able to evaluate it in assessing the merit of the Kaplans' claims and defenses. As a result, the judge denies the motion to seal.
