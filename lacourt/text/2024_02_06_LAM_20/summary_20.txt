Significant Statements:
* “Rule 3.1700 provided no discretion to consider a tardy motion to tax costs.”
* “The clerk ‘must’ immediately enter [Done!’s] costs on the judgment. Respectfully, this Court has no discretion to do otherwise.”
* “The time displayed as ‘0 seconds’ is not the time it took for the email to be delivered, but rather the time it took for the email to be handed off to the next server down the line."
* "It is very unlikely that these emails were undelivered and Turner received no notification of this. What most likely happened is that these emails were filtered out by defense counsel’s email system and sent into a spam folder or the like and then subsequently deleted without their knowledge."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and is issuing a tentative ruling. The plaintiff, DONE! Ventures, LLC and Coastal Laundromat, Inc., filed a memorandum of costs in the amount of $2,391,826.07 and the defendants, Jerry Jamgotchian, El Segundo Plaza Associates L.P., and Theta Holding IV, Inc., are seeking to tax the costs. The judge finds that the defendants' motion to tax costs is untimely because it was filed after the deadline for serving and filing the notice of motion to tax costs. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has shown that it served the defendants by email and that the email was delivered, despite the defendants' claims that it was not. The judge strikes the request for prejudgment interest from the memo of costs because it was already rejected in a previous ruling. The judge's ruling stands and the defendants are denied.
