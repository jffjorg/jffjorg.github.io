And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is considering a motion to strike filed by Defendants Florence Seckler and Charles Orellana, seeking to strike Plaintiffs Avo Topjian and Lilia Iranoosian's request for punitive damages and related allegations. The Court is requesting supplemental briefing from both parties to clarify the issues and provide authority for the motion. The Court is unclear about the basis for striking certain allegations and is asking the moving party to address each designated portion of the complaint with citation to authority. The parties are also requested to file briefing on the hit and run aspect of the allegations and whether it implicates punitive damages or is simply superfluous information. A new hearing date will be set after the parties have filed their supplemental briefing.
