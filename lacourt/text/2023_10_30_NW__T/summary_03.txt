And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Baz Nomair's motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered in favor of Plaintiff Paul Miller. The judge found that the defendant's assertions of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect were not sufficient to justify setting aside the default and default judgment. The defendant claimed that he did not receive notice of the ex parte hearing that advanced the demurrer hearing date, but he does not seek to set aside that order. The defendant also admitted to receiving the Court's Minute Order showing that the demurrer was heard and overruled, and that he was to answer the complaint within 5 days. However, the defendant failed to provide any explanation or excusable neglect for not answering the complaint, calling the court, seeking legal advice, or otherwise acting reasonably after receiving the notice. The judge concluded that the defendant cannot sit on his rights and that the motion to set aside the default and default judgment is denied.
