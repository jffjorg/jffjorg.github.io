And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Amir Balouch (plaintiff) and General Motors LLC (defendant). The plaintiff has filed a first amended complaint (FAC) alleging that the defendant concealed a battery defect in his vehicle and that the defendant knew of the defect since 2016. The defendant has demurred to the FAC and moved to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages.

The judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded facts to show that the defendant knew of the defect and that the defendant concealed the defect from the plaintiff. The judge has also denied the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages as to the fifth cause of action (COA) for fraud, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded facts to support the fraud element required for punitive damages.

However, the judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages as to the first through fourth COAs, finding that punitive damages are not recoverable under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The judge has ordered the defendant to file an answer to the FAC within 20 days.

The judge's ruling is subject to change after reviewing the parties' arguments and evidence at the hearing scheduled for October 30, 2023.
