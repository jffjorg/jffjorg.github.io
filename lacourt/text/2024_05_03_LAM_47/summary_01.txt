And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to expunge the notice of lis pendens. The defendant argues that the plaintiffs cannot establish the probable validity of their real property claim. The court finds that the defendant breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by refusing to provide tenant subordination, non-disturbance, and attornment (SNDA) agreements, which was a necessary step to ensure the plaintiffs could perform their obligations under the contract. The court concludes that the plaintiffs have demonstrated the probable validity of their claim by conceding the central allegations of the complaint.
