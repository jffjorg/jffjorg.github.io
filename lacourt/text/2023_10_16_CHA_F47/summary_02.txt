And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant SiteOne Landscape Supply, LLC's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff L.A. Tire Tech, Inc. and Gerard J. Neglio. The cross-complaint alleges breach of contract and express indemnity. The judge finds that the claims in the cross-complaint are related to the causes of action asserted by Plaintiff in the First Amended Complaint, and therefore the cross-complaint is compulsory. The judge also finds that Defendant has acted in good faith and that leave must be granted. However, the judge has continued the trial date to allow for discovery on new issues that may arise from the cross-complaint. The judge has ordered Defendant to file the cross-complaint today, October 16, 2023, and to serve a complete copy of the cross-complaint on Plaintiff.
