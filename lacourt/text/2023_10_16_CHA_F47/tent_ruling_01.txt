RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Ruben Ramirez’s
(Plaintiff) employment as a truck driver with/for Defendants: (1) Juan Carlos
Saucedo (Saucedo), (2) K12 School Services (K12), 
(3) Fresh Start Healthy School Meals (Fresh Start
Healthy) and (4) Fresh Start Meals, Inc. (Fresh Start Meals).  On 8/2/21, Plaintiff filed this action
against Defendants for: (1) Unpaid Overtime; (2) Unpaid Minimum Wages; (3)
Non-compliant Wage Statements; (4) Wages Not Timely Paid During and Upon
Separation of Employment; (5) Unpaid Business Expenses; (6) Unpaid Meal Period
Premiums; (7) Unpaid Rest Period Premiums; (8) Violation of California Business
& Professions Code§§ 17200, et seq.; and (9) Failure to Provide Employment
Records in Violation of Labor Code§§ 1198.5 & 432.7.
 
On 12/23/22, Saucedo, whom Plaintiff contends co-owns,
controls and is the Chief Executive Officer of the entity defendants, testified
that he is not the owner of Fresh Start Meals. 
Rather, Saucedo claimed he purchased the assets, but not the
liabilities, of Fresh Start Meals.  
 
In order to investigate Saucedo’s relationship with Fresh
Start Meals, including any purchase of the entity and the relationship between
the three entity defendants, Plaintiff served discovery on Defendants.
 
On 1/30/23, Plaintiff served Fresh Start Healthy with
Requests for Production of Documents, Set 3. 
(Roshanian Decl., Ex.A).  On
4/3/23, after being granted extensions of time to respond, Fresh Start Healthy
served responses to the discovery.  (Id.,
Ex.B).  On 4/13/23, Plaintiff sent a meet
and confer letter regarding what it perceived to be deficient responses.  (Id., Ex.C).  During the meet and confer process, it was
ultimately agreed that Fresh Start Healthy would have until 5/19/23 to provide
supplemental/further responses and Plaintiff’s deadline to file a motion for
further responses would be extended until 6/13/23.  (Id., Ex.D-F).  On 5/18/23, Fresh Start Healthy’s counsel
filed and served a motion to be relieved as counsel which was denied without
prejudice on 9/21/23.  (Roshanian Decl.;
9/21/23 Minute Order).  Fresh Start
Healthy did not serve supplemental responses as promised.  (Roshanian Decl.).  On 5/22/23, Plaintiff inquired as to whether
further responses would be served or whether motions should be filed.  (Id., Ex.G).  Fresh Start Healthy did not respond.  Id. 
 
Therefore, on 6/9/23, Plaintiff filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order compelling 
Fresh Start Healthy to provide further responses and produce documents
to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set 3.  Additionally, Plaintiff requests an award of
sanctions against Fresh Start Healthy and its  counsel in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of
$4,560.00.  Fresh Start Healthy has not
filed an opposition or any other response to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
By way of this motion, Plaintiff seeks to compel further
responses and/or the production of documents in relation to Requests 31, 32,
33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47 and 48.  (See Plaintiff’s Separate Statement).
 
CCP 2031.310(a) provides: 
 
“On receipt of a response to a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for
an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems
that any of the following apply:
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete.
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.”
 
In response to Request 31, Fresh Start Healthy makes
objections and then states that without waiving the objections: “Documentation
will be provided in the event the Plaintiff is able to provide a full
explanation regarding exactly how the nature of this Responding Party's clients
pertain in any manner to this dispute regarding wage and hour issues.”  This last sentence appears to be an objection
based on relevance.  In response to
Request 33, Fresh Start Healthy refers to its response to Request 31.  If a timely motion to compel further
responses is filed, the responding party has the burden to justify any
objection.  See Fairmont
Insurance Co. (2000) 22 C4th 245, 255; Coy (1962) 58 C2d 210,
220-221.  Fresh Start Healthy has failed
to meet its burden of justifying the objections made in response to these
requests.    
 
In response to Requests 32, 34, 36, 37, 38,  and 44, Fresh Start Healthy asserts various
objections and then states without waiving such objections, no responsive
documents exist.  Fresh
Start Healthy has failed to meet its burden of justifying the objections made
in response to these requests.  See
Fairmont Insurance Co., supra; Coy, supra.  Additionally, Fresh Start Healthy’s response/conclusion
that “no such documents exist” is insufficient. 
CCP 2031.230 provides: 
 
“A representation of inability to
comply with the particular demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent
search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that
demand. This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is
because the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed,
has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party. The statement shall
set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or
believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or
category of item.”
 
In response to Requests 41 and 43, Fresh Start Healthy asserts
unsupported objections and then states “[s]o far as is known to this Responding
Party, no such documents exist” and indicates that a search is being conducted
and all relevant documents will be produced. 
Again, K12 has failed to meet its burden of justifying its
objections.  See Fairmont
Insurance Co., supra; Coy, supra.   Fresh Start Healthy’s response that no
documents exist fails to comply with the requirements set forth in CCP 2031.230
noted above.  Fresh Start Healthy has
failed to produce any documents from its claimed diligent search.  
 
In response to Requests 39, 42, 47 and 48, Fresh Start
Healthy states “[s]o far as is known to this Responding
Party, no such documents exist” and indicates that a search is being conducted
and all relevant documents will be produced. 
Fresh Start Healthy’s response that no documents exist fails to comply
with the requirements set forth in CCP 2031.230 noted above.  Fresh Start Healthy has failed to produce any
documents from its claimed diligent search. 

 
In response to Request 46, Fresh Start Healthy makes an
unsupported objection based on relevance and then states that without waving
the objection: “No such documents are or would be available or accessible to
this Responding Party even after a diligent search and requests submitted to
third parties, for example.”  The
response is unclear.  If Fresh Start
Healthy is claiming that no responsive documents exist, its response must
comply with CCP 2031.230.  
 
Plaintiff is entitled to an award of sanctions against Fresh
Start Healthy and its counsel of record for their failure to comply with their
discovery obligations.  CCP 2023.010(d),
(e); CCP 2023.030(a); CCP 2030.310(h). 
However, the Court finds that the $4,560 requested to be excessive.  The Court awards $1,560 in sanctions (2 hours
to prepare the motion + 1 hour to appear x $500/hour + $60 filing fee).  The Court finds this motion is substantially
similar to the motion heard on 10/9/23 as to K12.  Therefore, the time was adjusted
accordingly.     
 
CONCLUSION
 
The request to compel further responses is granted.  The request for sanctions is granted in the
reduced amount of $1,560.00.  Further
responses are due and sanctions are payable within 30 days.
