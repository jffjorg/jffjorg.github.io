And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's unopposed motion to substitute a successor-in-interest for the deceased defendant, Samir Patel. The court orders that Mayur Samir Patel, the personal representative of the decedent, be substituted as the defendant in place of the decedent. The court's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 377.21, 377.40, and 377.41, which provide that a pending action does not abate by the death of a party if the cause of action survives, and that the cause of action may be asserted against the decedent's personal representative or successor-in-interest.
