 Case Number:  23NWCV02320    Hearing Date:   April 18, 2024    Dept:  C Portillo, et al.  v. Coster, et al., Case No.
23NWCV02320
 
Plaintiffs allege injuries caused by substandard living
conditions. Defendants move ex parte to consolidate the motion to compel
hearings and shorten time on the motions.
 
Currently, the motions are set for after trial, and trial
will occur on September 25, 2024. Based on this, the Court finds irreparable
harm. However, Plaintiff’s counsel stated that Defendants would receive
Plaintiff’s verified discovery responses the night of April 16, 2024, or the
following morning. (Decl. Winter, ¶ 13, Ex. B.) 
 
The Court will hear from Counsel regarding the status of the
discovery responses.
