And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling continues a hearing to consider a motion by the defendants to seek discovery concerning the plaintiff's sexual conduct with others, pursuant to CCP §2017.220. The plaintiff, Constance Brady, alleges that she was sexually assaulted as a minor by Defendant Charles "Chuck" Drylie, an employee of the City of Whitter. The defendants argue that they need to discover information about the plaintiff's sexual conduct to defend themselves, but the plaintiff argues that this is an unwarranted invasion of her privacy. The court orders the parties to continue their efforts to resolve their discovery disputes through informal means, and if necessary, to submit a joint statement outlining the remaining disputed issues for ruling. The court also sets a new hearing date for May 9, 2024.
