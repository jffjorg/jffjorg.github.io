Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Requests for Production of Documents (set one) is CONTINUED to Thursday, June 13, 2024
at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  

 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
This
lemon law action was filed by Plaintiff GABRIEL BARRAGAN, JR. (“Plaintiff”) on
August 14, 2023.  
 
On
March 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed the subject Motion, which seeks to compel
Defendant’s further responses to Request for Production of Documents (set one)
Nos. 1-3, 7, 9, 12, 17, 18, 22, 24, 28, 31, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 54, 56, 57, 74,
75, 84, 85, and 86.
 
In
Opposition, Defendant argues that Supplemental Responses to the outstanding
discovery were served on March 4, 2024 (the date this Motion was filed) and Plaintiff
failed to meet and confer in good faith over these Supplemental Responses
before filing this Motion. Defendant further argues that the RPDs put in issue
by this Motion are irrelevant or overbroad. 
 
The
Court is not persuaded that counsel have exhausted their meet and confer
obligations pursuant to the Code. Counsel are advised that their meet and
confer efforts should go beyond merely sending letters stating their respective
positions. (See Townsend v. Superior Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431,
1439.) “A determination of whether an attempt at informal resolution is
adequate…involves the exercise of discretion. The level of effort at an
informal resolution which satisfies the ‘reasonable and good faith attempt’
standard depends upon the circumstances. In a larger, more complex discovery
request, a greater effort at informal resolution may be warranted. In a
simpler, or more narrowly focused case, a more modest effort may suffice. The
history of the litigation, the nature of the interaction between counsel, the
nature of the issues, the type and scope of the discovery requested, the
prospects for success and other similar factors can be relevant. Judges have
broad powers and responsibilities to determine what measures and procedures are
appropriate in varying circumstances.” (Obregon v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 424, 431.) 
 
Counsel
are instructed to further meet and confer on the issues outlined in the subject
Motions. 
 
Counsel
are ORDERED to make further efforts
to resolve the issues presented. If, after exhausting those efforts, court
intervention is needed, counsel may appear and argue the merits on the
continued hearing date. If counsel are unable to informally resolve their
discovery disputes, then counsel are instructed to submit a JOINT STATEMENT
outlining the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required. The
joint statement must be FILED on or before Monday, June 3, 2024.
