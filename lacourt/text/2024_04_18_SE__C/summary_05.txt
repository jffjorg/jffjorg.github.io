And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for a protective order, which seeks to limit access to business records. The plaintiff argues that third parties will not produce the records unless they are subject to a protective order. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that it is procedurally defective and that the plaintiff is attempting to circumvent the proper procedure for compelling compliance with subpoenas. The court agrees with the defendant and denies the motion, finding that the plaintiff failed to attach a meet and confer declaration to the moving papers as required by law.
