This action for quiet tile was filed by Plaintiff CHARLES P.
MORAN (“Plaintiff”) on June 8, 2023. On July 20, 2023, the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was filed. 
 
Plaintiff alleges that “[o]n December 11, 2017, plaintiff
quitclaimed the property to one Angela Michelle Carrasca. On March 8, 2019,
Angele Michelle Carrasco transferred said property to Daniel Carrasco and
Angela Carrasco, husband and wife as joint tenants.” (FAC ¶6.) “Plaintiff did
not on December 11, 2017, or at any time, intend to transfer his property to
Angele Michelle Carrasco as an owner. Plaintiff borrowed approximately
$12,000.00 from defendants to stop a foreclosure sale to his residence located
at13467 Busby Dr., Whittier, California. Plaintiff’s intention was to repay the
$12,000.00 to defendant by monthly payments of approximately $600.00, which he
has been paying for several years. At the time plaintiff executed the quitclaim
deed to his home he was under the impression he was securing the approximate
$12,000.00 defendants loaned to plaintiff…. Plaintiff first notice that
defendants were making a claim of ownership of the property… in or about June
14, 2023, when plaintiff received several notices from defendants that he was
to vacate the property as a renter. The notice was addressed to the plaintiff
as a tenant.” (FAC ¶7.) 
 
The FAC asserts the following causes of action: 
 
(1) Quiet
Title; 
(2) Cancellation
of Deed; and
(3) Fraud
 
The Court notes that both Plaintiff and Defendants state
that a Second Amended Complaint has been served. To date, no Second Amended
Complaint has been filed. The operative pleading is the FAC. 
 
Defendants ANGELA MICHELLE CARRASCO and DANIEL CARRASCO
(“Defendants”) generally demur to each cause of action. Defendants argue that
the first through third causes of action are barred by the statute of
limitations, and that the second and third causes of action fail under CCP
§430.10(e). 
 
Statute of Limitations
 
          First
Cause of Action – Quiet Title 
 
No statute of limitations governs quiet tile actions.
Rather, the underlying theory of relief determines the applicable statute of
limitations. (Muktarian v. Barmby (1965) 63 Cal.2d 558, 560.) However,
there is no statute of limitations on a quiet title action when Plaintiff is in
possession of the property. (Muktarian v. Barmby (1965) 63 Cal.2d 558,
560.)
 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that he signed the quitclaim deed in
2017, but that he did not notice that Defendants were making a claim for
ownership until 2023. 
 
Plaintiff does not allege whether he is still in possession
of the property. 
 
If Plaintiff is, in fact, not in possession of the Subject
Property, then the quiet title claim may be barred by the three year statute of
limitations for fraud. However, the running of the statute of limitations must
appear clearly and affirmatively from the dates alleged on the face of the
complaint. It is not enough that the complaint might be time-barred. It must
necessarily be time-barred on the facts alleged. (Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn
& Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403.) 
 
The demurrer to the first cause of action is OVERRULED. 
 
Second and Third Causes of
Action – Cancellation of Instruments and Fraud 
 
The statute of limitations of a cause of action for
cancellation of instruments is three years if based on fraud, otherwise, the
statute is four years. (Zakaessian v. Zakaessian (1945) 70 Cal.App.2d
721, 725.) The statute of limitations for fraud is three years. (CCP §338(d).) 
 
Based on the facts alleged, the Court cannot conclude that these
claims are necessarily time-barred for purposes of demurrer. The SOL for fraud
does not accrue until the claiming party was entitled to prosecute an action,
which is the last element essential to the cause of action has occurred,
including appreciable harm. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 316-17.) Here, Plaintiff alleges that he did not
become aware of Defendants’ fraud until 2023. The Court must accept this
allegation as true at this stage in the litigation. The running of the statute
of limitations must appear clearly and affirmatively from the dates alleged on
the face of the complaint. It is not enough that the complaint might be
time-barred. It must necessarily be time-barred on the facts alleged. (Marshall
v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403.) 
 
Third Cause of Action- Fraud 
 
Defendants argue correctly that this claim fails to plead
facts with adequate specificity. Plaintiff must plead specific allegations of
what, how, where, by whom, to whom, and by what means the alleged
representations were made. (Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d
59, 73.) On this ground, the demurrer to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED
with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Second Cause of Action – Cancellation of Instruments
 
The elements of a cause of action for instrument
cancellation are (1) a written instrument; (2) a reasonable apprehension that
it may cause serious injury to someone; (3) as to whom it is void or voidable.
(Cal. Civ. Code §3412.)
 
The demurrer to the second cause of action is SUSTAINED with
20 days leave to amend for the same reasons noted in the Court’s analysis under
the Third Cause of Action for Fraud. Plaintiff has not successfully alleged
that the instrument is void or voidable.
