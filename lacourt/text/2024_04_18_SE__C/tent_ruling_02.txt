“A pending action or proceeding
does not abate by the death of a party if the cause of action survives.” (CCP
§377.21.) A cause of action against a decedent that survives may be asserted
against the decedent’s personal representative or, to the extent provided by
statute, against the decedent’s successor in interest. (CCP §377.40). After a
defendant dies, the court shall allow the pending action to continue upon
motion. (CCP §377.41.) 
 
CCP §377.41 states: “On motion,
the Court shall allow a pending action or proceeding against the decedent that
does not abate to be continued against the decedent’s personal representative
or, to the extent provided by statute, against the decedent’s successor in
interest, except that the court may not permit an action or proceeding to be
continued against the personal representative unless proof of compliance with
part 4… of Division 7 of the Probate Code governing creditor claims is first
made.” 
 
The Court has reviewed the
Declaration of Anthony A. Liberatore. The unopposed Motion is GRANTED.
