v. GONZALEZ
CASE NO.:  23NWCV02191
HEARING:  04/18/24
 
#5
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant’s Motion to Vacate Default is GRANTED.  The request to Dissolve the Temporary
Restraining Order is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
Defendant’s Proposed Demurrer attached as Exhibit A to
Plaintiff’s Amended Ex Parte Application to Vacate Default and Dissolve
Temporary Restraining Order is NOT DEEMED SERVED AND FILED as of
the hearing date. Moving Party is ORDERED
to FILE, SERVE, and RESERVE A HEARING DATE
for the Proposed Demurrer within 5 court days of the Court’s issuance of this
Order. 
 
The parties’ Requests for Judicial Notice are GRANTED. (Cal.
Ev. Code §452.) 
 
This action was filed on July 14, 2023. Default was entered
against Cross-Defendant LONE OAK FUND, LLC (“Lone Oak”) on October 24, 2023. 
 
On November 2, 2023, Lone Oak applied ex parte to vacate
default pursuant to CCP §§473.5 and 473(d) and dissolve the TRO.  Proceedings were continued several times due
to an automatic stay following bankruptcy proceedings involving Defendant Jose
Gonzalez.  The stay has now been
lifted.  
 
Lone Oak moves to set aside the default under CCP §§473(d)
and 473.5. 
 
CCP §473.5 sets the time limit as requiring the motion to be
filed within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i)
two years after entry of a default judgment; or (ii) 180 days after service on
the party of a written notice that a default or default judgment had been
entered. (CCP §473.5(a).) “Notice of motion to set aside
the default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action shall
designate as the time for making the motion a date prescribed by subdivision
(b) of Section 1005, and it shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under
oath that the party’s lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was
not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party
shall serve and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other
pleading proposed to be filed in the action.” 
(CCP § 473.5(b).)
 
Lone Oak acknowledges that on September 6, 2023, the
Cross-Complaint was electronically served upon John Narcise, a senior
para-professional at Mr. Aron’s law firm. (Aron Decl., ¶12.) Mr. Narcise informed Mr. Aron on October 30, 2023 that for
some unknown reason he found the emails in his spam folder. (Ibid.) Mr.
Narcise had never worked on the case before and had not previously received any
such emails. (Ibid.) Based thereon, the Court determines that Lone Oak’s
failure to defend the cross-complaint was caused by excusable neglect, Lone Oak
lacked actual notice of the Cross-Complaint, and Lone Oak timely sought
relief.  
 
The Motion is GRANTED under CCP §473.5. 
 
The request to dissolve the Temporary Restraining Order is
DENIED without prejudice.  The request
may be made via separately noticed motion.
