v. MODERN MILL, INC. 
CASE
NO.:  23NWCV00934
HEARING:
04/18/24
 
#4
 
Plaintiffs’
Motion for a Protective Order is DENIED. 
 
Opposing
Party to give Notice. 
 
Plaintiff
moves for a protective order on the basis that “third parties, to whom
subpoenas duces tecum, have stated that they will not produce business records
unless they are subject to a protective order limiting their access on a ‘need
to know’ basis.” (Notice 2:7-11.)  
 
In
Opposition, Defendant argues that the Motion is procedurally defective, for
various reasons, and must be denied. 
 
“Before,
during, or after a deposition, any party, any deponent, or any other affected
natural person or organization may promptly move for a protective order. The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.) (CCP §2025.420(a).) 
 
Here,
no meet and confer declaration is attached to the Moving Papers. The
Declaration of Robert H. Dewberry merely states that he “attempted to get
opposing counsel to stipulate to a protective order but they refused.”
(Dewberry Decl., ¶5.) This does not suffice. The Motion is procedurally
defective, and must be denied. 
 
Moreover,
on the merits, the Court does not find a sufficient basis to grant the instant
Motion. As argued in Opposition, Plaintiff is the issuing/propounding party of
the subject subpoenas. It is unclear why Plaintiff would move for a protective
order on behalf of the answering parties. If Plaintiff seeks to compel
compliance with the subpoenas it issued, then the proper procedural vehicle
would have been to file a Motion to Compel Compliance under CCP §2025.450.
