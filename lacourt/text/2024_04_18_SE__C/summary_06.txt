And here is the English summary:

In the tentative ruling, the Judge rules on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The Judge overrules the demurrer in part and sustains it with 20 days' leave to amend in part. The Judge denies the defendants' request for judicial notice of the plaintiff's responses to requests for admissions.

The plaintiff, Charles P. Moran, alleges that he executed a quitclaim deed in 2017, but did not intend to transfer ownership of the property. He alleges that the defendants, Angela Michelle Carrasco and Daniel Carrasco, are making a claim of ownership of the property. The plaintiff borrowed $12,000 from the defendants and has been paying them back through monthly payments.

The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The Judge finds that the quiet title action is not time-barred, as the plaintiff's possession of the property is not alleged. The Judge also finds that the claims for cancellation of instruments and fraud are not necessarily time-barred.

The Judge sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action, fraud, as the plaintiff has not pled specific allegations of what, how, where, by whom, and by what means the alleged representations were made. The Judge also sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action, cancellation of instruments, as the plaintiff has not alleged that the instrument is void or voidable.

The Judge gives the plaintiff 20 days to amend its complaint to cure the defects.
