Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion by attorney David Berke to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Jennifer Chen. Berke cites a breakdown in attorney-client communication and a material breach of the retainer agreement. The motion is unopposed. The judge finds that Berke has properly filed the necessary forms and that the breakdown in communication or breach of agreement are grounds for withdrawal. The judge notes that the next hearing is set for September 30, 2024, which should be sufficient time for Plaintiff to retain new counsel. The judge will hear from the parties at the hearing and may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court if no one submits a response.
