And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiffs, Brian Walker and Steve Malang. The court had previously ordered the plaintiffs to respond to discovery requests and pay a $1,000 sanction, but they failed to do so. The defendant filed a motion to terminate the sanctions, which the court denied, but the plaintiffs failed to file an opposition. The court notes that the plaintiffs' counsel has not been truthful to the court, as they did not receive the discovery responses that they allegedly served on the defendant. The court finds that the plaintiffs have abused the discovery process and has granted the defendant's motion to terminate the sanctions.
