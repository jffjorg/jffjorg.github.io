Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to compel deposition, citing that the defendant did not serve a deposition notice on the plaintiff. The judge grants the motion to extend the time of deposition, allowing the defendant an additional five hours beyond the seven-hour limit. The judge also denies the requests for sanctions, finding that both parties acted with substantial justification. The parties are ordered to meet and confer on the plaintiff's deposition dates, given the new time limit. The motion is granted in part and denied in part.
