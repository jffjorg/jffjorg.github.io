MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
Hearing Date: 6/17/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV07948 GABRIELA
SABET-BAKTASH vs CITY OF LOS ANGELES
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS DENIED
 
Background
 
Plaintiff
moves the Court to continue the trial from July 18, 2024, to November 6, 2024.
Plaintiff argues that she needs additional time to complete discovery and that
Defendant City of Los Angeles' counsel will be engaged in a trial that has been
granted preference at the same time. All parties stipulated to the continuance
of the trial and for trial-related deadlines to follow the new trial date.
 
This case was
filed on March 1, 2021, and Defendants all answered in 2021. Plaintiff has had
ample time to conduct discovery but contends she has been hamstrung in that
effort by Defendant’s failure to provide deposition dates.  Furthermore, Plaintiff states that Defendant
has a case set for trial on July 1, 2024, but failed to provide the case number
for the Court to assess the status of that trial for itself.  At this point, the Court does not find good
cause for a continuance.  However, the
Court will address the issues identified herein with the parties.  That said, to be fully transparent, the Court
is disinclined to grant a 4-month continuance in a 2021 case and strongly
recommends that the parties meet and confer regarding an earlier trial date
prior to the Court calling this matter.
