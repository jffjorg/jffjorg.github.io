And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to two requests for production. The Defendant had argued that the requests were premature and sought to violate the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine. The court found that the Defendant had expended significant efforts to obtain the Electronic Data Recorder (EDR) data and photographs of the vehicle, and was entitled to qualified work product protection. The court ruled that the Plaintiff could have obtained the same factual information without relying on the Defendant's efforts, and therefore denied the motion to compel. The court also denied the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions.
