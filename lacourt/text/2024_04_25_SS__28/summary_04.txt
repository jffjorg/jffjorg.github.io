And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to continue the trial date from June 11, 2024 to a later date. The State of California, acting through the Department of Transportation, requested a continuance because it only received notice of the complaint on April 18, 2023, 14 months after the complaint was filed. The State also argued that it needs more time to complete discovery. The judge granted the motion, continuing the trial date for 90 days or to the next available date on the court's calendar. The judge also ordered that discovery and related dates will be based on the new trial date.
