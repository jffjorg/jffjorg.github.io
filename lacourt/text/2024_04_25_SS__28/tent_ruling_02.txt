PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to grant relief from the waiver of a jury trial. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 631 provides in part: 
“(a) The right to a trial by jury as declared by
Section 16 of Article I of the California Constitution shall be preserved to
the parties inviolate. In civil cases, a jury may only be waived pursuant to
subdivision (f). 
* * *
“(f) A party waives trial by jury in any of the
following ways: 
* * *
  “(4) By failing to announce that a jury is required,
at the time the cause is first set for trial, if it is set upon notice or
stipulation, or within five days after notice of setting if it is set without
notice or stipulation. 
“(5) By failing to timely pay the fee described in
subdivision (b), unless another party on the same side of the case has paid
that fee. 
* * *
  “(g) The court may, in its discretion upon just terms,
allow a trial by jury although there may have been a waiver of a trial by jury.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 631, subds.
(a), (f)(4) & (5), (g).) 
“
‘The right to a jury trial is a basic and fundamental part of our system of
jurisprudence . . . In case of doubt, therefore, the issue should be resolved
in favor of preserving a litigant’s right to trial by jury.’”  (R. Fairbank et al., Cal. Practice Guide:
Civil Trials and Evidence (Rutter 2022) ¶ 2:311, p. 2-68 (Cal. Practice Guide),
quoting Byram v. Superior Court (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 648, 652; see
Grafton Partners v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 958 [“any ambiguity or doubt
concerning the waiver provisions of section 631 must be ‘resolved in favor of
according to a litigant a jury trial’ ”].) 
“While
the matter is discretionary, ‘it is well settled that, in light of the public
policy favoring trial by jury, a motion to be relieved of a jury waiver should
be granted unless, and except, where granting such a motion would work serious
hardship to the objecting party.’ ” 
(Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 2:317, pp. 2-69 to 2-70,
quoting Boal v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 806,
809.)  “Stated differently, ‘The Court
abuses its discretion in denying relief where there has been no prejudice to
the other party or to the court from an inadvertent waiver.’”  (Id. at p. 2-70, quoting Gann v.
William Bros. Realty, Inc. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1698, 1704.) 
“The
prejudice which must be shown to justify [denial of relief from jury trial
waiver] is prejudice from granting relief from the waiver, as opposed to
prejudice from a jury trial.” (Cal.
Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 2:320, p. 2-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff inadvertently posted jury fees in an untimely manner.  The jury trial waiver
resulted from an “inadvertent oversight” because Plaintiff believed she had
paid the fees.  Plaintiff argues
that Defendant will suffer no prejudice if the Court grants the motion.  Indeed, Plaintiff notes that Defendant has already requested a jury trial. 
The
Court finds that granting Plaintiff relief from waiver of a jury trial will not
prejudice Defendant.  The Court exercises its discretion to grant the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Danielle Alexis Venegas’s motion for relief from waiver
of jury trial. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
