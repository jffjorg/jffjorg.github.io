PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to compel Plaintiff’s responses to a demand for inspection and
production of documents and to interrogatories. 
Defendant also asks the Court to impose sanctions on Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)   
DISCUSSION 
On December
19, 2023, Defendant served a demand for inspection and production of documents,
set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one,
on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not provide
timely responses and had not provided responses by the time Defendant filed these
motions. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel responses to the demand for inspection
and production of documents and orders Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses without
objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored information,
and/or other things requested without objections by May 24, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel responses to the special and form interrogatories
and orders Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to the
special and form interrogatories without objections by May 24, 2024. 
Defendant
requests sanctions on the motions to compel responses to the demand for inspection
and production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories.  Under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, sanctions are available against
parties, persons, and attorneys who unsuccessfully make or oppose a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories or requests for production.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for inspection].)  Plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories or a demand for inspection. Therefore,
sanctions are not available under these statutes. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for these motions. 
(See Code Civ. Proc, § 2023.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and
monetary sanctions may not be imposed based solely on [the statute].  Monetary sanctions may be imposed only if
authorized by some other provision of the Discovery Act.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery
process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or other provision of this title”]; City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 498-504, review
granted Jan. 23, 2023 with order permitting citation of opinion for its
persuasive value and to establish the existence of a conflict in authority that
would “allow trial courts to exercise discretion . . . to choose between sides
of any such conflict.”) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a), provides: “The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed . . . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1348(a).)  “ ‘Rules of
court have the force of law and are as binding as procedural statutes as long
as they are not inconsistent with statutory or constitutional law.’ ” (Fidelity
National Home Warranty Company Cases (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 812, 842, fn.
41, quoting In re I.V. (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 249, 256.)  Interpreting rule 3.1348(a) to authorize an
award of sanctions here would be inconsistent with Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. 
The
Court denies Defendant’s request for sanctions. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant City of Los Angeles’s motion to compel
responses to the demand for inspection and production of documents, set one,
and orders Plaintiff Andrew Leeka to provide verified code-compliant responses
without objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored
information, and/or other things requested without objections by May 24, 2024. 
The Court GRANTS Defendant
City of Los Angeles’s motion to compel responses to special interrogatories,
set one, and orders Plaintiff Andrew Leeka to provide verified code-compliant
responses to the special interrogatories without objections by May 24, 2024. 
The Court
GRANTS Defendant City of Los Angeles’s motion to compel responses to form
interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff Andrew Leeka to provide verified
code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without objections by May
24, 2024. 
The Court
DENIES Defendant City of Los Angeles’s requests for sanctions.
