 Case Number:  22STCV28808    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  28 On
December 11, 2023, Plaintiff Danielle Penberthy (“Plaintiff”) filed a motion to
quash a deposition subpoena issued to Women’s Care of Beverly Hills Medical
Group or, in the alternative, issue a protective order.  The motion was set to be heard on February
23, 2024. The Court continued the hearing to April 25, 2024.  On February 8, 2024, Defendant-in-Intervention
Blue Hill Specialty Insurance Company filed an opposition. 
On
March 11, 2024, the Court signed the parties’ stipulated protective order. 
Because
Plaintiff’s motion requested a protective order as an alternative form of
relief, the Court concludes that the protective order approved on March 11,
2024 has made Plaintiff’s motion moot. 
If the parties disagree, they may appear at the April 25, 2024 hearing and
explain why the Court should nonetheless rule on the motion.
