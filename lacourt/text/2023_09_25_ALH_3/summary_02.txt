And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint filed by the Department of Transportation (DOT) against Danielle Brittany Vafa. The case was filed by Natalie Marie Diaz against the State of California, DOT, and others, arising from a motor vehicle collision on July 7, 2022. DOT seeks to file a cross-complaint for indemnity, which is compulsory because it arises from the same transaction as the plaintiff's claim. The court must grant leave to file the cross-complaint if DOT is acting in good faith. Vafa opposes the motion, arguing that she has already settled with the plaintiff for the full policy limits of her parent's automobile insurance policy in the amount of $500,000 and has no assets beyond the policy limits to indemnify DOT. However, the court finds that this argument does not show that DOT is acting in bad faith. Therefore, the motion is granted, and DOT is ordered to file the proposed cross-complaint within 5 days of the date of this order.

**English Summary:**

Judge William A. Crowfoot's tentative ruling grants the Department of Transportation (DOT)'s motion to file a cross-complaint against Danielle Brittany Vafa. 

The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by Natalie Marie Diaz against the DOT, Vafa, the County of Los Angeles, and the City of Monrovia, arising from a motor vehicle collision on July 7, 2022.  The DOT seeks to file a cross-complaint for indemnity against Vafa.

Vafa counters by stating that she has already settled with Diaz for the full policy limit of her parent's insurance policy ($500,000) and has no further assets to indemnify the DOT.  However, the Judge finds that this argument does not demonstrate that the DOT is acting in bad faith.

Therefore, the Judge grants the DOT's motion, allowing them to file the cross-complaint within five days of the ruling.
