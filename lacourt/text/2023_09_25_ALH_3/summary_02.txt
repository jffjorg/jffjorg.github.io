And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint filed by the Department of Transportation (DOT) against Danielle Brittany Vafa. The case was filed by Natalie Marie Diaz against the State of California, DOT, and others, arising from a motor vehicle collision on July 7, 2022. DOT seeks to file a cross-complaint for indemnity, which is compulsory because it arises from the same transaction as the plaintiff's claim. The court must grant leave to file the cross-complaint if DOT is acting in good faith. Vafa opposes the motion, arguing that she has already settled with the plaintiff for the full policy limits of her parent's automobile insurance policy in the amount of $500,000 and has no assets beyond the policy limits to indemnify DOT. However, the court finds that this argument does not show that DOT is acting in bad faith. Therefore, the motion is granted, and DOT is ordered to file the proposed cross-complaint within 5 days of the date of this order.
