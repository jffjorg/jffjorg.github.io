---

This tentative ruling is for a medical malpractice action filed on April 26, 2022. The Defendants, Heydar Shahrokh, D.D.S., and Heydar Shahrokh, D.D.S., Inc. dba Comfort Dental Center, moved for orders compelling Plaintiff Rosevianney C. Ogumsi to serve responses to Form Interrogatories and deeming the truth of the matters in Requests for Admission.

Plaintiff did not respond to the motion, and it is undisputed that Plaintiff failed to serve responses to Defendants' Form Interrogatories. The Court granted Defendants' motion to compel responses and ordered Plaintiff to serve verified responses within 20 days of the order's date.

Additionally, Plaintiff failed to timely respond to a request for admission. The Court granted Defendants' motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests. However, the Court deemed Defendants' request for sanctions excessive and reduced the amount from $2,235 to $870.

Parties who intend to submit on this tentative ruling should send an email to the Court. If no emails or appearances are made at the hearing, the Court may adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
