Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in Markdown format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 23AHCV01308
* Hearing Date: September 25, 2023
* Department: 3
* Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles - Northeast District
* Parties:
	+ Plaintiff: Jane Doe
	+ Defendant: North American Division of Seventh-day Adventists (NAD), et al.

**Introduction**

The case involves a motion to quash service of summons and dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction filed by NAD. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, alleges that NAD is responsible for childhood sexual assault she suffered while a minor member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

**Legal Standard**

To establish personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant has minimum contacts with the forum state, such that the exercise of jurisdiction does not offend "traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice."

**Discussion**

The court finds that the plaintiff's evidence is insufficient to establish general jurisdiction over NAD. NAD's contacts with California are limited to a few employees and do not rise to the level of "substantial, continuous, and systematic" contacts required for general jurisdiction.

The court also finds that the plaintiff's evidence is insufficient to establish specific jurisdiction over NAD. There is no evidence that NAD exercised pervasive or systematic control over local churches in California or implemented measures to prevent sexual abuse.

**Jurisdictional Discovery**

The court grants the plaintiff's request for jurisdictional discovery and continues the hearing. The plaintiff is ordered to file a supplemental brief, and NAD may file a supplemental reply brief.

**Conclusion**

The hearing on NAD's motion to quash is continued to December 27, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse.

**Significant Statements**

* "A nonresident defendant may be subject to the general jurisdiction of the forum if his or her contacts in the forum state are 'substantial, continuous, and systematic.'" ([Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 445.])
* "Specific jurisdiction is determined under a three-part test: (1) the nonresident defendant must do some act or consummate some transaction with the forum or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws; (2) the claim must be one which arises out of or results from the defendant's forum-related activities; and (3) exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable." ([Jewish Defense Organization, Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1054.])
