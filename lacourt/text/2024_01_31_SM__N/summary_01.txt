And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Leo Cono's motion to amend the deposition hearing. The Court has determined that it lacks jurisdiction to rule on the motion because the action was previously dismissed and the order became final on July 19, 2023. As a result, the motion is being taken off the calendar and the Clerk will give notice. The Judge notes that the relief requested in the motion is unclear and that the Plaintiff's motion is essentially moot due to the prior dismissal of the action.
