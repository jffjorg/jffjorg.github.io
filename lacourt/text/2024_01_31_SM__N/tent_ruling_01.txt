While the relief requested is unclear, the Court notes that this action was dismissed on March 3, 2023, an appeal filed by Plaintiff was dismissed on May 10, 2023, and that order became final on July 19, 2023. Thus, the Court lacks jurisdiction to rule on Plaintiff’s purported motion here. Accordingly, Plaintiff Leo Cono’s “Motion” for Leave to - “Amended Deposition” & - “Notice of Amended Deposition” (“Hearing Was Rescheduled”) – from “01/03/2024” to “02/02/2024”) is taken off calendar.
