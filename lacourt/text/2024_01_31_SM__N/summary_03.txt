The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to consolidate the two cases, 22SMCV00573 and 23SMCV03219, brought by The Cincinnati Insurance Company against Universal Appliances, Kitchens and Baths, Inc. dba Universal Appliance and Kitchen Center and Brende. The Judge has denied the motion, citing that the cases involve different parties, factual issues, and trial dates. The Judge has also noted that the motion and reply were filed in one case, while the opposition was filed in the other case, and has ordered the parties to file their briefs in the other case within ten days.

The Judge has also noted that the result of one case can inform the result in the other case through application of collateral estoppel.
