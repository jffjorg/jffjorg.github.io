And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to consolidate the two cases, Case No. 22SMCV00573 and Case No. 23SMCV03219. The plaintiff, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, had requested that the cases be consolidated due to their related nature and common questions of law and fact. However, the defendant, Universal Appliances, Kitchens and Baths, Inc. dba Universal Appliance and Kitchen Center, opposed the motion, citing concerns about prejudice to its due process rights. The court has reviewed the pleadings and finds that the cases are not suitable for consolidation due to the differences in parties, factual issues, and trial dates. The court has ordered the parties to file their briefs in the other case within ten days of the entry of this order.
