And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production propounded upon the defendants. The defendants, Yuan Shi and AI List Capital 1, LP, are ordered to provide supplemental responses to the identified interrogatories and requests for production within 20 days of entry of this order. The court finds that the defendants' original responses were incomplete or evasive, and that the plaintiff has made a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the issues through informal means. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's motions were not correctly filed and that many of the fees incurred were as a result of counsel's error in preparing the motions.
