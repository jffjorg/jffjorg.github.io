```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint is denied. The signed lease agreement provides that notices may be served at a designated address, and service was indeed effected at that address. As a commercial lease for rental of a sober living facility, the lease is subject to different notice provisions than residential leases. The court finds that the revision of statutory notice provisions is permissible in this case, citing Culver Center Partners East #1, L.P. v. Baja Fresh Westlake Village, Inc. (2010). The defendant is required to respond to the motion within 20 days.
