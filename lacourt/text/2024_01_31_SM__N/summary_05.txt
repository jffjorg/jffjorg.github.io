Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, Park Plaza Condominiums Homeowners Association. The defendant has demurred to all causes of action in the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Samuel Korn and Aliza Korn, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to comply with the pre-litigation alternative dispute resolution requirements of Civil Code section 5930 and that the first and sixth causes of action are insufficiently stated.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action, intentional infliction of emotional distress, without leave to amend, finding that the conduct alleged by the plaintiffs does not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the sixth cause of action, nuisance, without leave to amend, finding that the plaintiffs have not sufficiently stated facts that would allow the trier of fact to conclude that the alleged nuisance differs from their negligence claim.

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages, finding that the plaintiffs have failed to allege claims that would support an award of punitive damages. The judge has ordered the defendant to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 10 days of the entry of this order.

The ruling is based on the legal standards and authorities cited in the document, including California Rules of Court, Civil Code section 5930, and Code of Civil Procedure sections 116.220 and 116.221. The judge has also considered the facts alleged in the complaint and the arguments made by the parties.
