And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

**Summary**

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication on the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth Causes of Action of the First Amended Complaint. The motion was filed by the Plaintiff, Eidan Gamaty, against the Defendants, James Bekhor and James S. Bekhor Insurance Services, Inc.

The Fourth Cause of Action alleges that JSB owes the Plaintiff unpaid wages of $25,000 per month. The Judge found that there is a triable issue as to whether the Plaintiff was an employee of JSB or an independent contractor.

The Fifth Cause of Action alleges that JSB failed to pay the Plaintiff's wages and is liable for waiting time penalties. The Judge found that there is a triable issue as to whether the Plaintiff was an employee of JSB and therefore entitled to wages and waiting time penalties.

The Sixth Cause of Action alleges that JSB terminated the Plaintiff's employment without cause and in violation of public policy. The Judge found that there is a triable issue as to whether the Plaintiff was an employee of JSB and whether the termination was substantially motivated by a violation of public policy.

The Tenth Cause of Action alleges that the Defendants violated Penal Code section 496 by refusing to pay the Plaintiff back on loans and witholding wages and other payments. The Judge found that there is a triable issue as to whether the Defendants are liable for a violation of Penal Code section 496.

The Judge's ruling was based on the evidence presented and the applicable laws and statutes. The Court notes that the Plaintiff's separate statement failed to identify the causes of action at issue and that the Court did not consider the evidence submitted with the Plaintiff's reply.
