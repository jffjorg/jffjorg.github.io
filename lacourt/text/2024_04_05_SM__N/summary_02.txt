And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the plaintiff's application for default judgment to allow the plaintiff to submit supplemental evidence to support its claims. The judge has identified several deficiencies in the plaintiff's application, including the failure to omit filing and motion costs, the lack of proof of entitlement to damages, and the failure to prove emotional distress damages. The judge has instructed the plaintiff to amend its default judgment package to cure these deficiencies by June 6, 2024. The judge has also highlighted that even if the plaintiff had established claims for false imprisonment and private nuisance, the evidence provided does not support the claim of $80,000 in emotional distress damages.
