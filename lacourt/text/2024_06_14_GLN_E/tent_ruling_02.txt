In addition, Plaintiff has failed to meet and confer on this issue  in good faith.   This motion is based on  this notice, Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the supporting declaration  of Corey Tolmasoff, and the pleadings and records on file in this action, as  well as such oral or documentary evidence as may be represented at the hearing  on this motion.”   (Def.

(2) The  motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section  2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the  documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the  deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted  the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.   (CCP  §2025.450(a)-(b).)   ANALYSIS As  a preliminary matter, Defendant’s counsel does not explain in any clear manner  how it is complying with the requirements of 2025.450(a)-(b). Defendant simply  explains the background that led up to the filing this motion. Defendant leaves  it up to this Court to figure out how Defendant complied with each requirement  of 2025.450(a)-(b).   2025.450(a) “If,  after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,  director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an  organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a  valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to  proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically  stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the  party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s  attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,  electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the  deposition notice.” (CCP §2025.450(a).)   Here, Defendant explains that on July 25,  2023, Defendant served a Notice of Taking Deposition of Plaintiff and Request  for Production of Documents. (Tolmasoff Decl. ¶ 2.) The deposition was  scheduled for September 27, 2023.    On September 20, 2023, Plaintiff served  objections to the deposition notice for the deposition unilaterally being set  on a date and time that Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel was unavailable. Further,  Plaintiff asserted several objections to all 26 demands for production of  documents.   Defendant’s counsel states that on  September 20, 2023, December 6, 2023, and January 23, 2024, Defendant’s office  sent emails to Plaintiff’s counsel requesting dates for a deposition.  (Tolmasoff Decl. ¶ 4.) Defendant’s counsel states that Plaintiff’s counsel did  not respond to any of the emails requesting dates for a deposition.   2025.450(b)(1) “The  motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the  production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,  or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (CCP §2025.450(b)(1).)   Here, Defendant’s motion does not attempt  to set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying production of the 26  demands for production of documents in the deposition notice.   Discussion – 2025.450(b)(2) “The motion shall be accompanied by a meet  and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to  attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored  information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration  stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the  nonappearance.” (CCP §2025.450(b)(2).)   “A meet and confer declaration in support  of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an  informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (CCP §2016.040.)   To the extent that Defendant is attempting  to satisfy the meet and confer requirement, there is no declaration attached to  the motion discussing that a meet and confer occurred regarding the instant  motion.   Defendant’s declaration states that it  emailed Plaintiff’s counsel about new dates for the deposition, but none of  those emails, nor any documents contained in Defendant’s moving papers, indicate  that Defendant attempted to meet and confer regarding all the objections  asserted against the 26 demands for production of documents in the deposition  notice.   To the extent that Defendant was  attempting to satisfy the requirement about nonappearance, this requirement was  not met. Defendant was aware that Plaintiff objected to the deposition notice  and would not be appearing. Defendant did not inquire about a nonappearance,  Defendant sent emails about scheduling another date for a deposition since  Plaintiff asserted objections and Defendant was aware that the deposition would  not go forward.   TENTATIVE RULING The  Court will hear argument. Plaintiff did not oppose the instant motion.   SANCTIONS  “If a motion  under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction  under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who  noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the  deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make  the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP §2025.450(g)(1).) Defendant’s counsel does not request sanctions.Hearing Date: 06/14/2024 – 8:30am
Case No: 23GDCV01431
Trial Date: UNSET 
Case Name: MARIELENA MAESE, an individual; v. KIA AMERICA, INC., a California
Corporation, and DOES 1-10 inclusive

TENTATIVE
RULING ON MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES 

BACKGROUND
Plaintiff,
Marielena Maese, filed the instant action against Kia America, Inc. a
California Corporation on 7/10/2023 alleging three causes of action: (1)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty; (2) Violation of
Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty; and (3) Violation of the
Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2.

 

Plaintiff alleges that on June 28, 2022 she purchased
a 2022 Kia Forte and that the Subject Vehicle was delivered to Plaintiff with
serious defects and nonconformities to warranty and developed other serious
defects and nonconformities to warranty including, but not limited to,
electrical and structural system defects. (See Compl. ¶¶ 8, 10.)

RELIEF REQUESTED
“Plaintiff
MARIELENA MAESE (“Plaintiff”) will, and hereby do, moves for an order to strike
Defendant KIA AMERICA, INC. (“Defendant”) objections and compels further
responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Request
Nos. 1 through 31 (collectively, the “RFPs”).

Plaintiff brings this Motion pursuant to California
Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2031.310, and 2031.320, on the grounds that
Defendant’s objections are not Code-compliant, and that Defendant failed to
provide adequate responses to Plaintiff’s RFPs, which seek documents relevant
to the asserted Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”) causes of action.”

(Pl. Mot. 2.)

“On or about September 13, 2023, Plaintiff propounded
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, on Defendant seeking further
information to support the asserted claims. On or about October 31, 2023,
Defendant served verified responses to Plaintiff’s RFPs with boilerplate
objections that are not compliant California Code of Civil Procedure nor
California case law. Moreover, at this time, Defendant failed to
produce many of the responsive documents requested by Plaintiff.

In an attempt to avoid motion practice, Plaintiff, in
good faith, attempted to resolve this matter with Defendant; however, to date,
Defendant has not yet adequately responded to Plaintiff´s meet and confer
efforts. Given Defendant’s failure to adequately supplement its responses and
produce relevant documents, Plaintiff is now obligated to seek the Court’s
intervention.

Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks an order striking
Defendant’s meritless objections and compelling Defendant to provide further
responses and all responsive documents within ten calendar days from entry of
the Court’s Order as to Plaintiff´s Request for Production of Documents, Set
One, Request Nos. 1 through 31.

The Motion is based upon this Notice, the following
Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the Declaration of Gregory Sogoyan, Esq.,
the pleadings, and papers on file, and upon any other matters that may be
presented to the Court at the hearing.”

(Pl. Mot. p. 2-3.)

LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL FURTHER – REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION

Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.”  The Section
specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or defense of
the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,” and that discovery
“may be obtained of the identity and location of persons having knowledge of
any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence, description, nature,
custody, condition and location of any document, electronically stored
information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”



 

CCP § 2031.310(a) provides that a party demanding a document
inspection may move for an order compelling further responses to the demand if
the demanding party deems that:

“(1)   A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.

  (2)   A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.

  (3)  
An objection in the response is without merit or too general.”  



 

Under
CCP § 2031.310 (b)(1), “The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.”  

 

“In
the more specific context of a demand for production of a tangible thing, the
party who asks the trial court to compel production must show “good cause” for
the request—but unless there is a legitimate privilege issue or claim of
attorney work product, that burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of
relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)



PROCEDURAL ANALYSIS

45-Day Requirement
Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to
the demand. (CCP §2031.310(c).) 

Here, Plaintiff’s motion is timely.

Meet and Confer
“The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.” (CCP §2031.310(b)(2).)

Here, moving Plaintiff’s counsel met and conferred.
(See Sogoyan Decl. ¶¶ 20-21.)

TENTATIVE RULING
As
to RFPs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 30, Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses is GRANTED. Defendant’s objections did not
comply with 2031.240(b)-(c). Defendant’s objections are boilerplate.
Defendant’s objections are overruled. Defendant is to provide code-compliant,
verified responses, without objection, within ten calendar days from entry of
the Court’s Order.

As to RFPs 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 31, the Court fails to
see how Plaintiff demonstrated good cause. Under CCP § 2031.310 (b)(1), “The
motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.”  

 

“In the more
specific context of a demand for production of a tangible thing, the party who
asks the trial court to compel production must show “good cause” for the
request—but unless there is a legitimate privilege issue or claim of attorney
work product, that burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of
relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)

 

Many of these
requests pertain to documents dating back to 2017 and going until the present,
and many of the requests are not limited to the make, model, and year of the
subject vehicle. The subject vehicle is a 2022 Kia Forte. Plaintiff doesn’t attempt
to explain good cause in any understandable fashion.

 

Sanctions
Except
as provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP §2031.310(h).)

 

“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 

 

No sanctions were
requested by either party.
