And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production, with some exceptions. The judge finds that Defendant's objections to the deposition notice were not compliant with CCP ยง 2031.240(b)-(c) and overrules them. The judge grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to RFPs 1-14 and 30, but denies it for RFPs 15-31 because Plaintiff did not demonstrate good cause for the discovery sought. The judge does not impose sanctions on either party.
