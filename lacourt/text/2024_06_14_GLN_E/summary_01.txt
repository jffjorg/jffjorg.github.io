And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to amend a default judgment entered on May 6, 2024, to correct a clerical error in the Defendant's name. The Plaintiff, HEALTHY LIFE PHYSICAL THERAPY, INC., filed a complaint on April 7, 2023, and the default judgment was entered against the Defendants, including ERG HOME HEALTH PROVIDER, INC. and MARIA ISABEL BELZUNCE. The Plaintiff now moves to correct the clerical error in the Defendant's name, which was listed as "ERG HOME HEALTH, INC." instead of "ERG HOME HEALTH PROVIDER, INC." The Plaintiff argues that this clerical error prevents them from obtaining a Writ of Execution to enforce the judgment. The Court notes that the Plaintiff did not provide any case law to support their claim that the attorney's error is a "clerical mistake" under CCP § 473(d). The Court seeks clarification on what the Plaintiff means by their request to "file an amended judgment with the correct version of Defendant ERG's name attached as 'Exhibit B' in the Declaration of Michael Guloyan." The Court is considering denying the motion without prejudice or continuing the hearing based on the Plaintiff's failure to provide proper notice under CCP § 1005(b).
