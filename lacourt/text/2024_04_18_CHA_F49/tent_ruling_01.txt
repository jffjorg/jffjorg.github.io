BACKGROUND
 
On April 23, 2021, Plaintiff Lucy Holdings, LLC (“Plaintiff”
or “Lucy Holdings”) filed its original complaint in this action alleging a cause
of action for declaratory relief/quiet title against Defendants Krupe
Industries, Inc. (“Krupe”) and Witkin & Associates, LLC (“Witkin”),
alleging (1) Declaratory Relief/Quiet Title, and (2) Fraud. Subsequently, on
August 2, 2021, the Department F-51 court overruled Defendant Krupe’s demurrer
as to the declaratory relief/quiet title cause of action and sustained the demurrer,
with leave to amend, as to the fraud cause of action. 
 
On August 21, 2021, Plaintiff filed its First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”), asserting a single cause of action for declaratory
relief/quiet title. Subsequently, on November 5, 2021, the Department F-51
court overruled demurrer filed by Krupe and Witkin to Plaintiff’s FAC. (11/5/21
Minute Order.)
 
On November 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed the operative Second
Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendants Appel, Oscar Broederlow, Krupe,
Roshmore Development Inc., Cochran Inc., Witkin, and Does 1-10, alleging (1)
Declaratory Relief/Quiet Title, (2) Slander of Title, and (3) Conspiracy to
Slander Title. Subsequently, on March 9, 2023, the Department F-51 court
overruled Krupe’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s SAC. (3/9/23 Minute Order.) Following
this, Witkin and Krupe filed each’s Answer to SAC on March 10 and March 20,
2023, respectively. 
 
On June 21, 2023, the Department F-51 court overruled
Defendant Appel’s demurrer, ordering Appel to file an answer to the SAC within
30 days. (6/21/23 Minute Order.) 
 
On August 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed his Request for Entry of
Default against Appel, which was entered by the Department F-51 court on the
same day.
 
On January 22, 2024, Defendant Appel filed the instant Motion
to Set Aside/Vacate Defaulted entered on August 18, 2023.
 
No opposing papers have been received by the Court. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473
subdivision (b) provides, in pertinent part, that:
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve
a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order,
or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken .... No affidavit or declaration of
merits shall be required of the moving party. Notwithstanding any other
requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an application for
relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper
form, and is accompanied by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting
default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result
in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal
entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or
dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect. The court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an
attorney's affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable
compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties. However, this
section shall not lengthen the time within which an action shall be brought to
trial pursuant to Section 583.310.”
 
A.   
Motion to
Set Aside/Vacate
 
Mr. Craig L. Chisvin
(“Chisvin”), the attorney of record for the Moving Defendant, attests that the
default was entered as a result of him mistakenly overlooking the due date for
filing responsive pleading to Plaintiff’s SAC. (Chisvin Decl., ¶ 2.) Since the
Motion was made on January 22, 2024, less than six months after the entry of
the default on August 18, 2023, and is accompanied by attorney Chisvin’s
declaration of fault, relief is mandatory under Code of Civil Procedure section
473 subdivision (b).
 
“The court shall,
whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing
counsel or parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) “The court may properly order payment of costs or attorney
fees to the adverse party as compensation for loss or expense occasioned by the
granting of the section 473 motion.”¿ (Jade K. v. Viguri (1989) 210
Cal.App.3d 1459, 1474.)
 
Utilizing a lodestar
approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds
that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for
the work in preparing the Request for Entry of Default form is $900.00,
calculated at a reasonable hourly rate of $450 for 2 hours reasonably spent.
 
Appel is ordered to
separately file his Answer and Cross-Complaint. The Court notes that the
proposed Answer and Cross-Complaint, attached to the Motion, refer to an
incorrect case number. Additionally, it is the party’s responsibility to
correctly identify the judicial department and judicial officer. The foregoing
errors are to be corrected in the Answer and Cross-Complaint to be filed with
the Court. 
 
Accordingly, the Court SETS
ASIDE and VACATES the default entered on August 18, 2023, as to Defendant
Eliezer Appel.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant
Eliezer Appel’s Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Default is
GRANTED.
 
Defendant Eliezer Appel is ordered to file his Answer and
Cross-Complaint within 10 days.
 
Defendant’s attorney of record, Mr. Craig L. Chisvin,
is ordered to pay $900.00 compensatory fees to Plaintiff within 10 days.
 
Moving
party is to give notice.
