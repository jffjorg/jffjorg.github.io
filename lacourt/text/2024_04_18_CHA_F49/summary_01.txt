The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to set aside and vacate the default is GRANTED. The default was entered due to the attorney's mistake, and the court finds that the attorney's affidavit of fault is sufficient to grant relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivision (b). The court orders the attorney to pay $900.00 in compensatory fees to the opposing party.
