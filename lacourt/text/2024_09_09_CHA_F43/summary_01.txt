And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to set aside and vacate the default judgment entered against her. The Defendant claims that she never received the complaint because she does not live at the address where service was supposedly made. The Defendant's sister has submitted a declaration confirming that it was she, not the Defendant, who lived at that address. The Judge has considered the laws and precedents related to setting aside default judgments and has determined that the default judgment is void because the Defendant was not properly served with the summons and complaint. The Defendant is ordered to re-file her answer through the court's electronic filing system within 30 days.
