And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for attorney fees in the amount of $1,000. The defendant is the prevailing party in an unlawful detainer case because the court granted his motion for summary judgment. The rental agreement between the plaintiff and defendant provides for attorney fees for the prevailing party, up to a maximum of $1,000. The defendant's attorneys incurred fees in excess of $1,000, but are only requesting $1,000 because it is the maximum amount allowed by the rental agreement. The judge finds that the requested fees are reasonable and grants the motion in full.
