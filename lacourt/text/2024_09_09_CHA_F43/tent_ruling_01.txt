SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On September
26, 2019, Plaintiff Bank of America, N.A. (Plaintiff) filed this collections
action against Defendant Angelica S. Naccarati (Defendant).
 
On December 16,
2019, Plaintiff filed proof of personal service indicating that Defendant was
served at 2923 Montrose Ave. Apt. 101, La Crescenta, CA 91214. Thereafter,
default judgment was entered against Defendant on January 6, 2020.
 
Defendant
argues in her motion to set aside default, filed on August 12, 2024, that she
never received the complaint, as she does not live at 2923 Montrose Ave. She
claims that this address is where her sister used to live. Plaintiff claims
that she has lived in La Canada Flintridge for the last 20 years at 4843 Ocean
View Blvd., La Canada Flintridge, CA 91011. While the proof of service
indicates that Defendant was served via personal service at 2923 Montrose Ave.,
Defendant claims that she did not become aware of this lawsuit until her
employer was served with an order for garnishment in late December 2023.  Defendant’s sister submitted a declaration
confirming that it was she, not the defendant, who lived at the address where
service supposedly took place.  Defendant’s attorney filed his appearance in
this case in January 2024.
 
No response has
been filed by Plaintiff.
 
ANALYSIS
Defendant filed
this motion in part pursuant to CCP Section 473 (d), which allows the court to
vacate a default judgment that is void because the defendant had not been
properly served with the summons and complaint. 
(Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540, 544.)
 
The law favors
hearings on the merits, so any doubts as to the application of section 473
should be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default. (See Shapiro
v. Clark (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1139-1140.) Furthermore, a trial
court has wide discretion to grant relief under CCP § 473(d). (Berman v.
Klassman (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 900, 909.)
 
Based on the
declarations of defendant and her sister, it is undisputed that defendant was
never served with the summons and complaint. 
As a result, the default judgment is void.
 
CONCLUSION
Defendant’s
motion to set aside and vacate entry of default and default judgment is
granted. Although defendant filed a form general denial with her motion, she
must re-file her answer through the court’s electronic filing system within 30
days.
 
Moving party to
give notice.
