And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike an unverified answer filed by SR Hospitality Group LLC (the defendant) in a lawsuit brought by Venessa Garcia (the plaintiff). The plaintiff seeks to strike the answer because it was not verified, while the defendant argues that the motion should be denied due to a failure to meet and confer and because the court only ordered it to file an answer, without specifying that it had to be verified.

The judge rejects the defendant's arguments and grants the motion to strike. The court finds that the defendant is required to verify its answer, as stated in Code of Civil Procedure section 446 (a), and that the fact that the court's minute order did not specify verification does not excuse the defendant's failure to do so. The judge orders the defendant to file an amended verified answer to the remaining operative portions of the original complaint within 20 days.
