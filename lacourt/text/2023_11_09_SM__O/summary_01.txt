Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Hartford Fire Insurance Company, has moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication on the second cause of action for written contractual indemnity. The judge has denied the motion, finding that it is procedurally deficient. The plaintiff failed to specify which causes of action it was seeking to summarily adjudicate in its notice of motion. Additionally, the judge found that resolving the issues as framed by the plaintiff would require the court to summarily decide factual issues, such as whether a demand was made on the bond and whether the demand for collateral was made in good faith and with reasonable discretion. The court also found that the plaintiff cannot summarily adjudicate a defendant's liability for breach of contract and leave the calculation of the amount of those damages for resolution at trial.
