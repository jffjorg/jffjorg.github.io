Plaintiffs alleged they formed a business partnership with Defendants wherein Plaintiffs permitted Defendants to use Plaintiffs’ “Kai Ramen” brand for a restaurant enterprise, and in return Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiffs a share of Defendants’ profits. Plaintiffs alleged Defendants stopped paying out profits to Plaintiffs but kept using Plaintiffs’ brand for their restaurant.            Defendant Y’s OT Corporation (“YOC”) cross-complained against plaintiff Tomoaki Nishimura (“Nishimura”) on October 12, 2022 for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duties. YOC alleges it and Nishimura “entered into a written contract by which the parties agreed to jointly operate [YOC’s] downtown Los Angeles restaurant under the ‘Kai Ramen’ name, and ... in return for [Nishimura’s] promise to advance operating costs and to supervise and execute the business operations, the parties agreed to equally share the profits of the new business.” (XC, ¶ 4.) Nishimura breached the parties’ agreement by failing to provide certain business resources agreed upon in their contract, specifically “by failing and refusing to pay the expenses of the business operations ... and by converting and misappropriating income and assets of the business.” (XC, ¶ 7.)            On April 11, 2024, YOC moved for terminating sanctions because Nishimura had failed to respond to discovery orders and “otherwise disappeared from this action.” (04-11-2024 Ruling, p. 1.) The Court struck Nishimura’s complaint as to Defendants, and it entered Nishimura’s default on YOC’s cross-complaint.            Nishimura has neither filed any documents nor appeared since the Court’s ruling on April 11, 2024. YOC filed documents in support of default judgment on July 26, 2024, August 29, 2024, and September 5, 2024. The Court now conducts its Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Default Judgment Package. LEGAL STANDARD            Judgment may be entered against a defendant by default where “the defendant has been served, other than by publication, and no answer, demurrer, [or other responsive paper] has been filed with the clerk of the court within the time specified in the summons ... .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 585(b).) In such cases, the clerk shall enter default upon plaintiff’s written application and the plaintiff “thereafter may apply to the court for the relief demanded in the complaint.” (Ibid.)A party seeking a default judgment on declarations must use the mandatory form CIV-100 and also file with the clerk (1) a brief summary of the case, (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support, (3) interest computations as necessary, (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements, (5) a declaration of non-military status, (6) a proposed form of judgment, (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought, (8) exhibits as necessary, and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees, if they are sought. (Cal. R. Ct., Rule 3.1800(a).) DISCUSSIONProcedural Requisites            Code of Civil Procedure Section 585 does not apply.            The terms of Code of Civil Procedure section 585(b) do not apply. The Court entered Nishimura’s default upon YOC’s motion, not upon YOC’s written application to the clerk. The Court presumes YOC complied with the Court’s April 11, 2024 order for YOC to give notice of the ruling to Nishimura. YOC also mailed him copy of its CIV-100 Request for Judgment. Nishimura received notice of his default.            Rule of Court 3.1800 is not fully satisfied.            YOC’s filings satisfy Rule of Court 3.1800(a)(1)-(4) and (7)-(9). The confessed allegations in the cross-complaint, paired with the declaration of Yoshiyuki Ohshima and its exhibits, establish Nishimura’s liability. (See CRC 3.1800(a)(1)-(2), (8).) YOC does not claim prejudgment interest or costs, so no computation is necessary. (See id., subds. (a)(3)-(4).) YOC’s September 5, 2024 Request for Dismissal is somewhat unclear because it did not check box (1)(b)(6) indicating the dismissal applied to Roes; to avoid confusion, the Court now orders all Roe cross-defendants dismissed, effective September 5, 2024. (See id., subd. (a)(7). YOC does not seek attorneys’ fees, so no request is required. (Id., subd. (a)(9).)            YOC did not satisfy subdivisions (a)(5). Counsel submitted an outdated CIV-100 form that does not contain a complete declaration of nonmilitary status. (Id., subd. (a)(5). The updated form CIV-100 requires the signatory to state the basis of his knowledge regarding the defendant’s military service status. With no such attestation, the Court cannot award judgment.            YOC also did not satisfy subdivision (a)(6). A blank JUD-100 form is not a proposed form of judgment.            Notice of Damages            To inform supplemental filings, the Court notes that YOC has claimed damages in excess of those claimed in its cross-complaint. The Court cannot award YOC more than what was claimed in its pleadings. (See Sass v. Cohen (2020) 10 Cal.5th 861, 863 (Sass), quoting Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 824; see also Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1521 [“ ‘[A] default judgment greater than the amount specifically demanded is void as beyond the trial court's jurisdiction.’ ”].) If YOC’s calculation includes prejudgment interest, a separate calculation must be submitted. (CRC 3.1800(a)(3) [“Interest computations as necessary”].)            CONCLUSIONThe Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Default Judgment is CONTINUED to ___________________, [2024/2025], for Cross-Complainant to correct its default package.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
