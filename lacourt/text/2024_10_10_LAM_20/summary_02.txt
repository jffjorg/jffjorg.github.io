And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Kevin C. Brazile has issued a tentative ruling on two motions in the case of Jane Doe v. Religious Technology Center, et al. The first motion is a motion for order requiring Plaintiff Jane Doe to substitute her true name, which has been denied. The court finds that Plaintiff's need for anonymity outweighs any prejudice and the public's interest in knowing her identity.

The second motion is a motion to seal photographs of Plaintiff Jane Doe, which has been granted. The court finds that an overriding interest exists that overcomes the right of public access to the record, and that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored to ensure that Plaintiff's identity and sensitive personal information are not disclosed.

The court also notes that the photographs set forth Plaintiff's identity, which is material contained in documents that are subject to an existing motion to seal. The court therefore grants Plaintiff's motion to seal.
