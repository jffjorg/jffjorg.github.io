And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's special motion to strike the complaint is granted. The defendant is the co-host of a talk show and made comments about the plaintiff's business activities, which the plaintiff is claiming are defamatory. The defendant argues that the comments were made in a public forum and concerned an issue of public interest, and therefore are protected speech under California Civil Procedure Code section 425.16.

The judge found that the defendant had met the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute by showing that the comments were made in a public forum and concerned an issue of public interest. The judge also found that the plaintiff had failed to meet its burden of showing a probability of success on the merits by failing to present any evidence or arguments in opposition to the motion.

The judge granted the defendant's motion to strike the complaint, which means that the complaint will be dismissed unless the plaintiff can show that it has minimal merit. The judge encouraged the parties to appear by video conference rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
