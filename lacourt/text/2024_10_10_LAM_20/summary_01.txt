And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a non-appearance case review for a default judgment in the case of Nishimura, et al. v. Yanagi, et al. and Cross-Action. The case involves a dispute between Y'S OT Corporation and Tomoaki Nishimura, who failed to respond to discovery orders and was served with a default judgment. Y'S OT Corporation filed a request for judgment and submitted declarations and exhibits in support of the default judgment.

The Court notes that Y'S OT Corporation did not fully comply with the requirements for a default judgment, specifically failing to include a complete declaration of nonmilitary status and a proposed form of judgment. The Court also notes that Y'S OT Corporation claimed damages in excess of those claimed in its cross-complaint, and that the Court cannot award more than what was claimed in the pleadings.

The Court concludes that the non-appearance case review is continued to a future date to allow Y'S OT Corporation to correct its default package. If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
