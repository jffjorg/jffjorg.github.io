Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer to the complaint filed by the defendant, Dream Motor Cars, in a case involving breach of contract, breach of implied covenant, and fraud. The court sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action for fraud, finding that the plaintiff's allegations do not meet the specificity requirement for fraud claims. The court also sustains the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract, finding that the plaintiff's allegations do not include the necessary element of their own performance. However, the court overrules the demurrer to the second cause of action for breach of implied covenant, finding that the plaintiff's allegations do more than simply state a breach of contract. The court grants the defendant 30 days to amend its demurrer after the plaintiff has an opportunity to amend its complaint.
