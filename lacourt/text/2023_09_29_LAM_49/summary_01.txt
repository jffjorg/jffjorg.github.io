Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer to the complaint filed by the defendant, Dream Motor Cars, in a case involving breach of contract, breach of implied covenant, and fraud. The court sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action for fraud, finding that the plaintiff's allegations do not meet the specificity requirement for fraud claims. The court also sustains the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract, finding that the plaintiff's allegations do not include the necessary element of their own performance. However, the court overrules the demurrer to the second cause of action for breach of implied covenant, finding that the plaintiff's allegations do more than simply state a breach of contract. The court grants the defendant 30 days to amend its demurrer after the plaintiff has an opportunity to amend its complaint.

The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to amend the complaint to include all necessary elements, including their performance or excuse for nonperformance, to support the breach of contract claim.

The case 23STCV01185 is scheduled for a hearing on September 29, 2023, before Judge Randolph M. Hammock in the Superior Court. Plaintiffs Jong In Park and Howard J. Han claim that Defendant Dream Motor Cars breached a contract, failed to act in good faith, and committed fraud in a purchase agreement involving a 2015 Mercedes Benz GL Class. 

Defendant's Demurrer to the Complaint asserts that Plaintiffs have not met their pleading obligations with regards to claims one (breach of contract) and three (fraud), thus seeking their dismissal with an allowance to the plaintiffs of 30 days within which they might submit their re-amended and appropriately-drafted First Cause of Action complaint claim to allow determination for all associated relevant evidentiary submissions.



It remains possible to proceed if counsel want with demurrers presented here still so order, having found  an inapt form given these present words submitted theretowards claims to answer which this law shall resolve so finding thus on number 3 Breach claim being thrown-out thus will make those things real only one part as "with permission or re-modifying for one reason claim and a date after claim submitted " that number still good."

Summary:
This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer to the complaint in the case of Jong In Park and Howard J. Han v. Dream Motor Cars. Plaintiffs purchased a 2015 Mercedes Benz GL Class from Defendant and allege Defendant failed to pay for a warranty on the vehicle and failed to disclose a prior accident. Plaintiffs have brought causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud. The court has sustained Defendant's demurrer to the first and third causes of action with leave to amend within 30 days, while overruling the demurrer to the second cause of action. The court finds that Plaintiffs have not alleged the claim of fraud with specificity and have not adequately shown their performance under the contract for the breach of contract claim. However, the court rules that Plaintiffs have alleged conduct beyond breach of the contractual duty in the breach of implied covenant claim. Additionally, the court notes that Plaintiffs should remedy the error of improper party identification in the complaint when amending.
