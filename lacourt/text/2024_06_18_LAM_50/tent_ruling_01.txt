[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default
judgment against Defendant Mystery Baking Company, LLC aka Mystery Baking
Company. Plaintiff requests judgment in the total amount of $54,562.29, comprising
$46,804.98 demanded in the Complaint, $5,360.13 in
interest, $603.04 in costs, and $1,794.14 in attorney fees. 
The
Court notes that Plaintiff seeks interest from the period of February 1, 2023
to March 15, 2024. (Gowey Decl., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff’s counsel’s supporting
declaration states that there are 418 days between these dates. (Gowey Decl., ¶
5.) However, it appears that there are 408 days between February 1, 2023 and
March 15, 2024. Otherwise, the Court finds that
Plaintiff has sufficiently supported its request with the submitted
declarations and evidence.
Plaintiff may file a
revised request for court judgment (Form CIV-100), revised proposed judgment
(Form JUD-100), and a supplemental declaration to address the above-referenced
defect pertaining to the requested interest. If the foregoing defect is
corrected before the hearing, the Court will grant Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment.
