[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Brian Whitaker (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment against Defendant
Byte to Bite (California), LLC. Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount of
$9,710.32, comprising $4,000.00 in damages, $1,770.32 in costs, and $3,940.00 in
attorney fees.
The
Court notes a few defects with the submitted default judgment package.
First,
Plaintiff
seeks $200.00 in “other” unspecified costs. It is unclear if such unspecified
costs are allowable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. 
Second,
Plaintiff’s “Application For Default Judgment By Court” filed with the request provides,
inter alia, that “Plaintiff seeks an order requiring Defendant to
provide accessible dining surfaces at the facility, in compliance with the
ADAAG.” (Application at p. 9:13-14.) However, Plaintiff’s request for court
judgment (Form CIV-100) and proposed judgment (Form JUD-100) do not appear to
indicate that Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief. 
The
Court also notes that Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges that Plaintiff seeks, inter
alia, 
“injunctive relief, compelling Defendants to remove all presently existing architectural barriers
as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Unruh Civil Rights Act.”
(Compl., p. 7:4-6.) This does not appear to exactly match the injunctive relief
Plaintiff seeks in his “Application For Default Judgment By Court,” which is
discussed above. The Court notes that that “¿[a]
complaint…shall contain…the following:…(2) A demand for judgment for the relief
to which the pleader claims to be entitled. If the recovery of money or damages
is demanded, the amount demanded shall be stated.¿” (¿Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10, subd. (a)¿.) ¿Code of Civil Procedure section 580, subdivision (a)¿ “¿limits a trial
court’s jurisdiction to grant relief on a default judgment to the amount stated
in the complaint.¿” (¿Dhawan v. Biring (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 963, 968¿.) “[I]n all
default judgments the demand sets a ceiling on recovery.” (Finney v. Gomez (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 527, 534.)
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. The Court will discuss further proceedings with Plaintiff at
the hearing.
