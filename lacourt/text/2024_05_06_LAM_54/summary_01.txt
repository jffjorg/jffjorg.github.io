Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the first amended complaint and the motion to strike. The demurrer, filed by the defendants, was based on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to join the actual perpetrator of the shooting, David Roman, as a necessary party. The judge ruled that this ground was insufficient to sustain the demurrer. The defendants also demurred to the causes of action for negligence, alleging that the defendants did not owe the plaintiffs a duty of care. The judge ruled that the allegations in the complaint showed that the defendants knew of violent activity in or around the premises and selectively allowed patrons into the premises without checking for ID or weapons based on their relationships with security personnel. Therefore, the judge overruled the demurrer to the complaint.

Regarding the motion to strike, the defendants sought to strike the prayers for punitive damages and references to online reviews of the defendants' establishment. The judge denied the motion to strike, ruling that the allegations in the complaint showed that the defendants knew of violent activity in or around the premises and selectively allowed patrons into the premises without checking for ID or weapons based on their relationships with security personnel.
