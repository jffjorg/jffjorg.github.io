  - "There are degrees of procedural unconscionability. At one end of the spectrum are contracts that have been freely negotiated by roughly equal parties, in which there is no procedural unconscionability. Contracts of adhesion that involve surprise or other sharp practices lie on the other end of the spectrum." (Gentry v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 443, 469)
```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court rules that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration is granted. The action is stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration. The arbitration agreement executed by the plaintiff on October 26, 2022, is enforceable. The court finds that the agreement is not procedurally unconscionable, despite being an adhesion contract. The court also finds that the agreement is not substantively unconscionable, despite being infinite in time and scope, and containing a PAGA and class waiver. The court concludes that the plaintiff has not established that the agreement is highly substantively unconscionable.
