And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application to shorten time and advance the hearing on the application for a writ of attachment. The plaintiff believes that the defendant will not be able to satisfy the judgment and is seeking to obtain a writ of attachment to secure a potential judgment. However, the judge has determined that the plaintiff has had ample time to seek a writ of attachment since the case was filed in 2020 and has not provided sufficient evidence to support its application. The judge has also declined to consider the plaintiff's counsel's assertion that the defendant is concealing assets or would not satisfy a judgment.
