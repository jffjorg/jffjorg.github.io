Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions in limine filed by the parties. The judge has granted some of the motions and denied others.

The judge has granted Plaintiffs' Motion to Preclude Evidence of Lorenzo Ruiz's adult children being gang members, finding that the evidence is irrelevant and more prejudicial than probative.

The judge has denied Plaintiffs' Motion to Exclude Evidence of Lorenzo Ruiz's exposure to Agent Orange, finding that the evidence could be relevant to life expectancy and can be mentioned briefly at trial without delving into U.S. military policy and actions in Vietnam.

The judge has granted Defendant Pneumo Abex's Motion to Exclude Evidence from the Saranac experiments, finding that the evidence is deemed made and granted pursuant to the July 8, 2022 CMO.

The judge has denied Defendant Autozone West's Motion to Prevent Experts from Telling the Jury the Contents or Titles of Hearsay Documents, finding that the motion is too vague and that some of the documents upon which the experts rely may be otherwise admissible.

The judge has granted Defendant Autozone West's Motion to Exclude the Use of the Term "Victim", finding that the use of the term suggests someone at fault for harming the victim.

The judge has granted Defendant Autozone West's Motion to Exclude the Don't Blow It Video and any evidence referring to the video as hearsay, unscientific, and prejudicial, but allowed the video to be mentioned briefly at trial without delving into U.S. military policy and actions in Vietnam.

The judge has denied Defendant Autozone West's Motion to Exclude Evidence of a 1986 document prepared by the EPA, finding that the document could be relevant to notice of the dangers of asbestos pre-2007.

The judge has denied Defendant Autozone West's Motion to Exclude References to a 1989 proposed EPA ban, finding that the evidence may go to notice or knowledge.

The judge has denied Defendant Western Auto Supply's Motion to Exclude Studies and Videos from Material Analytical Sciences, finding that the work simulations are not similar to Plaintiff's exposure.

The judge has denied Defendant Western Auto Supply's Motion to Exclude Photographs and Documents related to Wizard Guardian brakes, finding that the evidence may be relevant.

The judge has denied Defendant Wyeth Holdings' Motion to Exclude Documents dated after Lorenzo Ruiz's last date of exposure, finding that the document does not state that it listed only current suppliers.

The judge has denied Defendant The Pep Boys' Motion to Exclude Evidence about its compliance with 1972 OSHA labeling regulations, finding that the motion is too vague.

The judge has denied Defendant The Pep Boys' Motion to Exclude Evidence about dust levels based on witnesses' visual observations, finding that the evidence may be relevant.

The judge has denied Defendant Genuine Parts Company's Motion to Exclude Undated Photographs used in a deposition, finding that the photographs may be relevant and can be authenticated at trial.
