 Case Number:  23STCV11756    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTIONS IN LIMINE
Defendants’ MIL No. 1
            Defendant
Union Carbide moves to exclude evidence of its relationship with Dow
Chemical.  This motion is too vague.  If at trial Plaintiff asks questions about
Dow Chemical that are irrelevant, Defendant can object at that time.  The motion is denied without prejudice to
objections at trial.
Defendants’ MIL No. 2
Defendant Union Carbide
moves to exclude evidence of working conditions at its facilities as irrelevant
and unduly prejudicial.  This motion is
too vague.  If “working conditions”
refers to something like wage and hour violations, that would be
irrelevant.  However, if it refers to
something like workers being exposed to asbestos, the evidence could be
relevant.  For example, the evidence of
asbestos exposure at the facilities could be relevant to knowledge or notice.
            The
motion is denied without prejudice to objections at trial.
Defendants’ MIL No. 3
Union Carbide moves to
exclude any reference to incidents where people died or were injured as a
result of Union Carbide’s chemicals other than asbestos.  Incidents not involving asbestos are
irrelevant, more prejudicial than probative, and would be unduly time
consuming.
            The
motion is granted.
            The
moving party is to give notice.
