And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on three motions in limine filed by Union Carbide. The first motion seeks to exclude evidence of Union Carbide's relationship with Dow Chemical, which the judge finds too vague and denies without prejudice to objections at trial. The second motion seeks to exclude evidence of working conditions at Union Carbide's facilities, which the judge also finds too vague and denies without prejudice to objections at trial. The third motion seeks to exclude any reference to incidents where people died or were injured as a result of Union Carbide's chemicals other than asbestos, which the judge grants because the judge believes the incidents are irrelevant, more prejudicial than probative, and would be unduly time consuming. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
