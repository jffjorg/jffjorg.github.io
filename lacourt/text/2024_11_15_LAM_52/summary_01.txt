And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court finds that the three cases are related and grants Perry Lazar's motion to deem cases related and consolidate cases. The cases involve disputes over real estate transactions and title insurance coverage, and consolidating the actions for trial will serve the interest of judicial economy. The court sets aside an order granting in part a motion to tax costs filed by In Action Realtors, Inc.

The court also grants Odalis C. Suarez's motion to set aside the order granting in part the motion to tax costs, allowing her to recover $8,402.55 in costs from In Action Realtors, Inc. The court finds that Suarez's mistake in not submitting evidence did not prejudice In Action Realtors, Inc., and that she acted with reasonable diligence in seeking relief.

The court consolidates the trials in the three cases: Plone Trust, et al. v. Kalousd Pandazos, et al., No. 21STCV19845; Perry Lazar v. Brad Korb, et al., No. 21STCV34102; and Perry Lazar, et al. v. First American Title Insurance Company, et al., No. 22STCV11182. The court orders Perry Lazar to file a report setting forth all the claims at issue in this consolidated action by December 3, 2024.
