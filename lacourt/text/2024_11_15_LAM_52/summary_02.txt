Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The defendants, Dick Browning, Inc., Matthew Browning, Kent C. Browning, Peter Browning, and Scott Dickinson, moved to compel arbitration of the employment dispute between them and plaintiff George Langarcia. The judge found that the defendants met their burden of showing that Langarcia agreed to arbitrate employment disputes and that the agreement is enforceable despite several arguments raised by Langarcia, including a provision limiting the court's authority to stay or deny arbitration, lack of provisions stating the arbitrator has the power to award all relief available in court, and the agreement not being mutual. The judge also rejected Langarcia's argument that the individual defendants cannot enforce the agreement because they have no admissible evidence that they are owners or officers of the corporation. The judge granted the defendants' motion and ordered Langarcia to arbitrate this action against defendants, staying the entire action pending resolution of the parties' arbitration proceeding.
