And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to expunge a notice of pendency of action and request for attorney fees. The motion was filed by the Union Home Loan Profit Sharing Plan, et al. against Pure Energy 369, LLC, Arthur Becerra, Melina Becerra, and Antonio Becerra. The notice of pendency of action was filed in a different action, Pure Energy 369, LC v. Union Home Loan, et al., No. 23STCV20798, which was pending in Department 78 before Judge Feeney. The court finds that the motion is defective because it was not filed in the correct action. The court also finds that the plaintiffs acted with substantial justification in filing the motion, despite its technical defect. As a result, the court denies the motion to expunge the notice of pendency of action and orders the plaintiffs to file a notice of related case in this action and the previous action. The defendants are awarded $3,825 in attorney fees for opposing the motion.
