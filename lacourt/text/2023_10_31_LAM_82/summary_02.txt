And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a tentative ruling on a case involving the use of force by a police officer (Petitioner) during the arrest of an individual named Miguel. The officer used a wrist lock on Miguel, which caused him to scream in pain. Despite the officer's assertion that pain does not necessarily mean injury, the judge finds that Miguel's screams and assertion that he was being hurt constitute a complaint of injury, which makes the use of the wrist lock reportable under department policy. The judge also notes that the officer used overt exertion to maintain control over Miguel, which is also reportable. Additionally, the judge reviews the evidence of Miguel's suicidal ideation during a medical examination, but finds it unclear how this relates to the case. Overall, the judge's tentative ruling suggests that the officer's use of force was not justified and may have been excessive.
