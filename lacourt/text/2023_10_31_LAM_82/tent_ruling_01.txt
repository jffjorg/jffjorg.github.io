[TENTATIVE] RULING ON VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY
  WRIT OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 82 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
Nicholas Landry petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondent City of
Los Angeles and Michel Moore to set aside the termination of petitioner, remove
the discipline on specified counts from his personnel file, and restore him to
his prior position of Police Officer with back pay.
 
I.       Factual Background
 
Petitioner
Nicholas Landry was a police officer employed by Los Angeles Police Department
(“LAPD” or “Department”) for 15 years until he was terminated for misconduct in
March 2021. (AR 317, 1050.) The Department alleged
that petitioner committed misconduct on or about February 9, 2020 with respect to
the arrest of an intoxicated domestic violence suspect. (AR 15-20.)
 
             On February 9, 2020, at approximately 21:00
hours, petitioner and his partner, Officer Mark Flores, responded to a domestic
violence radio call at 1911 W. 2nd Street. (AR 327, 333, 918.) At the scene,
the officers met with Person Reporting (“PR”), who told the officers that her
ex-boyfriend, Domingo Miguel, was intoxicated and banged on her windows. Miguel
also took her glasses. (AR 110, 609.) PR wanted Miguel to leave the location.
(AR 360, 375.) 
 
The
officers then encountered Miguel sitting on the steps of the apartment
building. (AR 931.) Miguel acknowledged that he broke PR’s glasses but said he
did not have them. (AR 366, 931.) The officers asked him to leave the area, but
Miguel refused. (AR 611, 931.) The officers told him that he was committing
trespass. (AR 377, 931.) Miguel then stood up and yelled and cursed at the
officers several times as he walked toward the officers. (AR 931.) Miguel was
agitated and belligerent, so the officers repeatedly ordered him to turn around
so they could restrain him. (AR 111, 931.) Miguel instead dared the officers to
tase him, removing his shirt and belt and yelling profanities at the officers.
(AR 111, 931.) 
 
When
Miguel was briefly distracted, Officer Flores quickly grabbed his right arm. (AR
395, 931.) Miguel then attempted to turn and face Officer Flores. (AR 931.)
Petitioner then grabbed Miguel’s left arm, after which Officer Flores
handcuffed Miguel. Miguel went down to the ground. (AR 395, 931.) Miguel then called
out for a supervisor six times. (AR 138, 448, 925, Dept. Ex. 5, video, File
647F, at 9:01.) The officers did not call a supervisor. (AR 138, 448.) The
officers arrested Miguel for public intoxication pursuant to Penal Code section
647(f). (AR 931.) 
 
The
officers attempted to place Miguel in a police vehicle. (AR 445.) Miguel attempted
to walk away. (AR 445.) To control Miguel, petitioner applied a “wrist lock” to
Miguel’s arms. (AR 445. 210 [“joint lock” and “wrist lock” are interchangeable].)
Miguel yelled in pain. (AR 445.) 
 
At
the Rampart station, Miguel was seen by the Watch Commander and indicated that
he was not sick, ill, or injured and had no questions. (AR 216-17.) 
 
At
22:45 hours, the officers transported Miguel to Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”)
for the medical screening and a hold for him to sober up. (AR 460, 932.) On the
way to MDC, Miguel told the officers that he was suicidal and that he would
tell the MDC staff that he was suicidal so that he could be transported to Twin
Towers jail. (AR 460, 479, 932.) 
 
At
the MDC, the officers sat Miguel on a bench while they prepared the paperwork a
few feet away. Miguel at some point yelled out, “I’m suicidal. I don’t want to
be with you motherfuckers. I don’t want to be here.” (AR 925, Dept. Ex. 5,
video, File 647f(1) at 13:43-46.) On the medical screening form, petitioner
documented that Miguel was not suicidal. (AR 959.) 
 
In
addition, when the MDC medical staff examined Miguel, he told them that he was
suicidal. (AR 873.) Miguel was verbally abusive and spat at the officers. (AR
462.) The MDC medical staff refused to book Miguel and instructed the officers
to transport him to a contract hospital, White Memorial Medical Center, because
of his increased heart rate. (AR 457, 482, 484, 932.) The officers dropped off
Miguel at the corner of Boyle Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue, which was
approximately 20-30 yards away from White Memorial Medical Center, and
suggested he go to the hospital. (AR 40, 41, 463, 925, Dept. 5, video, File
647f(2), at 4:41-6:10.) According to petitioner, Miguel had calmed down and had
refused medical care when the officers took him to MDC. (AR 497-98, 674.) 
 
For
the next hour, the officers did not update their status on their in-vehicle
log. (AR 184, 329.) 
 
Meanwhile,
Miguel walked into the emergency department of White Memorial and was observed
by the hospital staff to be shirtless, intoxicated, and aggressive. (AR 39.) They
notified their security, a 16-year Los Angeles County Sheriff Deputy, Jorge
Garcia. (AR 37-39) Garcia observed that Miguel was very intoxicated and
confused. (AR 39.) Miguel did not know where he was or how he got there and was
unable to care for himself. (AR 39, 40, 43.) The hospital staff then called 911
and requested an LAPD patrol unit to respond. (AR 42.) At 01:35 hours, in
addition to Hollenbeck division officers, Sgt. Calderon from Rampart division
responded to the hospital. (AR 530, 532.) She observed Miguel to have slurred
speech, to be intoxicated and unable to stand on his own or take care of
himself. (AR 535, 536, 540.)
 
At 02:02 hours, a Rampart
patrol unit transported Miguel to the Los Angeles County USC Medical Center
jail ward (“USCMC”). (AR 877.) Sgt. Calderon went to USCMC and called petitioner
and Officer Flores to respond so that they could re-arrest Miguel. (AR 515, 537.)

 
Approximately five hours
later, the USCMC medical staff cleared Miguel for booking. (AR 962.) The
officers re-arrested Miguel, transported him back to MDC, and booked him for Penal
Code § 647(f). (AR 518, 962.) 
 
Petitioner and Officer
Flores then returned to Rampart station and filled out an arrest report. (AR
518.) Officer Flores prepared the report with petitioner’s assistance. (AR 706,
931.) Petitioner was sent home before Officer Flores completed the report. (AR
451.) The arrest report stated that both officers can testify to all contents
of the report. (AR 933.) 
 
Officer Flores did not
check the box indicating a domestic violence incident in the report. (AR 930.) The
arrest report also did not mention a battery, theft of PR’s glasses, or a
non-categorical use of force. (AR 930-33.) The arrest report further stated
that Miguel was taken into custody “without incident.” (AR 931.) The arrest
report indicated that Miguel said that he was suicidal. (AR 932.) Sgt. Calderon
never asked petitioner to complete a supplemental report regarding the use of
force. (AR 553-54.)
 
Petitioner was relieved
of duty in January 2021. (AR 694.) Petitioner was afforded a Board of Rights
hearing, which commenced on November 2, 2021. (AR 1.) 
At the hearing, petitioner
faced seven counts: 
 
Count 1: On or about
February 9, 2020, you, while on duty, failed to take appropriate enforcement or
investigative action for the crime of domestic related theft, vandalism, or
battery. 
 
Count 2: On or about
February 9, 2020, you, while on duty, failed to report a non-categorical use of
force to a Department supervisor. 
 
Count 3: On or about
February 9, 2020, you, while on duty, failed to request a Department supervisor
when asked for by an arrestee. 
 
Count 4: On or about
February 9, 2020, you, while on duty, inaccurately completed a medical
screening form to conceal an arrestee’s suicidal condition. 
 
Count 5: On or about
February 9, 2020, you, while on duty, failed to obtain proper medical treatment
for an arrestee, as advised by custody services division medical staff. 
 
Count 6: On or about
February 9, 2020, you, while on duty, improperly released an intoxicated
arrestee from custody when you transported, and subsequently abandoned the
arrestee on the corner of Boyle Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue in Hollenbeck
area. 
 
Count 7: On or about
February 9, 2020, you, while on duty, failed to update your unit status when
transporting a member of the public. 
 
(AR 6-7.) 
 
With respect to Count 2,
not reporting the use of force, petitioner maintained that he merely supported
Miguel’s body weight in guiding him to the ground because Miguel was not
actively resisting due to intoxication. (AR 395, 397, 401, 410, 415.) Petitioner
claimed that he reported a use of force to Sgt. Calderon. (AR 405, 409, 410.) 
 
With respect to Count 3,
failing to call a supervisor, petitioner testified that at the time of the
arrest, he did not hear Miguel ask for a supervisor because he was focused on
controlling and handcuffing Miguel. (AR 448.) 
 
With respect to Count 4,
inaccurately completing a medical form stating Miguel was not suicidal, petitioner
testified he did so because he never heard Miguel state that he was suicidal.
(AR 456.)
 
On December 6, 2021, the
Board found petitioner guilty on all counts and recommended termination. (AR
1050.) On December 16, 2021, the Chief of Police removed petitioner from his
position as Police Officer effective March 4, 2021. (AR 1050.)  
 
 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
             On March 17, 2022, petitioner filed a Verified
Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate.  On August 25, 2023, petitioner filed an
opening brief. On September 25, 2023, respondents filed an opposition. On October
9, 2023, petitioner filed a reply. 
 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
Under CCP § 1094.5(b),
the pertinent issues are whether the respondent has proceeded without
jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether there was a
prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.
(CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
Because the termination
of petitioner from his position as Police
Officer concerns a fundamental vested right, the Court
exercises its independent judgment on the administrative findings. (See Wences v. City of Los Angeles (2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 305, 314; Bixby v. Pierno
(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143.) Under the independent judgment test, “the trial
court not only examines the administrative record for errors of law, but also
exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited
trial de novo.” (Bixby, 4 Cal.3d at 143.) The court must draw its own reasonable
inferences from the evidence and make its own credibility determinations. (Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City of
Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003) 107 Cal. App. 4th 860, 868.)  
 
An agency is presumed to
have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.) “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817, internal
quotations omitted.) A reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either
party to an appeal and will not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a
search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in
the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950)
99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) When an appellant challenges “‘the sufficiency of the
evidence, all material evidence on the point must be set forth and not merely
their own evidence.” (Toigo v. Town of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309,
317.)  
 
“On questions of law
arising in mandate proceedings, [the Court] exercise[s] independent judgment.’”
(Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.) The interpretation of statute or regulation is a
question of law. (See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush
(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 71.) 
 
 
 
IV.     Analysis
 
            Petitioner disputes the finding of
the Board of Rights with respect to Counts 2, 3, and 4. (OB at 9-14.)  Petitioner also argues the removal from the
Department was an excessive penalty.  (OB
at 14.) 
 
A.          
Count
2 – Failure to Report Use of Force
 
The Department’s policy defines
a non-categorical use of force to include when an officer uses “physical force”
to “[c]ompel a person to comply with” the officer’s directions, “[e]ffect an
arrest or detention,” or to “[o]vercome resistance.” (AR 926.) The policy
provides examples describing when a use of force is reportable, including when
the “officer had to overcome the suspect’s active resistance, when the suspect
reports an injury, and when the officer uses force to control a suspect. (AR
926-27.) 
 
The policy also states
that the use of a “joint lock to compel a person to comply with an employee’s
direction, which does not result in an injury or complained of injury” is not
a reportable use of force. (AR 927.) The policy provides examples of
non-reportable uses of force, including the use of reasonable force to overcome
passive resistance due to intoxication not resulting in injury or complained of
injury and use of physical force to support the body weight of an intoxicated
suspect who is unable to maintain balance. (AR 927.)  
 
The record demonstrates
petitioner’s use of force in two reportable instances: (1) when petitioner
grabbed Miguel’s left arm; and (2) when petitioner used a joint lock while
leading Miguel to the transport vehicle.
 
With respect to the first
incident, the record demonstrates that, prior to Officer Flores grabbing
Miguel’s right arm, Miguel
was agitated and belligerent, challenged the officers to tase him, removed his shirt
and belt, and yelled profanities at the officers. (AR 111, 931.) After Officer Flores grabbed Miguel’s right arm and
tried to place it behind Miguel’s back, Miguel attempted to turn and face
Officer Flores. (AR 931.) Petitioner then grabbed Miguel’s left arm to gain
control. (AR 931.) The record reflects that petitioner grabbed Miguel’s left
arm while Miguel was actively resisting Officer Flores’ attempts to control
him. The policy defines the use of force to overcome a suspect’s active
resistance as reportable. (AR 926.) 
 
Petitioner testified that,
once he got a hold of Miguel’s left arm, Miguel felt like dead weight and
Miguel was no longer supporting himself. (AR 395-96.) Petitioner then
purportedly “guided” Miguel to the ground. (AR 395.) While use of force on an
intoxicated suspect who passively resists may not be reportable, petitioner’s
assertions of Miguel’s sudden passive resistance are not credible considering
Miguel’s belligerence before the officers grabbed his arms and Miguel’s attempts
to turn around after Officer Flores grabbed his left arm. Even crediting
petitioner’s testimony that Miguel stopped resisting after the officers had
control of his arms, petitioner’s grabbing of Miguel’s right arm while Miguel
actively resisted constituted a reportable “overt exertion to maintain
control.” (AR 927.)
 
With respect to the
second incident, the record demonstrates that, when the officers attempted to
place Miguel in a transport vehicle, Miguel attempted to walk away. (AR 445.) Petitioner
testified that he then applied a joint or wrist lock on Miguel to maintain
control of Miguel. (AR 445.) Miguel’s attempts to walk away demonstrate that he
was able to control his body movements, thus taking his actions outside the
realm of passive resistance into active resistance. (AR 927 [defining passive
resistance to include an inability to control body movements due to
intoxication].) Because petitioner used physical force to effect a detention,
such use of force was reportable, regardless of whether Miguel complained of an
injury during petitioner’s application of a joint lock. (AR 926 [officer’s use
of force reportable when force was necessary to overcome active resistance,
regardless of whether suspect sustains injury].)
 
Petitioner does not
dispute failing to report a use of force. Instead, petitioner points to
Sergeant Ku’s testimony that a wrist lock does not become reportable until
there is an injury. (AR 232-33.) However, according to the Department’s policy,
a reportable use of force does not require the suspect to sustain an injury as
long as the officer used force to overcome a suspect’s active resistance.[1] (AR
926.) 


Petitioner also refers to
Sergeants Jimmy Ku and Blair Calderon’s testimony indicating that officers sometimes
do not recognize their interaction with a suspect as being a reportable use of
force based on their positioning or perspective. (AR 252, 549.) Petitioner contends
Sergeants Ku and Calderon were not certain that petitioner’s use of force was
reportable. (OB at 10:3-27.) Sergeant Ku testified that Miguel’s movements
during his arrest, including Miguel’s spinning or turning, could have been due
to intoxication. (AR 253.) Sergeant Calderon testified that she told Internal
Affairs that Miguel’s actions during the arrest, including dropping his weight,
could have been due to intoxication, not active resistance. (AR 554, 565-68.)
Even if Sergeants Ku or Calderon could not definitely conclude that
petitioner’s uses of force were reportable, the Court exercises its independent
judgment in reviewing the termination of petitioner’s employment. For the
reasons stated above, the record reflects that petitioner’s uses of force were
reportable.  
 
Petitioner
also contends that Board of Rights’ decision violates Topanga. (OB
11:23-12:8.) In Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los
Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, the Supreme Court held that “implicit in
[Code of Civil Procedure] section 1094.5 is a requirement that the agency which
renders the challenged decision must set forth findings to bridge the analytic
gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.” (Topanga, 11
Cal.3d at 515.) The Court explained that “among other functions, … findings
enable the reviewing court to trace and examine the agency's mode of analysis.”
(Id. at 516.)
 
“Administrative
agency findings are generally permitted considerable latitude with regard to
their precision, formality, and matters reasonably implied therein.” (Southern
Pacific Transportation Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization (1987) 191
Cal.App.3d 938, 954; see also Oduyale v. Cal. State Bd. of Pharmacy
(2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 101, 113 [Topanga “does not require the Board to
outline all the reasons it opted not to impose a lesser form of discipline. It
is only required to justify the penalty imposed, including ‘a statement of the
factual and legal basis of the decision’”].)
 
With respect to Count 2,
the Board set forth the two non-categorical uses of force in which petitioner
was involved (AR 887-88), the instances when uses of force are reportable and
non-reportable (AR 888-89), the reasons why both uses of force were reportable
(AR 889-90), and its reasons for doubting petitioner’s assertion that he
reported the uses of force to a supervisor (AR 890-92.) The Board’s decision
was sufficiently detailed for the Court to determine the basis for the Board’s
finding of guilt on Count 2. 
 
For the foregoing
reasons, the weight of the evidence supports the finding of guilt on Count 2. 
 
B.          
Count 3 – Failure to Call
Supervisor
 
LAPD Manual 811.20
states, “When a member of the community wishes to report misconduct and/or make
a complaint, the employee shall immediately notify a supervisor.” (AR 944.) 
 
Petitioner
maintains that the Board did not establish that Miguel wished to report
misconduct or make a complaint. However, the record reflects that Miguel told petitioner and Flore
to “Call your supervisor” six times after the officers took him to the ground. (AR
138, 395, 448, 925, Dept. Ex. 5, video, File 647f, at 9:01-10.)  Notably, Miguel did so after telling the
officers “I’m gonna sue ya” and “I’m going to sue your ass.” (AR 925, Dept. Ex
5 video, File 647f at 8:42, 8:45.) The proximity of Miguel having been taken
down, followed by his threat to sue and request for a supervisor, indicates Miguel
wanted to complain about the officers. Miguel’s call for a supervisor while
being arrested clearly indicated his intent to report alleged misconduct or to
make a complaint. This is so even if Miguel did not later complain about the
officers to the Watch Commander afterward. 
(AR 217.)
 
Petitioner
maintains that he did not hear Miguel request a supervisor, as he was
purportedly focused on completing the handcuffing. (AR 448.) Petitioner cites Graham
v. Connor (1989) 490 U.S. 386, 396 for the assertion that his purported
failure to hear Miguel’s multiple requests was reasonable. Graham stands
for the proposition that “the ‘reasonableness’ of a particular use of force
must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,
rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.” (Graham, 490 U.S. at
396.) The issue here is not whether the use of force was reasonable, but rather
whether petitioner heard the calls for a supervisor. Even if Graham were
read for the proposition that the Court must evaluate whether it was reasonable
for petitioner not to hear Miguel’s request for a supervisor, the Court finds
that it was not.
 
The
video evidence indicates that, while face down on the ground handcuffed and
petitioner right above him, Miguel six times told petitioner and Flores to
“Call your supervisor.” (AR 925, Dept. Ex. 5, video, File 647f, at 9:01.)  The Board found not credible petitioner’s
assertion that he did not hear Miguel’s requests for a supervisor. (AR 893-94,
908.) After reviewing the video evidence, the Court agrees with the Board.  As captured by the video evidence, Miguel
repeatedly, unambiguously, and clearly told the officers to “Call your
supervisor” six times, one after the other. (AR 925, Dept. Ex. 5, video, File
647F, at 9:01-9:10.)   
 
The
Court also finds that the Board’s decision concerning Count 3 was adequately
supported. The Board set forth the policy of section 811.20, described when
Miguel called for a supervisor, set forth facts demonstrating that no
supervisor was ever called, and found that petitioner’s assertion that he did
not hear Miguel’s request was not credible. (AR 893-94.) 
 
It
is undisputed petitioner did not call for a supervisor. (AR 138, 448.) For the foregoing reasons, the weight of the
evidence supports the finding of guilt on Count 3. 
 
C.          
Count 4 – Failure to Note
Suicidal Ideation on Medical Form
 
On
February 9, 2020, the officers arrived with Miguel at MDC at 22:57 hours. (AR
920.) At approximately 23:10 hours, petitioner indicated on an Arrestee Medical
Screening Form that Miguel did not feel suicidal or did not feel like hurting
himself. (AR 959.) 
 
Petitioner
disputes hearing any indication that Miguel was suicidal. Petitioner maintains
that due to Miguel’s prior outbursts, he “tuned out” Miguel. (AR 583.) 
 
The
video evidence reflects that, at the MDC, the officers prepared paperwork while
Miguel was seated a few feet away. (AR 925, Dept. Ex. 5, video, File 647f(1),
at 13:32-39.) Miguel yelled out, “I’m suicidal dude.” (AR 925, Dept. Ex. 5,
video, File 647f(1), at 13:32-33.) 
Seconds later, Miguel again yelled out, “I’m fucking suicidal. . .  I’m suicidal. I don’t want to be with you
motherfuckers. I don’t want to be here.” (AR 925, Dept. Ex. 5, video, File 647f(1),
at 13:38-39.) Petitioner maintains that he did not hear Miguel’s statement that
he was suicidal. (AR 479.)
 
The
arrest report indicates that, on the way to MDC, Miguel demanded to be taken to
the Twin Towers jail or else he would claim that he was suicidal. (AR 932.) Petitioner
maintains that he did not recall Miguel making this comment. (AR 479.)[2]

 
The
Court agrees with the Board’s finding that petitioner’s assertion that he did
not hear Miguel’s suicidal ideation is not credible. (AR 896.) It strains credulity
to think that petitioner could tune out Miguel’s comments that he was suicidal
on the way to MDC and while filling out the Arrestee Medical Screening Form,
particularly in light of the video evidence in which Miguel clearly states he
is suicidal multiple times.  (See (AR
925, Dept. Ex. 5, video, File 647f(1), at 13:32-39.) Combined with petitioner’s
assertion that he did not hear Miguel’s six requests for a supervisor, which
the Court rejects above, the weight of the evidence demonstrates that
petitioner inaccurately completed the screening form to conceal Miguel’s
suicidal condition, as set forth in Count 4. 

 
Further,
the Court finds that the Board adequately set forth the basis of its finding of
guilt concerning Count 4. The Board set forth the portion of the body camera
footage where Miguel indicated that he was suicidal and petitioner’s subsequent
completion of the screening form. (AR 895.) The Board also set forth why
petitioner’s claim that he did not hear Miguel’s statements was not credible.
(AR 896.)
 
For the foregoing
reasons, the weight of the evidence supports the finding of guilt on Count 4. 
 
D.          
Propriety
of Termination as Penalty
 
“The
propriety of a penalty imposed by an administrative agency is a matter vested
in the discretion of the agency, and its decision may not be disturbed unless
there has been a manifest abuse of discretion.” (Lake v. Civil Service
Commission (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 224, 228.) If reasonable minds can differ
with regard to the propriety of the disciplinary action, there is no abuse of
discretion. (County of Los Angeles v. Civil Service Commission (1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 620, 634.)
 
A
police officer’s “job is a position of trust and the public has a right to the
highest standard of behavior from those they invest with the power and
authority of a law enforcement officer. Honesty, credibility and temperament
are crucial to the proper performance of an officer's duties.” (Talmo v.
Civil Service Com. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 210, 231.) “The public is entitled
to protection from unprofessional employees whose conduct places people at risk
of injury and the government at risk of incurring liability.” (Kolender v.
San Diego County Civil Service Com. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 716, 721.)
“Judicial interference with the agency’s assessment of a penalty ‘will only be
sanctioned when there is an arbitrary, capricious or patently abusive exercise
of discretion by the administrative agency.’” (Kazensky v. City of Merced
(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 44, 54.)
 
            Petitioner maintains that he has learned
from the incident and that he would request advice in the future concerning
whether a use of force is reportable. (OB at 13:24-14:11.) Petitioner maintains
that termination of his employment is excessive. 
 
            Putting aside Counts 2 through 4, petitioner
did not dispute the finding of guilt for Counts 1, 5, 6, and 7. With respect to
Count 1, the Board found that petitioner “failed to enforce the applicable
Penal Code provisions in responding to the domestic violence call.” (AR 904.)
Petitioner failed to complete a “Domestic Violence Incident” investigative
report. (AR 882.) Petitioner did not properly investigate the incident, such as
asking Person Reporting whether she wanted a report taken or thoroughly questioning
PR to determine the crimes that may have been committed, and instead asked her
whether she wanted Miguel to leave. (AR 883-84.) Petitioner also did not document
domestic violence-related theft, vandalism, and battery in a report, despite
having had information establishing these crimes. (AR 884-86.) 
 
With respect to Counts 5
and 6, the record reflects that the
MDC medical staff instructed the officers to transport Miguel to a hospital because
of his increased heart rate. (AR 457, 482, 484, 932.) Rather than dropping off
Miguel at the hospital, the officers dropped off Miguel
approximately 20-30 yards away. (AR 40, 41, 463, 925, Dept. 5, video, File
647f2, at 4:41.) Hospital security observed that Miguel was very intoxicated
and confused. (AR 39.) Miguel did not know where he was or how he got there and
was unable to care for himself. (AR 39, 40, 43.) Sergeant Calderon also observed
Miguel to have slurred speech, to be intoxicated and unable to stand on his own
or take care of himself. (AR 535, 536, 540.) 
 
            With respect to Count 7, the
officers did not update their status on their in-vehicle log. (AR 184, 329.) The
Board found that this reflected an intent to conceal that petitioner and his
partner dropped off Miguel at the sidewalk and released him. (AR 908.) 
 
            The Board found that petitioner’s misconduct reflected a
“disregard of the duty to save lives.” (AR 905.) The Board found that
petitioner “allowed the possibility that Mr. Miguel would return to the
location and harm the person reporting.” (AR 905.) The Board also found that
petitioner “disregarded Mr. Miguel’s safety and health by dropping him off at
the sidewalk in front of White Memorial Medical Center…[in] knowing
disobedience of a directive from MDC dispensary personnel.” (AR 905.) The Board
also noted that petitioner knew Miguel was highly intoxicated, had an elevated
heart rate and suicidal ideations, and had shown aggression during the night,
thus posing a danger to others in the area, as well as himself. (AR 905-6.) 
 
            Combined with petitioner’s “concealment of and lack of
candor about his misconduct,” which are set forth in the Board’s decision (AR
906-909), the Board found that retaining petitioner “would pose an undue risk
to the Department and the City” (AR 909-10). 
 
            Considering Counts 1 and 5-7 alone,
a reasonable person could find that termination of petitioner’s employment was
warranted. A reasonable person could find that petitioner’s failure to properly
investigate the domestic violence incident posed a risk to Person Reporting. A
reasonable person could also find that petitioner’s failure to drop off Miguel
at the hospital posed a danger to the highly intoxicated Miguel, as well as any
person Miguel may have encountered on the street. When considered with petitioner’s
failure to report a reportable use of force on an arrestee (Count 2), failure
to request a supervisor when a complaining arrestee asked for one (Count 3),
and failure to note suicidal ideation by an arrestee (Count 4), the breach of
the public trust evidenced by petitioner’s conduct demonstrates that
termination of his employment was warranted. 
 
V.      Conclusion
 
The petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), respondents shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed
judgment.
