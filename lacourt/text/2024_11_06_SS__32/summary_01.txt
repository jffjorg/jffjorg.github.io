  - "If there is a possibility that the damages will exceed $25,000, the case cannot be transferred to limited."
  - "The court shall grant the motion and enter an order for reclassification, regardless of any fault or lack of fault, if the case has been classified in an incorrect jurisdictional classification."

And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to reclassify the action from unlimited to limited jurisdiction filed by Defendant Michael Zargar. The motion was filed after the time to file the initial pleading, and Defendant has not shown good cause for not seeking reclassification sooner. The evidence provided does not show to a legal certainty that the amount in controversy will not exceed $35,000, as Plaintiff Sharf claims $7,859 in medical bills, $3,054.48 in property damage, and one week in lost wages, and Plaintiff Demovsky claims $7,850 in medical bills. Therefore, the motion is denied. Defendant must provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
