And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition for approval of a compromise for a person with a disability, filed by Petitioner Lillian Monica McFarland on behalf of Claimant Taylor Swelstad, age 20. The Petitioner proposes to deposit the entire net settlement proceeds of $242,321.57 into a pooled Special Needs Trust (SNT) for the benefit of the Claimant. However, the judge denies the petition without prejudice due to several defects. The Petitioner failed to serve the state agencies with notice of the hearing and petition, as required by law. Additionally, the proposed trust instrument has several defects that must be corrected. The judge orders the Petitioner to re-file the petition and proposed order, correct the defects, and provide proof of service of the petition upon the state agencies. The hearing is continued to December 4, 2024, and a revised petition must be filed and served by November 15, 2024.
