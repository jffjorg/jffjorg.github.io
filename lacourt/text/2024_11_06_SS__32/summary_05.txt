And here is a brief summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Lotus Eleven Ventures, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication in a negligence and premises liability case. The plaintiff, Yolanda Candelario Macario, slipped and fell on a wet sidewalk outside a 7-Eleven store operated by Lotus, allegedly due to a leaky pipe. Lotus argued that it did not owe a duty to the plaintiff because the leaky pipe was under the control of AK Investment Property LLC, the landlord, and not Lotus. However, the court found that Lotus failed to meet its burden to establish the absence of a triable issue of fact and that it had control over the sidewalk as part of its lease agreement. Therefore, the motion was denied.
