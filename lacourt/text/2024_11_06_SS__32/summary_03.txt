And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Plaintiff Graciela Fonseca Garcia's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set Three, number 36. The motion was filed prematurely and without adequate meet and confer with the opposing party. The court notes that the parties had agreed to meet and confer after an informal discovery conference, but Plaintiff did not follow through on this agreement. The court also finds that Plaintiff did not establish that the requested documents are responsive to the request, which seeks policies and procedures at the time of the incident regarding investigating slip and fall incidents. As a result, the motion is denied as moot. The court also declines to award sanctions to Plaintiff, as they did not adequately meet and confer with the opposing party before filing the motion.
