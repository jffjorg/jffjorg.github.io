The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, granting their motion to compel verified responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One from the defendant. The defendant has failed to respond to the request, despite multiple extensions. The judge has also awarded monetary sanctions against the defendant and its counsel in the amount of $585.00, which is a reduced amount from the $952.91 requested by the plaintiff. The defendant is required to serve verified responses without objections within 30 days, and the monetary sanctions are to be paid to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days of the date of the order.
