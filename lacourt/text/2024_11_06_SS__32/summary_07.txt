```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing Plaintiff's complaint without leave to amend. The court found that Plaintiff's complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendant. The court also took judicial notice of Plaintiff's deemed admitted Request for Admissions, which admitted that Defendant did not breach a duty owed to her, did not own or operate the premises, and did not cause her injury. As a result, the court found that the motion was properly granted. The court also noted that Plaintiff failed to oppose the motion and did not show that she could reasonably amend the pleadings. The court ordered Defendant to give notice of the order and file a proof of service.
