```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to stay the case pending the resolution of the criminal case against him. The defendant argued that giving testimony in the civil case could incriminate him in the criminal case, but the judge found that the defendant remains free to withhold his testimony. The judge also noted that the discovery disputes have been resolved, and that the defendant's concerns about the potential impact of the civil case on his criminal case are speculative and not sufficient to warrant a stay. The judge cited several precedents that support the denial of the motion, including Fuller v. Superior Court and Pacers, Inc. v. Superior Court.
