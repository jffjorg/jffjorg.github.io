And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents is CONTINUED to December 12, 2023, with the opportunity for plaintiff to serve and file reply papers on or before December 6, 2023. The Judge notes that there was confusion over the service and filing of the opposition papers and that someone needs to inquire about the non-party's willingness to release their records.

The Judge also ruled that the motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions is DENIED, without prejudice, and no sanctions are awarded. The Judge held that it is premature to use requests for admissions to seek facts about a prospective "me too" witness before that witness has agreed to testify or been deposed.
