English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The Plaintiff sought to access a storage unit and prevent the Defendant, Warren, from destroying or disposing of its contents. However, the Judge ruled that the motion is denied due to the lack of an operative complaint and admissible evidence. The Plaintiff was given 30 days to amend its complaint, but no amended complaint has been filed. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff has not provided any admissible evidence to support its motion. The Defendant is entitled to a dismissal of the action if they choose to make a motion for dismissal. The Judge will consider the Plaintiff's motion again after an amended complaint is filed and supported by admissible evidence.
