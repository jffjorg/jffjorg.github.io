And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains PNC Bank, N.A.'s demurrer to the second and third causes of action, which are negligence and common counts. The court holds that these claims are preempted by the California Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) because they rely on the bank's acceptance of alleged fraudulent and unauthorized wire transfers. The court cites Zengen, Inc. v. Comerica Bank, which held that Article 4A of the UCC governs funds transfers and displaces common law causes of action based on allegedly unauthorized funds transfers.

The court notes that the plaintiff's common law claims are based solely on the bank's processing of the wire transfers and the release of the funds, and not on any subsequent conduct. Therefore, the court finds that the plaintiff's claims are preempted by the UCC and must be brought under Article 4A. The court will entertain argument on this issue and will determine whether the plaintiff can demonstrate a reasonable possibility of successfully amending its complaint to state common law causes of action against PNC Bank, N.A.
