Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant City National Bank's motion to compel arbitration. The judge finds that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties. The arbitration agreement was added to the Account Agreement and Disclosures in December 2022, and Plaintiff was provided with actual notice of the agreement through emails sent to two of its email addresses. The judge concludes that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and that the case should be stayed pending arbitration. The judge also finds that the Plaintiff's opposition to the motion to compel arbitration is without merit.
