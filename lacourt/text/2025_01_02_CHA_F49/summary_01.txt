The Court GRANTS the unopposed Motion to Strike.
Leave to amend is generally available when the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer is reasonably capable of cure.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint related to allegations and requests for relief for punitive damages. The judge found that the plaintiff's claims did not plead ultimate facts that would establish malice or oppression, and therefore did not meet the requirements for punitive damages under California law. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint.
