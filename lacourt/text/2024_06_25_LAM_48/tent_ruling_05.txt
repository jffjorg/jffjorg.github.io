  CASE NO.: 23STCV01149
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR LEAVE
  TO FILE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
June 25, 2024



 
On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff Peter Bachmann filed
this action.  On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint (“FAC”).
The
Court may, in its discretion and after notice to the adverse party, allow an amendment
to any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (a)(1).)  A motion to amend a pleading
must include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading which must be
serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments and
must state what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted
or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the allegations
are located.  (California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1324(a).)  The motion shall also be
accompanied by a declaration attesting to the effect of the amendment, why the amendment
is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier.  (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).)
Plaintiff
identifies the amendments and provides a copy of the proposed FAC.  The amendments generally correct dates and
allege specific dollar amounts. 
Plaintiff’s current counsel substituted into the case in July 2023 and
received discovery responses in December 2023 
(Berke Decl. ¶ 3.)  Counsel
underwent several health issues from October 2023 through at least January 2024,
and he did not file the motion sooner because he is still catching up on cases.  (Berke Decl. ¶ 4.)  Trial is not until December 2, 2024.  No oppositions were filed.
Because
there is no showing of prejudice, the motion for leave to file an amended complaint
is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to file
and serve his FAC within 10 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
