  CASE NO.: 21STCV25648
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
June 25, 2024



 
Jasmine
J. Badawi, counsel of record for Plaintiff Patricia J. Espinoza Rosales, seeks to
be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration
states that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until January 21, 2025, and there
is no prejudice to Defendant.
The
proposed order does not include Plaintiff’s current or last known address and
telephone number.  Counsel must provide
this information at the hearing.
The
proposed order no longer reflects the correct next hearing date.  The Court will correct this information
before signing.
Subject
to the provision of Plaintiff’s current or last known address and telephone
number, the unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing
a proof of service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order
on GC Patricia J. Espinoza Rosales and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 25th day of June 2024
