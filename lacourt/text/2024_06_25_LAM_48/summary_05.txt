And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiff, Peter Bachmann, filed his original complaint on January 18, 2023, and filed the motion for leave to amend on May 29, 2024. The proposed amendments correct dates and allege specific dollar amounts. The plaintiff's current counsel substituted into the case in July 2023 and received discovery responses in December 2023, but did not file the motion sooner due to health issues. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file and serve the first amended complaint within 10 days. Since no oppositions were filed, the motion is granted.
