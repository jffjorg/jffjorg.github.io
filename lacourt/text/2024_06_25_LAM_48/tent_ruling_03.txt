On
February 20, 2024, Plaintiff Timothy Philips filed a fourth amended complaint (“4AC”)
against Defendant Seizmic Inc. and Sal Fateen.
On
March 19, 2024, Defendants filed a demurrer and motion to strike.
On
May 7, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication of all
causes of action except the eighth and ninth causes of action for failure to permit
inspection or copying of a personnel file.
DEMURRER
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)
Only
Defendant Sal Fateen (not Seizmic Inc.) demurs to the remaining eighth and ninth
causes of action.  Defendants argue that the
4AC “does not state how Mr. Fateen himself failed to provide copies of supposed
wage statements to the Plaintiff.”  (Demurrer
at p. 13.)  Plaintiff argues that the 4AC
sufficiently pleads alter ego liability. 
(Opposition at pp. 5-6.)
“In
California, two conditions must be met before the alter ego doctrine will be invoked.  First, there must be such a unity of interest
and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that the separate
personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality exist.  Second, there must be an inequitable result if
the acts in question are treated as those of the corporation alone.”  (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court
(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 538.)
The
4AC alleges, among other things, that Fateen completely dominated and controlled
Seizmic, derived actual and significant monetary benefits by and through Seizmic
as the funding source for his own personal expenditures, and did not comply with
corporate formalities.  (4AC ¶¶ 10-11.)  Therefore, “The recognition of the separate existence
of SEIZMIC, and/or FATEEN would not promote justice . . . The corporate existence
of FATEEN, SEIZMIC, and DOES 2- 25 should be disregarded in equity and for the ends
of justice because such disregard is necessary to avoid fraud and injustice to Plaintiff
herein.”  This is sufficient at the pleading
stage.  Defendants’ Reply addresses the burdens
at summary judgment, not when pleading.
The
demurrer is OVERRULED.  Sal Fateen is ordered
to file an answer to the eighth and ninth causes of action within 10 days.  (See California Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j).)
MOTION TO STRIKE
The
court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California,
a court rule, or an order of the court.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b).)
Defendant
moves to strike allegations related to punitive damages (4AC ¶¶ 50, 64, 75, 84,
96, 116, and Prayer for Relief No. 7).  The
Court has already adjudicated the causes of action containing these allegations.  Furthermore, the 4AC contains no allegations supporting
punitive damages for the eighth and ninth causes of action.
The
motion to strike is GRANTED without leave to amend.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
