And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a case between Plaintiff Timothy Philips and Defendant Seizmic, Inc. and Sal Fateen. The Plaintiff filed a fourth amended complaint, and the Defendant filed a demurrer and a motion to strike. The Court has already granted summary adjudication of all causes of action except the eighth and ninth, which relate to Plaintiff's claims against Defendant Sal Fateen. The Court has overruled the demurrer, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations of alter ego liability are sufficient at the pleading stage. The Court has also granted the motion to strike allegations related to punitive damages, as these allegations are no longer relevant in light of the Court's previous ruling.
