Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's further response to Form Interrogatory No. 4.1. The defendant had objected to the form, including boilerplate objections, and responded that it was not aware of any insurance policies that may cover the relevant damages, claims, or actions. However, the judge finds that the defendant's response was incomplete and evasive, and that it did not make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information. As a result, the judge orders the defendant to provide a supplemental response to the form within 30 days and imposes sanctions of $2,550.00 on the defendant's counsel.
