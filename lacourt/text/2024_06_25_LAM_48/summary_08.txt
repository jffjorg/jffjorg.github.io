Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration filed by the Plaintiffs, Derek Andersen and Connie Andersen. The ruling grants the motion in part, compelling arbitration with Elmoro Holdings LLC, but denies it as to Ryan Elmore. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have shown the existence of an arbitration agreement and have not waived their right to compel arbitration. However, the Court concludes that Ryan Elmore is not a party to the arbitration agreement and cannot be compelled to arbitration individually. The Court also finds that the Plaintiffs' argument that Ryan Elmore is bound by the arbitration agreement as an alter ego of Elmoro Holdings LLC is without merit. The action is stayed pending the conclusion of the arbitration, and a status conference is scheduled for June 26, 2025.
