And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a summary judgment in favor of Omninet Kipling, L.P. (Plaintiff) against Maryline Benavidiez and Glenn Valerio (Defendants) for breach of a written lease. The Plaintiff claims that the Defendants failed to pay rent due on the lease of 4077 W. 3rd Street, #524, Los Angeles. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has established all the elements of the cause of action, including the existence of the contract, performance by the Plaintiff, breach by the Defendants, and resulting damage. Since the Defendants did not oppose the motion or produce evidence, the burden has shifted to them to raise any triable issues of material fact. The Court grants the unopposed motion and will sign the proposed order.
