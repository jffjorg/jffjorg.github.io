Summary:
The tentative ruling grants the Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to the Third Cause of Action for retaliation in violation of Labor Code §1102.5. The Court finds that Plaintiffs failed to comply with the Tort Claims Act's claims presentation requirement and did not provide sufficient evidence to establish compliance. The Court also finds that Plaintiffs' claims are subject to the Tort Claims Act and that they did not demonstrate substantial compliance with the Act. The Court therefore grants the Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings without leave to amend.
