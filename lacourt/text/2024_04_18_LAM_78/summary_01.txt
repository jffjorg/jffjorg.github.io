And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to bifurcate trial filed by Defendants Regus Management Group, LLC, IWG PLC, Maile Gilleres, and Mark Sorum. The motion is denied as to compensatory damages and granted as to punitive damages. The Court agrees that bifurcation as to the issue of punitive damages is mandatory and that Defendants' financial information may be admitted only after the factfinder determines whether Defendants were guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud. As for the remaining issues over compensatory damages, the Court finds that it would not further judicial economy to allow bifurcation of compensatory damages and liability.
