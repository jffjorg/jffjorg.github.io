  Case Number:  23LBCV00892    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundPlaintiffs Sambath Khim and Rovannarin Khat (“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“Honda”) and DOES 1-10. Plaintiffs allege violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.On May 16, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their complaint against Honda alleging three causes of action: (1) Violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(d); (2) Violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(a)(3); and (4) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability.On April 23, 2024, the court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production of Documents (Set One). The court ordered Honda to produce code-compliant, objection-less further responses to Plaintiffs’ requests seeking “Infotainment System” defects for the subject vehicle, a 2019 Honda Odyssey, and other vehicles with the same defects as Plaintiffs. Honda now brings this motion seeking reconsideration of the court’s April 23 order.Parties ArgumentsIn this instance, Honda argues the court failed to consider that Plaintiffs never presented the subject vehicle to Honda for “Infotainment System” failures. In support, Honda submits the declaration of Honda Senior Technical Specialist, James Jongkind. Mr. Jongkind reviewed the three repair orders related to Plaintiffs’ 2019 Honda Odyssey and determined none of these repairs were related to the Infotainment System. (Jongkind Decl., ¶¶ 1, 6-14.) As Plaintiffs’ repair visits were not related to Infotainment System issues, Honda requests the court reconsider its April 24 order.In response, Plaintiffs insist the 2019 Honda Odyssey was subject to various recalls related to the Infotainment System defects - specifically, Recall 20-012, Recall 20-051,Recall 20-047, Recall 20-024, and Recall 20-050. Although Plaintiffs mentioned further problems with the subject vehicle, e.g. rear hatch, metal noise from left rear when braking, rear tail gate makes loud noise when latching), Plaintiffs argue the number of recalls on the Infotainment System alone support Plaintiffs’ position that the Infotainment System was defective.AnalysisCode of Civil Procedure § 1008(a) reads:(a) When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and… granted…any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. (Italics added.)“The party making the application shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” New York Times Co. v. Superior Ct. (2005) 135 Cal. App. 4th 206, 211. A party seeking reconsideration also must provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at an earlier time. (New York Times, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at p. 212; Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 689, 68 Cal.Rptr.2d 228.)Here, there are no new or different facts, circumstances or law presented by Honda. There is no indication from Honda that Mr. Jongkind’s declaration could not have been produced prior to the court’s April 23 ruling. In fact, in its opposition to the motion to compel further responses, Honda argued several of the same points made in Mr. Jongkind’s declaration. As Honda has not demonstrated “new” facts or circumstances, the court finds no basis to reconsider its April 23 ruling. Accordingly, Honda’s Motion for Reconsideration is denied.TENTATIVE RULING: Defendant American Honda’s Motion for Reconsideration is denied.
