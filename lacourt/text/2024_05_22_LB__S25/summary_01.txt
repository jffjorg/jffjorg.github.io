And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Honda's motion for reconsideration of the court's April 23 order compelling further responses to Plaintiffs' request for production of documents. Honda argued that Plaintiffs never presented the subject vehicle for "Infotainment System" failures and submitted a declaration by James Jongkind stating that Plaintiffs' repair visits were not related to Infotainment System issues. However, the court finds no new or different facts, circumstances, or law presented by Honda and denies the motion.
