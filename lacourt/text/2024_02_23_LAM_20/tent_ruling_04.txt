This is a matter relating to breach of the warranty of habitability.  Plaintiffs Luis and Maria Caceres seek default judgment against Defendant Joe Nishanian.While Plaintiffs request $100,000 in damages, the Complaint fails to make any specific request for damages.  This is problematic as “[t]he relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 580.)  Further, phrases such as “in an amount not less than” do not give notice for the purposes of Code Civ. Proc. § 580.  (Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173-1174.)    Thus, Plaintiffs can either accept the jurisdictional minimum of $25,001 in damages or else amend the Complaint’s allegations as to damages, which would be a material change opening Defendant’s default.  (Cole v. Roebling Const. Co. (1909) 156 Cal. 443; Leo v. Dunlap (1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 24, 27-28.) Further, Plaintiffs failed to (1) specifically explain how $100,000 in damages were computed and what these damages represent; (2) dismiss the Doe Defendants; and (3) request damages on form CIV-100. For all these reasons, the Default Judgment Application is denied without prejudice. Plaintiff to give notice.
