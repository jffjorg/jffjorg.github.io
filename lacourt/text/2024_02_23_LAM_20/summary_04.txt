And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the matter of breach of warranty of habitability, in which Plaintiffs Luis and Maria Caceres are seeking default judgment against Defendant Joe Nishanian. However, the Complaint fails to make any specific request for damages, which is problematic under Code Civ. Proc. § 580. The judge notes that phrases such as "in an amount not less than" do not give notice for the purposes of Code Civ. Proc. § 580. The judge orders the Plaintiffs to either accept the jurisdictional minimum of $25,001 in damages or to amend the Complaint's allegations as to damages, which would be a material change opening the Defendant's default. The judge also notes that the Plaintiffs failed to specifically explain how the damages were computed, dismiss the Doe Defendants, and request damages on form CIV-100. As a result, the Default Judgment Application is denied without prejudice, and the Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice.
