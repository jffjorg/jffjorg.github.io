  Case Number:  22AHCV01208    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2024    Dept:  X Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney Fees is granted.  Attorney fees are awarded in the total amount of $38,430.00.  The Court also awards $9,276.13 in recoverable costs.In determining a reasonable attorney fee, the trial court begins with the lodestar, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.  (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 36.)  The lodestar may then be adjusted based on factors specific to the case to fix the fee at the fair market value of the legal services provided.  (Ibid.)  These factors include (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, and (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.  (Ibid.)Turning to the reasonableness of fees, “[i]n determining hourly rates, the court must look to the ‘prevailing market rates in the relevant community.’”  (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 100.)  In making this determination, “[t]he court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market.”  (Ibid.)  The Court finds that a rate of $450.00 per hour is reasonable for the attorneys working on this matter.As to the hours expended, the attorney fees are reduced as set forth below where the Court determines that some of the hours expended were duplicative or otherwise insufficiently described so as to justify the time expended, and exceeded the Court’s determination of reasonable attorney time spent considering the task identified.  The Court determines that 85.4 hours is reasonable.  When multiplied by the hourly rate, fees in the amount of $38,430.00 is appropriate.The Court declines to apply a multiplier, as the total fee amount is determined to be reasonable and the lodestar factors were considered in determining the lodestar amount.  (See Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1142 [use of counsel’s qualifications and exceptional representation both in calculating hourly rate and in applying a multiplier amounts to “improper double counting” of factors].)Finally, as to costs, the Court reduces the claimed costs by $498.45, the amount of the Statement of Non-Appearance.Moving Party is to give notice.
