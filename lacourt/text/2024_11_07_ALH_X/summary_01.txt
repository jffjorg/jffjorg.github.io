And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and costs. The judge has awarded attorney fees in the amount of $38,430.00, which is calculated by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by the reasonable hourly rate. The hourly rate is determined to be $450.00 per hour, which is reasonable based on market rates in the relevant community. The judge has adjusted the lodestar amount by considering factors specific to the case, such as the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, the skill displayed in presenting them, and the contingent nature of the fee award. The judge has reduced the claimed costs by $498.45, the amount of the Statement of Non-Appearance. The judge's decision is based on the court's discretion to determine a reasonable attorney fee and its authority to award costs.
