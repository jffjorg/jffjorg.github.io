after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order
quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it

DISCUSSION 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1346, provides: 
“A written notice and all moving papers supporting a
motion to compel an answer to a deposition question or to compel production of
a document or tangible thing from a nonparty deponent must be personally served
on the nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees
to accept service by mail or electronic service at an address or electronic
service address specified on the deposition record.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1346.) 
Defendants
ask the Court to compel the person most knowledgeable regarding billing
procedures and practices for Hawthorne Surgery Center
to comply with Defendants’ Deposition Subpoena for Personal Appearance and
Production of Documents and Things. 
However, Defendants did not personally serve the moving papers on Hawthorne
Surgery Center and Defendants have not shown that Hawthorne Surgery Center “agrees
to accept service by mail or electronic service at an address or electronic
service address specified on the deposition record.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1346.) 
The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the motion to compel Hawthorne Surgery Center’s compliance with a
deposition subpoena filed by Defendants Marco
Carreon and Vicky Carreon. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
