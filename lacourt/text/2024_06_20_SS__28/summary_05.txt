And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is a continuance of the hearing on Defendant Erika Gomez's Motion to Strike without demurrer, originally scheduled for June 20, 2024. The hearing has been advanced to June 10, 2024, and then continued to July 5, 2024, at 1:30 PM in Department 28 at the Spring Street Courthouse. The continuance is due to the fact that the Plaintiff's Amended Complaint has not yet been filed. If the Amended Complaint is filed before the new hearing date, the Defendant will need to make a new reservation and file new moving papers. The Defendant was ordered to give notice of the continuance.
