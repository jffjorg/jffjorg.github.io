And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to compel deposition filed by Plaintiff Rodrigo Orozco. The motion was served on Defendant Top USA Properties, LLC by electronic service on October 18, 2024, but this is not sufficient notice under California Code of Civil Procedure. The notice period should have been at least 16 court days before the hearing, and since the court was closed on November 11, 2024, the motion should have been served electronically no later than October 17, 2024. Therefore, the motion is denied, and Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this order and file proof of service.
