CASE NUMBER:


23STCV29546




MOTION:  


Motion to Determine Application of Automatic Stay




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiffs Patricia Othon and Richard Othon




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
MOTION
            Plaintiffs
Patricia Othon and Richard Othon (“Plaintiffs”) seek a determination of whether
the automatic stay the bankruptcy filing of Defendant Allen Abraham
(“Defendant”) triggered also stays this case as against Defendant Craftscape
Creations, LLC.  The unopposed motion is
denied.
Filing of a
bankruptcy petition automatically triggers a stay of proceedings against the
debtor.  (11 U.S.C., § 362, subd. (a).)  However, federal courts have exclusive
authority to determine the scope of the automatic stay.  (See In re Gruntz (9th Cir. 2000) 202 F.3d
1074, 1083 [“by virtue of the power vested in them by Congress, the federal
courts have the final authority to determine the scope and applicability of the
automatic stay”].)  As such, this Court
cannot rule on whether the stay applies. 
Plaintiffs must seek guidance from the bankruptcy court.  
Plaintiffs are ordered to provide notice of this order and to
file proof of service of same.
