And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the unopposed motion filed by Plaintiffs Patricia Othon and Richard Othon to determine whether the automatic stay triggered by the bankruptcy filing of Defendant Allen Abraham also stays this case as against Defendant Craftscape Creations, LLC. The judge ruled that the filing of a bankruptcy petition automatically triggers a stay of proceedings against the debtor, but that federal courts have exclusive authority to determine the scope of the automatic stay. Therefore, the judge cannot rule on whether the stay applies and the Plaintiffs must seek guidance from the bankruptcy court. The judge ordered the Plaintiffs to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
