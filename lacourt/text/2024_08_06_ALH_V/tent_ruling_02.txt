BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Mariposa Landscapes, Inc. (plaintiff) filed the
complaint against defendant Norton Simon Museum of Art at Pasadena (defendant)
on February 20, 2024. Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action: (1)
common count, (2) account stated, (3) breach of the covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, (4) breach of contract, and (5) unjust enrichment. This matter
arises from a dispute over a landscape maintenance contract between the
parties. Plaintiff alleges that at the time of the contract dispute, payments
for services paid by defendant to plaintiff was $12,501.77 per month. Plaintiff
alleges it is owed for invoices dated 12/31/2022 and 1/30/2023 for a total of
$25,003.43 owed. Plaintiff alleges defendant issued a check for $4,972.93 with
a deduction for bollards which defendant alleges were damaged. Plaintiff denies
damaging bollards on defendant’s premises. Plaintiff alleges that defendant
owes it the $25,003.43 and defendant refuses to pay.
Defendant files the instant motion on April 26, 2024. The
motion is unopposed.
LEGAL STANDARD
“The court, on its own motion, may reclassify a case at any
time. . . The court shall grant the motion and enter an order for
reclassification, regardless of any fault or lack of fault, if the case has
been classified in an incorrect jurisdictional classification.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 403.040(a).)
“A court contemplating ordering reclassification on its own
motion must also provide notice to the parties. (Kent v. Superior Court (1992)
2 Cal.App.4th 1392, 1394.) Whether a party makes a motion, or the court raises
the jurisdictional issue on its own motion pursuant to section 403.040,
subdivision (a), the court must provide ‘sufficient opportunity to respond and
offer reasons why [reclassification] should or should not be ordered.’ (Walker
v. Superior Court, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 272.) Even if no hearing is held,
before ordering reclassification the court must afford the parties an
opportunity to contest reclassification.” (Stern v. Superior Court (2003) 105
Cal.App.4th 223, 230.)
DISCUSSION
The amount in controversy for this case is $25,003.54. The
minimum amount for unlimited civil jurisdiction is $35,000. Accordingly, the
court finds the case has been classified in an incorrect jurisdictional
classification. The correct jurisdictional classification is limited civil,
thus the case warrants reclassification.
The parties have the opportunity to respond and offer why
reclassification should or should not be ordered. Thus, the court sets a status
conference to determine whether reclassification is proper.
Based on the foregoing, the court CONTINUES the motion to
compel arbitration to _________, in order to determine whether reclassification
is necessary.
The court sets a status conference for ___________.
