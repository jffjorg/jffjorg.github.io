And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has reviewed the Third Amended Complaint (TAC) filed by plaintiffs Lachica Ousley and Angelique Johnson Ousley against defendants Holiday Inn Express / Sued Hollywood Stay LLC Hotel and Sherri Hoodworth. The defendants filed a demurrer, arguing that the complaint is uncertain and ambiguous. The court agrees with the defendants and sustains the demurrer. The court finds that the TAC does not cure the defects of the previous complaints because it is still unclear and difficult to understand. The court denies leave to amend the complaint, citing the plaintiffs' four previous attempts to state a claim and their failure to file responsive pleadings. The court grants the motion to dismiss and denies the plaintiffs' request for compensation.
