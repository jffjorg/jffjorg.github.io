The Court strikes  Defendant’s answer with 30 days leave to amend.   BACKGROUND    This is a wrongful  termination action brought by Plaintiff, the California State Labor  Commissioner, on behalf of the People of the State of California, for civil  penalties, injunctive relief, and costs of suit as damages arising from defendants  Hugo Hernandez and E & J Construction Landscape Inc., a/k/a E & J  Construction Landscape Inc.’s unlawful retaliation, under Labor Code sections  244 and 1019, against Mr. Epifanio Huerta (“Complainant”) for engaging in  activity protected under Labor Code sections 98.6 and 1102.5. (Compl. 1:26–2:3.)     On 3/14/24,  Plaintiff filed her complaint, alleging against both defendants the following  causes of action: (1) Violation of Labor Code § 98.6; (2) Violation of Labor  Code § 244; (3) Violation of Labor Code § 1019(a); and (4) Violation of Labor  Code § 1102.5. On 6/24/24, Defendant filed his answer.   On 6/27/24,  Plaintiff filed the instant motion to strike Defendant’s answer. On 10/29/24,  Defendant filed his notice of non-opposition.[1]   ANALYSIS   Under Code of Civil Procedure section 436,  the Court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms  it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in  any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a).) The court may also strike  all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws  of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Id., §  436, subd. (b).) The grounds  for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of  judicial notice. (Id., § 437.)    Here,  Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s answer must be stricken because it is  unverified and fails to contain specific denials, in violation of Code of Civil  Procedure sections 446, subdivision (a), and 431.30, subdivision (d). (Pl.’s  Mot. 4:12–22.) Defendant concedes that “Plaintiff’s motion to strike is  unopposed and Defendant requests leave to file an amended Answer on or before  December 6, 2024.” (Def.’s Not. of Non-Opp. 2:19–20.)   Based on  the foregoing, the Court grants the unopposed motion to strike Defendant’s  answer, with 30 days leave to amend.    CONCLUSION    The unopposed  motion is granted. The Court strikes Defendant’s answer with 30 days leave to  amend.
