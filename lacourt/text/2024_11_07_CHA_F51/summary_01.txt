And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argued that Assembly Bill 218 (AB 218) is unconstitutional and creates a gift of public funds. The defendant also requested a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of two cases before the Court of Appeal. The judge found that AB 218's exemption to the claims presentation requirement does not create substantive liability where none previously existed, and therefore does not violate the gift clause of the California Constitution. The judge also found that the public purpose exception applies, as AB 218 serves a valid public purpose of maximizing claims of sexual-abuse minor plaintiffs for as expansive a period of time as possible. The judge denied the motion for stay of proceedings, finding that the action should proceed to trial given the passage of time since the alleged sexual assault occurred.
