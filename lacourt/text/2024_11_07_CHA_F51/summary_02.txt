And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the motions to compel further responses to discovery requests. The motions were filed by the plaintiff, Elda Ocampo, seeking to compel the defendant, Ford Motor Company, to provide further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents.

The judge granted the motions in part, ordering the defendant to provide further code-compliant responses to the plaintiff's special interrogatories, set one, numbers 45-48, as limited above; and to the plaintiff's requests for production of documents, set one, numbers 16, 19-29, and 31, within 30 days.

The judge also declined to issue monetary sanctions, as neither party was completely successful in bringing or opposing the motions. The plaintiff had sought sanctions of $4,460.00 against the defendant and its attorney.

The dispute arose from the plaintiff's allegations that the defendant failed to provide code-compliant responses to the discovery requests, and the defendant's opposition to the plaintiff's motions. The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
