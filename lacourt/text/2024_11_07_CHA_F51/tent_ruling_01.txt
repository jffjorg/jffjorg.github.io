BACKGROUND
 
This is a childhood sexual assault

ANALYSIS
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings made by a defendant
may be based on the following grounds: (1) the court has no jurisdiction of the
subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint or (2) the complaint
does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that
defendant. (Code Civ. Proc. § 438, subd. (c)(1)(B).) “The
grounds for motion … shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or
from any matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice.” (Id.
at subd. (d).)
 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings serves the function
of a demurrer, challenging only defects on the face of the complaint.” (Richardson-Tunnell
v. School Ins. Program for Employees (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1056, 1061.) In
considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings, courts consider whether the
factual allegations, assumed true, are sufficient to constitute a cause of
action. (Fire Insurance Exchange v. Superior Court (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 446, 452–453.)
 
Here,
Defendant moves for a judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff’s entire
complaint, arguing that Assembly Bill 218 (“AB 218”), which further amended
Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 in 2019, “cannot constitutionally operate
to revive already unenforceable claims that were subject to the claims
presentation requirements before AB 218, because the Legislature has no power
to create liability for past conduct where no enforceable claim existed.” (Def,’s
Mot. 6:12–14.)
 
A.    Meet-and-Confer 
 
Before filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the
moving party must meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party that
filed the pleading subject to the motion to determine whether an agreement can
be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 439, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Defendant’s counsel declares that on 4/1730/24, she met
and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel to discuss the issues raised in the
instant motion, but the parties were unable to come to a resolution. (Decl. of Katti
E. Trinh, ¶ 5.) Therefore, the Court finds that
counsel has satisfied the preliminary meet and confer requirements of
Code of Civil Procedure section 439, subdivision (a). 
 
B.    
Constitutionality of AB 218
 
Plaintiff brings this action under
Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1, which sets forth the procedural
requirements that must be followed when a plaintiff seeks to pursue a claim for
childhood sexual assault. Actions brought under Section 340.1 are subject to
the Government Claims Act, which typically requires written claims for damages
against a public entity to be timely presented to that entity for resolution
prior to filing suit. (Gov. Code §
900 et seq.) In 2019, the Legislature enacted AB 218, which revived
otherwise time-barred claims for childhood sexual abuse, and exempted all
claims based on childhood sexual assault from the claims presentation
requirement, with retroactive application. (Coats v. New Haven Unified
School District (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, 424.)
 
1.     
Gift Clause
 
Here, Defendant argues that AB 218
constitutes an unconstitutional gift of public funds. The gift clause of the
California Constitution states, in relevant part, that “the Legislature shall
have no power ... to make any gift or authorize the making of any gift, of any
public money or thing of value to any individual, municipal or other
corporation whatever ....” (Cal. Const., art. XVI, § 6.) The gift clause denies
“to the legislature the right to make direct appropriations to individuals from
general considerations of charity or gratitude, or because of some supposed
moral obligation resting upon the people of the state.” (Stevenson v. Colgan
(1891) 91 Cal. 649, 651.)
 
Defendant argues that “AB 218
violates the Constitutional prohibition against gifts of public funds, because
imposition of liability for a ‘past act of negligence’ against a public entity ‘would,
in effect, be the making of a gift.’” (Def.’s Mot. 10:24–26, quoting Heron
v. Riley (1930) 209 Cal. 507, 517.) Defendant argues that therefore, “in the
years before AB 218 was enacted, plaintiff did not have an enforceable claim
against the District because plaintiff did not present a claim for damages
within six months of Jeffrey Plum’s alleged misconduct, as was required by the
Government Claim Act at that time.” (Id. at 15:17–19.)
 
Defendant’s argument relies on the
theory that the claims presentation requirement is a substantive element of
Defendant’s liability to Plaintiff under Section 340.1. However, this precise argument
was considered and rejected by the Court of Appeal in its recently published
opinion in West Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of
Contra Costa County (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 1243, a case directly applicable
here. In West Contra Costa, the Court of Appeal specifically held that
the claims presentation requirement did not impose substantive liability on the
defendant school district for revived claims of childhood sexual assault. (103
Cal.App.5th at 1257.) Rather, the West Contra Costa Court found that “the
claim presentation requirement is a condition on the state’s consent to suit,
and not an aspect of the state’s substantive liability. … Accordingly, the [Government
Claims Act] itself makes clear that the District’s substantive liability
existed when the alleged wrongful conduct occurred; timely presentation of a
claim was a condition to waiver of government immunity, but it was not
necessary to render the underlying conduct tortious.” (Id. at 1261.)
 
Based on the foregoing, here, as in
West Contra Costa, the Court finds that AB 218’s exemption to the
claims presentation requirement does not create substantive liability where
none previously existed. Accordingly, the Court follows West Contra Costa and
finds that AB 218’s retroactive waiver is not a gift of public funds. 
 
2.     
Public Purpose Exception
 
Even if, assuming arguendo, AB
218’s retroactive waiver was found to be a gift of public funds, such an
appropriation is not unconstitutional if it is to be used for a public purpose.
(Los Angeles County v. La Fuente (1942) 20 Cal.2d 870, 876–877 [“In
determining whether an appropriation of public money is to be considered a gift
within the constitutional prohibition, the primary question is whether the
funds are to be used for a public or a private purpose. If the money is for a
public purpose, the appropriation is not a gift even though private persons are
benefited by the expenditure.”].) “The determination of what constitutes a
public purpose is primarily a matter for the Legislature to determine, and its
discretion will not be disturbed by the courts so long as that determination
has a reasonable basis.” (County of Alameda v. Carleson (1971) 5 Cal.3d
730, 746.)
 
Here, Plaintiff argues that AB
218’s retroactive waiver falls within the public purpose exception because “‘the
language of the retroactivity provision of section 340.1 indicates a clear
legislative intent to maximize claims of sexual-abuse minor plaintiffs for as
expansive a period of time as possible. The public policy is manifest from the
text of the law.’” (Pl.’s Opp. 8:22–25, quoting Liebig v. Superior Court
(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 828, 834.) “The legislative history [of AB 218], noting
that Code of Civil Procedure section ‘340.1’s delayed discovery provisions
recognize’ that ‘[f]or many victims, the emotional and psychological trauma
from childhood sexual abuse does not manifest itself until well into adulthood,’
states the intention ‘to ensure that victims severely damaged by childhood
sexual abuse are able to seek compensation from those responsible, whether
those responsible are private or public entities.’” (Coats, 46
Cal.App.5th at 422.)
 
Defendant argues in reply that “it
is the Court’s role to make a determination on [the] issue [of AB 218’s
constitutionality] regardless of policy considerations.” (Def.’s Reply 7:21–
22.) Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendant have not shown that
AB 218 does not serve a valid public purpose. Accordingly, the Court finds that
any purported “gift” of public funds created by AB 218 is not unconstitutional.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied.MOTION FOR STAY OF
PROCEEDINGS

Los Angeles Superior Court Case
# 22CHCV01419

  
Motion Filed: 6/18/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant/Cross-Complainant William S.
Hart Union High School District (erroneously sued as Doe 2) (“Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff C.C. (“Plaintiff”)
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order staying proceedings in the
instant action pending the Court of Appeal’s outcome of two matters pending
before it.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is denied. Defendant’s
request for judicial notice is granted as to Exhibit H, and is granted as to
the existence, but not the contents, of Exhibits A–G.
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Trial courts generally have the
inherent power to stay proceedings in the interests of justice and to promote
judicial efficiency.” (Freiberg v. City of Mission Viejo (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489.)
 
Here, Defendant has concurrently
filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings against Plaintiff. Defendant
argues that the substantive issues argued in its motion for judgment on the
pleadings are pending before the Court of Appeal in two different matters, and
that “a decision by either court will govern this Court’s decision on the
District’s upcoming motion for judgment on the pleadings. Thus, the District
requests that this Court stay this matter pending resolution of one or both of
the pending writs.” (Def.’s Mot. 3:24–27.)
 
Defendant argues that the action
should be stayed as requested to avoid wasting the Court’s resources and litigating
the case when a decision by the Court of Appeal may dispose of the litigation
entirely at the pleadings stage. (Def.’s Mot. 6:11–16, 9:19–25.) 
 
Here, the Court agrees with
Plaintiff that as the facts underlying this case occurred over 40 years ago,
any further delays in bringing the case to trial may result in the loss of
evidence and/or recoverable damages due to deteriorating memories, health
issues, etc. (Pl.’s Opp. 4:10–16.) The Court further notes that since the date
of the filing of the instant motion, the Court of Appeal recently published
opinion in West Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of
Contra Costa County (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 1243. Any future rulings on Roe
#2 v. Superior Court (Second Appellate District, Div. 6, Case No. B334707)
may be considered by this Court if and when they are finalized or published by
the Court of Appeal.


Based on the foregoing
circumstances of the instant case, the Court finds insufficient basis to stay
this action. Accordingly, the motion is denied.
 
CONCLUSION¿ 
 
The motion
is denied.
