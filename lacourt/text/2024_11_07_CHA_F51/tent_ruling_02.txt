BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff brings this action under the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act (Civil Code § 1790 et seq.) for a vehicle she purchased on or
around 9/2/19, for which Defendant issued the manufacturer’s express warranty.
(Compl. ¶¶ 7, 15.) Plaintiff alleges that “defects and nonconformities to
warranty manifested themselves within the applicable express warranty period.
The nonconformities substantially impaired the use, value and/or safety of the
Subject Vehicle.” (Id. at ¶ 16.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant “has
failed to promptly make restitution in accordance with the Song-Beverly Act.”  (Id. at ¶ 29.) 
 
On 5/16/23, Plaintiff filed her complaint, alleging against Defendant
the following causes of action: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of
Express Warranty; (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied
Warranty; and (3) Violation of Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2. On 6/21/23,
Defendant filed its answer.
 
On 10/10/23, Plaintiff served her first set of discovery
requests on Defendant. (Decl. of Armando Lopez ¶ 3.) On 11/14/23, Defendant
served its responses thereto, with verifications served on 5/2/24. (Id.
at ¶ 4.) On 10/21/24, Defendant served Plaintiff with supplemental responses to
RFP Nos. 45 and 46. (Decl. of Hannah M. Biemann ¶ 4.)
 
On 7/1/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motions to compel further
responses to the subject discovery requests. On 10/25/24, Defendant filed its
oppositions thereto. On 10/31/24, Plaintiff filed her replies.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The
party to whom interrogatories have been propounded shall respond in writing
under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of the following: (1) An
answer containing the information sought to be discovered; (2) An exercise of
the party’s option to produce writings; or (3) An objection to the particular
interrogatory.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) “Each answer in a
response to interrogatories shall be as complete and straightforward as the
information reasonably available to the responding party permits.” (Code Civ
Proc. § 2030.220.) “If an objection is made to an interrogatory or to a part of
an interrogatory, the specific ground for the objection shall be set forth
clearly in the response. If an objection is based on a claim of privilege, the
particular privilege invoked shall be clearly stated.” (Code Civ Proc. §
2030.240, subd. (b).)
 
A
propounding party may move for an order compelling further responses to
interrogatories if any of the following apply: “(1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate; or (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300,
subd. (a).)  
 
California
law requires a responding party to respond to each request for production of
documents with either a statement of compliance, a representation that the
party lacks the ability to comply, or an objection to the demand. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.210, subd. (a).)
 
If the
response includes an objection to the demand in part, it must also include a
statement of compliance or noncompliance as set forth above. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.240, subd. (a).) Additionally, the response must (1) identify the
particular document that falls within the category of the request to which the
objection is being made, and (2) expressly set forth the extent of, and
specific ground for, the objection. (Id., subd. (b).)¿A propounding party may
move for an order compelling further response to a discovery request if it
decides that: “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete”;
“(2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive”; or “(3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (a).)¿ 
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks to
compel Defendant’s additional responses the subject discovery requests, arguing
that Plaintiff’s responses are not code-compliant and that its objections are
without merit.
 
A.   
Meet and Confer 
 
A motion to compel further
discovery responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration stating, “facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2016.040.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that on 4/30/24, he sent Defendant’s counsel a meet-and-confer
letter raising the issues discussed herein. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 5.) The parties were unable to come to an informal
resolution (Id. at ¶¶ 6–11.) Therefore, the
Court finds that counsel has satisfied the preliminary meet and confer
requirement under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300, subdivision (b)(1)
and 2031.310, subdivision (b)(2).
 
B.    
Special Interrogatory Nos. 45–48
 
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatory Nos. 45–48 “seek repair
rates for 2020 Ford Explorer vehicles including the top five symptoms and
components replaced.” (Pl.’s SPROG Mot. 4:18–19.) In response, Defendant
asserted objections based on scope, ambiguity, relevance, and undue burden.
(Ex. B to Lopez Decl.)
 
Here, Plaintiff argues that “the information sought is
relevant because it would tend to show whether a widespread defect or
nonconformity—of the same type that Plaintiff experienced—exists in these types
of vehicles. This information could refute Ford’s affirmative defenses claiming
that Plaintiff and/or others misused or abused the vehicle or engaged in
unauthorized or unreasonable use as the cause of the problems with the vehicle.”
(Pl.’s SPROG Mot. at 4:23–28.) Plaintiff further argues that “this information
is relevant to proving whether a civil penalty is warranted because it would
tend to show whether Ford made its determination not to repurchase Plaintiff’s
vehicle even though Ford had information indicating that these types of vehicles
contained a defect or nonconformity and, thus, failed to use information
reasonably available to it.” (Id. at 5:14–17.)
 
Defendant argues in opposition that “Ford properly objected
to Special Interrogatory Nos. 45-48 as overly broad and seeking irrelevant
documents because they are not limited to a relevant timeframe, to any specific
claim or repair, to Plaintiff, to the allegations in Plaintiff’s Complaint, to
any specific or alleged malfunction, problem or concern, or to the allegations
in this case.” (Def.’s SPROG Opp. 1:12–15.) Defendant asserts that the requests
“seek information about the entire Ford Explorer, which is comprised of
hundreds of systems and sub-systems, and thousands of individual components and
parts,” but “systems, components, and parts that were never repaired on
Plaintiff’s vehicle, and which are not at issue in her Complaint, are plainly
not relevant.” (Id. at 5:23–27.)
 
In reply, Plaintiff argues that “interrogatories 45-48 would
be probative of whether Ford had reason to know that its 2020 Ford Explorer
vehicles were experiencing an abnormally high number of warranty repairs
regarding the same problems that Plaintiff experienced with their vehicle.”
(Pl.’s SPROG Reply 2:10–12.)
 
The Court agrees with Defendant that Special Interrogatory
Nos. 45–48 are not sufficiently tailored in scope. Accordingly, the Court
limits the scope of the interrogatories to repairs of 2020 Ford Explorer
vehicles, purchased in California, for the specific defects alleged in
Plaintiff’s complaint. The motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to
Special Interrogatory Nos. 45–48 is granted with this limitation.
 
C.   
RFP Nos. 16, 19–29, 31, and 45–46
 
“Here, the RFPs at issue for this motion include requests
seeking Ford’s policies and procedures related to its compliance with the
Song-Beverly Act.” (Pl.’s RFP Mot. 4:24–25.) RFP Nos. 45 and 46 seek “similar
complaints and warranty repairs.” (Id. at 5:17.) In response, Defendant
asserted objections and statements of partial compliance.
 
Plaintiff argues that further responses should be compelled
because “requests seeking documents evidencing Ford’s policies, procedures, and
instructions are relevant because they would show whether Ford’s policies are
meant to hinder consumers from seeking their statutory remedies, whether they
comport with Ford’s duties under the Song-Beverly Act including whether they
seek to provide an inferior remedy than Ford is required to provide, what
criteria Ford uses for determining whether a vehicle qualifies for repurchase
or replacement, or whether Ford has even enacted any policies or procedures for
dealing with its affirmative obligations under the Act.” (Id. at
5:9–15.)
 
RFP No. 16 seeks Defendant’s “warranty claims policy and
procedure manual(s) from 2019 to the present.” (Pl.’s RFP Sep. Stmt. 1:3.) In
response, Defendant stated that it would “comply with this Request in part, and
… produce its Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual applicable to 2023, the year
in which Plaintiff filed suit against Ford regarding the subject vehicle,
subject to a protective order.” (Id. at 1:5–9.) The Court finds that because
Plaintiff purchased the subject vehicle in 2019, Plaintiff is entitled to
Defendant’s warranty policies and procedure manuals, published by Defendant and
provided to its authorized repair facilities, within the State of California,
for the period of 2019 to present. 
 
RFP Nos. 19–29 and 31 seek documents regarding customer
requests for vehicle repurchase and/or determinations of whether a vehicle is
eligible for a repurchase or refund. In response, Defendant stated that it
would partially comply with the requests, “and offered to produce one or more
of the following: (1) Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual; (2) policies and
procedures for Ford’s Customer Relationship Center (‘CRC’); and (3) RAV Policy
& Procedure Manual, applicable to 2023, subject to a protective order.”
(Def.’s RFP Opp. 10:20–23.) Plaintiff maintains that these responses are
deficient because “Ford failed to provide a proper statement of compliance
indicating that it will comply in whole and produce all responsive documents.
Instead, it unilaterally decided which documents it would produce without
indicating that it is producing the whole universe of responsive documents.”
(Pl.’s RFP Reply 1:21–25.) The Court agrees and finds that Plaintiff is
entitled to all documents evidencing policies and procedures used to evaluate
customer requests for repurchase pursuant to the Song-Beverly Act, for the
period of 2019 to present, as Plaintiff purchased the subject vehicle in 2019. While
Defendant argues that its response to RFP No. 24 is code-compliant, stating
that “Ford responded that it had conducted a reasonable and diligent search,
and did not locate responsive scripts,” the Court finds no such response to RFP
No. 24 on file.
 
RFP Nos. 45 and 46 seek documents evidencing complaints and
repairs regarding the 2020 Ford Explorer. Defendant asserts that no further
responses are warranted because “in its supplemental responses to Request Nos.
45 and 46, Ford agreed to produce the very documents that Plaintiff requested,
including documents sufficient to identify customer complaints or concerns in
California regarding vehicles that are of the same year, make, and model as Plaintiff’s
vehicle, which is a 2020 Ford Explorer, equipped with a 3.0L Ecoboost V6 engine
and a 10-speed Automatic Transmission (10R80), involving the symptoms from
Plaintiff’s repair records allegedly exhibited in Plaintiff’s vehicle.” (Def.’s
RFP Opp. 11:26–12:3.) Plaintiff concedes that “further responses are no longer
needed.” (Pl.’s RFP Reply, p. 1, n.1.) Accordingly, the Court declines to
compel any further responses to RFP Nos. 45 and 46.
 
D.   
Sanctions
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction … against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand [or interrogatories], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (h).)
 
Here, Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the total
amount of $4,460.00 to be imposed against Defendant and its attorney. As the
Court finds that neither party was completely successful in bringing or
opposing the instant motions, the Court declines to issue monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motions are granted in part.
The Court orders Defendant to provide further code-compliant responses to
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 45–48, as limited above; and to Plaintiff’s RFPs, Set
One, Nos. 16, 19–29, and 31,
within 30 days. The Court declines to issue monetary sanctions.
