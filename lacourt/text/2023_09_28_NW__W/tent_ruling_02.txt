California, 91423 (“the Premises”) for $4,250.00 each and every month to the
Defendants along with a deposit of $8,500.00and the Defendants would pay for
same. Plaintiff alleges Defendants breached the agreement by failing to pay the
monthly rent and security deposit. Plaintiff further breached the agreement by
failing to disclose all occupants of the Premises and submitting an application
for each occupant of the Premises as well as failing to maintain the Premises.

TENTATIVE
RULING:  DENY
 
The court cannot award a default
judgment greater than the amount pleaded in the complaint, including if the
complaint does not specify the amount. 
(See Falahati v. Kondo (2005) 127 Cal.App. 4th 823,
830-831.)  The complaint seeks at most $55,500.00
for the first and third causes of action and $25,500 for the second and fourth
causes of action and punitive damages in the amount of $50,000.00. However,
Plaintiff seeks $224,476.00 in their default judgment packet. 
 
Moreover, Plaintiff claims $143,726.00 of the damages are from
damages to the flooring, walls, ceilings, plumbing, and so forth. Plaintiff
provides no evidence of such, nor any evidence of defendant’s financial net
worth, to support the request for punitive damages.
