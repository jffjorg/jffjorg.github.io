And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Audrey Povar v. Stelios Christakis Shakallis, case number 23VECV00709. The plaintiff, Audrey Povar, had filed a motion to compel the defendant, Stelios Christakis Shakallis, to provide discovery responses. The defendant had failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, and the plaintiff sought to compel the defendant to respond. The judge has ruled that the motion to compel is moot, as the defendant has since provided discovery responses. The judge has also awarded the plaintiff $1,990.00 in sanctions, which is less than the amount requested by the plaintiff. The judge found that the defendant had failed to respond to the discovery requests in a timely manner, but that the plaintiff could have avoided filing the motion to compel by simply notifying the defendant's counsel about the outstanding discovery. The case arises out of an automobile accident that occurred on September 13, 2021, and the plaintiff alleges that the defendant was negligent in operating his vehicle.
