And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that Plaintiff Audrey Povar's motion to compel Defendant Stelios Christakis Shakallis to provide verified responses to discovery requests is MOOT. The judge has also granted Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,990.00, total.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that Defendant failed to serve timely responses to Plaintiff's discovery requests, despite the fact that Defendant had the obligation to respond. The judge has also taken into account Defendant's argument that the discovery requests were not properly served, but has found that Defendant's failure to respond was not justified.

The judge has awarded Plaintiff one hour to prepare each motion to compel and one hour of appearance time, as well as a $60 filing fee per motion. The judge has also imposed a reduced amount of sanctions, totaling $1,990.00, to compensate Plaintiff for the costs and expenses incurred in bringing the motion.
