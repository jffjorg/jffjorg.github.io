BACKGROUND
 
This matter arises out of an automobile accident that occurred on September

it caused his vehicle to collide with Plaintiff’s vehicle from the rear left as

Defendant for negligence.

DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff Audrey Povar moves to compel Defendant Stelios
Christakis Shakallis to provide verified responses to Plaintiff’s discovery
requests, without objection, within ten days of the hearing date of this
motion. Plaintiff further requests the court impose monetary sanctions against
Defendant and his attorneys of record in the sum of $1,460.00 per motion for
the reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred and to be incurred in
bringing this motion.
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to
discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§
2030.290, 2031.300, 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails
to serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may also move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (CCP §
2033.280(b).)
 
On June 2, 2023, Plaintiff propounded Form
Interrogatories, Set One; Request for Admissions, Set One, Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One to
Defendant Stelios Christakis Shakallis. (Osorio Decl. ¶ 2.) Responses were due
by or before July 6, 2023. (Osorio Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant did not serve any
responses by July 6, 2023.  (Osorio Decl.
¶4.) As of the date of the filing of this motion, Defendant has failed to
provide any responses to the written discovery. (Osorio Decl. ¶6.) 
 
In opposition, Defendant has provided discovery responses. (Flock
Decl., Exhs. A-D.) Defendant contends the discovery at issue was only served on
John Flock, but not served on Candice VanDeudekom. (Flock Decl. ¶4.) However,
all discovery served by Defendant in this matter has originated from paralegal,
Candice VanDeudekom. (Flock Decl. ¶4.) Moreover, Mr. Flock never consented to
electronic service whereas Ms. VanDeudekom has. Under these circumstances, service
of the discovery at issue was improper because the appropriate persons were not
served. Defendant further contends Plaintiff did not meet and confer before
filing these discovery motions. (Flock Decl. ¶9.) If Plaintiff had simply
notified defense counsel about the outstanding discovery, the discovery motions
could have been entirely avoided. 
 
Affirmative consent to electronic service is correct only in the case
of self-represented parties. (CCP § 1010.6(c)(3)(ii); Rule of Court
2.251(c)(3)(B).) For represented parties, like Defendant, such parties must
accept electronic service because electronic service is mandatory in Los
Angeles Superior Court. (CCP § 1010.6(b)(1-2).) Accordingly, even though the
subject discovery was electronically served on Flock and not VanDeudekom, Defendant
had the obligation to respond. Moreover, there is no meet and confer
requirement in a motion to compel initial discovery responses. However, the
court agrees that if Plaintiff had attempted to reach out to Defense counsel,
these motions could have been avoided. 
 
Accordingly, the motions to compel are MOOT. 
 
Sanctions
 
The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in
the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or
both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone
as a result of that conduct. (CCP §2023.030.) 
 
Plaintiff requests $1,460.00 per motion ($5,840.00 total), which
includes 3 hours drafting each motion and 1 hour per motion for preparing a
reply and attending the hearing. Counsel’s hourly rate is $350.00. Plaintiff
does not provide an explanation for the additional $60 per motion. 
 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in the reduced
amount of $1,990.00, total. The court awards one hour to prepare each motion to
compel. Moreover, the court finds only one appearance was necessary for the
motions, and awards 1.0 hours of appearance time as well as $60 filing fee per
motion.
