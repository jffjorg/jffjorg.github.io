Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's request for a default judgment in the amount of $224,476.00. The Judge cites California law, specifically Falahati v. Kondo, which states that a court cannot award a default judgment greater than the amount pleaded in the complaint. The Plaintiff's complaint seeks damages and punitive damages, but the amount pleaded is $55,500.00 for the first and third causes of action and $25,500.00 for the second and fourth causes of action. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff provides no evidence to support the request for punitive damages and that the amount sought in the default judgment packet is greater than the amount pleaded in the complaint.
