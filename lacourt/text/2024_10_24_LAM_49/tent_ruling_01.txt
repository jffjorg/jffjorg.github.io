After Plaintiffs moved to enforce terms of the settlement agreement pursuant to CCP section 664.6, the court entered judgment in Plaintiffs’ favor on June 5, 2024.Plaintiffs now move to recover their reasonably attorney’s fees and costs. Defendant opposed.  TENTATIVE RULING:Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED IN PART in the total amount of $20,000.00.Plaintiffs are awarded their full costs in the sum of $4,004.75.Moving parties are ordered to give notice, unless waived.DISCUSSION:Motion for Attorney’s FeesA. Legal StandardCivil Code § 1794, subdivision (d) provides: (d) If the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.(Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d) [emphasis added].)The determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial courts.  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.)  “The determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  In setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar work.’”  (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664.)  The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees.  (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal. App. 4th 603, 615.) The Court has broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee award which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 1379, 1393-94.  The Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)B. AnalysisPlaintiffs move to recover their reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. The parties do not dispute that Plaintiffs are the prevailing parties under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees as the prevailing buyer.  The only matter at issue is the reasonableness of the fees requested.By this motion, Plaintiffs seek $37,035.00 in attorney’s fees, plus a 1.5 multiplier, for a total award of $55,552.50.  1. Reasonable Hourly RatePlaintiffs were represented by two law firms in this action: (1) Norman Taylor & Associates (“NTA”) and (2) Wirtz Law. NTA seeks compensation at rates of $250.00 per hour for work by two paralegals, and $645.00 per hour for work by attorney Norman F. Taylor. (Taylor Decl. ¶ 13, Exh. 1.)Wirtz Law seeks compensation at rates between $250.00 per hour and $300.00 per hour for work by three paralegals, and at rates between $450.00 and $550.00 per hour for four attorneys. (Wirtz Decl. ¶¶ 16-22, Exh. 1.)Here, Plaintiffs have demonstrated these rates are consistent with the general prevailing rates in the Los Angeles area and have recently been approved by courts in similar circumstances. Thus, under the totality of the circumstances and based upon general prevailing rates in the Los Angeles area for this type of litigation, this court finds the quoted rates to be reasonable. Considering the number of attorneys and paralegals all billing at varied rates, for Lodestar purposes, this court will award a blended hourly rate of $400.00 per hour. This determination considers the complexity of the case, the quality of services provided, and the attorneys’ experience.  2. Number of Hours Reasonably ExpendedIn total, Plaintiffs’ counsel’s records reflect 33 hours billed by NTA, and 52.5 hours billed by Wirtz Law. (Taylor Decl., Exh. 1, p. 6; Wirtz Decl., Exh. 1, p. 11.)"[I]t is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged [within the moving party’s verified billing invoice], with a sufficient argument and citations to evidence.  General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.”  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)  In opposition, Defendants argue Plaintiffs’ dragged out this “routine” lemon law case to garner a higher fee award. Defendants point to several time entries in the billing records that they contend are duplicative, unreasonable, or unnecessary. Based on this court’s independent review of the billing records and consideration of the case, some of Defendants’ points are well-taken. The case involved little law and motion practice or discovery. Moreover, as Plaintiffs’ attorneys are well-versed in lemon law, the issues involved were applicable to other consumers’ vehicles, thereby triggering economies of scale in terms of Plaintiffs’ counsel’s efficiency in litigating this matter. This should not have required anything more than slight factual modification to existing boilerplate. In light of these considerations, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total amount of reasonable attorney’s fees in this case, using a lodestar methodology, is $20,000. This was calculated by multiplying the hourly rate of $400 by 50 hours, which this court deems to be the total amount of reasonable attorney’s fees in this matter on behalf of Plaintiffs.The Court in its discretion declines to apply a multiplier given this was a relatively standard Song-Beverly case with no novel or complex issues of law.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED IN PART in the total amount of $20,000.00.3. Costs and ExpensesPlaintiffs seek costs in the amount of $3,124.68 for Wirtz Law and $880.07 for NTA.  (See Memoranda of Costs.) Plaintiffs filed the cost memoranda on July 1, 2024. Defendants did not file a motion to tax or strike, and the time to do so has passed. (See CRC Rule 3.1700(b)(1); CCP § 1010.6(a)(3)(B).) It is the challenging party that has the burden of demonstrating that those costs are unreasonable or unnecessary. (Adams v. Ford Motor Co., 199 Cal. App. 4th 1475, 1486 (2011); 612 South LLC v. Laconic Limited Partnership, 184 Cal. App. 4th 1270, 1285 (2010).)  Based on Defendants’ failure to timely object, Plaintiffs are awarded their full costs. (See Douglas v. Willis (1994) 27 Cal. App. 4th 287, 289 [“failure to file a motion to tax costs constitutes a waiver of the right to object.”].)Accordingly, Plaintiffs are awarded their full costs in the sum of $4,004.75.Moving parties are ordered to give notice, unless waived.  IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   October 24, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
