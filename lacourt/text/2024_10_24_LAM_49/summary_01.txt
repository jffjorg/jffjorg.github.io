And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion for Attorney's Fees filed by Plaintiffs Babken Aladadyan and Madlen Aladadyan. The Plaintiffs seek to recover $37,035.00 in attorney's fees, plus a 1.5 multiplier, for a total award of $55,552.50. The judge has granted the Motion in part, awarding $20,000.00 in attorney's fees. The judge has also awarded the Plaintiffs their full costs in the sum of $4,004.75.

The judge found that the Plaintiffs are entitled to an award of reasonable attorney's fees as the prevailing buyer under the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The judge calculated the reasonable hourly rate at $400.00 per hour, based on the rates charged by the attorneys and paralegals in this case. The judge also found that the number of hours reasonably expended by the attorneys and paralegals was 50 hours.

The judge declined to apply a multiplier, citing that this was a relatively standard Song Beverly case with no novel or complex issues of law. The judge also found that the Plaintiffs' counsel's records were reasonable, despite some minor issues with certain time entries. The judge ordered the moving parties to give notice, unless waived.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change, and any party may submit on the ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.
