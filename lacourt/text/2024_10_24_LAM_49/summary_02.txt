Significant Statements:
  - The court is unaware of any legal authority which requires a court to rule on evidentiary objections on a motion, except as to a motion for summary motion/adjudication or a special motion to strike.
  - The appointment of a receiver is a "drastic," "harsh," and costly remedy that is to be exercised sparingly and with caution.
  - Due to the "extraordinary" nature of this remedy and the special costs it imposes, courts are strongly discouraged – although not strictly prohibited – from appointing a receiver unless the more intrusive oversight of a receiver is a 'necessity' because other, less intrusive remedies are either 'inadequate or unavailable.'

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for an order appointing a receiver to manage the assets of the musical group "Cobra Man." The plaintiff, Sarah Rayne, alleges that the defendant, Andrew Harris, has taken the band's trademark, withdrawn funds from the band's bank account, and locked her out of social media accounts. The defendant has filed a cross-complaint against Rayne, alleging that she fraudulently incorporated Cobra Man, LLC and represented herself as CEO and 50% owner.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for an order appointing a receiver without prejudice, pending a future change of material circumstances. The judge found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate that the band's property is in danger of being lost, removed, or materially injured, and that a receiver is not necessary to preserve the property or rights of the plaintiff.

The judge also denied the defendant's request for attorney's fees and costs against Rayne under CCP § 128.5 or 128.7, finding that the motion was not made in bad faith, nor was it frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to modification or denial at the hearing, and any party may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.
