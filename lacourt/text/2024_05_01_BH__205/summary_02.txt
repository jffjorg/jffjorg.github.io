This tentative ruling is about a lawsuit between A&M Engineering Inc. and several defendants, including Christopher Klein, Alondra Group, LLC, Stelaro LLC, and others. The plaintiff, A&M Engineering Inc., claims that the defendants breached promissory notes and seeks to recover damages. The case arose from a breach of promissory notes in which the plaintiff loaned $14 million to the defendants, who used the money to buy cars in Mexico and resell them for a profit. The plaintiff has filed applications for right to attach orders against the defendants, but the court denied these applications. The defendants have filed a writ of mandate, and the Court of Appeal has ordered the court to reconsider the applications. The court is setting a hearing on the applications for attachment and is granting the plaintiff, Alondra, Stelaro, and Instant leave to file supplemental briefs.
