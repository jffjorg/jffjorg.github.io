```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for an order to show cause and to lift the stay and order the defendants to pay sanctions for failing to comply with the court's previous orders. The court had previously entered a default judgment against the defendants, ordering them to remove any portion of the block wall encroaching on the plaintiff's property. However, the defendants failed to comply with the judgment, and the court ordered sanctions in the amount of $100 per day. The court later vacated the default judgment due to the defendants not being properly served with the summons and complaint. Therefore, the court finds that there is no basis for the plaintiff's motion, and it is denied.
