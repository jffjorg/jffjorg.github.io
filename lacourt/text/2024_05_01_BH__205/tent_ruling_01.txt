  Case Number:  22SMCV01773    Hearing Date:   May 1, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   MITRA H. BRAL,   Plaintiff, v.  KHOSROW SHOUMER, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  22SMCV01773     Hearing Date:  May 1, 2024      [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR AN ORDER    TO SHOW CAUSE RE: LIFTING STAY    AND ORDERING DEFENDANTS PAY    SANCTIONS FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY    WITH COURT’S ORDER        This case arises from a dispute between neighbors.  Plaintiff Mitrah Bral owns her home located at 1207 Beverly Estates Drive, Beverly Hills, California 90210 (the “Bral Property”).  Defendants Khosrow Shoumer and Fariba Shoumer, individually and as trustees of the Shoumer Trust, own the property next door, located at 1211 Beverly Estates Drive, Beverly Hills California 90210 (the “Shoumer Property”).    In 2020, Defendants began construction on the Shoumer Property.  During construction, Plaintiff alleges Defendants’ contractors entered into the Bral Property and destroyed Plaintiff’s landscaping and vegetation.  Defendants also removed Plaintiff’s wood fence bordering the Shoumer Property and erected plywood barriers.  Defendants’ construction activities culminated in two block walls and a chain link fence located between the Bral Property and the Shoumer Property.  Plaintiff alleges a land survey shows that the walls and fence are partly on the Bral Property.   On October 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants alleging a single claim for trespass to land.  The Complaint seeks equitable relief in the form of a judicial order requiring Defendants to remove any portion of the block wall encroaching on the Bral Property.   On August 8, 2023, this Court entered a default judgment against Defendants, ordering them to remove any portion of the block wall encroaching on Plaintiff’s property within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Order by certified mail.  When Defendants failed to comply with the judgment, Plaintiff moved for contempt sanctions.  On November 16, 2023, this Court ordered sanctions in the amount of $100 per day until the wall was removed.   On January 30, 2024, the Court vacated the default judgment because Defendants had not been properly served with the Summons and Complaint.  Accordingly, the Court’s August 8, 2023 and November 16, 2023 orders are no longer in effect.   This hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion for sanctions given Defendants’ failure to comply with the August 8 and November 16 orders.  As those orders were vacated by the Court’s January 30, 2024 order, there is no basis for Plaintiff’s motion.   Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion for an order to show cause re: lifting stay and ordering Defendants pay sanctions for failure to comply with Court’s order.      IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: May 1, 2024               ___________________________ Edward B.
