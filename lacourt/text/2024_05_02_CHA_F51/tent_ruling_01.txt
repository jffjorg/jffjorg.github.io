Plaintiff further  requests monetary sanctions against Defendant in the total amount of $1,560.00.   TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed motion is granted. Defendant  is ordered to provide objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first set of  discovery requests within 20 days. The Court imposes sanctions against Defendant  in the amount of $900.00.   Plaintiff is reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended  General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil. When e-filing  documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set  forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First  Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly bookmarking  declarations and exhibits). (CRC 3.1110(f)(4).) Failure to comply with these  requirements in the future may result in papers being rejected, matters being  placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be resubmitted in  compliance with these requirements, documents not being considered and/or the  imposition of sanctions.   BACKGROUND   This is a personal injury action in  which Plaintiff alleges that on 4/4/22, she was injured by exercise equipment owned  and operated by Defendant at his chiropractic office. (Compl. ¶¶ 15–30.) On 3/21/23,  Plaintiff filed her complaint, alleging against Defendant the following causes  of action: (1) Negligence; and (3) Professional Negligence. On 9/5/23,  Defendant filed his answer.   On 10/16/23, Plaintiff served the subject discovery requests  on Defendant. On 4/8/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motions to compel Defendant’s  responses thereto. No oppositions have been filed to date.   ANALYSIS   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to a request for production of documents if the  responding party fails to serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ.  Proc. §§ 2031.300, subd. (b); 2031.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding  party who fails to serve a timely response “waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to interrogatories if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd.  (b); 2030.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings  under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.  (a).)   Here, as Plaintiff electronically served  the subject discovery requests on Defendant on 10/16/23, the last day for Defendant  to respond was 11/17/23. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).) Plaintiff’s counsel  granted Defendant’s counsel two extensions for Defendant to serve his responses,  bringing the due date for the responses to 12/29/23. (Ex. 5 to Decl.  Christopher J. Keane.) To date, Defendant has not provided responses to the  subject discovery requests. (Keane Decl. ¶ 3.) The  Court notes that Defendant has failed to oppose the instant motion.  Accordingly, the Court grants the instant unopposed motion to compel Defendant  to provide responses to the subject discovery requests.   Sanctions¿    “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).)   “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.  Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).)   Additionally, “the court may impose  a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery  process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable  expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that  conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd. (a).)   Here, Plaintiff requests $1,435.00  in monetary sanctions against Defendant. This amount includes (1) 2 hours of Plaintiff’s  attorney’s time spent preparing the motion; and (2) an anticipated 1 hour appearing  at the hearing, at counsel’s hourly rate of $500.00 per hour. (Keane Decl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff also  seeks to recover $60.00 in filing fees. (Ibid.)   In granting the instant unopposed motion,  the Court finds it reasonable to award Plaintiff sanctions against Defendant in  the total amount of $900.00  CONCLUSION   The unopposed motion is granted.  Defendant is ordered to provide objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first  set of discovery requests within 20 days. The Court imposes sanctions against Defendant  in the amount of $900.00.
