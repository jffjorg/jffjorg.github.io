And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Plaintiff's request for default judgment against Power Lane Logistics, Inc. and has found several defects in the submitted default judgment package. Specifically, the Plaintiff did not file a request for court judgment (Form CIV-100), did not file a declaration of nonmilitary status, and the proposed judgment seeks an amount of damages that is not alleged in the Complaint. Additionally, the Plaintiff's request for prejudgment interest is unclear and the proposed judgment contains a typo. The Court has denied the Plaintiff's apparent request for default judgment without prejudice and will discuss with the Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
