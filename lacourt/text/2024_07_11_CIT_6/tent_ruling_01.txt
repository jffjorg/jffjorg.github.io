  Case Number:  23PSCV03335    Hearing Date:   July 11, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  James Rutherford’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendants: Harpreet S. Sandhu, as trustee of The Sandhu Family  Trust, and Birinder K Sandhu, as trustee of The Sandhu Family Trust  TENTATIVE RULING            Plaintiff’s request for entry of  default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.            BACKGROUND                         This  is an ADA/Unruh Civil Rights Act case. On October 27, 2023, plaintiff James  Rutherford (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Harpreet  S. Sandhu, as trustee of The Sandhu Family Trust, and Birinder K Sandhu, as  trustee of The Sandhu Family Trust (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 to 10, alleging one cause of  action for violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Civil Code § 51 et seq.  On April  16, 2024, default was entered against Defendants. On May 22, 2024, Plaintiff  filed a request for entry of default judgment against Defendants.  LEGAL  STANDARD  Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration  of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all  parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of  grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for  attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS  Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $9,394.09,  including $8,000.00 in damages, $570.00 in attorney fees, and $824.09 in costs.  The Court finds Plaintiff has submitted insufficient evidence to support  Plaintiff’s claim for $8,000.00 in damages. Plaintiff seeks $4,000.00 for the  occurrence of the underlying incident in this action on January 25, 2023, and  $4,000.00 for deterrence. (Compl., Prayer for Relief, ¶¶ 2-4; Summary of the  Case, 2:14-20.) The complaint cites the case of Johnson v. Guedoir (E.D.  Cal. 2016) 218 F.Supp.3d 1096 (Johnson) as the basis for requesting  $4,000.00 as deterrence damages in addition to the $4,000.00 for the underlying  incident. (Compl., Prayer for Relief, ¶ 3.) However, the district court in Johnson  awarded $4,000.00 for deterrence based on the initial incident and then  $4,000.00 for personally encountering the access violations on a later date. (Johnson,  supra, 218 F.Supp.3d at p. 1100.) Further, Plaintiff must identify a  particular occasion on which the plaintiff was reasonably dissuaded from  visiting the facility due to his actual knowledge of the violation. (Civ. Code,  § 55.56(b).) Here, Plaintiff only provides evidence of one incident in this  action that occurred on January 25, 2023. (Compl., ¶ 11; Rutherford Decl., ¶ 3.)  Therefore, Plaintiff is at most entitled to $4,000.00 in damages. (Civ. Code, §  52, subd. (a).)  The  Court also finds that, based on the reduced damage calculation, Plaintiff’s  request for attorney fees must also be reduced. (Local Rule 3.214.) The Court  finds the correct amount of attorney fees that Plaintiff can recover here is  $330.00.  Moreover,  the Court notes that Plaintiff did not complete items 4, 5, or 6 on Form  CIV-100, or sign and date the signature block under those items. (Request for  Entry of Default Judgment, ¶¶ 4-6; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd.  (a).)  CONCLUSION            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
