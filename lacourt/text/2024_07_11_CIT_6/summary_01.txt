And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff had sought default judgment against the defendants in the amount of $9,394.09, including $8,000.00 in damages, $570.00 in attorney fees, and $824.09 in costs. However, the court found that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence to support their claim for $8,000.00 in damages. The court also reduced the amount of attorney fees that the plaintiff could recover to $330.00. Additionally, the court noted that the plaintiff had not completed certain sections of the request for entry of default judgment and had not signed and dated the signature block under those items.
