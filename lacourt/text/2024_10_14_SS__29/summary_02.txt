As for the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to amend a complaint filed by a plaintiff, Allen Leon Tripolskiy, in a personal injury case. The plaintiff is seeking leave to amend his complaint to add a cause of action for negligence per se and a claim for punitive damages. The defendant, Clubbizz, LLC, opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed in bringing the motion and that granting leave to amend would be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant.

The judge notes that the procedural requirements for the motion have been satisfied and that the proposed amendment is not a sham or offered solely for purposes of delay. The judge also notes that the defendant's alleged false statements regarding security guards may have contributed to the delay in bringing the motion.

The judge is concerned about the potential prejudice to the defendant if leave to amend is granted, particularly given the proximity to the scheduled trial date and the need for discovery to be reopened. The judge will hear from counsel on this issue and may consider granting a continuance of the trial date and reopening of discovery.

Ultimately, the judge grants the motion to amend, allowing the plaintiff to file a first amended complaint.
