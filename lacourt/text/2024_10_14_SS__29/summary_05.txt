And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Briana Torrez et al. v. County of Los Angeles. The court has excused the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem and allows counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call.

The court has reviewed the petitions and proposed orders filed by the petitioner, but finds that there are still issues that must be addressed before the petitions can be granted. The court notes that the settlement agreement does not apportion how the amounts would be divided among the claimants and that the petitioner must provide certain information to the court, including the gross settlement amount for each claimant, fees, costs, and medical bills.

The court has calculated that Briana Torrez will receive a net settlement amount of $100,000 and that each of the three children will receive a gross settlement amount of $382,927.64. However, the court notes that this is based on the information provided and that the calculations and assumptions must be verified by the petitioner.

The court has ordered the petitioner to file new or amended petitions and proposed orders that are complete and based on each claimant's share of the global settlement. The hearing on the three petitions to approve minors' compromises is continued to October 14, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. in Dept. 29 at Spring Street Courthouse.
