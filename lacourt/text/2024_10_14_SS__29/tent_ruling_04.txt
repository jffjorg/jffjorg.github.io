22STCV32545
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Francis John Cowhig
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On October 4,
2022, Liying Zou (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Noel Contreras for
negligence and negligence per se under Vehicle Code section 22350 arising out
of an accident on October 7, 2020.
 
On June 25,
2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to correct the name of the defendant to Pedro
Contreras. 
 
Defendant has
yet to make an appearance in this matter.
 
On September 20,
2024, Francis John Cowhig (“Counsel”) filed
this motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. No opposition has been
filed. 
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
The Court notes Counsel
failed to use MC-052 for the declaration portion of the motion. (See California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c).) Further, the motion is not timely served.  Counsel served the motion on September 19, 16
court days before the hearing; timely service would need to include five more
days for service by mail. (Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b).)
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Conclusion
 
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.Moving counsel to give notice.
