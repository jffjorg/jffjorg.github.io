v. County of Los Angeles

Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise for Amado Ruiz
Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise for Annaleia Huertas
Petition
for Approval of Minor’s Compromise for Annarae Huertas
 
Tentative:
 
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the
guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.  
 
On September 16, 2024, the Court issued a minute order explaining,
in detail, the various issues with the petitions and the proposed orders that Petitioner
needs to address before the Court can grant the petitions.
 
On September 23, Petitioner filed three supplemental declarations
but did not file any new or amended petition or proposed order.
 
The Court has carefully reviewed the supplemental declarations,
just as it carefully reviewed all of the prior submissions from
Petitioner.  There are still issues in
the petitions and the proposed orders that must be addressed before the Court
can grant the petitions.
 
The Court understands that the settlement agreement with
defendants is the total amount of $1.3 million and that the agreement did not apportion
how those amounts would be divided as among the claimants.  Nonetheless, Form MC-350 is a mandatory form
that must be filled out fully, completely, and accurately, and it requires
petitioner to provide certain information to the Court, including (but not
limited to): the gross settlement amount that each claimant is to receive; the
fees, costs, and medical bills for each claimant that will be paid out of that
gross settlement amount; the net settlement amount for each claimant; and how
that net settlement amount will be distributed to the claimant.
 
From the most recently filed supplemental declarations, it appears
to the Court that Plaintiff Briana Torrez will receive a net settlement amount
of $100,000.  
 
If Ms. Torrez’s must also pay a proportional amount of the
attorney’s fees, and if Ms. Torrez must also pay one fourth of the costs
incurred by counsel, it appears to the Court that of the total settlement of $1.3
million, the gross amount of Ms. Torrez’s share is $151,217.08.  
 
The Court bases that number on the following calculation.  If the amount paid to Ms. Torrez is subject
to attorney’s fees in the amount of 33.3 percent of the gross settlement, and if
one fourth of the total costs is charged against Ms. Torrez’s share, the attorney’s
fees attributable to Ms. Torrez’s share are $50,355.29 (33.3 percent of
$151,217.08) and the costs attributable to Ms. Torrez’s share are $861.79 (one
fourth of $3,447.15).  That leaves a net
settlement to share to Ms. Torrez in the amount of $100,000. 
 
The remaining gross amount of the settlement, after deduction of
Ms. Torrez’s share, is $1,148,782.92.  Dividing
that amount by three, each of the three children will receive a gross amount of
$382,927.64 from the settlement.
 
Deducted from each of the three children’s gross settlement amount
are attorney’s fees in the amount of $127,514.90 (33.3 percent of $382,927.64)
and each child’s share of the costs in the amount of $861.79 (one fourth of
$3,447.15).  Before payment of medical
liens or other medical expenses, each child will have available the amount of $254,550.95
from the settlement.  (The Court notes
that this is consistent with the figures in paragraph 4 of the most recently
filed supplemental declarations.) 
 
The Court bases these calculations on the information it has
received in the petitions and declarations and inferences that it can draw therefrom.  Petitioner must verify whether the
calculations (and assumptions) are correct. 
If the Court’s calculations are correct, the gross share of the
settlement for each child is $382,927.64 (not $400,000 or $325,000).
 
Petitioner must file new or amended petitions and proposed orders
that are complete, based on each claimant’s share of the global settlement. 
 
Therefore, the
Court CONTINUES the hearing on the three petitions to approve minors’
compromises to __/__/2024 at 1:30 p.m. in Dept. 29 at Spring Street Courthouse.
