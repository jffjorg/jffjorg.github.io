And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies, without prejudice, the defendant's motion for an order setting a reasonable fee for the appearance at deposition of the plaintiffs' treating radiologist, Dr. Hosam Moustafa, M.D. The defendant claims that Dr. Moustafa's invoice for $2,800 is exorbitant and believes a reasonable rate is $1,000 to $1,500. However, the court notes that Dr. Moustafa is a treating doctor who has not been designated as an expert, and the court assumes, without deciding, that a treating doctor is still considered an expert for purposes related to a fee for appearance at deposition. The court denies the motion due to procedural reasons, including the failure to serve the nonparty witness, failure to file a meet and confer declaration, and failure to present evidence to determine the reasonableness of the fee.
