BACKGROUND
 
On January 22, 2024, Plaintiffs Frank
R. Delli Santi and Tori R. Delli Santi sued Defendants Zuma Bay Villas
Association, Lonnie Gordon, Dennis Torres, Rachel Nielson, Marty Ordman, Gina
Eckstein, Jill Van Zeebroeck and Malibu Management Services LLC, asserting
causes of action for (1) negligence; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) breach
of covenants, conditions and restrictions; (4) violation of Civil Code § 4775;
and (5) violation of Civil Code § 5810.
 
Plaintiffs allege they suffered a
catastrophic water loss to their condominium building from water leaking
through the open roof of their building, making their condominium uninhabitable.
Plaintiffs allege Defendants (1) failed to properly oversee and manage the
maintenance of the development; (2) failed to select proper insurance limits
(including deductibles) for the development insurance policy; (3) refused and
failed to pay the deductible when damage sustained to the Plaintiffs' building
fell below the selected deductible amount; and (4) refused and failed to assess
the other Association members to pay the deductible that was owed. The
CC&Rs require the HOA to maintain the roofs of the condominiums. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or to any
of the causes of action in it.  (CCP §
430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only
the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual
allegations or the plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996)
50 Cal. App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court
must treat as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.  (Id. at 732-33.)  The complaint is to be construed liberally to
determine whether a cause of action has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
A. First Cause
of Action for Negligence
 
To plead a cause of action for negligence, one must allege (1) a legal
duty owed to plaintiffs to use due care; (2) breach of duty; (3) causation; and
(4) damage to plaintiff. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2006) 137 Cal. App. 4th 292, 318.)
 
The individual Defendants assert that they cannot be held liable for
negligence because there is no independent tort duty and because Plaintiff did
not suffer physical injury, only economic losses. Under the CC&Rs, the HOA,
through its directors, is responsible for maintaining the roofs of the
condominiums and to obtain adequate insurance. Plaintiffs allege Defendants had
a duty to maintain the roofs with due care and to obtain insurance with due
care. Plaintiffs allege Defendants failed to do so, resulting in severe damage
to Plaintiffs’ unit. Defendants then failed to remedy the damage by failing to
pay for its remediation. This is sufficient to allege a cause of action for
negligence. Plaintiffs have pleaded that Defendants did not act with sound
business judgment.
 
Plaintiffs allege property damage, which is more than just “economic
loss.”
 
The demurrer to the first cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
B. Second Cause
of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty
 
The elements for a breach of fiduciary duty cause of action are “the
existence of a fiduciary relationship, its breach, and damage proximately
caused by that breach.” (Thomson v. Canyon (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 594,
604.)  
 
The individual Defendants assert the second cause of action fails
because HOA directors owe fiduciary duties to the HOA only and not to “third
parties.” Plaintiffs, however, are not “third parties.” At the time of the
damage, they allege they were members of the HOA. Courts have held that the
directors of HOAs owe fiduciary duties to the HOA and its members. (See Coley
v. Eskaton (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 943, 958 [“...the directors of a nonprofit
mutual benefit corporation, like the Association here, are fiduciaries who must
act for the benefit of the corporation and its members.”])


The demurrer to the second cause of action is OVERRULED.


C. Third Cause
of Action for Breach of CC&Rs
 
“The standard elements of a claim for breach of contract are: ‘(1) the
contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff therefrom.’” (Wall Street
Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)
 
The individual Defendants assert the third cause of action fails because
there was no breach of the CC&Rs. Defendants hired a contractor to maintain
the roofs and obtained insurance as required by the CC&Rs. Plaintiff
alleges Defendant failed to maintain the roofs by failing to properly obtain
and supervise the roof repair, causing Defendant damage, and then failed to
maintain sufficient insurance to remedy their failure to obtain and supervise
the repair and payment for the damage. This is sufficient to state a cause of
action for breach of the CC&Rs. Defendants also argue that the claim is
barred by the business judgment rule. Whether a directors’ decision is
protected by the business judgment rule is a question of fact not suitable for
determination on demurrer.
 
The demurrer to the third cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
D. Fourth Cause
of Action for Violation of Civil Code § 4775 and Fifth Cause of Action for
Violation of Civil Code § 5810
 
Under Section 4775(a) of the Civil Code, the HOA has a duty to maintain,
repair and replace the common areas. Under Section 5810, the HOA must notify
members of changes in insurance. Defendants assert that there is no authority
to hold the individual directors liable under these sections. Plaintiffs allege
the individual Defendants took on the responsibility of compliance with these
sections as directors of the HOA. This is sufficient to state claims for
violations of these sections. 
 
The demurrer to the fourth and fifth causes of action is OVERRULED.

BACKGROUND
 
On January 22, 2024, Plaintiffs Frank
R. Delli Santi and Tori R. Delli Santi sued Defendants Zuma Bay Villas
Association, Lonnie Gordon, Dennis Torres, Rachel Nielson, Marty Ordman, Gina
Eckstein, Jill Van Zeebroeck and Malibu Management Services LLC, asserting
causes of action for (1) negligence; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) breach
of covenants, conditions and restrictions; (4) violation of Civil Code § 4775;
and (5) violation of Civil Code § 5810.
 
Plaintiffs allege they suffered a
catastrophic water loss to their condominium building from water leaking
through the open roof of their building, making their condominium uninhabitable.
Plaintiffs allege Defendants (1) failed to properly oversee and manage the
maintenance of the development; (2) failed to select proper insurance limits

ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or to any
of the causes of action in it.  (CCP §
430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only
the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual
allegations or the plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996)
50 Cal. App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court
must treat as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not

A. First Cause
of Action for Negligence
 
To plead a cause of action for negligence, one must allege (1) a legal
duty owed to plaintiffs to use due care; (2) breach of duty; (3) causation; and
(4) damage to plaintiff. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2006) 137 Cal. App. 4th 292, 318.)
 
Defendant HOA asserts that Plaintiffs cannot state a cause of action for
negligence because Defendant did not owe Plaintiffs a tort duty and did not
breach any duties to Plaintiffs. Defendant argues that it is only responsible
for the duties stated in the CC&Rs and HOA statutes. Under the CC&Rs,
the HOA is responsible for maintaining the roofs of the condominiums and to
obtain adequate insurance. Plaintiffs allege Defendants had a duty to maintain
the roofs with due care and to obtain insurance with due care. Plaintiffs
allege Defendants failed to do so, resulting in severe damage to Plaintiffs’
unit. Defendants then failed to remedy the damage by failing to pay for its remediation.
This is sufficient to allege a cause of action for negligence.
 
Defendant also asserts it cannot be held liable for the contractor’s
negligence under SeaBright Ins.
Co. v. US Airways, Inc. (2011) 52
Cal.4th 590, 598. SeaBright Ins. addressed whether one who hires an
independent contractor is liable to the employees of the independent contractor
for injuries sustained while performing the contracted work. It does not
broadly hold that the HOA can never be liable for a contractor’s negligence. 
 
The demurrer to the first cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
B. Second Cause
of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty
 
The elements for a breach of fiduciary duty cause of action are “the
existence of a fiduciary relationship, its breach, and damage proximately
caused by that breach.” (Thomson v. Canyon (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 594,
604.)  
 
Defendant demurs to the second cause of action on the ground that it is
duplicative of the cause of action for negligence. The Court declines to
sustain the demurrer on these grounds. Plaintiffs may allege different theories
of liability under the same facts.
 
The demurrer to the second cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
C. Third Cause
of Action for Breach of CC&Rs
 
“The standard elements of a claim for breach of contract are: ‘(1) the
contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff therefrom.’” (Wall Street
Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)
 
Defendant asserts the third cause of action fails because Defendant
hired a contractor to maintain the roofs and obtained insurance as required by
the CC&Rs. Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed to maintain the roofs by failing
to properly obtain and supervise the roof repair, causing Defendant damage and
then failed to maintain sufficient insurance to remedy their failure to obtain
and supervise the repair and pay for the damage. This is sufficient to state a
cause of action for breach of the CC&Rs. Defendant also argues that the
claim is barred by the business judgment rule. Whether a decision is protected
by the business judgment rule is a question of fact not suitable for
determination on demurrer.
 
The demurrer to the third cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
D. Fourth Cause
of Action for Violation of Civil
Code § 4775
 
Under Section 4775(a) of the
Civil Code, the HOA has a duty to maintain, repair and replace the common
areas. Defendant asserts it did not violate this section because it hired a
contractor to replace the roofs. Plaintiff alleges Defendants failed to
adequately repair the roofs and failed to remedy the damage caused by the
inadequate roof repair. This is sufficient to state a claim for violation of
Civil Code § 4775.
 
The demurrer to the fourth
cause of action is OVERRULED.
