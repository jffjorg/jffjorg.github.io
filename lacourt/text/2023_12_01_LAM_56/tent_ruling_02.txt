MOVING
PARTY: Petitioner
 
            The Court has
considered the moving papers.  No
opposition papers were filed.  Any
opposition papers were required to have been filed and served within 10 days of
receipt of the moving papers under California Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) section 1290.6.
 
BACKGROUND
            On April 27, 2023, Petitioner filed a petition to confirm
the arbitration award issued by the arbitrator in the arbitration proceeding
between Petitioner and Respondent (the “Petition”).  On June 5, 2023, Petitioner filed a notice of
hearing and motion to confirm the Petition (the “Motion”).  The Petition and Motion request that the
Court confirm the arbitration award (the “Award”) issued in Petitioner’s favor
in the amount of $45,163.14 by an arbitrator on April 4, 2023.  (See Petition, Exhibit 8(c).)  The Petition also requests that the Court
award Petitioner interest on the Award and costs of suit.  
 
DISCUSSION
            Under CCP section 1285, any party to an arbitration in
which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or
vacate the award.  (CCP § 1285.)  The petition shall name as respondents all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.  (Id.)  Once a petition to
confirm an award is filed, the superior court must select one of only four
courses of action: it may confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it,
or dismiss the petition.  (EHM
Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21
Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.)  Under CCP section 1286.2, the court may
vacate the award only under very limited circumstances.  (Id.)
 
When
a party petitions the court to confirm the award, the opposing party may seek
vacation of the award by way of response only if he serves and files his
response within 10 days after the service of the petition under CCP section
1290.6.  (Oaktree Capital Management,
L.P. v. Bernard (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 60, 64.)  Unless the response is duly served and filed,
under CCP section 1290, the allegations of the petition are deemed to be
admitted by the other side.  (Id.)  
 
            The
Petition sets forth the terms of the Award. 
As it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Petition in its entirety.  (See Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. v.
Bernard (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 60, 64.)
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
