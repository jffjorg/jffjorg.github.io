As for the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling addresses a motion for summary adjudication filed by plaintiffs Aidan Sciandra, Boualiene Syprasert, and Jack Edjourian against defendants Chronicpractor Caregiver, Inc., Eric Loyola, and Daniela Alexander. The dispute arises from a breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, and specific performance related to the ownership and management of a marijuana dispensary, Chronicpractor Caregiver, Inc. (CCI).

The Judge finds that there are factual issues regarding the interrelationship of the parties' obligations under the agreements and the enforceability of the liquidated damages clause in the binding term sheet, which preclude summary adjudication of the second cause of action. As a result, the motion is denied as to the second cause of action of the TAC.

On the other hand, the Judge grants the motion with respect to the fifth and sixth causes of action in the FAXC, finding that the plaintiffs have met their burden to show that there are no triable issues of material fact regarding the conversion claims alleged in the FAXC.
