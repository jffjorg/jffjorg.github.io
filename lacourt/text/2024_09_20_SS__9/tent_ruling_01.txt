  Case Number:  24STCP01344    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2024    Dept:  9 The criminal history assessment that
the Clerk’s Office ran on September 5, 2024 states in part Petitioner is unable
to be identified and to see the attached live scan results.  The attached live scan results seem to
indicate that Petitioner is not a registered sex offender but the Clerk’s
office’s notation indicates that petitioner is unable to be identified.  This notation is vague and ambiguous.  It is unclear whether this notation means that
despite the attached live scan results that more information is needed or
sufficient information has been provided. 
The petition is continued to September 30, 2024 at 9:30 am.  The Clerk’s Office must re-run the criminal
history assessment and provide more clear notation whether Petitioner has any
convictions, including for offenses that require sex offender registration.
The Name Change Clerk is ordered to
run and complete a criminal history assessment prior to the continued hearing.
Court Clerk to give notice.
