And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by defendants Spinning Gold, LLC and Timothy Bogart to set aside their defaults. The defaults were entered on August 2 and 10, 2023, due to issues with service of process. The defendants argue that service was improper because Bogart was served in the USA when he actually lives in Italy, and Spinning Gold, LLC was served on its entertainment counsel at a law firm where the counsel no longer worked. Since there is no opposition, the motion is granted. The Judge orders the moving parties to give notice and encourages counsel to appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
