On August 2 and August 10, 2023, the Court entered defaults for Defendants Spinning Gold, LLC and Timothy Bogart.Defendants Spinning Gold, LLC and Timothy Bogart now seek to set aside their defaults because (1) Bogart was served in the USA when in fact he lives in Italy and (2) for Spinning Gold, LLC, service was improperly rendered on its entertainment counsel at a law firm where he no longer worked.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 473.5.)Because there is no opposition, the Motion is granted.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 8.54(c); Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
