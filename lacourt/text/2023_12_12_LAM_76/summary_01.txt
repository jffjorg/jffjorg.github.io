English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant Joan Elise Slater's anti-SLAPP special motion to strike the Complaint. The Court finds that Defendant's statements to neighbors and the landlord, which were alleged to be defamatory and harassing, do not constitute protected speech under the anti-SLAPP statute. The Court concludes that Defendant's statements were not made in furtherance of a public issue or issue of public interest, and therefore do not qualify for protection under the statute. The Court also finds that Defendant did not demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits, and therefore denies the anti-SLAPP motion.
