[1]           As the Court will address
below, the allegation regarding the misuse of Plaintiffs’ insurance license is
a separate grounds for a claim for conversion that is not alleged against CLAFMA Defendants. 


[2]           Representations made by non-CLAFMA Defendants are not relevant. Although Plaintiffs
allege numerous statements were made by many different individuals on behalf of
CLAFMA, Winston, and the MetLife Defendants, the TAC does not allege facts
showing any agency relationship among CLAFMA, Winston, and MetLife Defendants.  
 


[3]           Under these
circumstances, the Court must take as true Plaintiffs’ allegations that they
relied on the representations but need not accept that the reliance was
reasonable.


[4]           Defendants
also argue that the is claim is not properly alleged against the individual
defendants, Paul Oyler and Paul Schneider. In opposition, Plaintiffs note that
only Defendant CLAFMA is subject to Plaintiffs’ promissory estoppel claim. (TAC
¶¶ 251-259.)


[5]           Any damages would
seemingly be highly uncertain and may even be nominal in value.  


[6]           Interestingly, this representation was not made to Plaintiffs
but to CLAFMA Defendants – which raises a doubt of how reasonable it was to
rely on this representation where the there is a question as to whether the
representation was made with the intent Plaintiff to rely on it. (See Granadino,
236 Cal. App. 4th at 418, 186 Cal.Rptr.3d 408 [“Promissory estoppel applies
whenever a ‘promise which the promissor should reasonably expect to
induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and
which does induce such action or forbearance’ would result in an ‘injustice’ if
the promise were not enforced.”].)
