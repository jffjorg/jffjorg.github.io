Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling addresses the allegation of misuse of Plaintiffs' insurance license, which is a separate ground for a claim of conversion. The Court must take as true Plaintiffs' allegations that they relied on representations made by CLAFMA, Winston, and MetLife Defendants, but need not accept that the reliance was reasonable. The Court finds that the representations were made to CLAFMA, not the Plaintiffs, which raises a doubt about the reasonableness of the reliance. The promissory estoppel claim is only against CLAFMA, and any damages would likely be nominal in value. The Court notes that the representation was not made to the Plaintiffs, but to CLAFMA, and questions whether the representation was made with the intent for the Plaintiffs to rely on it.

## English Summary

The judge is tentatively ruling on a promissory estoppel claim brought by Plaintiffs against several Defendants, including CLAFMA Defendants, Winston, and MetLife Defendants. The judge acknowledges that Plaintiffs allege they relied on certain representations made by these Defendants, but questions whether this reliance was reasonable.

The judge is particularly concerned about the fact that the alleged representations were not made directly to Plaintiffs, but rather to CLAFMA Defendants. This raises doubts about whether the Defendants intended for Plaintiffs to rely on these representations.

Furthermore, the judge notes that the potential damages in this case are uncertain and may be minimal. The judge is also considering whether the promissory estoppel claim is properly alleged against two individual defendants, Paul Oyler and Paul Schneider. 


This tentative ruling is preliminary and subject to change based on further arguments and evidence presented at the upcoming hearing.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case. The court has found that the plaintiff's allegations regarding the misuse of their insurance license are a separate grounds for a claim for conversion, and are not alleged against the CLAFMA defendants. The court has also found that the representations made by non-CLAFMA defendants are not relevant to the case. The court notes that while the plaintiffs relied on the representations, it does not need to accept that the reliance was reasonable. The court further found that the individual defendants, Paul Oyler and Paul Schneider, are not properly named as defendants in the plaintiff's promissory estoppel claim. The court notes that any damages awarded would likely be nominal and uncertain in value. The court's ruling is based on California case law, specifically Granadino, which states that promissory estoppel applies when a promise induces action or forbearance and would result in an injustice if the promise were not enforced.

  - "Damages uncertain and may even be nominal"

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the allegation regarding the misuse of Plaintiffs’ insurance license is a separate grounds for a claim for conversion that is not alleged against CLAFMA Defendants. Representations made by non-CLAFMA Defendants are not relevant. Plaintiffs' reliance on the representations made by CLAFMA, Winston, and MetLife Defendants must be taken as true, but the reasonableness of their reliance is not accepted. The claim is not properly alleged against the individual defendants, Paul Oyler and Paul Schneider. Any damages would seem to be highly uncertain and may even be nominal in value. The representation was not made to Plaintiffs but to CLAFMA Defendants, raising a doubt as to whether it was reasonable to rely on this representation.
