Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling addresses the allegation of misuse of Plaintiffs' insurance license, which is a separate ground for a claim of conversion. The Court must take as true Plaintiffs' allegations that they relied on representations made by CLAFMA, Winston, and MetLife Defendants, but need not accept that the reliance was reasonable. The Court finds that the representations were made to CLAFMA, not the Plaintiffs, which raises a doubt about the reasonableness of the reliance. The promissory estoppel claim is only against CLAFMA, and any damages would likely be nominal in value. The Court notes that the representation was not made to the Plaintiffs, but to CLAFMA, and questions whether the representation was made with the intent for the Plaintiffs to rely on it.
