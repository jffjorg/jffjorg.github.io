  Case Number:  21STCV36088    Hearing Date:   June 21, 2024    Dept:  61 YOLENY DE LA PAZ TORRES CRUZ, et al. vs JONATHAN AZIZZADEH, M.D., et al.TENTATIVEThe Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim of a Minor (Oscar Rodriguez-Torres, Age 3). The Court finds the settlement is reasonable, however, there is one deficiency that precludes the granting of the petition at this time:(1) The costs from Ikuta Hemesath, LLP listed on attachment 13b(1) amount to $58,557.82, and not $58,734.19, as listed on the petition under item 13b. As such, the total for costs when accounting for $4,176.88 from Hodes Milman, LLP is $62,734.70, and not $62,911.07. If there are additional costs that were incurred that are not listed on attachment 13b(1), counsel must file proof of such. If not, this amount should be corrected wherever applicable in the petition and proposed order, which will in turn add $176.37 to the net amount Claimant is to receive.Accordingly, the petition is CONTINUED to August 26, 2024, at 9:00 am to allow Petitioner to correct the deficiency by filing an amended petition and proposed order, or to file a supplemental declaration with proof that costs in the additional amount of $176.37 have been incurred.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
