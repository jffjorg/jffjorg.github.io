And here is the English text summary:

The Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim of a Minor (Oscar Rodriguez-Torres, Age 3). The Court finds the settlement is reasonable, but there is one deficiency that precludes the granting of the petition at this time. The deficiency is related to the costs listed on the petition, which do not match the actual costs incurred. The Court has ordered the petition to be continued to August 26, 2024, to allow the Petitioner to correct the deficiency by filing an amended petition and proposed order, or to file a supplemental declaration with proof that the additional costs have been incurred.
