And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a California judge regarding a motion by the plaintiffs (Jessica Loy, et al.) for an award of attorney's fees against the defendants (Trina Kenney, et al.). The motion is granted, and the court awards attorney's fees in the amount of $1,195,516.84 to the plaintiffs. The court finds that the plaintiffs' counsel, Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, LLP and the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), have acted reasonably in their representation of the plaintiffs and that the fees claimed are reasonable. The court rejects the defendants' arguments that the ALDF only represented one of the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs are not entitled to attorney's fees under California Civil Code ยง 1780(e). The court also finds that the plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence to support their claimed attorney's fees and that the defendants have failed to challenge the reasonableness of those fees.
