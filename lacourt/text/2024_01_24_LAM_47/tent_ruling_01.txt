  Case Number:  23STCV08524    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  47 Before the Court is Plaintiff Kyung Yoon Pak’s motion to
compel responses to form interrogatories brought against Defendant Ock J. Kim.
 
On December 15, 2023, the Court sustained Defendant Ock J.
Kim’s demurrer without leave to amend, on the basis that Kim is not the owner
of the subject property, and thus is not the proper party against whom
Plaintiff’s claims may be asserted. 
 
Accordingly, because Plaintiff is not entitled to propound
discovery to a non-party (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.010 [only parties may be
served with interrogatories], the Court denies Plaintiff’s motion in its
entirety.  
 
On its own motion, the Court advances the hearing on
Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents,
set for January 29, 2024, and denies this motion for the same reason, that is,
that Defendant Kim is not a party subject to this written discovery. 
 (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.010  [only parties may be served with
demands for production of documents under this Code provision].)  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
