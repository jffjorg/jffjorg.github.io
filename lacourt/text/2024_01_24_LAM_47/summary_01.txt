And here is the summary in English text:

The Court is considering a motion to compel responses to form interrogatories brought by Plaintiff Kyung Yoon Pak against Defendant Ock J. Kim. The Court previously sustained Defendant Kim's demurrer without leave to amend, finding that Kim is not the owner of the subject property and therefore not a proper party against whom Plaintiff's claims may be asserted. As a result, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion in its entirety, as Plaintiff is not entitled to propound discovery to a non-party. The Court also advances the hearing on Plaintiff's motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents, set for January 29, 2024, for the same reason.
