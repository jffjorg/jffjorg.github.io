And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel initial responses from the defendant, TBayles Inc., to the plaintiff's request for production (RFPs). The defendant was served with the RFPs on June 28, 2023, and the new deadline to respond was August 28, 2023, but no responses were provided. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to comply with its discovery obligations is unjustified and sanctions the defendant and its counsel $700. The judge also requires the parties to participate in an informal discovery conference (IDC) prior to motions to compel further being heard on the merits.
