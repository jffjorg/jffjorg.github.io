  vs.
 
TRAVIS BAYLES, et al.   
 


 Case
  No.:  22STCV39704
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 14, 2023



 
 
As for the motions to
compel further, the parties are to contact Department 17 to set up an IDC. 
 
Plaintiff’s motion to
compel initial responses from Defendant TBayles, Inc. to her RFPs is GRANTED.
Defendant is sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $700.
 
On
12/21/2022, Plaintiffs You Li and Jane Wenjun Sha (collectively, Defendants)
filed suit against Travis Bayles, Alan Quach, Sanborn Collective, LLC, and
Urban Asset Group, LLC, alleging: (1) promissory fraud; (2) fraudulent
concealment; (3) violation of Penal Code section 496; (4) breach of promissory
note; (5) intentional interference with contract; (6) breach of guaranty; and
(7) breach of guaranty. 
 
            Various
parties have filed motions to compel further discovery in this action. The
Court requires that parties participate in an informal discovery conference
(IDC) prior to motions to compel further being heard on the merits. 
 
            The
parties are to contact Department 17 to set up an IDC. 
 
            However,
Plaintiff You Li (Plaintiff) has moved to compel initial responses to
discovery. The Court limits its analysis to this motion.
 
Discussion 
 
            On
6/28/2023, Plaintiff served defendant TBayles Inc. (Defendant)
with Request for Production (Set Two) (RFPs). After Defendant was provided two
extensions, the new deadline to respond was 8/28/2023. To date, no responses
have been provided. Moreover, Defendant did not oppose this motion.
 
            Given
the lack of opposition, the Court is without any justification for Defendant’s
failure to comply with its discovery obligations.
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel initial responses is granted.
Defendant is sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $700. ($350/hr x 2
hr.)  
 
It is so ordered.
