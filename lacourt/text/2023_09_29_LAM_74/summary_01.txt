And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings filed by Nissan North America, Inc. (Defendant) and has denied the motion. The court finds that the decision in Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958 is better reasoned than Felisilda v. FCA LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486, which is the basis for the Defendant's motion. The court also notes that a recent decision in Kielar v. Superior Court of Placer County (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614 disagrees with the decision in Felisilda. As a result, the court will exercise its discretion and follow the precedent set in Montemayor. The court denies the motion to compel arbitration and orders the plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling.
