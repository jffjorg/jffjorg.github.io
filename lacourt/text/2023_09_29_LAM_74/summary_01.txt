Superior Court of Placer County (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614 disagrees with the decision in Felisilda. As a result, the court will exercise its discretion and follow the precedent set in Montemayor. The court denies the motion to compel arbitration and orders the plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling.

## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Nissan North America's motion to compel arbitration in a case involving a defective 2020 Nissan Versa. 

The Judge explains that they find the recent case of *Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company* to be more persuasive than *Felisilda v. FCA LLC*, both of which deal with similar legal issues.  Because *Montemayor* was decided more recently and is considered stronger legal precedent, the Judge will not compel arbitration in this case.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings filed by Nissan North America, Inc. (Defendant) and has denied the motion. The Defendant had argued that the case should be sent to arbitration based on the Court of Appeal's decision in Felisilda v. FCA LLC (2020). However, the court has found that the more recent decision in Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company (2023) is better reasoned and will follow that precedent. The court will not compel arbitration and will allow the case to proceed in court.

The court has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in the case of Eliceo Cortes Olmos and Magdalena Alonso v. Nissan North America, Inc. The plaintiffs filed a complaint against the defendant alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act due to a defective 2020 Nissan Versa. The defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration, citing the decision in Felisilda v. FCA LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486. However, the court found that the decision in Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958 is better reasoned and therefore denies the motion to compel arbitration. The court will exercise its discretion and follow the precedent set by Montemayor, as there are conflicting appellate court decisions on the matter. The plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
