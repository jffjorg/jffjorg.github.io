 Case Number:  22STCV41001    Hearing Date:   September 29, 2023    Dept:  74 Philip Ri v.
City of Los Angeles
Motion for Leave to File First
Amended Complaint.
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
TENTATIVE RULING
            The court grants Plaintiff Phillip
Ri leave to amend the complaint because he has substantially complied with the
relevant California Rules of Court, Defendant City of Los Angeles has not
demonstrated resulting prejudice, and policy favors amendment.
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute.
            On
December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Phillip Ri (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendant City of Los Angeles (Defendant). The complaint alleges the following
causes of action: disability harassment; disability discrimination; retaliation
in violation of FEHA; and failure to prevent harassment, discrimination, and
retaliation.
            On
August 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for leave to file a first amended
complaint. Plaintiff would like to add an additional cause of action for
retaliation in violation of Labor Code section 1102.5.
LEGAL STANDARD          
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “[t]he court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading.”  Amendment may be
allowed at any time before or after commencement of trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §
576.) “[T]he court’s discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit
amendment of the pleadings. The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.” (Howard
v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428 (internal
citations omitted).) “If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of
the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse
permission to amend . . .”  (Morgan v.
Sup. Ct. (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in
trial, loss of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit v.
Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.) 
A
motion to amend a pleading before trial must include a copy of the proposed
amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate
it from previous pleadings or amendments. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(a).) The motion must also state what allegations
are proposed to be deleted or added, by page, paragraph, and line number.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(a).) Finally, a separate supporting declaration
specifying the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and
proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered,
and the reason the request for amendment was not made earlier must also
accompany the motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.134(b).) 
DISCUSSION   
            Plaintiff
has substantially complied with the relevant California Rules of Court and
Defendant has not demonstrated prejudice. However, Defendant argues the court
should deny this motion because the proposed amendment is futile. (Foxborough
v. Van Atta (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 217, 230-231 [trial court does not abuse
its discretion in denying motion for leave to amend when amendment would be
futile].) If Defendant wishes to challenge the new cause of action, it may do
so by way of demurrer to the first amended complaint.
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court grants Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file first
amended complaint.
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice.
 
//////////////////////////////////////////////Philip Ri v.
City of Los AngelesDemurrerThe
court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.TENTATIVE RULING            The demurrer is moot because the
court has granted Plaintiff Phillip Ri leave to file a first amended complaint.BACKGROUND             This
action arises from an employment dispute.            On
December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Phillip Ri (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendant City of Los Angeles (Defendant). The complaint alleges the following
causes of action: disability harassment; disability discrimination; retaliation
in violation of FEHA; and failure to prevent harassment, discrimination, and
retaliation.            On
March 22, 2023, Defendant filed this demurrer.            On
August 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a first amended
complaint. LEGAL STANDARD            A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (¿¿Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318¿¿.) “¿To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.¿” (¿¿C.A. v. William S. Hart Union
High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872¿¿.) For the purpose of testing
the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all
material facts properly pleaded. (¿Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967¿.) A demurrer “¿does not admit contentions, deductions
or conclusions of fact or law.¿” (¿¿Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713¿¿.)             A
pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label
the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell
what he or she is supposed to respond to. 
(Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135,
139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (¿Khoury v. Maly's of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616¿.)DISCUSSION              Because
the court has granted Plaintiff leave to file a first amended complaint, this
demurrer is moot. (Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services,
Inc. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1054 [filing of first amended complaint
rendered moot demurrer to original complaint].)  CONCLUSION Based
on the foregoing, the court finds this demurrer moot.
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice.
