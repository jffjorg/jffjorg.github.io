  Case Number:  22STCV39527    Hearing Date:   September 29, 2023    Dept:  74 Eliceo Cortes Olmos, et al. v.
Nissan North America, Inc.
 
Motion to Compel Arbitration and
Stay Proceedings
 
The
court considered the moving papers, opposition, reply.
TENTATIVE RULING
            The court denies the motion to
compel arbitration because Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 92
Cal.App.5th 958 is better reasoned than Felisilda v. FCA LLC (2020) 53
Cal.App.5th 486. 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from a dispute
over a defective 2020 Nissan Versa.
            On
December 20, 2022, Plaintiffs Eliceo Cortes Olmos and Magdalena Alonso
(Plaintiffs) filed a complaint against Defendant Nissan North America, Inc.
(Defendant). The complaint alleges violations of the Song-Beverly Act.
            On
May 8, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to compel arbitration and stay
proceedings.
DISCUSSION 
            Defendant
aims to compel arbitration under the Court of Appeal, Third District’s decision
in Felisilda v. FCA LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486 (Felisilda).
But another panel in the Third District recently disagreed with that decision.
(Kielar v. Superior Court of Placer County (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614.)
Moreover, the court finds Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89
Cal.App.5th 1324 (Ford Motor Warranty Cases) and Montemayor v. Ford
Motor Company (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958 (Montemayor) better reasoned
than Felisilda. On July 19, 2023, petition for review was granted for Ford
Motor Warranty Cases. However, review has not been granted for Montemayor.
Accordingly, the court will exercise its discretion and follow the precedent of
Montemayor. “[W]here there is more than one appellate court decision,
and such appellate decisions are in conflict . . . the court exercising
inferior jurisdiction can and must make a choice between the conflicting
decisions. (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court of Santa Clara County (1962)
57 Cal.2d 450, 455.) 
CONCLUSION
                Based on the foregoing, the court denies
Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration.
                Plaintiffs are ordered to give
notice of this ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
