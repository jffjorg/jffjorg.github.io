**English Text Summary:**

This tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Philip Ri's motion to amend his complaint in his employment dispute against the City of Los Angeles. The court finds that Plaintiff substantially followed the rules for amending pleadings, the City of Los Angeles did not show any harm from the amendment, and courts generally favor allowing amendments. 

The court also found the City's demurrer (a formal objection to the complaint) to be moot because the amendment effectively replaces the original complaint.  The City can challenge the new cause of action in the amended complaint through a demurrer to that specific amended document.
