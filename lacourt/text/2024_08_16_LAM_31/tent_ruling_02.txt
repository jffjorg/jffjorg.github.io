[1] Defendants cite Business &
Professions Code section 7109 for the proposition that GH Palmer owed a duty to
Defendants to follow product recommendations. 
Their reliance on Section 7109 is misplaced.  As stated in section 7109, willful departure
in any material respect from accepted trade standards or disregard of plans or
specifications constitutes a cause for disciplinary action.  Defendants do not cite any authority for the
proposition that section 7109 creates a duty to a manufacturer to follow its instructions
and recommendations.
 
As
Plaintiff points out, Defendants appear to be relying a version of negligence
per se by invoking a purported violation of Section 7109.  However, to establish liability for
negligence per se, the plaintiff must show “[t]he death or injury resulted from
an occurrence of the nature which the statute, ordinance, or regulation was
designed to prevent” and that “[t]he person suffering the death or the injury
to his person or property was one of the class of persons for whose protection
the statute, ordinance, or regulation was adopted.”  (Evid. Code § 669(a)(3)-(4); Jones v. Awad (2019)
39 Cal.App.5th 1200, 1210.)  The
Contractors State Licensing Law (which includes Section 7109) is designed “to
protect consumers and the public from dishonest or incompetent contractors.”  (ACCO Engineered Sys., Inc. v. Contractors’
State License Bd. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 80, 88.)  Defendants have not alleged death or injury
to its person or property and does not fall into the class of persons that
Section 7109 was designed to protect.
 


[2] Defendants’ claims are most
appropriately asserted as defenses to GH Palmer’s FAC.   And indeed, Defendants have asserted GH
Palmer’s comparative fault and contributory negligence as defenses. (See Answers
to the FAC, filed on 2/23/24.)  Under
these circumstances, Defendants cannot reframe its defenses as affirmative
causes of action.
