I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            This is a
Song-Beverly action.  Before the court
are seven discovery motions filed by Plaintiff Christina Gozy: three (3)
motions to compel Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC’s responses to Plaintiff
First Set of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for
Production of Documents; one (1) motion to deem Requests for Admission admitted
against Defendant; and three (3) motions to compel Defendant’s further
discovery responses to Plaintiff’s First Set of Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents.  The court addresses these motions in two sections
as described herein.
 
II.        MOTIONS TO COMPEL INITIAL RESPONSES
AND TO DEEM ADMITTED 
            
A.   
Relevant
Background
 
On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed motions to compel Defendant
to provide responses to Plaintiff’s First Set of Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents, and to deem Requests
for Admission admitted against Defendant. 
Plaintiff sought sanctions against Defendant and its counsel.
                                                     
            On April
30, 2024, Defendant filed untimely oppositions. 
The oppositions referenced Declarations of Vanessa Dao and Defendant’s responses
which were not filed with the court.
 
            On May 1,
2024, Plaintiff filed replies.
 
            On May 6,
2024, Defendant filed the supporting Declarations of Vanessa Dao and
Defendant’s belated discovery responses. 
The discovery responses are not verified.
 
            On May 7,
2024, Defendant filed a supplemental declaration of Vanessa Dao which attached
verifications for Defendant’s discovery responses.  The supplemental declaration did not appear
in the court’s electronic case file prior to the hearing and was therefore not
considered in its tentative ruling.
 
            The motions
were heard on May 8, 2024.  The court
issued a tentative order granting Plaintiff’s motions.  After oral argument and pursuant to oral stipulation,
the hearings for these motions were continued to June 12, 2024.  The court also directed the parties to submit
supplemental briefs no later than May 22, 2024 regarding two issues: (1)
whether Defendant’s belated responses are substantially compliant with the
code, and (2) whether Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Admission must be deemed admitted. 
 
            Plaintiff
timely filed her supplemental brief. 
Defendant did not file supplemental briefing.   The court now rules as follows.
 
B.    
Legal
Standard 
 
            If a party
to whom interrogatories or inspection demands were directed fails to serve a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order to compel
responses without objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b);
2031.300, subd. (b).)¿ If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ Failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a); 2031.300,
subd. (a); 2033.280, subd. (a).)  
 
A party moving to compel discovery responses under these
statutory provisions is not required to meet and confer prior to filing the
motion.¿ (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b), 2031.300, subd. (b); see
also Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411 (Sinaiko) (citing Leach v. Superior Court (1980)
111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906 for the proposition that “meet and confer” requirement
“did not apply when propounding party sought order compelling responses to
interrogatories and sanctions for responding party's failure to respond ‘within
the statutorily permitted time’”).)
 
            Monetary
Sanctions 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to
impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿ 
¿ 
            If the
court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel
responses to inspection demands, the court “shall impose a monetary sanction .
. . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  In the context of a motion to deem requests
for admission admitted, it is mandatory that the court impose monetary
sanctions on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to the request necessitated the motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿
 
C.    
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff moves
for an order compelling Defendant to provide responses to Plaintiff’s interrogatories
and production request and to deem admitted the requests for admissions.
 
            It is
undisputed that Plaintiff properly served Defendant with the at-issue discovery
requests and Defendant did not provide timely responses.  Objections to the discovery requests are therefore
waived.¿ 
 
            In
opposition, Defendant argues the motions should be denied because full
responses have been served.  Defendant did
not initially include the response with its oppositions, but instead, separately
submitted the responses to the court after Plaintiff filed her replies.  The responses are a mixture of objections and
substantive responses.  (See Declarations
of Vanessa Dao, Exs. A.)  Defendant also
separately filed verifications for its responses.  Defendant further argues the court should relieve
Defendant of the waiver of objections because “there is no prejudice to any
party” and because the delay was due to mistake, inadvertence, and excusable
neglect. [1] 
 
            The court
continued the hearings for these motions to allow the parties to address
whether Defendant’s responses are Code-complaint.[2]  The court addresses each discovery set in
turn.
 
1.      Form Interrogatories
 
            Plaintiff propounded
31 Form Interrogatories.  Plaintiff takes
issue with Defendant’s substantive responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 1.1, 12.1,
12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 15.1, 17.1, and 50.1.  She argues, in essence, that because the
foregoing Form Interrogatories are not Code-compliant, all Defendant’s responses
to the Form Interrogatories are not substantially compliant.  The court disagrees.  Defendant served substantive responses to
Nos. 2.5, 2.8, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 4.1, 4.2, 12.2, 13.1, 13.2,
14.1, 14.2, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, and 50.6 that are Code-compliant.  Taken together, the court finds Defendant served
belated responses to the Form Interrogatories which are substantially
compliant.  Defendant is entitled to
relief from the waiver of objections as to the Form Interrogatories.  The motion to compel Defendant’s responses to
the Form Interrogatories is DENIED.
 
2.      Special Interrogatories
 
            Plaintiff
propounded 34 Special Interrogatories.  Plaintiff
takes issues with all of Defendant’s responses to the Special Interrogatories.  As to Nos. 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 34, Defendant responded
that it “does not have sufficient information at this time to respond to this
interrogatory. Discovery and investigation are continuing. Responding Party
reserves the right to supplement or amend its response.”  This is not a Code-compliant response.  (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 406 citing
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220 (“[responding party who “does not have personal
knowledge sufficient to respond fully” to interrogatory may so state, but must
“make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry
to other natural persons or organizations,” unless the information is “equally
available to the propounding party”].) 
Defendant does not indicate that it made a reasonable and good faith
effort to obtain the information. 
 
            As to Nos. 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21, Defendant simply
refers to documents that it has not produced. 

 
            As to Nos.
22-33, Defendant provided objection-only responses.  The objections lack merit.
 
            In sum, the
court agrees with Plaintiff that Defendant’s responses to the Special
Interrogatories are not substantially compliant with the Code.  Defendant is not entitled to relief from the
waiver of objections to the Special Interrogatories.  The motion to compel Defendant’s responses to
the Special Interrogatories is GRANTED.
 
3.      Request for Production of Documents
 
            Plaintiff propounded 90 Requests for Production of
Documents.  Plaintiff takes issue with
Defendant’s responses to Nos. 1-7 11, 48-51, and 85-87 because Defendant stated
it would comply but has not produced documents. 
However, Plaintiff does not explain how the responses to the
foregoing discovery requests are deficient. 
If Plaintiff seeks the production of documents, Plaintiff must bring a
motion to compel compliance pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320.
 
            Plaintiff takes
issue with Defendant’s responses to Nos. 8, 10, 44, 52-57, 58-60 67, 81, and 84
because Defendant did not provide Code-compliant responses.  Defendant’s responses to these requests
attempt to indicate that Defendant is unable to comply.  A representation of inability to comply under
section 2031.230 has three parts:¿ the statement must¿(1) affirm that a
diligent search and reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply,
and¿¿(2) the statement shall specify whether the inability to comply is because
“the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been
lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party.”¿¿And, (3) The third
part comes into play if the responding party knows or believes someone else has
possession of the documents:¿ if so, “[t]he statement shall set forth the name
and address of any natural person or organization known or believed by that
party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or category of
item.”¿¿ The court agrees with Plaintiff that Defendant’s responses to Nos.
8, 10, 44, 52-57, 58-60 67, 81, and 84 do not conform to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.230.
 
            As to the
remaining production requests—Nos. 12-43, 45-47, 52, 61-66, 68-80, 82-83, and
88-90—Defendant provided objection-only responses.  The objections are boilerplate and lack
merit.  
 
In sum, the court agrees with Plaintiff that Defendant’s
responses to the Request for Production of Documents are not substantially
compliant with the Code.  Defendant is
not entitled to relief from the waiver of objections to the production requests.  The motion to compel Defendant’s responses to
the Request for Productions is GRANTED.
 
4.      Request for Admissions
 
            Plaintiff
propounded 58 Requests for Admission.  As
to Nos. 49, and 55-58, Defendant served objection-only responses.  The objections are boilerplate and lack
merit.  
 
As to Nos. 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 35, 37, 38, and 42, Defendant
responded that it does “not [have] sufficient information to admit or deny” the
request.  This is not a Code-compliant
response.  If a responding party gives
lack of information or knowledge as a reason for a failure to admit all or part
of a request for admission, that party shall state in the answer that a
reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the particular request has been
made, and that the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to
enable that party to admit the matter.¿  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.220,
subd. (c).)  Defendant’s responses to
Nos. 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 35, 37, 38, and 42 do not conform to the Code.  
 
As to Nos. 30-32, Defendant responded with denials.  Plaintiff points out that the denials are not
unequivocal.  A denial of all or any
portion of the request must be unequivocal. (See American Federation of
State, County & Municipal Employees v. Metropolitan Water Dist. of Southern
Calif. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 247, 268.) 
 
However, Plaintiff does not challenge the sufficiency of
Defendant’s responses to the 32 remaining admissions requests (Nos. 1-13,
20-34, 36, 39-41. 43-48, 50-54).  The
court has reviewed those responses and finds they are substantially
compliant.  In sum, the court finds that
Defendant provided substantially compliant responses to Plaintiff’s Request for
Admissions.  Defendant is entitled to relief
from the waiver of objections to the admissions requests.  The motion to compel Defendant’s responses to
the Request for Admission is DENIED. 
 
5.      Monetary Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Defendant and its counsel.  Given the Court’s ruling, sanctions are
warranted.  Defendant concedes untimely
responses were served.  In the context of
untimely responses to requests for admission, sanctions are mandatory.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Pursuant to Hennings, supra,
imposition of monetary sanctions against counsel is also proper unless counsel
shows that he or she did not counsel the discovery abuse.¿ (Hennings, 58
Cal.App.5th at p. 81.)¿ Defense counsel does not meet their burden.[3]¿
Defendant succeeds only in showing the untimely discovery responses were
attributable to Defense counsel’s error alone.  Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against defense
counsel only in the sum of $4,153.20, consisting of eight hours at Plaintiff’s
counsel’s hours rate and $153.20 in filing fees.  
 
D.   
Conclusion
 
The motions to compel responses to Special Interrogatories
and Request for Production of Documents are Granted.  Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC is ordered
to serve verified, objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s First Set of Form
Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents, within 30 days of this
order.  
 
The motion
to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, is Denied.
 
The motion
to deem Request for Admissions, Set One, admitted against Defendant is Denied. 
 
The request for sanctions is Granted.  Defense counsel is ordered to pay sanctions
in the amount of $4,153.20 to Plaintiff, by and through her counsel, within 30
days of this order.
