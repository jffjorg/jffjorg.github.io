[1] A relief from waiver should be
brought by motion.  (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a); 2031.300, subd. (a); 2033.280, subd. (a); see also Weil
& Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 8:1369.1.)
However,
the court will exercise its discretion to consider Defendant’s request.
 


[2] Plaintiff also argues that
Defendant’s verifications are improper. 
The verifications state, in part, “The matters stated herein are not all
within my personal knowledge. I am informed and believe there is no officer or
employee of Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, LLC who has personal knowledge of all such
matters. The information contained in said responses has been assembled by
authorized employees and counsel of defendant Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, LLC and I
am informed and believe that the facts stated in these responses are
true.”  Generally, a verification
asserting phrases such as “I am informed and believe that the matters stated
herein are true” is insufficient.  (See
Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter
Group 2024) ¶ 8:1104.)  However, in the
case of verifying answers on behalf of an entity, asserting responses on
“information and belief” is acceptable. “The person designated to verify the
corporation's responses may not have personal knowledge of all facts
stated therein. (The entity is obliged to provide facts known to any
agent or employee, but the particular officer verifying may not have personal
knowledge of all of them.)  Under such
circumstances, “information and belief” is the only realistic way to verify
answers on behalf of the entity. While nothing in the Discovery Act expressly
authorizes verification of interrogatories on “information and belief,” this is
entirely proper. [Perry v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2023) 91 CA5th
1088, 1097, 308 CR3d 696, 703-704 (citing text)]”  (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024) ¶ 8:1106.)  Accordingly, the court rejects Plaintiff’s
challenge to the sufficiency of Defendant’s verifications.
 


[3] Additionally, Defendant represented
that Plaintiff did not take issue with the belated service of unverified
responses.  Plaintiff objects to the
representation.  There is support for Plaintiff’s
position.  Plaintiff provides
time-stamped emails showing that Defendant served the unverified responses at
11:09 p.m. on April 30, 2024—after Defendant filed its oppositions.  (See Reply, Declaration of Sam Azimtash, Exs.
A and B.)  Plaintiff could not have taken
issue with discovery responses that were served after the oppositions were
filed.
