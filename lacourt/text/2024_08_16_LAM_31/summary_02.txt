```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, addressing the defendants' claims and defenses. The defendants rely on Business & Professions Code section 7109 to argue that GH Palmer owed a duty to follow product recommendations. However, the judge finds that this reliance is misplaced, as section 7109 only provides a cause for disciplinary action, not a duty to a manufacturer to follow its instructions and recommendations. The judge also notes that the defendants have not alleged death or injury to their person or property, and do not fall into the class of persons that Section 7109 was designed to protect.

Furthermore, the judge rules that the defendants' claims are most appropriately asserted as defenses to GH Palmer's complaint, and that they cannot reframe their defenses as affirmative causes of action. The judge cites relevant case law and statutes, including Evidence Code section 669(a)(3)-(4) and the Contractors State Licensing Law.
