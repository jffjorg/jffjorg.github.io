Summary:

The judge has sustained GH Palmer, Inc.'s demurrer to the Cross-Complaint filed by Aquatherm GMBH, Aquatherm L.P., AETNA NA, L.C., and Aquatherm NA, L.C. The judge found that the Cross-Complaint fails to state a cause of action for negligence, contribution, and implied and equitable indemnity. The judge ruled that GH Palmer, Inc. did not owe a duty of care to the Defendants, and that the damages claimed by the Defendants are purely economic losses that are not recoverable. The judge also found that the Cross-Complaint's contribution and indemnity claims are premature and cannot be sustained at this time.
