And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Caiden Caldwell v. Live Nation Worldwide, Inc. et al. (Case No. 22STCV04087). The case arises from an attack on Darrell Caldwell, a hip hop recording artist, at a music festival held at the Banc of California Stadium on December 18, 2021. Caldwell died as a result of his injuries. The plaintiff, Caiden Caldwell, filed a lawsuit against multiple defendants, including Live Nation Worldwide, Inc. and the University of Southern California.

The defendant, University of Southern California, has moved to compel the plaintiff's responses to its discovery requests, including interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The motion is unopposed. The judge has granted the motion and ordered the plaintiff to provide verified, objection-free responses to the discovery requests within 30 days.

Additionally, the judge has imposed sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel of record in the amount of $1,350. The sanctions are based on the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests and the failure of his counsel to meet their burden to show they did not counsel discovery abuse. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff and his counsel to pay the sanctions to the defendant within 30 days.
