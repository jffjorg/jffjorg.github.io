And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which involves a petition for relief from the claim filing requirements under Government Code section 946.6. The plaintiff, Jose Del Toro Cervantes, was involved in a vehicle accident with a Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) vehicle and filed a claim with the City of Los Angeles, which was denied. The plaintiff then initiated a lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles and Raul Garcia Bueno and amended the complaint to name HACLA as a defendant. The plaintiff also filed an application with HACLA for permission to file a late claim, which was denied.

The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to timely present a claim to HACLA was excusable neglect due to a reasonable mistake made by his counsel, Sark Ohanian, who relied on the name of the defendant HACLA to determine the filing location. The court grants the petition for relief from the claim filing requirements and orders the plaintiff to give notice.

The court's ruling is based on the facts of the case, including the plaintiff's failure to timely present a claim to HACLA, the denial of the application for permission to file a late claim, and the plaintiff's subsequent filing of a lawsuit. The court also cites relevant statutes and case law, including Government Code section 946.6 and Munoz v. State of California (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767.
