I.          INTRODUCTION
            This action arises
from events at the Once Upon A Time in LA music festival (the “Music Festival”).
 The music festival took place at the Banc
of California Stadium on December 18, 2021. Hip hop recording artist Darrell
Caldwell (AKA Drakeo the Ruler) (“Decedent”) was attacked while backstage at
the Music Festival.  Decedent died a
result of his injuries.  
On or about
February 2, 2022, Plaintiff Caiden Caldwell, a minor, as Successor-In Interest
to the Estate of Darrell Caldwell p/k/a Drakeo The Ruler, through his guardian
ad litem, filed the instant action (Case No. 22STCV04087).  On August 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint (FAC), alleging causes of action for (1) Negligence-Wrongful
Death CCP § 377.60; (2) Premises Liability-Wrongful Death; and (3) Negligent
Hiring/Retention/Supervision Training-Wrongful Death against Defendant
University of Southern California, among others.
 
On April 18, 2024,
Defendant University of Southern California (USC or Defendant) filed these
motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s First Set of Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of
Documents.  Defendant seeks sanctions
against Plaintiff and his counsel.
 
The motions are
unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD  
 
If a party to whom interrogatories or inspection demands
were directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order to compel responses without objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (b); 2031.300, subd. (b).) Failure to timely serve responses
waives objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a);
2031.300, subd. (a).)¿  
 
A party moving to compel discovery responses under these
statutory provisions is not required to meet and confer prior to filing the
motion.¿ (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b), 2031.300, subd. (b); see
also Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411 (Sinaiko) (citing Leach v. Superior Court (1980)
111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906 for the proposition that “meet and confer” requirement
“did not apply when propounding party sought order compelling responses to
interrogatories and sanctions for responding party's failure to respond ‘within
the statutorily permitted time’”).) 
 
¿           Monetary Sanctions¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general
statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery
process,” which includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as:
making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to
discovery; making an evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and
without substantial justification making or opposing a motion to compel or
limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity of the person against
whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction requested, that the motion
be supported in the points and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a
declaration supporting the amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or
opposed a motion to compel responses to inspection demands, the court “shall
impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)  
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION  
 
USC moves for an order compelling Plaintiff to provide
responses to USC’s First Set of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories,
and Request for Production of Documents. One.   
 
It is undisputed that USC properly served Plaintiff with the
at-issue discovery requests on January 24, 2024.¿ Responses were due on February
27, 2024.  Plaintiff did not provide responses.  USC attempted to resolve this matter
informally.  However, to date, Plaintiff has not served responses.   (See Cohen Decls.)  Accordingly, all objections to the discovery
requests are waived.  Further, USC is entitled to an order compelling
responses to the interrogatories and production requests.
 
¿Monetary Sanctions 
¿ 
USC requests sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel of
record.  Given the court’s ruling, sanctions are warranted.  Pursuant
to Hennings, supra, imposition of monetary sanctions against
counsel is also proper unless counsel shows that he or she did not counsel the
discovery abuse.¿ (Hennings, 58 Cal.App.5th at p. 81.)¿ Plaintiff’s
counsel does not meet their burden.¿ Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against
Plaintiff and his counsel of record in the amount of $1,350, consisting of two
hours at defense counsel’s hourly rate. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
The unopposed motions are GRANTED.  Plaintiff Caiden
Caldwell is ordered to provide verified, objection-free responses to Defendant University
of Southern California’s First Set of Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents within 30 days of this
order.    
 
The request for sanctions is granted.  Plaintiff and his
counsel of record are ordered to pay, jointly and severally, sanctions in the
amount of $1,350 to Defendant, by and through its counsel, within 30 days of
this order. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
