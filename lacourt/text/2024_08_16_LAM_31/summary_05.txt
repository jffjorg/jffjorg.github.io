Here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering Defendant's request for relief from waiver of certain discovery responses. The judge notes that a relief from waiver must be brought by motion, and that the court will exercise its discretion to consider the request. The judge also rejects Plaintiff's challenge to the sufficiency of Defendant's verifications, finding that it is acceptable for an entity to verify answers on behalf of another entity based on "information and belief". Finally, the judge rejects Defendant's representation that Plaintiff did not take issue with the belated service of unverified responses, finding that the service was made after the oppositions were filed and that Plaintiff could not have taken issue with the responses.
