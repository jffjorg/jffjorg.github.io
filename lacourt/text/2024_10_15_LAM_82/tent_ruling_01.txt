[Tentative] Order Denying Petition for
Writ of Mandate
 
            
INTRODUCTION 
 
            Petitioner
Enrique Reynoso (“Petitioner”) was a Police Officer II with the Los Angeles
Port Police Department (the “Department”). 
While off-duty and apparently intoxicated, Petitioner got into a loud
argument with his fiancé outside her mother’s house.  A neighbor called the police and reported a
potential incident of domestic violence. 
When police officers responded, Petitioner cursed at them and refused to
cooperate, resulting in his arrest. 
Petitioner eventually pleaded to violation of Penal Code section 415, disturbing
the peace, a misdemeanor.  Petitioner was
terminated and filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate challenging
the decision.  Petitioner primarily
challenges the penalty, arguing that another officer pleaded to a DUI but was
not terminated.  However, the Department’s
discipline guidelines permit termination for a first offense of this nature,
and unlike the other officer, Petitioner was abusive and uncooperative to
responding officers.  Therefore, the
court finds that there was no manifest abuse of discretion in imposing a
penalty of termination and denies the petition. 

 
BACKGROUND 
 
On April 28, 2019,
while off duty, Petitioner had an argument with his fiancé, Lauren Flores,
outside her mother’s home. (AR 994-1000.) 
Petitioner appeared to be intoxicated. (AR 611, 1005, 30, 65, 803.)  The argument was so loud that a neighbor
called the El Monte Police Department (the “El Monte PD”), and the El Monte PD
were dispatched on a domestic violence call. (AR 68-69, 1004.)  When El Monte PD arrived, they approached
Petitioner, who yelled:  “What? Are you going
to fucking to arrest me? Fuck you!” (AR 595, 927.)  Petitioner walked away from the officers
toward his vehicle, which he had left running in the middle of the street and
facing the wrong way. (AR 251, 927, 714.)  At his administrative interview, Petitioner
admitted that he was “trying to get back to my car so I can go home.”  (AR 714.) 
To prevent Petitioner from leaving, an El Monte PD officer stuck
Petitioner on the thigh with a flashlight and brought him to the ground, while
another officer helped to restrain him.  (AR
595-596, 927.)  After Petitioner was
arrested, he called the El Monte PD “motherfuckers” and remained uncooperative.
(AR 571, 608-611.)
 
Initially,
Petitioner was charged with violations of Penal Code sections 148 and 243,
delaying an officer’s investigation and domestic battery, respectively.  (AR 290.) 
Petitioner pleaded to a violation of Penal Code section 415, disturbing
the peace, a misdemeanor.  (AR
290-291.)  
            
The Department conducted
an Internal Affairs Investigation and sustained the following allegations
against Petitioner:
 
1.    
On
April 28, 2019, Officer Enrique Reynoso, while off duty, engaged in violations
of state law during a contact with the El Monte Police Department resulting in
his arrest and conviction (“Allegation One”).
 
2.    
On
April 28, 2019, Officer Enrique Reynoso, while off duty, engaged in conduct
that was disgraceful and adversely affected the member’s relationship with this
department (“Allegation Two”).
 
3.    
On
April 28, 2019, Officer Enrique Reynoso, while off duty, engaged in conduct
unbecoming a member of this department (“Allegation Three”). 
 
4.    
On
April 28, 2019, Officer Enrique Reynoso, while off duty, engaged in violations
of state law and Department policy by driving while intoxicated (“Allegation Four”).
 
(AR 566-569.)
 
On April 17, 2020,
a pre-disciplinary “Skelly” package was issued to Petitioner proposing
termination based on the four allegations.  (AR 555.)  On June 11, 2020, Petitioner appeared before
Chief Thomas Gazsi, Police Chief for the Los Angeles Port Police Department
(“Chief Gazsi”) and Judy Salazar, Senior Personnel Analyst with the Port of Los
Angeles for a pre-disciplinary “Skelly” meeting.  (AR 555)  On August 13, 2020, the Department sent
Petitioner a final discipline decision terminating him from his employment. (AR
553.)
 
Petitioner appealed
his termination and administrative hearings were held in November and December
2021 before Hearing Examiner Craig Renetzky (the “Hearing Examiner”).  (AR 966-968.)  On May 16, 2022, the Hearing Examiner issued
the Report of the Board’s Hearing Examiner (the “Hearing Examiner’s Report”).
(AR 966.)  The Hearing Examiner
recommended that the Board of Civil Service Commissioners (the “Board”) sustain
Allegations Two, Three, and Four, and not to sustain Allegation One.  (AR 1009.)
 
On July 14, 2022,
the Board voted unanimously to sustain Allegations Two and Three and not to
sustain Allegation One.  The Board voted
four to one not to sustain Allegation Four. 
(AR 1087-1093.)  The Board also
voted four to zero to remand the case to the Department to reconsider whether
termination was the appropriate penalty.  (AR 1104-1105.)  On remand, the Department determined that no
less severe penalty was appropriate.  (AR
1113-1119.)  On October 27, 2022, the
Board voted to sustain Allegations Two and Three, adopt the Hearing Examiner’s
Report as to those allegations, and find discharge appropriate.  (AR 1171-1174.)  However, before the final vote, the Board
lost its quorum and the item was unresolved. 
(Ibid. and AR 1174.)  Due
to clerical error, the matter was not returned to the Board for final action
until July 17, 2023.  (AR 1174.)  On that date, the Board voted, without
discussion, to adopt the findings and conclusions in the Hearing Examiner’s
report as the Board’s own except with regard to Allegations One and Four. (AR
1174.)  The Board sent Petitioner a
letter on July 18, 2023, notifying him of the Board’s final decision and his
right to demand reinstatement pursuant to Charter Section 1017.  (AR 1174-1175.)  This petition for writ of administrative
mandate was filed on January 3, 2023, over six months before the final decision
was rendered.  
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are whether the
respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial,
and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.  An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the
evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(b).)
 
Because the termination
of Petitioner’s employment with Department concerns a fundamental vested right,
the court exercises its independent judgment on the administrative
findings.  (See Wences v. City of Los Angeles (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 305, 314; Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal. 3d 130,
143.)  Under the independent judgment
test, “the trial court not only examines the administrative record for errors
of law, but also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed
in a limited trial de novo.”  (Bixby
v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal. 3d 130, 143.) 
The court may draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and
make its determinations as to the credibility of witnesses.  (Morrison
v. Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners
(2003) 107 Cal. App. 4th 860, 868.)  “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal. 4th 805, 817.)
 
The court has limited authority to reconsider the penalty.  “The propriety of a penalty imposed by an
administrative agency is a matter vested in the discretion of the agency, and
its decision may not be disturbed unless there has been a manifest abuse of
discretion.”  (Williamson v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance (1990) 217
Cal.App.3d 1343, 1347.)   
 
DISCUSSION 
 
A.        The Weight of the Evidence 
 
Petitioner argues
that the weight of the evidence does not support the findings, and that the
findings do not support the decision.  Petitioner
bears the burden of proof to demonstrate, by citation to the administrative
record, that the weight of the evidence does not support the administrative
findings.  (Strumsky v. San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. (1974) 11
Cal.3d 28, 32; Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil
Service Commission (1958) 166 Cal. App. 2d 129, 137.)  Significantly, Petitioner “must
identify (with citations to the record) the factual findings made by the board
that he or she is challenging and demonstrate (with citations to the record)
why those factual findings were against the weight of the evidence.”  (Shenouda
v. Veterinary Medical Bd. (2018)
27 Cal.App.5th 500, 513.)  A
reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either party to an appeal and will
not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a search of the record for
any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d
740, 742.)  “When an appellant fails to
raise a point, or asserts it but fails to support it with reasoned argument and
citations to authority, we treat the point as waived.”  (Nelson v. Avondale HOA (2009) 172
Cal.App.4th 857, 862-863.)
 
Here, nearly all
of Petitioner’s arguments pertain to the propriety of the penalty, which is a
separate legal issue analyzed below. 
While Petitioner asserts that the weight of the evidence does not
support the findings, and that the findings do not support the decision,
Petitioner does not support such assertions. 
(Opening Brief (“OB”) 8:19-27.)  Specifically,
Petitioner has not identified the factual findings that he challenges or
explained why there is insufficient evidence to support the findings.  Nor has Petitioner explained why the Board’s
findings do not support its decision.  
 
Nor could
Petitioner successfully do so.  The Board
sustained Allegations Two and Three, which alleged that Petitioner, while off
duty, engaged in conduct that was disgraceful and adversely affected Petitioner’s
relationship with the Department and engaged in conduct unbecoming a member of
the Department.  (AR 566-569.)  The Board adopted the Hearing Examiner’s
Report, which includes detailed factual findings that support the decision to
sustain Allegations 2 and 3.  (AR
1002-1005.)  The Report also includes
sufficient findings to support the penalty decision.  (AR 1002-1005, 1007-1008.)  
 
The weight of the
evidence, including video evidence and admissions of Petitioner, supports the
Board’s findings.  Specifically, on April
28, 2019, while apparently intoxicated, Petitioner got into an argument with
his fiancé that was so loud and disruptive that a neighbor called the police to
report a potential incident of domestic violence.  (AR 68-69, 927, 1004.)  When the El Monte PD arrived, they approached
Petitioner, who was uncooperative and verbally abusive.  (AR 927.) 
This evidence clearly supports the two charges that were sustained by
the Board.  To the extent Petitioner
argues otherwise, his arguments are not persuasive.  
 
Petitioner argues
that he “was completely unaware that the officers arrived to speak to or
confront him, as the argument with Flores had generally concluded by that point.”  (OB 5:26-28, citing AR 483, 508.)  The Board and Hearing Examiner did not credit
Petitioner’s testimony that he “had no idea [the police] were there for me.”  (AR 483, 1006.)  Neither does this court.  The video evidence shows that Petitioner knew
they were police officers, and they arrived on scene while he was engaged in a
domestic dispute.  (AR 927.)  Further, Petitioner said: “What? Are you going
to fucking to arrest me? Fuck you!” (AR 595, 927.)  This demonstrates that Petitioner understood
the officers were responding to an incident in which he was involved.  Regardless, it was unbecoming for Petitioner
to curse at officers from a different police department and refuse to cooperate
with them, even if he did not know why they were present.      
 
Petitioner
suggests that El Monte PD officer Nick Budge used excessive force in striking
Petitioner with his flashlight without any prior “commands” or threatening
conduct by Petitioner.  (OB 6:1-12.)  The Hearing Examiner wrote: 
 
In my opinion, the El Monte Officer may have used
excessive force, however this was after the Appellant’s statements and do not
excuse his actions. His behavior leading up to what could have been excessive
force by the El Monte Officer is not the question before this examiner. I am
not judging the actions of the El Monte Officer, but rather the Appellant’s.  
 
(AR 1006.)  This reasoning is correct.  The Department was primarily concerned with
Petitioner’s conduct—the verbal abuse and lack of cooperation—before
Officer Budge used the force at issue.  Whether
Officer Budge used excessive force is not before this court and not relevant to
these proceedings.  
 
Based on the
foregoing, the weight of the evidence supports the Board’s findings, and the
findings support the Decision. 
Therefore, the petition for writ of administrative mandate on this basis
is denied. [1]      
  
            B.        The
Penalty
 
Petitioner argues
that the sustained Allegations Two and Three were insufficient to warrant
termination.  Petitioner points out that
certain members of the Board stated that the penalty was a “close call,” and that
the Department acknowledged that Allegation Two, on its own, was not sufficient
to support the discharge.  Petitioner also
argues that the Department’s penalty determination was an abuse of discretion
because Petitioner was given a harsher punishment that another officer who was
convicted of a DUI (“DUI case”), even though Petitioner was not convicted for a
DUI and Allegation Four was not sustained. (OB 9-13.)  
 
[T]he propriety of a penalty imposed by an
administrative agency is a matter vested in the discretion of the agency and
its decision may not be disturbed unless there has been a manifest abuse of
discretion.  In reviewing the penalty
imposed by an administrative body which is duly constituted to announce and
enforce such penalties, neither a trial court nor an appellate court is free to
substitute its own discretion as to the matter; nor can the reviewing court
interfere with the imposition of a penalty by an administrative tribunal
because in the court’s own evaluation of the circumstances the penalty appears
to be too harsh.  Such interference, in
the light of the foregoing authorities, will only be sanctioned when there is
an arbitrary, capricious or patently abusive exercise of discretion.  
 
(Cadilla v.
Board of Medical Examiners (1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 961, 966, internal quotes, internal
alterations, and citations omitted.)  In considering whether an abuse of discretion occurred, “the overriding
consideration … is the extent to which the employee’s conduct resulted in, or
if repeated is likely to result in, harm to the public service.  Other relevant factors include the
circumstances surrounding the misconduct and the likelihood of its recurrence.”  (Skelly
v. State Personnel Bd. (1975)
15 Cal.3d 194, 218, internal quotes, internal alterations, and citations
omitted.)  “If reasonable
minds may differ with regard to the appropriate disciplinary action, there is
no abuse of discretion.”  (County of Los Angeles v. Civil Service
Commission (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 620, 634.) 

 
            The Department’s discipline
guidelines for both Allegations Two and Three are “a notice to correct . . . up
to termination for first offense.” (AR 1044-1045, 1099, 557.)  Accordingly, officers are on notice that a
first offense may result in termination, and the Department had authority to
terminate Petitioner under these circumstances. 
The Department’s reasoning to terminate is summarized in the Hearing
Examiner’s Report:
 
The Chief of Police and other witnesses have made it
clear that peace officers are expected to work together with other Departments
and that a mutual level of trust needs to exist…. [A]fter hearing the evidence
it seems that the evidence showed the Appellant while intoxicated, cursed at a
fellow police officer, and attempted to evade that officer after creating a
public disturbance. This has caused the Department to lose faith and trust in
the Appellant. This loss of faith and trust is not unwarranted and cannot be
rectified by a suspension even if lengthy. The bottom line is that the
comparison, of an officer arrested for a DUI collision who is immediately
remorseful, but remains cooperative to an officer who is drunk, abusive,
obstructive and attempts to leave the scene causing a use of force against
them, is not comparing the same thing. The discipline in these two cases should
be different and dramatically so. In one case the officer demonstrated a poor
decision, yet remained a professional. In the Appellant's case he has not
demonstrated anything close to professionalism and his Department's loss of
confidence in him is understandable, and reasonable.
 
(AR 1008.)
 
Chief Gaszi also testified
regarding why Petitioner should be terminated, recognizing the differences to
the DUI case discussed at the hearing:
 
[I]t’s the aggregate of what
happened that night. It’s the lack of care for someone you’re close to, in a
neighborhood that has brought attention to this argument in front of Ms. Flores’
family. The neighbors being aware of this, the argumentative derogatory nature
with the investigating agency that arrived, the car parked idly in the street,
the terse, profane language, where he had not only an ethical obligation to
comply with the officers, but a dutiful obligation to comply and a lawful
obligation.
 
(AR 378; see also AR 350 [officer in the DUI
case “was very polite and cooperative with the investigating agency”].)  Indeed, had Petitioner acted in a more
professional and less abusive manner that night, he would have had a stronger
argument that termination was a manifest abuse of discretion.  
 
            Petitioner’s
remaining arguments are unpersuasive.  Petitioner
points out that Chief Gaszi and the Department acknowledged that Allegation Two,
particularly with respect to the argument with Flores, would not have justified
discharge.  (OB 10; see AR 386 and
1045-46.)  This argument is not
persuasive because Petitioner was found guilty of both Allegations Two and Three.  Chief Gaszi and the Department were adamant
that discharge was the appropriate penalty when Allegation Three is considered,
specifically Petitioner’s conduct unbecoming in his interactions with the El
Monte PD.  (AR 1045, 1170.)   
 
            Petitioner
also argues that he was remorseful and cites his apology letter in the
record.  (OB 10-11, citing AR 928.)  The apology letter is dated May 28, 2020,
more than a year after the incident that led to Petitioner’s discharge.  The Hearing Examiner and the Board considered
this evidence, as well as Petitioner’s lack of prior discipline, and concluded
that discharge was the appropriate penalty. 
(See AR 1007-1008; see also AR 982, 997, 1005.) 
 
             In sum, the Board could reasonably conclude,
as it did, that Petitioner’s disgraceful and unbecoming conduct toward the El
Monte PD warranted termination.  Based on
the entire administrative record, the court concludes that the Board did not
abuse its discretion in imposing termination as the penalty.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
             Based upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The petition for writ of mandate is
denied.
 
            2.         The parties shall meet-and-confer and
lodge a proposed judgment.
 
            3.         The court’s clerk shall provide
notice.  
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED
