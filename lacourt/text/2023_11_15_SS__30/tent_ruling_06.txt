 Case Number:  22STCV25040    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  30 NJDEH KARABEDIAN vs LILYBETH GOMEZ-GARCIAMotion to Compel Responses to Form InterrogatoriesMotion to Deem Request for Admissions AdmittedTENTATIVEPlaintiff’s Motions to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, and to Deem Requests for Admissions Admitted are DENIED as MOOT. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in part. Defendant is ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $310 within 30 days of this order to Plaintiff’s counsel. Plaintiff to give notice.DISCUSSIONOn September 28, 2022, Plaintiff served upon Defendant Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Admissions, Set One. (Mirzaie Decl., ¶ 3.) To date, no responses to the discovery were provided.Defendant’s counsel argues in reply that the firm has been attempting to contact Defendant since the commencement of this action and on October 31, 2023, Defendant served responses without objection to the request for discovery. Defense counsel argues Defendant was not aware a lawsuit was filed against her.As Defendant has responded to the discovery at issue, the motions are moot.However, as to sanctions, while defense counsel has provided substantial justification for the failure to serve timely responses, sanctions on the party or attorney whose failure to serve a timely response are mandatory in connection with a motion to deem matters specified in a request for admissions as true, and there is no exception for providing substantial justification. (Code Civ. Proc. §2033.280(c).) However, sanctions will only be imposed against Defendant as defense counsel did try to contact Defendant to obtain these responses but could not locate her. Nevertheless, sanctions will be reduced in connection with that motion due to the simplicity of the motion. As such, Defendant is ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $310 ($250 per hour, plus $60 filing fee) within 30 days of this order to Plaintiff’s counsel.
