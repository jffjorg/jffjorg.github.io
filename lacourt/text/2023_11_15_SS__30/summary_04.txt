And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to continue the trial date. The trial is now scheduled for March 15, 2024, at 8:30 am, in Dept. 30, and the Final Status Conference is continued to March 1, 2024, at 10:00 am, in Dept. 30. The judge has also continued all trial-related deadlines in accordance with the new trial date. The defendants' counsel has requested a continuance of at least 60 days from the original trial date of January 11, 2024, citing the need for additional time to conduct discovery as the plaintiff is still being treated for injuries and has recently produced a life care plan estimating over $3 million in future medical treatment and other costs. The judge has found that good cause exists for a continuance and the plaintiff is amenable to a continuance of 60 days, which would be the first continuance in this matter.
