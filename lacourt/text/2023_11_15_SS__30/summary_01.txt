Significant Statements:
  - "The trivial defect doctrine originated to shield public entities from liability where conditions on public property create a risk 'of such a minor, trivial or insignificant nature in view of the surrounding circumstances ... no reasonable person would conclude that the condition created a substantial risk of injury when such property or adjacent property was used with due care in a manner in which it was reasonably foreseeable that it would be used.'" (Huckey v. City of Temecula, 2019)
  - "A court should not rely solely upon the size of the defect ... although the defect's size 'may be one of the most relevant factors' to the court's decision." (Huckey v. City of Temecula, 2019)
  - "The critical test for constructive notice is whether 'the condition has existed long enough that it may be inferred that a reasonable inspection would have ascertained its existence.'" (Strongman v. Kern County, 1967)
