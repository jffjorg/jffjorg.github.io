And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents. The defendant, Homayoon Sean Moshiri, is ordered to serve verified responses without objection within 20 days. The plaintiff has incurred reasonable expenses in preparing and filing this motion, including attorney's fees, and the judge has granted the request for sanctions in the amount of $648.30 payable to the plaintiff within 30 days. The motion to compel responses to Special Interrogatories is taken off calendar, as each discovery request requires its own motion and filing fee. The judge has based this decision on California law, which states that unsworn responses are tantamount to no responses and that a party waives objections to a discovery request when it does not serve a timely response to the request.
