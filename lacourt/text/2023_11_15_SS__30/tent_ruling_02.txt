 Case Number:  21STCV10334    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  30 HECTOR ACOSTA, et al. vs JULIE WELKERMotion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories as to Plaintiff Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories as to PlaintiffTENTATIVEDefendant Julie Welkers’s motions to compel Plaintiffs Hector Acosta and Saul Lopez to provide responses to form interrogatories are GRANTED. Plaintiffs Hector Acosta and Saul Lopez are ordered to provide responses without objection to Defendant’s request for form interrogatories within 20 days of this order.  Defendant’s request for sanctions is DENIED.DISCUSSIONOn May 25, 2023, Defendant served Form Interrogatories, Set One on Plaintiffs. (Weissman Decl., ¶ 2; Exhs A.) Responses were due on or before June 26, 2023. To date, responses have not been provided. (Id., ¶ 3.)As Defendant properly served discovery requests and Plaintiffs have failed to serve responses, the Court finds Defendant is entitled to a court order directing Plaintiffs to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests served on Plaintiffs. Therefore, the motions are granted.Defendant also requests sanctions. Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.290(c) allows for sanctions when the motion was unsuccessfully opposed. Here, as the motions were not opposed, the request for sanctions is denied.Defendant’s request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the alleged misuse of discovery is also denied, as "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)
