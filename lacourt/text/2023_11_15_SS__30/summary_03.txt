And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' motion to compel compliance with the subpoena for business records is continued for 60 days. The defendants had served a deposition subpoena on the custodian of records of Illuminated Path, seeking medical records of the plaintiff. However, the proof of service does not indicate that personal service has been made on Illuminated Path, as required by California Rule of Court, rule 3.1346. The judge is allowing the defendants to personally serve Illuminated Path with the motion, and the motion is continued for 60 days to allow this to happen.
