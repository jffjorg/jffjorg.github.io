As a result of the accident underlying this matter, Plaintiff sought medical care and treatment with Dr. Shadi Souferian, who is affiliated with Illuminated Path, for her alleged injuries. (Kahn Decl., Exh B.) Defendants served a Deposition Subpoena for the Production of Business Records on Illuminate Path’s Custodian of Records on May 22, 2023 for the medical records of Plaintiff. (Id., Exhs. C-D.) No party has objected to the subpoena. No records were produced.California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346 requires a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena to be personally served on the non-party whose compliance is sought. Defendants’ proof of service does not indicate that personal service of the motion has been made upon Illuminated Path. (California Rule of Court, rule 3.1346.) The Court notes though that according to the proof of service attached as exhibits C and D to Defendants’ motion, the deposition subpoena was issued and served on the Custodian of Records for Illuminated Path, and a Notice to Consumer was served on Plaintiff. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition, objecting to the deposition. Nevertheless, the Court continues the motion to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena in order for Defendants to personally serve Illuminated Path with this motion.
