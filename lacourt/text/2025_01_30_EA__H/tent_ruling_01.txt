  Case Number:  24PSCV00597    Hearing Date:   January 30, 2025    Dept:  H Londo Welding, Inc. v. Chavez, Case No. 24PSCV00597


ORDER ON
DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION

Plaintiff Londo Welding, Inc. dba Welding Certification Center’s Application
for Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice. 
 
Background 
Plaintiff Londo Welding, Inc. dba Welding Certification Center (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows:


Plaintiff is a private welding school. On or about
September 15, 2019, Plaintiff and Gilbert Chavez (“Defendant”) entered into a
written agreement (“Agreement”), wherein Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff $9,304.00
to attend Plaintiff’s Comprehensive Welding – SMAW Structural Steel Program. Defendant
defaulted on the Agreement in or around June 30, 2022.
 
On February
27, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting a cause of action against and Does
1-50 for breach of written contract. 
On July 16, 2024, Defendant’s
default was entered.
 
Pending before the Court is Plaintiff’s Application for Default
Judgment.

 
Discussion 
Plaintiff’s Application for
Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.       Vanessa
Londo (“Londo”) has provided the Court with a copy of the original loan agreement
and a “full account statement,” which are attached as Exhibits A and B,
respectively, to her declaration. The first paragraph of Exhibit A (under the
header “NOTICE”) references a promissory note, which has not been attached. The
Court requests that Londo furnish the promissory note.
 
2.       Exhibit
A reflects a promise by Defendant to pay Plaintiff the principal amount of $9,304.00, payable in
monthly payments of $300.21 commencing September 15, 2019, with the final
payment due August 15, 2022. Exhibit A further reflects a September 5, 2019
execution date by both parties.
The first
entry on Exhibit B, however, is dated December 31, 2018 and reflects a “balance
forward” of $0. There are three entries for September 5, 2019, which reflect an
invoice for $2,694.96, a second invoice for $260.00 and a payment of $260.00;
none of these entries corresponds with the $9,304.00 principal amount. The
$9,304.00 principal amount, in fact, does not appear to be listed anywhere on
Exhibit B. Also, Londo represents that Defendant defaulted on Exhibit A “[i]n
or around June 30, 2022.” (Londo Decl., ¶ 4.) A June 3, 2022 entry on Exhibit B
reflects that a payment of $335.21 was made on that date, with a balance of
$2,206.06 listed. The Court requests that Londo attach copies of the invoices
listed therein to any future declaration submitted to the Court and explain why
the account statement does not begin with a starting balance of $9,304.00, with
subsequent entries reflecting Defendant’s payment history and any late charges
imposed.
3.       Londo purports to provide the Court with
an interest calculation in Paragraph 6; again, however, a
balance of $2,206.06 is listed as owing on June 30, 2022. The Court requests
that Londo provide a further explanation regarding how interest is calculated.
Accordingly, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment, without prejudice, and directs
Plaintiff to submit a revised, complete default judgment packet that addresses
the aforementioned issues. The Court notes that it will not accept any
piecemeal submissions and expects any future default prove-up application to be
full and complete in and of itself.
