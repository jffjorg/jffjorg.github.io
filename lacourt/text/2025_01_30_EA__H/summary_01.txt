And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment in the case of Londo Welding, Inc. dba Welding Certification Center v. Gilbert Chavez, without prejudice. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant defaulted on a written agreement to pay $9,304.00 for a welding certification program, and the plaintiff sought default judgment. However, the judge noted several defects in the plaintiff's application, including the lack of a promissory note, incomplete account statements, and unclear interest calculation. The judge requested that the plaintiff provide additional documentation, including a promissory note, invoices, and an explanation of the interest calculation. The judge also directed the plaintiff to submit a revised, complete default judgment packet and warned that the court will not accept piecemeal submissions.
