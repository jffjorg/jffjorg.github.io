And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Takasugi has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sebastian Donovan and Arconex (Plaintiffs) against Quantgene, Inc. and Johannes Bhakdi (Defendants). The Plaintiffs moved to compel the production of documents that were improperly withheld as privileged, and requested monetary sanctions in connection with the motion. The Court has found that the motion is now substantively moot, as the Defendants have produced the requested documents. The Court also declines to award sanctions at this time, as the parties could have resolved the discovery issues informally without motion practice. The Court's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiffs' motion to compel is moot, and the Court declines to award sanctions.
