And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies without prejudice a motion filed by Delphine Leonard to be appointed successor in interest to the deceased plaintiff, Ludella Leonard. Ludella Leonard died without a will, and Delphine Leonard is seeking to take over the lawsuit that Ludella Leonard filed against 856 W. 42nd Place, LLC and Brent Hogan. The judge finds that Delphine Leonard's motion is procedurally and substantively defective. Specifically, Delphine Leonard's motion does not set forth actual facts that show she is the successor in interest and that her interest is superior to all others. Additionally, the judge notes that Delphine Leonard has not shown why her interest as Ludella Leonard's niece would be superior to that of her brothers, who were Ludella Leonard's nephews. The judge also notes that Delphine Leonard's motion was served on the defendants' counsel but not on Ludella Leonard's nephews or other family members, and therefore they were not given an opportunity to oppose Delphine Leonard's contentions or show that they have an equal interest to that of Delphine Leonard.
