Facts: Plaintiff Tamara Harris filed a lawsuit against Kaiser Permanente and Sedgwick Claims Management Services alleging professional negligence, business and medical malpractice, emotional distress, breach of contract, and violation of the Insurance Code. The defendants demurred to the complaint in its entirety, arguing that the case is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The doctrine of res judicata describes the preclusive effect of a final judgment and promotes judicial economy by preventing piecemeal litigation.
Disputes: Whether the doctrine of res judicata applies to the case
Acts: Plaintiff filed a workers' compensation case in 2007, which resulted in an award of future medical treatment and benefits. Plaintiff then filed a lawsuit in 2020, which was dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiff is now filing a new lawsuit, alleging that the defendants refused to pay and continued to delay and deny medical treatment.

Significant Statements: "The doctrine of res judicata describes the preclusive effect of a final judgment and promotes judicial economy by preventing piecemeal litigation." "To determine whether a prior action bars a second lawsuit, courts examine whether (1) there has been a final determination on the merits, (2) between the same parties or parties in privity with them, (3) on the same cause of action."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the defendants' demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff's complaint is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The doctrine of res judicata states that a final judgment on the merits is conclusive and binding, and prevents relitigation of the same cause of action. In this case, the plaintiff's 2020 lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice, and the current lawsuit is essentially a rehashing of the same claims. The judge finds that the three elements necessary for application of the doctrine of res judicata are met: there has been a final determination on the merits, the same parties are involved, and the same cause of action is being litigated. As a result, the judge concludes that the doctrine of res judicata bars the plaintiff's current lawsuit.
