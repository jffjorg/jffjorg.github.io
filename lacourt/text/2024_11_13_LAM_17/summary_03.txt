And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside a dismissal without prejudice, which was entered on July 8, 2024. The plaintiff, Hyun Soon Lee, alleges that she was not aware of the status of her case because she was represented by an unauthorized and unlawful legal document assistant, Bill Kim, who took her money ($13,000) and promised to represent her. The court notes that the plaintiff personally attended a hearing on March 20, 2024, and was served with a notice of ruling on March 26, 2024. The court also cites Section 473(b) of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which requires that a motion to set aside a dismissal be accompanied by a proposed pleading and a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed. Since the plaintiff failed to provide this documentation, the court has denied her motion to set aside the dismissal without prejudice.
