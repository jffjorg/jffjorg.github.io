Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel compliance with the subpoena to Omnia Insurance & Risk Solutions, Inc. The defendants did not properly serve the moving papers on Omnia, as required by California Rule of Court rule 3.1346. The correspondence between the parties does not constitute an agreement by Omnia to accept service of the moving papers by mail or electronic service. Additionally, the correspondence objecting to the subpoena was made on behalf of the plaintiff, not Omnia. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions against the defendants' counsel, finding that the defendants acted with substantial justification in their motion and that the circumstances do not warrant the imposition of sanctions.
