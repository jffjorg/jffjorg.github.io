 Case Number:  24STCV07262    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default
Judgment
Plaintiffs Cambria Investment Management, L.P., Cambria GP, LLC, Mebane
Faber, and Sarah Ministrelli request court judgment by default against defendant
Lani Pollock.  Plaintiffs seek a judgment
permanently enjoining defendant from disclosing proprietary information and
from using email or social medial accounts bearing the name “Eric Richardson” to
contact people associated with the plaintiff entities.  The court issued a preliminary injunction to
that effect in June 2024.  Plaintiffs
show good cause for entering judgment of a permanent injunction against
defendant.  
Plaintiffs Cambria Investment
Management, L.P., Cambria GP, LLC, Mebane Faber, and Sarah Ministrelli’s
request for default judgment is granted. 
The court will sign the proposed judgment plaintiffs submitted on
October 24, 2024.
