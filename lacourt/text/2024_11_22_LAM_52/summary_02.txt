And here is the text summary:

The plaintiff, Lee Ouye, trustee of the Lee and Lorraine Ouye Trust, moves for summary adjudication of his first cause of action for breach of contract and his fourth cause of action for dissolution of partnership. The court has denied the motion for summary adjudication. In the first cause of action, the court found that Ouye did not meet his burden of proving the element of damages, despite arguing that the partnership paid $445,000 in management fees to Mertz Management. The court also found that Ouye did not show that collecting rents in violation of the Business and Professions Code breached any contract between the parties. In the fourth cause of action, the court found that there were triable issues of material fact and that the partnership business was operating successfully and in conformity with the partnership agreement. The court denied Ouye's motion for summary adjudication.
