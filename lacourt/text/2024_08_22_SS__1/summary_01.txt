And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in this Private Attorney General Act (PAGA) action. The defendant, AGVA, LLC, seeks to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement that allegedly applies to all claims under the California Labor Code, including PAGA claims. However, the agreement contains a carve-out for PAGA claims, which explicitly states that PAGA claims are not covered. The judge finds that this carve-out is clear and unambiguous and that it defeats the defendant's argument that the agreement applies to PAGA claims. The judge also notes that the FAA preemption does not apply in this case, as the parties have not agreed to arbitrate PAGA claims. Therefore, the motion to compel arbitration is denied. The case will be stayed pending the conclusion of the related case, which was earlier sent to arbitration on individual claims. A status conference is set for January 15, 2025.
