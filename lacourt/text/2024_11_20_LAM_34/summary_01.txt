The court has granted Ryan C. Baker's Motion to Approve Settlement in the ADA Action, which is a conditional settlement agreement in the amount of $11,000.00 and a plan to remediate the property to comply with ADA statutes. The court notes that no opposition or response has been filed.

Regarding Baker's Petition for Instructions, the court defers to the parties' Stipulation Expanding the Receiver's Authority and instructs Baker to perform an accounting on the partners' capital accounts prior to filing Shalom's 2022 and 2023 tax returns. The parties must cooperate and provide Baker all necessary information requested to perform such accounting.

The court also notes that Baker does not have the power to make any distributions on behalf of the Receivership Estate and that the issue of attorney's fees is currently under review of the court through Jila's Motion for Attorney's Fees. The court cannot entertain the parties' arguments regarding Baker's petition for instructions on this issue.

In conclusion, the court grants Baker's Motion to Approve Settlement and provides instructions regarding the accounting of partners' capital accounts and the distribution of funds.
