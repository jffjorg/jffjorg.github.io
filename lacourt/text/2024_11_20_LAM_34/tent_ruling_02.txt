 Case Number:  23STCV02215    Hearing Date:   November 20, 2024    Dept:  34 Plaintiff Ourian
Investment Corporation’s Motion to Deem Request for Admissions, Set No. Two,
Admitted is GRANTED. The court AWARDS Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,050.00. Defendant Kelly Swartz must pay
said monetary sanctions to Plaintiff within 20 days of the court’s order. 
 
Background
 
On February 1, 2023, Plaintiff Ourian Investment
Corp. (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against
Defendant Todd Hedley (“Hedley”) and Does 1-100 for breach of contract based on
Hedley’s failure to pay Plaintiff $150,000.00 in funds pursuant to two loan
agreements between Hedley and Plaintiff.
 
On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants Hedley, Kelly Swartz (“Swartz”), and Does
1-100 asserting causes of action for breach of contract and fraudulent
transfers. 
 
On February 23, 2024, Hedley and Swartz filed their
answer to Plaintiff’s FAC.
 
On September 20, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff’s
Motion to Enforce Settlement between Plaintiff and Hedley. 
 
On October 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion to
Deem Request for Admissions, Set No. Two, Admitted against Swartz and Request
for Sanctions. As of November 12, 2024, no opposition or other response has
been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
When a party fails to serve a
timely response to a request for admission, the party propounding the request
for admission may move for an order to deem the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted. (Code Civ.
Proc., §¿2033.280, subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely response
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that
the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for
admission that is in substantial compliance with Section  2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on the party or attorney,
or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
contends to have served Request for Admissions, Set No. Two, on Swartz on September
9, 2024. (Motion, at pp. 1-2; Zadeh Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff contends that Swartz
responses were due by October 14, 2024. (Zadeh Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff contends
that Swartz has not provided any responses. (Id., ¶ 8.) Thus, Plaintiff
argues that the court should deem Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions admitted
and award monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,750.00 against Swartz.
(Motion, at pp. 3-4; Zadeh Decl., ¶ 10.) 
 
There
is no evidence before the court that would indicate Swartz responded to Plaintiff’s
Request for Admissions. 
 
The court
grants Plaintiff’s motion. Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions are deemed
admitted.
 
With
respect to monetary sanctions, the court notes that they are mandatory in
connection with a motion to deem requests for admissions admitted. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
That
being said, the court finds that since Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed, Plaintiff’s
counsel does not require the additional 2.0 hours to analyze an opposition or
draft reply papers. The court will therefore award Plaintiff monetary sanctions
in the reduced amount of $1,050.00, comprised of two hours of work preparing
this motion and one hour of anticipated time to prepare and attend the hearing
on this motion, multiplied by the hourly rate of $350.00. Said monetary
sanctions must be paid by Swartz within 20 days of the court’s order. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Ourian Investment Corporation’s Motion to Deem Request for Admissions, Set No.
Two, Admitted is GRANTED. The court AWARDS Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,050.00. Defendant Kelly Swartz must pay
said monetary sanctions to Plaintiff within 20 days of the court’s order.
