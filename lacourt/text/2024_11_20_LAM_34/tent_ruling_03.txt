Stay for Forum Non Conveniens, along with, this
Motion to Seal Exhibits 40, 41, and 42. No opposition or response has

Legal Standard.
A party that requests
that a record or portion of a record be filed under seal must file a motion or
an application for an order sealing it. The motion must be accompanied by a
supporting memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify
the sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(1); Savaglio v Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 588, 597–601.) All parties that have
appeared in the case must be served with a copy of the motion or application.
Unless the judge orders otherwise, a party that already possesses copies of the
records to be sealed must be served with a complete, unredacted version of all
papers as well as a redacted version. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(2).)
The moving party must
lodge the record with the court in a separate envelope when the motion or
application is made, unless good cause exists for not lodging it or it has been
lodged previously. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(4) and (d).) The lodged
record is conditionally under seal pending the judge's determination of the
motion or application. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(4).)
Pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d), a judge may order that a record be filed under
seal only if the judge expressly finds facts that establish all the following:
(1) There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record.
(2) The overriding
interest supports sealing the record.
(3) A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed.
(4) The proposed sealing
is narrowly tailored, and
(5) No less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550(d).)
In ruling on a motion to
seal, the court must weigh the competing interests and concerns. This process
necessitates (1) identifying the specific information claimed to be entitled to
protection from public disclosure, (2) identifying the nature of the harm
threatened by disclosure, and (3) identifying and accounting for countervailing
considerations. (H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879,
894.) Therefore, to prevail on his or her motion, the moving party must present
a specific enumeration of the facts sought to be withheld and the specific
reasons for withholding them. (Id. at p. 904.)
The California Supreme
Court has held that the First Amendment provides “a right of access to ordinary
civil trial and proceedings.” (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Super. Ct.
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1212.) The court further noted its belief that “the
public has an interest, in all civil cases, in observing and assessing the
performance of its public judicial system.” (Id. at 1210.) There is a
presumption of openness in civil court proceedings. (Id. at 1217.) This
presumption may apply to seemingly private proceedings. (Burkle v. Burkle
(2006) 135 Cal. App.4th 1045, 1052 (divorce proceedings).) Therefore, it is up
to this Court to determine if that presumption has been overcome.
Courts must find
compelling reasons, prejudice absent sealing and the lack of less-restrictive
means, before ordering filed documents sealed. (Hurvitz v. Hoefflin
(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1246; NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Super.
Ct. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1208-1209 n. 25; Champion v. Super. Ct.
(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 777, 787.) A compelling reason could include to protect
confidential trade secrets, which “have been recognized as a constitutionally
protected intangible property interest.” (DVD Copy Control Ass’n, Inc. v.
Bunner (2003) 31 Cal.4th 864, 878, internal citations omitted.)
A proposed sealing must
be narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest, such as by sealing
portions of pleadings or redacting text. (In re Marriage of Burkle
(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1052, 1070.) An application to seal must be
accompanied by a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify sealing.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(1).)
A “contractual obligation
not to disclose can constitute an overriding interest” is sufficient to justify
sealing the requested documents so long as the moving party establishes that
disclosure of the information will result in substantial prejudice. (Universal
City Studio, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (2003) 110 Cal. App. 4th 1273, 1283–84.)
Discussion
 
Defendants
move the court to seal Exhibits 40, 41, and 42 submitted in support of
Defendants’ reply brief to their Motion to Stay on Grounds of Forum Non
Conveniens which were lodged with the court under seal on October 9, 2024. (Motion,
at p. 3.) Defendants argue that that the exhibits consist of private and
confidential financial statements of Defendant Meis Design Studio LLC which are
protected by the California constitutional right to privacy. (Ibid.) Defendants
contend that the overriding interest of privacy supports sealing the record so
that the public cannot have access to parties financial affairs. (Ibid.)
Defendants argue that a substantial probability exists that the overriding
privacy interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed since the
financial information contained will be disseminated to the public. (Ibid.)
Defendants also contend that sealing is narrowly tailored since Defendants only
request that only these three specifics exhibits be sealed. (Ibid.)
Lastly, Defendants argue that there is no less restrictive means exist to keep
Defendants’ financial records confidential. (Ibid.)  
 
No
opposition has been filed. 
 
Regarding the exhibits, the court finds: (1) that there is an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) that the
overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) that a substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed; (4) that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and (5) that no
less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants
Meis Design Studio LLC and Perkins Eastman Architects DPC’s Motion to Seal is
GRANTED.
