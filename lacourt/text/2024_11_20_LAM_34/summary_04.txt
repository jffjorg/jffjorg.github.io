```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Menashi Cohen's Motion to Dismiss, finding that the action should be dismissed due to forum non conveniens. The court finds that Indiana is a suitable alternative forum, as the alleged wrongful conduct and harm took place in Indiana, and the parties and witnesses are all located there. The court also finds that the private and public interest factors weigh in favor of dismissal, as litigating the action in California would be burdensome and unjust, and Indiana has a stronger interest in prosecuting the alleged civil wrongs.

The court notes that Plaintiff's purpose in filing the action is solely to secure a lis pendens over the Beverly Hills Property, but would ultimately rely on the Indiana actions to enforce a judgment regarding the property. The court finds that this is an abuse of process and that the action should be dismissed.

The judge's ruling is supported by the fact that the alleged misappropriation of funds occurred in Indiana, and the parties and witnesses are all located there. The court also finds that the interests of the parties and the public are better served by litigating the action in Indiana, rather than in California.
