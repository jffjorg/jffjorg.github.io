And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to deem the request for admissions, set no. two, admitted against the defendant, Kelly Swartz. The court also awards the plaintiff monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,050.00. The defendant, Kelly Swartz, must pay the monetary sanctions to the plaintiff within 20 days of the court's order. The court's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to serve a timely response to the request for admissions, which is mandatory under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280. The court notes that since the motion is unopposed, the plaintiff's counsel does not require the additional time to analyze an opposition or draft reply papers, and therefore the court awards the reduced amount of monetary sanctions.
