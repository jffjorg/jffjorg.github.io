And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to seal Exhibits 40, 41, and 42, which contain private and confidential financial statements of Meis Design Studio, LLC. The defendants argue that the exhibits are protected by the California constitutional right to privacy and that sealing is necessary to prevent prejudice to their financial interests. The judge finds that there is an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record, and that sealing is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The judge also finds that there is no less restrictive means to achieve the overriding interest, and that sealing the exhibits will not prejudice the public's right to access the court proceedings.
