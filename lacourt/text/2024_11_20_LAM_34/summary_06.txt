And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion by Philip Debevoise to compel arbitration against State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Company, arising from an automobile collision on February 10, 2020. The court finds that Debevoise has failed to provide prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate, as required by law. Specifically, Debevoise did not provide a copy of the insurance policy that allegedly contains the arbitration agreement. As a result, the court denies Debevoise's motion to compel arbitration.
