Here is a summary of the tentatively ruling in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling addresses the 17th cause of action, which alleges that the parties agreed to pay the Plaintiffs' 12 months' worth of commissions. The Court notes that while the Plaintiffs relied on representations made by Oyler, Mr. Oyler did not make a clear promise to the Plaintiffs. The Court also points out that Defendant Kaliher is not named as a defendant in this cause of action. The Court concludes that it must take the Plaintiffs' allegations as true, but does not have to accept that the reliance was reasonable. The Court also notes that any damages would likely be highly uncertain and potentially nominal in value.
