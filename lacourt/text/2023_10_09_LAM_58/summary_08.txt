And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Farmers Insurance to the 16th and 17th causes of action in the case. The court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff's claim for conversion fails to state a cause of action because it does not allege a specific, identifiable sum of money that was converted. The court has also sustained the demurrer to the claim for promissory estoppel, finding that the plaintiff's reliance on vague promises made by various defendants was unreasonable. Additionally, the court has granted the motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the plaintiff has not alleged facts supporting malice, fraud, or oppression.
