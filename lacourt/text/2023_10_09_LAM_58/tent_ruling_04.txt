            This
arises from an employment dispute. The Complaint alleges causes of action for
numerous Labor Code violations by Plaintiff Lazaro Ventura Gomez (Plaintiff) against
his employers, Defendants Duckmill LLC dba Berkshire House, Berkshire
Restaurant and Rami Haddad. 
            
            The
Complaint was filed on August 17, 2021. On March 16, 2022, Defendants Duckmill
LLC dba Berkshire House, Berkshire Restaurant and Rami Haddad filed a joint
answer. On August 2, 2023, the Court struck the answer of Duckmill, LLC and
Rami Haddad and entered default as to these parties. 
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for default judgment against Defendants. Does 1-50 have been dismissed.
Plaintiff also dismissed the twelfth cause of action brought under PAGA. The
request for entry of default judgment is denied. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $68,614.40, which includes $12,461.13 in
interest, $1,086.65 in costs, and $2,196.62 in attorney fees. 
 
            As
a preliminary matter, it does not appear that Plaintiff has dismissed Defendant
Berkshire House or obtained an entry of default as to this party. This party
must be dismissed prior to entry of default judgment in this case;
alternatively, Plaintiff can proceed in its litigation of his claims against
this party or take steps to enter default as to this party. 
 
            With
respect to the sufficiency of the evidence of damages in this case, Plaintiff
represents that he worked for Defendants as an hourly, non-exempt cook,
dishwasher, food prepper, and cleaner. (Gomez Decl., ¶ 3.) He states that from December
1, 2019, through March 20, 2021, there were several weeks where he did not receive
any compensation for work provided; specifically, he states he was not paid s
$12,440.00 in regular wages. (Gomez Decl., ¶ 4.) He also states that he worked overtime
approximately 14 hours a week and should have been compensated an additional $30,600.
(Gomez Decl., ¶ 5.) 
 
With respect to
the remaining Labor Code violations, Plaintiff he states he is entitled to
$3,350 for Defendants’ failure furnish Plaintiff pay stubs that accurately
reflected all information required by Labor Code section 226. (Gomez ¶ 6; Summary
of the Case, 4:25-5:9.). Plaintiff also states that Defendants failed to pay all
his wages when his employment ended pursuant to Labor Code section 201(a) such
that Defendants were liable for an additional $3,420. (Summary of Case:
5:10-23.) However, while Plaintiff submits evidence of his daily rate, he does not
offer evidence that he was not paid his wages upon his termination. (Gomez
Decl., ¶ 7.) Lastly, Plaintiff submits evidence that he is entitled to 350 days’
worth of rest breaks ($4,200 at $12 an hour) and meal breaks ($4,200 at $12 an
hour), entitling him to a total of $8,400. (Summary of Case 5:24-6:27.) Again,
Plaintiff does not submit evidence that he was not given rest or meal breaks
for 350 days. 
 
Plaintiff also
seeks interest starting to accrue from December 1, 2019. (Nigoghosian Decl., ¶ 2.)
However, the damages purportedly incurred were not fully incurred as to all
amounts until March 20, 2021 or more than 30 days after for some of Plaintiff’s
claims. Thus, this interest calculation is improper. 
 
The attorney fees
sought are reasonable under Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.214 based
on the total damages sought. (Nigoghosian Decl., ¶ 7.) However, for the reasons
addressed below, this damage amount is incorrect. 
 
Fatal to this
entre damage amount request is the absence of this specific amount sought in
the Complaint. That is, Plaintiff requests $52,870 in damages but does not
identify this amount in the operative pleading. 
 
When, as here,
there is no answer, Code of Civil Procedure section 580 provides “[t]he relief
granted to the plaintiff ... cannot exceed that which he or she shall have
demanded in his or her complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11,
or in the statement provided for by Section 425.115 ....“ (§ 580, subd. (a).) Plaintiff
did not file either statement provided for under sections 425.11 or 425.115 –
which would not have been appropriate in any case given the nature of the
claims at issue here.
 
Instead, the Complaint
only specifically states the amount of damages “exceeds $25,000” and then seeks
“damages [for] Plaintiff in an amount subject to proof at trial.” (Compl., ¶ 1
[“Plaintiff’s damages sought herein exceed $25,000.00”], Prayer, ¶ 1.) 
 
Our Supreme Court has held that a trial court violates section 580 and
exceeds its jurisdiction when it awards damages above the largest amount
specifically prayed for in the complaint, even if the complaint requests relief
for damages “in excess” of a specific amount. (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction
Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 492 [reducing default judgment award of
$26,457.50 plus attorney's fees to $20,000, where the “complaint sought damages
‘in excess of $20,000 ... or according to proof....’ “].) Such a prayer “cannot
insure adequate notice of the demands made upon a defendant.” (Id. at p.
494.) In such a situation, courts must reduce the award to the total specified
by the plaintiff as the minimum amount of damages for which the defendant would
be liable. (See Electronic Funds Solutions v Murphy (2005) 134
Cal.App.4th  1161, 1173-1174; Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 830.)


Thus, Plaintiff’s
request for $52,870 in damages violates Code of Civil Procedure section 580 and
Defendants’ due process. (In re Marriage of Lippel (1990) 51 Cal.3d
1160, 1166 [“It
is a fundamental concept of due process that a judgment against a defendant
cannot be entered unless he was given proper notice and an opportunity to
defend. [Citations.] California satisfies these due process requirements in
default cases through section 580.”].) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs damages
are limited to $25,000. 
 
As a result of
this limited damage amount, Plaintiff must recalculate attorney fees and interest.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment in the amount of $62,528.10 is denied.  Plaintiff may
submit a new declaration or agree to a judgment for $25,000 plus costs and
attorney’s fees.
