[1]           Farmers Insurance
is the successor in interest to Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance
Company (MPCIC).


[2]           Any damages would
seemingly be highly uncertain and may even be nominal in value. 
 


[3]           The TAC alleges that “Plaintiff
understood Mr. Oyler to have been speaking collectively on behalf of CLAFMA,
the MetLife Defendants, and Winston based on his representation that he spoke
to MetLife (the representatives of which were also acting on behalf of MPCIC
and MLP) and Winston and that they all agreed to the proposed arrangement to
pay Plaintiffs’ 12 months’ worth of commissions in total.” (TAC ¶ 92.) 


[4]           Under these
circumstances, the Court must take as true Plaintiffs’ allegations that they
relied on the representations but does not have to accept that the reliance was
reasonable.
 


[5]           As the Court notes above,
no clear promise was made by any party. 


[6]           Although, Defendant
Kaliher joins the demurrer to the seventeenth cause of action, Defendant
Kaliher is not named as a defendant to this cause of action.
