And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery responses from the defendant without prejudice. The plaintiff had served discovery requests on the defendant, but the defendant failed to respond despite multiple extensions. The plaintiff then moved to compel discovery responses, which is unopposed. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not provided proof of service of the motion on the defendant, and that the plaintiff combined all three sets of discovery requests into one motion, which requires separate motions and fees. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days.
