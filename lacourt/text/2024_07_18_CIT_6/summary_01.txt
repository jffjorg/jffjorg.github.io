And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's motion for leave to intervene in the action. State Farm seeks to intervene on behalf of its insured, Michael Antonio Diaz, who is not participating in the action. The judge finds that State Farm is entitled to intervene as Diaz's insurer, as it has a direct and immediate interest in the litigation and may be required to satisfy any default judgment entered against Diaz. The judge also notes that the motion is unopposed, and that State Farm's intervention will not enlarge the issues in the case or create prejudice to any other party. The judge orders State Farm to file an answer in intervention within five days of the ruling and to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days.
