And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant in a medical malpractice case. The plaintiff had requested that the defendant provide certain documents related to the plaintiff's teeth, but the defendant failed to do so. The judge finds that the defendant's supplemental response did not provide the requested documents and that the defendant's contention that this is a credibility issue is unavailing. The judge orders the defendant to provide a verified further response, including any responsive documents, or indicate that no such documents exist and the reason as set forth in the code, within 20 days of the order.

The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, as the plaintiff is self-represented and not entitled to attorney's fees. The judge declines to award issue sanctions as well, as the plaintiff did not identify any issues for the court to consider and did not provide a separate statement for such sanctions.

The judge orders the plaintiff to give notice of the court's rulings within five calendar days of the order.
