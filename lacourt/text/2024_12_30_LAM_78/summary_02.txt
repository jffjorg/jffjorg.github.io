And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting FPA's unopposed motion for leave to file a first amended answer. FPA's current counsel, Ian Stewart, substituted as counsel of record on May 30, 2024, and evaluated the evidence, discovering that prior counsel failed to assert any affirmative defenses. The judge notes that FPA's motion and declaration do not fully conform to the requirements set forth in CRC Rule 3.1324, but since no parties filed opposition to the motion, the judge grants the motion. The judge orders FPA to file a separate copy of the proposed first amended answer within five days and gives notice to all parties.
