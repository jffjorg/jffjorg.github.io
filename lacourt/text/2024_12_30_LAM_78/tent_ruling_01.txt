  Case Number:  22STCV36257    Hearing Date:   December 30, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ JACKIE IZARRARAZ, Plaintiff(s), vs. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 22STCV36257 Hearing Date: December 30, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: DEMURRER WITH MOTION TO STRIKE  I. BACKGROUND Plaintiff Jackie Izarraraz (“Plaintiff”) initiated this FEHA action against defendants California Department of Transportation, Dawn Kerr (“Kerr”), and Does 1 through 50 alleging that she was employed by California Department of Transportation and that supervisor Kerr subjected Plaintiff to harassment based on her sex and gender in October 2020. (Compl. ¶¶ 10-11.) The Complaint sets forth twelve causes of action against all defendants for (1) Breach of Employment Contract, (2) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith And Fair Dealing, (3) Unlawful Discrimination Based On Disparate Treatment, (4) Retaliation In Violation of FEHA, (5) Discrimination In Violation of FEHA - Cal. Gov Code §12940(A), et seq., (6) Harassment In Violation of FEHA - Cal. Gov Code §12940(J) ), et seq., (7) Retaliation In Violation of FEHA - Cal. Gov Code §12940(H), et seq., (8) Failure To Prevent Discrimination, Harassment and/or Retaliation In Violation FEHA - Cal. Gov Code §12940(K), et seq., (9) Violation Of Whistleblower Statute, Labor Code §1102.5, (10) Negligent Retention, (11) Wrongful Harassment in Violation of Public Policy, and (12) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (“IIED”). On July 3, 2024, defendant The People of the State of California, acting by and through the Department of Transportation and erroneously sued as “California Department of Transportation” (“State”) filed a demurrer against all twelve causes of action of the Complaint. Additionally, the State moves to strike punitive damages. On July 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed oppositions to the motions. On July 25, 2024, the State filed its replies.  II. DISCUSSION Before filing a demurrer and/or motion to strike, the moving party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. (CCP §§ 430.41(a); 435.5(a).)¿The moving party “shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference.” (Ibid.) The State’s counsel declares that on June 5, 2024, he sent a letter by email to Plaintiff’s counsel in an attempt to meet and confer, and that the letter requested that Plaintiff’s counsel set up a time to discuss the motion by telephone as required by code. (DiPietro ¶ 2.) Counsel sent another email to Plaintiff’s counsel requesting a time to discuss, but Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond. (Id. at ¶¶ 3-4.) The Court finds the State fails to establish that it has complied with the meet and confer requirements under CCP §§ 430.41 and 435.5. The State’s counsel does not declare that he ever attempted to reach Plaintiff’s counsel telephonically to discuss the issues raised in the motions, and whether Plaintiff’s counsel refused to meet and confer despite such attempts.  III. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court CONTINUES the hearing for the State’s demurrer with motion to strike to January 30, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 78 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse to provide the State an opportunity to comply with the meet and confer requirements of CCP §§ 430.41 and 435.5.  The Court orders the State to file a meet and confer declaration that complies with the requirements of CCP §§ 430.41 and 435.5 no later than seven (7) court days prior to the continued hearing date.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: December 27, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
