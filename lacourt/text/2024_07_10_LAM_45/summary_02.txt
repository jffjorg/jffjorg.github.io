And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to serve initial responses to requests for production of documents, set one, and has imposed monetary sanctions on the defendant and defense counsel. The motion was filed due to the defendant's failure to serve responses to the requests, despite being served with them on December 18, 2023. The defendant claims it was unable to locate the documents it initially believed it had, but the court notes that the defendant fails to provide any evidence to support its claims. The court has ordered the defendant to serve responses to the requests without objections within 20 days of the order, and has imposed sanctions in the amount of $750.00, jointly and severally, on the defendant and defense counsel.
