Party:  Plaintiff LGP Equipment Rentals,

Responding
Party:  Defendant 1ST Choice Design and
Development
 
Motion to Compel Initial Responses to
Request for Production of Documents, Set One and Request for Sanctions in the Amount
of $3,000.00         
The Court considered the moving, opposition, and reply
papers. 
            The motion is GRANTED. 
 
Recommendation:     Grant, Defendant is ordered to serve responses to Requests for Production, Set
One without objections within 20 days of this order. Defendant and Defense
Counsel are also ordered to pay monetary sanctions jointly and severally in the
amount of $750.00 to Plaintiff through its counsel of record. 
Reason: Plaintiff served Requests
for Production, Set One, on December 18, 2023. To date, the Defendant has not
served any responses. However, Defendant argues that after a diligent search,
it was unable to locate the documents it initially believed it had. Defendant’s
counsel states “[w]hen I was corresponding with Plaintiff’s counsel, I was
unaware that the documents did not exist and based on discussions with my
Client we both believed the documents did exist but eventually Defendant was
unable to locate them after a diligent search.” (Diefenbach Decl. ¶ 8; See also
Innabi Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. C.) Moreover, Tony Holder, the principal and owner of
Defendant 1st Choice Design & Development states “Defendant is
ultimately unable to produce the documents because the project file was taken
from a former employee who worked as the project manager for both projects, Mr.
Alberto Dominguez.” (Holder Decl. ¶ 2.) Mr. Holder further states “[t]he
records that 1st Choice did have that were not lost at the project site were
lost when 1st Choice changed office locations in approximately June of 2021 . .
. 1st Choice
does not have any responsive documents in its custody and control that it can
make available for production. I initially believed the project documents
existed but was unable to locate them after a diligent search and realized that
Mr. Dominguez was in charge of the documents and then other documents were lost
during a move.” (Id. at ¶¶ 4-6.)
Nevertheless, the Court notes Defendant fails to
provide any evidence for its speculations of the former employee taking the
records. 
Therefore, the Court should grant the motion under
CCP section 2031.300 and impose the reasonable amount of $750.00 (1.5 hours at
$500 per hour) in monetary sanctions on the Defendant and Defense Counsel,
jointly and severally. 
Other Notes:   There is a discrepancy as to the sanction amount
requested. In the moving papers, Plaintiff seeks $3,000.00 in sanctions.
However, in the reply papers, Plaintiff seeks $2,000.00 in sanctions. 
 
            It
is so ordered.
