```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for a protective order, which sought to bar and limit the plaintiff's ability to take depositions of third-party lay witnesses. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's questions to these witnesses were improper and would result in harassment and duplication of testimony. However, the judge found that the defendant had failed to show how allowing the plaintiff to proceed with additional depositions would result in "unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense." The judge also noted that the plaintiff had already deposed eight third-party lay witnesses and that the defendant had failed to provide any evidence that the proposed witnesses lacked personal knowledge of the issues at hand.

The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendant, finding that the defendant had acted with substantial justification in moving for the protective order. The judge's ruling allows the plaintiff to proceed with taking depositions of the third-party lay witnesses, but may limit the scope of the depositions to prevent duplication of testimony.
