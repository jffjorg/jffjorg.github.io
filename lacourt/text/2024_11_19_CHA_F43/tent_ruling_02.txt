SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiff Oscar
Sanchez (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendants David Parker
(Defendant) and Regina Parker on May 2, 2024. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’
vehicle rearended Plaintiff’s vehicle because Defendants were speeding and
failed to keep proper distance. Plaintiff claims he sustained severe injuries
as a result of collision. The complaint alleges causes of action for motor
vehicle and general negligence.
 
On June 29,
2024, Plaintiff propounded on Defendant Request for Admissions, Set One, which
included 55 requests and a Declaration of Additional Discovery. (Declaration of
Colette M. Asel [Asel Decl.], Exh. B.) 
 
On July 3,
2024, Colette M. Asel, Defendant’s counsel of record, sent Plaintiff’s counsel
a meet and confer letter explaining why the number of requests was excessive
and asking Plaintiff’s counsel to reduce the number of requests to 35. (Asel
Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. E.) Asel requested Plaintiff’s counsel respond by July 11,
2024 or to call Asel to meet and confer telephonically. (Ibid.)
 
On July 11, 2024,
counsel spoke via telephone, and Plaintiff’s counsel indicated it would not
consider withdrawing any of the requests for admission. (Asel Decl., ¶ 7.) The
following day, Asel sent an email summarizing the telephonic meet and confer
and informed Plaintiff’s counsel she would proceed with filing a motion for a
protective order. (Ibid.) After again exchanging meet and confer emails,
counsel still did not come to an agreement. (Ibid.)
 
On July 31,
2024, Defendant filed this motion for a protective order. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on August 13, 2024. Defendant filed a reply on October 17, 2024. 
 
 
Meet and
Confer
A motion for
protective order must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration stating
“facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.090, subd. (a);
2016.040.) 
 
Here,
Defendant’s counsel declares she sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s
counsel on July 3, 2024, explaining the issues with the Request for Admission,
Set One. (Asel Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. E.) Subsequently, counsel met and conferred
telephonically on July 11, 2024 and July 12, 2024 but could not come to an
agreement. (Ibid.) The Court finds that counsel has satisfied the meet
and confer requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.090.
 
Summary of
Arguments
Defendant
argues the number of requests for admission is excessive and that Plaintiff’s
declaration for additional discovery is insufficient. The declaration fails to
justify why the complexity and quantity of issues in this case require 55
requests for admission. Because this is a routine auto accident case, Plaintiff
cannot meet his burden of justifying the excessive number of requests for
admission, especially because several of the requests are duplicative of the
form interrogatories Plaintiff propounded on Defendant. The requests seek
irrelevant information not related to disputed facts. Because Plaintiff has not
established good cause or an explanation for the excessive requests, the Court
should impose $662.28 in monetary sanctions for abuse of discovery.
 
In opposition,
Plaintiff states he has a right to conduct discovery and that good cause exists
to deny Defendant’s motion. Because it is early in the discovery process, he
can use any form and amount of discovery. The Court must impose $1,600.00 in
monetary sanctions because Plaintiff opposes Defendant’s motion with
substantial justification.
 
In reply,
Defendant reiterates that Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of justifying
the number of requests for admission. Plaintiff does not deny that this is a
routine negligence case, nor does Plaintiff dispute that several of his
requests are improper. Plaintiff fails to address the deficiencies in its
declaration for additional discovery or explain why this case is complex enough
to warrant the greater number of requests for admission. Defendant notes that
Plaintiff cut and pasted a section about special interrogatories into its
opposition. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Protective
Order
When RFAs have
been propounded, the responding party, may promptly move for a protective
order. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.080, subd. (a).) “The court, for good cause
shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any party, deponent,
or other natural person or organization from unwarranted annoyance,
embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.080, subd. (b)(1).) 
 
 
Here, Plaintiff
propounded 55 Requests for Admission on Defendant, seeking admissions about the
cause of the accident, medical records, and the bounds of Defendant’s insurance
policy coverage. (Asel Decl., Exh. B.)
 
A party may
propound more than 35 requests for admission if either the additional requests
relate to the genuineness of documents or the propounding party attaches a
supporting declaration with the request. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.050, 2033.040,
subd. (a).) “[T]he greater number [of requests must be] warranted by the
complexity or the quantity of the existing and potential issues in the
particular case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.040, subd. (a).) The supporting
declaration must “state the reasons why the complexity or the quantity of
issues in the instant lawsuit warrant this number of requests for admission.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.050.) “If the responding party seeks a protective order
on the ground that the number of requests for admission is unwarranted, the
propounding party shall have the burden of justifying the number of requests
for admission.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.040, subd. (b).) The propounding
party must show good cause for the additional requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.420.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s counsel declares “This number of requests for admission is
warranted . . . because we are in the process of initial discovery and made
this request in good faith.” (Asel Decl., Exh. B, at p. 7.) Defendant argues
the declaration “fails to ‘state the reasons why the complexity or the quantity
of issues in the instant lawsuit warrant this number of requests for admission.’”
(Motion, p. 4:19-20 [quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.050.) Defendant also
argues the declaration fails to provide any facts or explanation to show the
greater number of requests is warranted by the complexity or quantity of the
existing issues in the case. (Motion, p. 4:26-28.)
 
In opposition,
Plaintiff discusses the purpose of discovery statutes and states the discovery
statutes must be construed liberally in favor of disclosure. 
 
The Court finds
the declaration for additional discovery is insufficient and fails to provide
specific facts supporting the need for excessive requests for admissions. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court grants Defendant’s protective order and orders Plaintiff to propound
requests for admission again. Plaintiff may propound up to 35 requests of his
choosing.
 
 
 
 
Sanctions
“The court
shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion for a protective order under this
section, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.420, subd. (h), 2033.080, subd.
(d), 2031.060, subd. (h).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary
sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or
any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Defendant
requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $662.28 be imposed on Plaintiff
and Plaintiff’s counsel. Defendant’s counsel’s hourly rate is $160.17. The
requested sanction amount includes: (1) 2 hours for researching and drafting
this motion ($320.34); (2) 0.75 hours for reviewing the opposition and drafting
the reply ($120.12); (3) 1 hour for appearing at the hearing ($160.17); and (4)
$61.65 in filing fees per motion. (Asel Decl., ¶ 10.)  
 
In opposition,
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the total amount of $1,600.00 to be
imposed on Defendant and their counsel. Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is
$400.00. The requested sanctions include: (1) 2 hours to prepare the opposition
($800.00); and (2) 2 hours to appear for this motion ($800.00). (Declaration of
Bobby Tamari, ¶ 13.) 
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court grants Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff in the amount of $662.28. The Court denies Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions.
