And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of David Griffiths and Carolyn Griffiths v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, which were served on the Defendant. The Defendant provided initial responses, but these were met with objections from the Plaintiffs. The parties then met and conferred, but the Defendant did not provide complete responses. The Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel further responses, which the Defendant opposes.

The Court has reviewed the documents related to this motion and has ordered the parties to review the Court's Lemon Law Discovery Order and to meet and confer with the Order in mind. The parties must meet and confer directly, not by email, to resolve as much as they can. The parties are also ordered to file a joint statement of remaining issues by a date to be set by the Court.

The Court has not decided the motion on the merits at this time and will set the dates for a status report and continued hearings at the hearing on this motion.
