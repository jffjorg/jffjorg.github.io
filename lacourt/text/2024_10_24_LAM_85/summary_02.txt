And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving the California Public Records Act (CPRA) and the County's denial of Kwong's requests for certain records. The County did not assert certain exemptions, such as the personnel records exemption or the right to privacy, when denying the requests. The court has declined to expand the scope of category 5, which was the subject of the requests. The court's review was limited to records that existed on November 11, 2022, when the requests were denied. The judge has ordered the County to review the Kwong request records that existed on that date.
