H&H
Retail Owner v. Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc, 23STCV20673 
Tentative decision on application for right to attach
order:  mostly granted




 
 
            
Plaintiff H&H Retail Owner (“Landlord” or “H&H”) applies
for right to attach orders against Starline Tours of Hollywood (“Tenant” or
“Starline”) in the amount of $970,769.53.
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,[1]
and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiff
filed this Complaint against Defendant Starline on August 29, 2023, alleging
causes of action for breach of lease. The Complaint alleges in pertinent part
as follows. 
 
a. A201 Lease 
            On
or around May 31, 2013, Landlord’s predecessor-in-interest, CIM/H&H Retail
(“CIM”), and Tenant entered into a written lease agreement (“A201 Lease”) for a
term of five years plus the option for Tenant to extend for two extended terms
if it so chose. The lease was for a retail space identified as “Space No.
A2-201A” (“Space A201”) which contained approximately 6,093 square feet of
total floor area.  Among other items, the
A201 Lease obligates Tenant to pay Minimum Annual Rent and Additional Rent
(collectively referred to as “A201 Rent”). The A201 Lease provides that
Tenant’s failure to pay A201 Rent by the date due constitutes a Default. The
A201 Lease gives Tenant three days to cure a Default after written Notice from
Landlord. 
            On
or around August 21, 2015, Landlord and Tenant entered a Storage Space Lease
(“A201 Storage Lease”), wherein Tenant leased certain storage space which was
used by Tenant in connection with its tenancy pursuant to the A201 Lease. The
original terms of the A201 Storage Lease ran from September 1, 2015 to August
31, 2016. Following this period, the A201 Storage Lease would continue a
month-to-month basis unless either party terminated said lease upon 30 days’
prior written notice. Tenant was required to pay monthly rent for the A201
Storage Lease in the amount of $520.  Tenant
relinquished possession of the A201 Storage Lease premises on or around May 2,
2023. 
On or around March 20, 2018, Landlord and Tenant entered into
the First Amendment to the A201 Lease (“A201 First Amendment”). On or around
January 17, 2023, Landlord and Tenant entered into the Second Amendment to the
A201 Lease (“A201 Second Amendment”).  Pursuant
to the A201 Second Amendment, Landlord abated unpaid A201 Rent as of January
2022 in the total amount of $151,281.06 (“A201 Abated Rent”). Additionally, the
A201 Second Amendment deferred $200,000 in unpaid rent as of January 2022 into
a repayment period of 18 months beginning July 1, 2022. The repayment period would
run through December 1, 2023 and required Tenant top pay $11,111.11 per month. 
Landlord alleges that Tenant owes a total of $707,868.38 with
respect to the A201 Lease. This amount consists of the A201 Lease rent in the
total estimated amount of $501,031.77, $55,555.55 for the remainder of the A201
Lease deferred amount for the period of August to December 2023, and
$151,281.06 for the A201 Abated Rent. 
 
b. A207 Lease 
On or around February 22, 2007, CIM and Tenant entered into
a written Lease Agreement (“A207 Lease”) for a term of five years for a retail
space currently identified as “Space No. A-2- 207” (“Space A207”). The A207
Lease obligates Tenant to pay Minimum Annual Rent and Additional Rent
(collectively referred to as “A207 Rent”). The A207 Lease was amended a total
of three times, with the third and final amendment (A207 Third Amendment”)
taking place on December 14, 2022. Pursuant to the A207 Third Amendment, Landlord
abated unpaid A207 Rent owed by Tenant as of January 1, 2022 in the total
amount of $105,814.69 (“A207 Abated Rent”).
Tenant owes Landlord $219,227.68 with respect to the A207
Lease.  This amount consists of A207 Rent
in the total estimated amount of $113,412.99 and $105,814.69 for the A207
Abated Rent.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On August 29, 2023, Landlord
filed the Complaint and Summons. 
            Landlord initially filed
its application for right to attach order for hearing on February 22,
2024.   The parties subsequently
stipulated multiple times to continue the hearing to the instant date.
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
             Where the defendant is a corporation, a
general reference to “all corporate property which is subject to attachment
pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010” is
sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  Where the defendant is a partnership or other
unincorporated association, a reference to “all property of the partnership or
other unincorporated association which is subject to attachment pursuant to
subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  A specific description of property is not
required for corporations and partnerships as they generally have no exempt
property.  Bank of America v. Salinas
Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has
the burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any
affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See
Bank of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against plaintiff,
(2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown
would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any
security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together
with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the
security interest) have decreased that security interest’s value.  CCP §483.015(b).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
            
            C. Statement of Facts
            1.
Landlord’s Evidence[2]
            a.
A201 Lease
            On
or around May 31, 2013, CIM and Tenant entered into a written Lease Agreement
(a) for a term of approximately five years (plus two extended terms if
exercised by Tenant), (b) for that certain retail space currently identified as
“Space No. A2-201A” containing approximately 6,093 square feet of total Floor
Area, consisting of approximately 1,464 square feet of Floor Area on Level 1,
making up the office space, and 4,629 square feet of Floor Area on Level 2,
making up the retail space, (collectively, the “A201 Premises”) in the project
known as “Ovation Hollywood”.  Gomez
Decl. ¶3, Ex. A. 
Pursuant to Article 4 of the A201 Lease, the A201 Lease
obligates Tenant to pay Minimum Annual Rent and Additional Rent (“A201 Rent”).  Gomez Decl., ¶4.
On or around August 21, 2015, Landlord and Tenant entered
into the A201 Storage Lease wherein Tenant leased certain storage space from
Landlord containing approximately 145 square feet, designated as Unit 169 H
located at the Premises (“A201 Storage Lease Premises”), and which was used by
Tenant in connection with its tenancy pursuant to the A201 Lease.  Gomez Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  Pursuant to Section 2 of the A201 Storage
Lease, the original term of lease ran from September 1, 2015 to August 31, 2016.
 Gomez Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.  Thereafter, the A201 Storage Space Lease would
continue from month-to-month unless either party terminated said lease upon 30
days’ prior written notice.  Gomez Decl.,
¶5, Ex. B.
            On
or around March 20, 2018, Landlord and Tenant entered into the A201 First
Amendment.  Gomez Decl., ¶6, Ex. C.  On or around January 17, 2023, Landlord and
Tenant entered into the A201 Second Amendment.  Gomez Decl., ¶7, Ex. D.  Pursuant to the A201 Second Amendment,
Landlord abated unpaid A201 Rent owed by Tenant as of January 2022 in the total
amount of $151,281.06.  Gomez Decl., ¶8.  Further, Section 6.2 of the A201 Second
Amendment deferred $200,000.00 in unpaid rent owed by Tenant as of January 2022
into a repayment period of 18 months beginning July 1, 2022 through and
including December 1, 2023, in the amount of $11,111.11 per month (the “A201
Deferred Amount”).  Gomez Decl., ¶8.
            Tenant
is required to pay monthly rent during the term of the A201 Lease.  Gomez Decl., ¶9.  Beginning in July 2018, pursuant to Section 3
of the A201 First Amendment, the Minimum Annual Rent for the Retail Space was
$21,960 for each lease year and per Section 4, the Minimum Annual Rent for the
Office Space was $204,912.   The Minimum
Annual Rent increased 3% each subsequent year.  Gomez Decl., ¶11.  
Pursuant to Section 3.2 of the A201 Second Amendment, the
Minimum Annual Rent for the Retail Space was $26,756.13 for the first year of
the term, July 2023 through June 2024, while the Minimum Annual Rent for the
Office Space, per Section 3.1, was $257,581.44 for the first year of the term,
July 2023 through June 2024.  Gomez
Decl., ¶13. 
            Without
accounting for partial payments and reverse charges, Tenant has accrued A201
Minimum Annual Rent charges for the A201 Office Space from February 2020 to
January 2024 in the total amount of $974,210.88.  Gomez Decl., ¶14.  Without accounting for partial payments and
reverse charges, Tenant has accrued A201 Minimum Annual Rent charges for the
A201 Retail Space from May 2020 to January 2024 in the total amount of
$94,101.58.  Gomez Decl., ¶15.
            During
the term of the A201 Lease, Tenant was also required to pay Additional Rent.  Gomez Decl., ¶ 16.  Specifically, Section 4.4 of the A201 Lease
provides that Additional Rent includes tax and insurance expenses, utilities
and chilled water, and common area maintenance.  Gomez Decl., ¶16, Ex. A. 
            Without
accounting for partial payments and reverse charges, Tenant has accrued A201
Utilities and Chilled Water charges for the A201 Office Space from July 2020 to
July 2020 in the total amount of $566.39.  Gomez Decl., ¶22.  Without accounting for partial payments and
reverse charges, Tenant has accrued A201 Utilities and Chilled Water charges
for the A201 Retail Space from May 2020 to January 2024 in the total amount of
$11,546.40.  Gomez Decl., ¶23.
Tenant also was obligated to pay Common Area Maintenance
(“CAM”) charges.  Tenant has accrued A201
Common Area Maintenance charges for the A201 Office Space from February 2020 to
January 2024 in the total amount of $0.  Gomez
Decl., ¶25.  Without accounting for
partial payments and reverse charges, Tenant has accrued A201 Common Area
Maintenance charges for the A201 Retail Space from May 2020 to January 2024 in
the total amount of $587,739.46.  Gomez
Decl., ¶26.
Pursuant
to Section 4.7 of the A201 Lease, Tenant’s untimely payment of any Minimum
Annual Rent or Additional Rent when due would subject tenant to interest and
late charge penalties.  Gomez Decl., ¶27.
 Landlord reserves the right to determine
the amounts of, and pursue, all late charge penalties and interest owed by
Tenant under the A201 Lease at the time of trial.  Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 28-29.  
Per
A201 Second Amendment, Landlord abated unpaid rent in the total amount of
$151,281.06.  Gomez Decl., ¶30.  Further, Section 6.2 of the A201 Second
Amendment deferred $200,000 in unpaid rent Tenant into a repayment period of 18
months beginning July 1, 2022, through December 1, 2023, in the amount of
$11,111.11 per month.  Gomez Decl., ¶30.
 Tenant failed to comply with
repayment terms for the A201 Deferred Amount.  Gomez Decl., ¶32. Landlord therefore reclaimed
the A201 Abated Rent in the amount of $151,281.06.  Gomez Decl., ¶32. 
Tenant
is required to pay monthly rent during the term of the A201 Storage Lease.  Gomez Decl., ¶33.  The A201 Storage Lease provides that Tenant is
to pay Landlord A201 Storage Lease rent in the amount of $520.00 per month in
advance on the first day of each month.  Gomez
Decl., ¶33.  Tenant relinquished
possession of the A201 Storage Lease Premises on or around May 2, 2023.  Gomez Decl., ¶34.  Without accounting for partial payments and
reverse charges, Tenant has accrued A201 Storage Lease rent from May 2020 to
May 2023 in the total amount of $19,240. 
 Gomez Decl., ¶ 35.  This amount, the amount for Tenant’s partial
payments, and the amount for reverse charges all in connection with the A201
Storage Lease are included within Tenant’s current A201 Rent balance.  Gomez Decl., ¶35.
Tenant’s
A201 Rent balance as of January 2024, after accounting for partial payments and
reverse charges, is $651,185.49.  Gomez
Decl., ¶¶ 39-45, Ex. H, I.  This amount
represents the combined total of (a) Tenant’s A201 Office Space and A201 Retail
Space balances, and (b) the value of the reclaimed A201 Abated Rent.  Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 39-45, Ex. H, I. 
Despite
Tenant’s outstanding A201 Rent balance and despite Landlord’s issuance of
several demand letters to Tenant that have not been complied with, at no point
throughout any period of Tenant’s tenancy under the A201 Lease has Landlord
ever disturbed Tenant’s possession of the A201 Premises contrary to the terms
of the A201 Lease.  Gomez Decl., ¶46.
 
b.
A207 Lease
On
or about February 22, 2007, CIM and Tenant entered into a written A207 Lease
for a term of approximately five years and for a retail space identified as
“Space No. A-2-207” containing approximately 528 square feet of Floor Area (“A207
Premises”) in the project known as “Ovation Hollywood”.  Gomez Decl., ¶47, Ex. J.   As set forth in the A207 Lease, Tenant is
required to pay rent during the term of the A207 Lease.  Gomez Decl., ¶53.
On
or around March 2, 2012, Landlord and Tenant entered into the Lease Amendment
No. 1 to the A207 Lease (the “A207 First Amendment”).  Gomez Decl., ¶ 49, Ex. K.  On or around September 9, 2014, Landlord and
Tenant entered into a Second Amendment to the A207 Lease (the “A207 Second
Amendment”).  Gomez Decl., ¶50, Ex. L.  On or about December 14, 2022, Landlord and
Tenant entered into the third and final amended lease, A207 Third Amendment.  Gomez Decl., ¶ 51, Ex. M.  Pursuant to the A207 Third Amendment, Landlord
abated unpaid A207 Rent owed by Tenant as of January 1, 2022, in the total
amount of $105,814.69.  Gomez Decl., ¶52.
 
During
the term of the A207 Lease, Tenant was required to pay Additional Rent.  Gomez Decl., ¶ 58.  Pursuant to Section 4.4(a) of the A207 Lease,
Tenant was required to pay Landlord each month the amounts Landlord estimated
as Tenant’s obligation for A207 Additional Rent.  Gomez Decl., ¶59.  Pursuant to section 4.4(b) of the A207 Lease,
Tenant was entitled to a reconciliation of Landlord’s estimate of Tenant’s A207
Additional Rent for each lease year, which would result in credits or debits to
Tenant’s lease ledger.  Gomez Decl.,
¶60.  
Pursuant
to Section 5 of the A207 Lease, Tenant’s obligation for A207 Additional Rent
includes the payment of Tenant’s share of tax and insurance expenses.  Gomez Decl., ¶61.  Tenant does not have an outstanding balance
for any A207 Tax and Insurance Expenses under the A207 Lease.  Gomez Decl., ¶61.  
Pursuant
to Sections 6.2 and 6,4 of the A207 Lease, Additional Rent includes a utilities
charge, which was to be paid in accordance with Section 4.4 of the A207 Lease,
as well as a chilled water charge, which was also to be paid in accordance with
Sections 4.4 of the A207 Lease.  Gomez
Decl., ¶64.  Without accounting for
partial payments and reverse charges, Tenant has accrued A207 Utilities and
Chilled Water charges under the A207 Lease from July 2020 to July 2020 in the
total amount of $670.  Gomez Decl., ¶65.
Pursuant
to Section 7.3(a) of the A207 Lease, Additional Rent includes Tenant’s common
area expenses in connection with the use, ownership, operation and maintenance
of the common area to the Premises. Tenant’s share of common area expenses was
to be paid in in accordance with Section 4.4, and calculated based upon Section
7.3(b) of the A207 Lease.  Gomez Decl.,
¶66.  Without accounting for partial
payments and reverse charges, Tenant has accrued A207 Common Area Maintenance
charges under the A207 Lease from January 2020 to January 2024 in the total
amount of $215,886.48.  Gomez Decl., ¶67.
Pursuant
to Section 4.7 of the A207 Lease, Tenant’s untimely payment of any Minimum
Annual Rent or Additional Rent when due subjects Tenant to interest and late
charge penalties.  Gomez Decl., ¶68.  Landlord reserves the right to determine the
amounts of and pursue all late charge penalties and interest owed by Tenant
under the A207 Lease at the time of trial. 
Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 69-70.
Pursuant
to the A207 Third Amendment, Landlord abated unpaid rent in the total amount of
$105,814.69 (“the A207 Abated Charges”). 
Gomez Decl., ¶71.  By reason of
Tenant’s failure to pay all rent due under the A207 Lease when due following
its execution of the Second Amendment, Tenant now owes Landlord $105,814.69 for
the A207 Abated Charges.  Gomez Decl.,
¶73.
Tenant’s
A207 Rent owed as of January 2024, after accounting for partial payments and
reverse charges, is $222,584.04.  Gomez
Decl., ¶77.  This amount represents the
combined total of (a) Tenant’s most recent A207 Lease rent balance
($116,769.35), as reflected within Tenant’s most recent January 2024 ledger for
the A207 Premises, and (b) the value of the reclaimed A207 Abated Rent
($105,814.69).  Gomez Decl., ¶77.

Gomez Supplemental
Cecilia
Gomez is an authorized agent of Landlord H&H.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶1.  The moving papers filed on January 25, 2024
included Gomez’s declaration with an Exhibit Q that she has now updated with
Charts A and B.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶2.  Gomez has reviewed the figures in Charts A and
B with Landlord’s accounting team and the figures in the charts are correct.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶2.  
Since
the filing of the application the parties have continued the proceedings
because they were attempting to informally resolve the unpaid rent issues
without prejudice to their legal rights. 
Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶2.  This
includes the thousands of documented backup support (similar to an audit under
Section 4.4(c) of the A201 and A207 leases) that Landlord has shared with
Tenant for the Common Area charges.  Gomez
Supp. Decl., ¶2.  This documented backup
supports the requested amounts.  Gomez Supp.
Decl., ¶2.  To date, however, the issues
remain unresolved.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶2.  
The
amount requested in moving papers was for $873,769.53 in unpaid rent, $95,000
in estimated attorney’s fees, and $2,000 in allowable costs, for a total of
$970,769.53.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶3.  Chart A summarizes this requested amount and
is arranged by categories of rent and credits for each of the three leases: (1)
the A201 Lease, (2) the A207 Lease, and (3) the now terminated Storage Space
Lease.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶3.  
Chart
B is the updated figures through September 30, 2024 for the unpaid rent from
the leases, and attorney’s fees and costs. 
Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶3.  Chart B
also includes the 2023 reconciliations for the charges identified in the A201
and A207 leases under Article 5 and 7 as Tax and Insurance Expenses and Common
Area.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶3.  For the 2023 reconciliation, Tenant received
a reconciliation credit of (a) $23,344.38 against its Rent balance for the A201
Lease, and (b) 8277.31 (sic.) against the Rent balance for the A207
Lease.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶3.  
Charts
A and B reflect three categories of Rent charges for the A201 and A207 leases.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶4.  The first is Minimum Annual Rent, which is
the Minium Annual Rent as defined in the A201 and A207 Leases.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶4.  The second category is for Utilities and
Chilled Water, which are charges pursuant to Article 6 of the A201 and A207
leases.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶4.  The third category totals the charges allowed
pursuant to Articles 5 (Tax and Insurance Expense) and 7 (Common Area).  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶4.  This third category of charges are billed to
Tenant as estimated charges pursuant to section 4.4(a) of the two leases.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶4.  These same charges are then reconciled
pursuant to section 4.4(b) of the leases and, if Tenant paid more than the
actual charges, then the terms of the reconciliation possibly provide Tenant
with a credit against the balance pursuant to Sections 4.4(b) and 4.6 of the
subject leases.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶4.  Charts A and B indicate any debit or credit
applied to Tenant’s ledger for each of the two leases following the
reconciliation of Article 5 and 7 charges for the years 2019 through 2023.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶4.  
Thus
far, for the A201 Lease, Landlord has billed Tenant $24,032.62 each month this
year in estimated Article 5 and 7 charges (January 2024 through September 2024)
for a total of $216,293.58. Landlord will reconcile these charges next year.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶5.  
Thus
far, for the A207 Lease, Landlord has billed Tenant $8,312.64 each month this
year in estimated Article 5 and 7 charges (January 2024 through September 2024)
for a total of $74,813.76. Landlord will reconcile these charges next year. For
now they are billed as estimates as allowed under Section 4.4(a) of the A201
and A207 leases.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶6. 
Charts
A and B also reflect the rent as the only category of rent that is owed under
the lease for the Storage Space.  Gomez Supp.
Decl., ¶7.  Exhibit S is the details of
the reconciliations for the years 2019 through 2023 for the Article 5 and 7
charges pursuant to the A201 and A207 Leases.

Supp. Decl., ¶8.  Exhibit T are the

Fee
Estimates
Landlord’s
law firm charges a highly competitive rate for such services, namely $550.00
per hour for partners, $285.00 – $425.00 per hour for associates, and $95.00
per hour for law clerks.  Aguirre Decl.,
¶13.
Landlord’s
counsel estimates that the allowable attorneys’ fees to litigate this action
through trial will be $95,000 (fees are currently approximately $36,000).  Aguirre Decl., ¶14.  Counsel estimates the costs to litigate this
action to be $2,000 (costs are currently approximately $534.66), which include
the filing fee, fees for filing the writ of attachment, and the costs to serve
Defendant, among other potential costs leading up to trial.  Aguirre Decl., ¶14.  
 
2.
Tenant’s Evidence 
a.
Background
Shoeleh
Sapir (“Sapir”) is Starline’s Chief Financial Officer.  Sapir Decl., ¶1.  Starline originated in 1935 and is the
original hop-on, hop-off, tour bus service provider in Los Angeles, providing
sightseeing opportunities for countless tourists over the years.  Sapir Decl., ¶2.  
Starline
leases retail and office space, along with several open-air sales kiosks/carts,
at the Hollywood and Highland Mall (“H&H Mall”).  Sapir Decl., ¶3.  The H&H Mall is around 400,000 square
feet.  Sapir Decl., ¶3.  Starline has been leasing a portion of the
H&H Mall since 2007, approaching nearly two decades.  Sapir Decl., ¶3.  It has increased its rental space at the
H&H Mall over the years.  Sapir Decl.,
¶3.  
 
b.
Leases
The
A201 and A207 Leases were with CIM. 
Sapir Decl., ¶4.  Sapir does not
recall ever having seen an assignment of those Leases or any other document
transferring an interest in the property from CIM to H&H Retail Owner, LLC.  Sapir Decl., ¶4.  
Over
the last several years, Sapir began to notice that the charges that Starline
was being charged on the Leases differed from previous years.  Sapir Decl., ¶5.  The amount seemed significantly larger for
CAM charges and included items that Sapir had not previously seen included in
CAMs like salaries, pool maintenance, management fees, accounting software, and
other administrative fees.  Sapir Decl.,
¶5.  Because the Leases do not provide a
fixed square footage for the H&H Mall on which to base the Additional Rent,
those numbers fluctuate without explanation. 
Sapir Decl., ¶5.  
Because
the Leases are complex and require certain information to determine the actual
amounts owed, such as who are major tenants and licensees, what contributions
they make, and what premises are open and leased, Starline asked to see the
underlying documentary support for the Additional Rent, including CAMs.  Sapir Decl., ¶5.  Sapir still does not understand the
calculations used to apportion Starline’s charges from other tenants at the
H&H Mall and does not believe the charges are accurate.  Sapir Decl., ¶5.  
Landlord
claims CAM charges owed of nearly $600,000 for approximately four years for the
201A retail lease.  Sapir Decl., ¶5.  That is over six times the amount of the base
rent charged for the same space, and that retail space is less than 1500 sq.
ft.  Sapir Decl., ¶5.  The charges do not make sense to Sapir and
are not in line with the charges Starline incurred prior to 2019 under their
Leases.  Sapir Decl., ¶5.  
Starline
has also asked for an explanation how Starline’s payments were applied to the
various leases.  Sapir Decl., ¶6.  Sapir is concerned that Starline’s payments
were not properly applied.  Sapir Decl.,
¶6.  The ledgers provided appear to
credit or apportion the payments across the various Leases in differing amounts
and without explanation.  Sapir Decl., ¶6.  
When
the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, Starline’s operations were shut down and the
H&H Mall was completely closed for months. 
Sapir Decl., ¶7.  Starline could
not even access its leased spaces during that period.  Sapir Decl., ¶7.  Starline was permitted to resume operations
in October and November 2020, but then was ordered to shut down again from
December 2020 to March 2021.  Sapir Decl.,
¶7.  Despite the closed mall and
government mandates, Starline continued to be charged not just base rent but
massive amounts for CAM charges.  Sapir Decl.,
¶7.  The Additional Rent Starline was
required to pay under the Leases is based on calculations that depend in part
on which leased spaces were “open.” 
Sapir Decl., ¶7.  No explanation
or calculation has been provided to show what spaces were open and leased
during that period or that the charges for Additional Rent are correct given
the number of closed businesses during the Covid period.  Sapir Decl., ¶7.  As a result, Sapir disagrees with the charges
accrued during the COVID-19 pandemic and the following months.  Sapir Decl., ¶7.  
Sapir
has observed that large portions of the H&H Mall are vacant.  Sapir Decl., ¶8.  Sapir has serious concerns that Landlord is
trying to cover the cost of these vacancies at the expense of the current
tenants.  Sapir Decl., ¶8.  This has put an unfair and undue burden on
the few remaining tenants, particularly with regard to the CAM charges.  Sapir Decl., ¶8.  Despite these difficulties, Starline is still
a tenant at the H&H Mall and continues to pay rent for the leased spaces.  Sapir Decl., ¶9. 
 
c.
Meet and Confer 
The
parties have engaged in several meet and confer efforts, including the exchange
of documents, to try and reach an agreement as to what, if any, charges are
owed by Tenant.  Rhyne Decl., ¶5.  The review of those documents is ongoing, and
includes the review of receipts/invoices, ledgers, spreadsheets, and other
various documents provided by Landlord for multiple years.  Rhyne Decl., ¶5.  Further discovery is needed to ascertain the
veracity of the calculations, including a deposition of someone with knowledge
of the complex rent formula and the apportionment performed for Starline's
share, a single tenant at a very large mall. 
Rhyne Decl., ¶5.  
During
the exchange of documents, Landlord claimed that the documents it provided to Tenant
are "Confidential," and demanded that Starline maintain their
confidentiality pursuant to the terms of the Leases related to Tenant's right
to an audit.  Rhyne Decl., ¶6.  Accordingly, Tenant has not provided those
documents in conjunction with its opposition. 
Rhyne Decl., ¶6.
 
D.
Analysis 
Landlord
seeks a right to attach order against Tenant in the amount of $970,769.53,
which includes for past due rent on the Leases in the amount of $873,769.55, estimated
attorney fees of $95,000 and estimated costs of $2000.[3]
 
1.
Standing
Tenant
argues that H&H has failed to demonstrate that it has an enforceable right
under the Leases.  The original 2007 and
2013 Leases are between Tenant and CIM. 
Sapir Decl., ¶4; Gomez Decl., Exs. A, J. 
There is no citation to any fact establishing H&H's ownership of
H&H Mall.  Neither supporting
declaration includes any fact regarding H&H's ownership of the property,
and there is no assignment or other agreement showing how H&H came to own
H&H all.  As such, H&H has failed
to demonstrate that it is the real party-in-interest and it lacks standing to
enforce any rights against Starline under the 2007 and 2013 Leases.  Opp. at 10-11.
This
would be a good argument except that Landlord rebuts it.  Normally an assignment is required to show
that a plaintiff is the successor-in-interest to a contracting party.   However, H&H is correct that The A201
and A207 Leases, at Section 25.1, provide that “[t]he parties hereto agree that
all the provisions of this Lease… shall bind and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors,
and assigns.” Gomez Decl., Exs. A, J. The Storage Space Lease has the same
provision at Section 17.  Gomez Decl.,
Ex. B.  
Each
amendment of the Leases herein – two for the A201 Lease and three for the A207
Lease, contains a recital that H&H is Landlord and successor-interest to
CIM.  Gomez Decl., Exhibits C, D, K , L,
and M.  Tenant signed each amendment, thereby
admitting that H&H is Landlord and owner of the Premises.  The parties’ course of dealing also
demonstrates Tenant’s recognition of H&H as Landlord.  Reply at 5.
H&H
has standing to bring this application.
 
2. A Claim
Based on a Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  
Landlord’s claim is
based on Tenant’s breach of the three Leases and the claim exceeds
$500.  This is a claim on which
attachment may be based.
 
2. An Amount Due
That is Fixed and Readily Ascertainable 
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained
by reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41.  The fact that the damages
are unliquidated is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard by
which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id.
(citations omitted).
Tenant correctly states that an application for a right to
attach order "must be supported by an affidavit or declaration showing
that the applicant, on the facts presented. would be entitled to a judgment on
the claim upon which the attachment is based."  CCP §484.030. "The facts stated in each
affidavit filed pursuant to this title shall be set forth with particularity.
Except where matters are specifically permitted by this title to be shown by
information and belief, each affidavit shall show affirmatively that the
affiant, if sworn as a witness, can testify competently to the facts stated
therein."  CCP §482.040.  In considering an application for right to
attach order and writ of attachment, the must "apply the same evidentiary
standard to an attachment hearing decided on affidavits and declarations as to
a case tried on oral testimony." Goldstein v. Barak Construction, (200)
164 Cal.App.4th 845, 853. 
Opp. at 13.
Tenant argues that Landlord’s evidence fails to present a
complete picture of the parties' business and financial dealings and is
insufficient to establish the elements for a writ of attachment. This is not an
application based on a simple lease that provides a clear formula for calculation
of the amounts owed.  Rather, this
landlord/tenant relationship encompasses multiple leases, some with multiple
amendments. The Leases require calculations of rent based on variables not
supported in the moving papers, such as open premises, types of other lessees
at the H&H Mall, and proportional charges dependent on information that
cannot be ascertained from the Leases themselves.  Opp. at 14.
The deficiencies include the following.  First, H&H has provided a convoluted
amalgamation of purported charges and payments for the Starline spaces going
back to 2019 that do not correspond with their own ledgers.  H&H claims that the Leases at issue are
for spaces designated A2-201A (retail and office) and A-2-207. Ex.A, §1.4, Ex.
J, §1.4.  However, the ledgers provided
by H&H are for spaces 2-A-203, 2-A-300, and 2-A-207.  Gomez Decl., Exs. H, I, and R.  No explanation is provided for these
discrepancies.  Opp. at 14.
Second, it is unclear how H&H allotted Tenant’s payments
to amounts owed under the various Leases.  For example, in November 2021, H&H's
ledgers identify a check from Starline (Chk#I099) split into three different
payments on the three Leases (Ex. H $14,227.58, Ex. I 920,232.93; Ex. R
$6,392.31). There is no consistency to H&H's payment allocations and no
explanation for these varying applications. Starline believes that its payments
were not properly credited by H&H.  Sapir
Decl., ¶6.  These issues are critical
because H&H contends that large sums are owed for charges previously
deferred and charges previously abated due to non-compliance by Starline. But
H&H has not demonstrated how it applied payments by Starline.  Opp. at 14.
In addition, while H&H identifies the relevant portions
of the Leases regarding insurance and taxes, it merely states that Starline is
up to date on those charges for both Leases.  Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 18-20.  None of H&H's ledgers, however, include
any tax and insurance information regarding charges or payments.  See Exs. H, I, and R.  It is unclear how H&H has been charging and
crediting Starline for taxes and insurance so that Starline has no balance owed
for those charges but owes balances for rent or abated/deferred charges.  Opp. at 15.
H&H also combined the storage space lease charges and
payments in its A201 retail rent and payments, despite the fact that they were for
an independent Lease and the storage space was relinquished in 2023.  See Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 33-35.  There is no explanation why these rent charges
were incorporated under the A20l amounts or how the payments were accounted
for. This is particularly odd given that the A201 Retail and A20l Office spaces
are treated as independent in the ledgers despite the fact that a single Lease
governed them.  Opp. at 15.
Third, H&H has not provided sufficient facts to support
the calculations for CAM expenses. The Leases contain specific provisions about
how the CAM charges are to be calculated. CAM expenses shall be reduced (prior
to the calculation of Tenant's share) by the contributions of the Major Tenants
and by the Licensees' Contribution.  CAM
expenses shall not include any costs of Landlord in connection with the
original construction and installation of the Common Area. See, e.g.,
Exs. A and J, §7.3(a), (b).  This
calculation requires at least the following information: contributions of the
Major Tenants and contributions of the Licensees, the square footage of the
H&H Mall, the square footage of the Major Tenants and Licensees, and the other
premises in the H&H Mall that are leased and those that are open.  Id. 
H&H's application, however, contains no information on these
elements.  While Gomez's belated
supplemental declaration provides information on the annual reconciliations
(Exs. S, T), it does not explain how those amounts were calculated.  Nonetheless, 40% of all amounts purportedly
owed under the Leases according to H&H were designated as CAM charges
($803,513.92 out of $2,002,264.48 accrued on the Leases since January/May of
2020). The CAM charges for the A201 Retail Space are more than six times the
minimum annual rent for the space ($94,101.58 v. 8587,739.46).  Gomez Decl., ¶45.  Opp. at 16.
Furthermore, there were significant periods of time during
which the H&H Mall was closed due to the Covid-l9 pandemic, and Starline
was not permitted to enter the property.  Sapir Decl., ¶7.  H&H continued to charge not only base rent
but excessive CAM charges.  Ibid.  In addition, H&H has failed to explain
how those closures impacted Tenant's Additional Rent calculations given that
such rent is calculated based in part on open and leased premises.  Ibid.  Significant questions remain as to H&H's
calculation of rent during the Covid-I9 pandernic, questions which H&H has
not explained in its application.  Opp.
at 17.
Despite the parties’ discussions and Tenant’s review of the
provided documents, Starline is still unclear about how and what it is being
charged.  
H&H has failed to establish that the amounts charged to
Starline were calculated according to the terms of the Leases. Nor are those
amounts readily ascertainable based on the information provided by H&H with
its application.  Compare CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) I 15 Cal.App.4th
537, 541 (master lease and corresponding lease schedules provided a clear and
definite formula for the computation of damages) and Construction
Laborers Trust Funds for Southern California Administrative Company v. West
Coast Structures, Inc., (C.D. Cal., June 21, 2019, No. EDCV1849OJGBSPX)
2019 WL 4148354, at *8 (even where an agreement provides a formula for
calculating damages, if the underlying input for that formula is missing, the
amount is not readily ascertainable or definite).  Opp. at 17.
Tenant is confusing the requirement that the Leases furnish
a standard by which the amount may be ascertained with the proof to meet that
standard.  The Leases certainly provide
the standard by which Rent and Additional Rent may be calculated.  Nor is Landlord’s proof deficient.  Landlord is not required to prove its case.  It is only required to show a probability of
success, which means a prima facie case. 
See post.
Landlord’s
counsel estimates attorney fees to litigate this action through trial of
$95,000 and estimated costs of $2,000. 
Aguirre Decl., ¶14.  These
estimates are supported by an attorney declaration and are allowed.
            
            3.
Probability of Success
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Tenant
notes that, where a lease provides for periodic payments of rent, a separate
statute of limitations runs separately as to each monthly rent payment when it
becomes due.  Tilson v. Peters, (“Tilson”)
(1940) 4l Cal.App.2d 671, 674-75 (complaint for breach of lease is
impermissibly uncertain where it alleges only the amount of the debt, the
amount that has not been paid, and balance left due and owing).  Like Tilson, H&H fails to properly
allege any breach. H&H suggests there have been multiple breaches of
different Leases and their amendments.  Nowhere
in the Complaint or the application does H&H identify the specific breaches
of the A20l Lease, the Storage Lease, and the A207 Lease by Starline.  Similarly, H&H seeks to include amounts of
rent that had been previously abated or deferred and only generically states
that Tenant failed to comply with repayment terms for the abatement and failed
to pay all rent due under the lease, thus justifying H&H's efforts to
reclaim those amounts.  Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 32,73.
 This is inadequate to meet H&H's
heavy burden to show when and how Tenant breached the terms such that H&H
was entitled to reclaim those amounts.  Opp. at 12.
The uncertainty in Tilson court related to whether
“the property was rented for an aggregate sum which became due under the
contract for the entire term...or whether the rent became due in monthly
installments.” 41 Cal.App.2d at 674.  Tenant’s
rent under the Leases was due on a monthly basis and there is no uncertainty.  
Moreover, the statute of limitations for breach of written
contract is four years from the date of the breach. CCP §337(a).  Defendant’s breach under the A201 Lease for
the Office began in February 2020, the breach under the A201 Lease for the
Retail and Storage spaces began in May 2020, and the breach under the A207
Lease began in January 2020.  The
Complaint was filed on or about August 29, 2023. All alleged breaches were
based on Defendant’s non-payment of the amounts due under the Lease and all are
within the four-year statute of limitations for breach of contract actions.
Tenant argues that it should be permitted to file its
defenses and claims, and H&H should be required to address those defenses
and claims, before a right to attach order is issued.  See Pet Food Exp. Ltd. v. Royal
Canin USA Inc., (N.D. Cal., July 28,2009, No. C-09-1483 MHP) 2009 WL
2252108, at *5 (to establish probability of prevailing on breach of contract
claim, plaintiff must show that defendant's defense is less than 50% likely to
succeed).   Opp. at 12.
This is incorrect. 
Tenant can raise its defenses and claims of offset in opposition to
Landlord’s right to attach application. 
A defendant may raise a claim of offset for any indebtedness of the
plaintiff to the defendant raised in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense
in an answer.  CCP §483.015(b)(2),
(3).  The defendant’s offset claim under
CCP section 483.015(b)(2) or (3) must be supported by sufficient evidence to
prove a prima facie case of attachment in its own right. Lydig
Construction, Inc. v. Martinez Steel, (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 937; Pos-A-Traction,
Inc. v. Kelly Springfield, (C.D. Cal. 1999) 112 F.Supp.2d 1178, 1183.  Landlord is not required to wait until Tenant
files a cross-complaint or answers.  
Turning to Tenant’s arguments under the readily
ascertainable heading, Landlord shows that the Leases contain a force majeure
clause and the risks of COVID for payment of rent belong to Tenant.    Additionally, Tenant released any claim
against Landlord for the A201 and A207 Leases when they were amended on January
17, 2023.  Reply at 6-7.
Landlord has presented a prima facie case concerning the
Rent and Additional Rent (including taxes and insurance, utilities and chilled
water, and CAM charges) for each of the A201, A207, and A201 Storage Space
Leases.  This information is provided in
ledgers for each Lease. Exs. H, I, R. 
While Tenant questions some entries, it does not show them to be in
error.  Tenant’s arguments about lack of “consistency”,
“clarity”, or “explanation” in Landlord’s showing are insufficient.
Exhibit I identifies monthly base rent for the “office”
portion of the A201 Lease, Exhibit H tracks the expenses for the “retail” space
and delineates which charges pertain to the Storage Lease, and Exhibit R tracks
the charges for the A-207 Lease.  Thus,
irrespective of the Storage Lease amounts being tracked alongside the “retail”
space amounts, the amounts are clearly separated and Tenant does not allege
that it owes no such amounts.  Nor has
Tenant shown that any check was improperly allocated between Leases.  
For the CAM expenses, Tenant wants the underlying foundation
of contributions of the Major Tenants and contributions of the Licensees, the
square footage of the H&H Mall, the square footage of the Major Tenants and
Licensees, and the other premises in the H&H Mall that are leased and those
that are open.  Landlord supposedly
included the CAM charges calculation in Gomez Ex. Q, but it is impossible to
read.   However, Exhibits S and T to the
Gomez supplemental declaration show the CAM charges.  These exhibits show the information Tenant
seeks on H&H Mall square footage, occupancy, Tenant’s square footage and
percentage, and Tenant’s pro rata share. 
Tenant may have questions about the CAM charges, but Landlord has no
obligation to include additional foundational information in its reconciliations.  
Moreover, as Landlord points out (Reply at 8), Tenant had
the right to audit Landlord’s books, pursuant to Section 4.4(c) of the A201 and
A207 Leases pertaining to Tenant’s share of taxes, insurance, chilled water,
and CAM charges within 12 months of the end of a calendar year.  Tenant fails to proffer any evidence that it
audited or sought to audit any of the expenses. 

In reply, Landlord acknowledges that the Gomez supplemental
declaration reconciles the CAM charges for 2019 to 2023 to reduce the estimated
amounts by $23,344.38 for the A201 Lease and by $9,202.39 for the A207
Lease.  Gomez Supp. Decl., ¶8, Chart B.  Tenant should receive the benefit of these
more accurate amounts.  Therefore, the amount
sought of $873,769.55 for past due rent on the Leases is reduced to $841,222.78
($873,769.55 - $23,344.38 and $9292.39). 
With estimated attorney fees of $95,000 and estimated costs of $2000 the
total amount is $938,222.78.[4]
 
            4.
Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.  CCP §484.090(a)(3).  Landlord seek
attachment for a proper purpose.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
application for a right to attach order is granted in the amount of $938,222.78.
