And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case. The Tenant failed to provide a courtesy copy of their opposition, which is a violation of the Presiding Judge's order on electronic filing. As a result, the Judge has only considered the declaration and not its supporting exhibits. The Judge has also ruled on the Tenant's evidentiary objections, overruling all of them. The Landlord has provided evidence that the amount owed has increased to $1,000,920.78, but the Judge is limiting the amount to what was sought in the application. The Judge is not adding in any rent and charges accrued since January 2024, as this was not part of the original application. The Judge is giving the Tenant the benefit of an accurate reconciliation, but is not attaching assets for rent incurred after the application.
