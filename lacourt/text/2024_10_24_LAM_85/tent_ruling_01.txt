  Case Number:  23STCP00841    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  85 
Timothy
Ryan, M.D. v. County of Los Angeles, 23STCP00841
 
 
Tentative decision on motion for: (1) 
reconsideration: denied; (2) section 473(b) relief:
denied; (3) clarification: granted in Ryan’s favor



 
            
 
            Respondent
County of Los Angeles (“County”) moves for (1) reconsideration of the court’s
order that it waived the attorney-client privilege exemption, (2) relief under
CCP section 473(b), and (2) clarification that the County can still assert the
catch-all exemption for the emails at issue. 
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and renders
the following tentative decision. 
            
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioner
Timothy Ryan, M.D (“Ryan”) filed the verified Petition on March 16, 2023, alleging
a cause of action for traditional mandamus. 
The Petition alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            From
2013-18, Ryan was employed at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (“Harbor-UCLA”) as a
vascular surgeon.  A jury verdict subsequently
found that, while working at Harbor-UCLA, Ryan was subject to retaliation for
whistleblowing activity related to the submission of false medical claims.
 
            a.
Requests Related to Kwong
            On
August 15, 2022, Ryan made a CPRA request for records related to Dr. Louis
Kwong (“Kwong”), former chairman of Harbor-UCLA's orthopedics department.  On September 22, 2022, the County requested
an extension to respond.
            On
October 4, 2022, Ryan made a CPRA request for any records related to Kwong’s
employment, allegations of his misconduct, and his suspension.  The first category of documents was for all
documents indicating Kwong’s suspension in the first week of April 2022.  The second category was for all documents
referring to or identifying the reasons for such suspension.
            The
County invoked a 14-day extension to respond. 
On November 11, 2022, the County asserted that all documents responsive
to the two requests fell under statutory exemptions to disclosure.  
 
            b.
Requests Related to Whistleblower Retaliation
            In
April and November 2015, Ryan filed two complaints with the County Intake Specialist
Unit (“CISU”).  In Timothy Ryan, M.D.
v. The County of Los Angeles, (“Ryan I”) Case No. BC606535, County
employees testified that the County never conducted an internal investigation
into his complaints.  In Timothy Ryan,
M.D. v. Brant Putnam, M.D. (“Ryan v. Putnam”) Case No.
2:17-cv-05752- CAS-RAO, discovery showed that the County had initiated an
external investigation through Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP (“Sheppard
Mullin”).  They showed that Sheppard Mullin
attorney Robert Barker, Esq. (“Barker”) interviewed Christian de Virgilio, M.D.
(“De Virgilio”), and Janine Vintch, M.D. (“Vintch”) as part of the
investigation.
            A
County employee filed a third complaint based on improper retaliation against
Ryan.  The County interviewed Ryan on
tape for this investigation.  A November
5, 2018 notice designated the complaint as “A.” 
The County Policy of Equity (“CPOE”) defines a designation of A to mean
that the initial investigation revealed a potential violation of the
policy.  
            In
June 2020, County Equity Investigation Unit (“CEIU”) investigator Ana Palacios
(“Palacios”) contacted Ryan about the investigation based on the third-party’s complaint.  Ryan provided Palacios with various documents
supporting the complaint.  Discovery in Ryan
v. Putnam revealed that Palacios conducted three interviews as part of this
investigation.
            The
jury in Ryan I ruled in Ryan’s favor. 
On March 3, 2023, the County informed Ryan that it had determined that the
facts in support of the retaliation allegations were unsubstantiated.  
            On
November 15, 2022, Ryan made a CPRA request for (1) all documents related to CISU
matter #2018-5003062, (2) all documents related to CEIU #2019-13746, and (3) the
audio/video recordings of Palacios’ June 2020 interviews of DeVirgilio, Anish Mahajan
(“Mahajan”), and Brant Putnam (“Putnam”), plus any other interviews related to
this matter.
            On
December 6, 2022, the County denied the requests entirely based on numerous
abstract exemptions.
            On
December 11, 2022, Ryan made a CPRA request for documents related to any
investigation of Ryan’s complaints by Sheppard Mullin or other outside
counsel.  This included Sheppard Mullin’s
bills submitted to the County for the 2018 investigation of allegations made
against Ryan.  The investigation included
allegations of fraud and record falsification by Rodney White, M.D. (“White”) and
Carlos Donayre, M.D. (“Donayre”) and any kickback payments Medtronic made to
White.  Ryan also requested documents and
findings created or collected as part of the investigations, communications to
or from then-County PMU employee Tito Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”) about the
investigations, any such communications to or from any other County employee,
and any such communications to or from Barker.
            The
County extended the deadline to respond four times and, as of the Petition, has
not provided a complete determination or produced responsive documents.
 
            c.
Requests Related to the Theft of Controlled Substances
            On
May 23, 2016, Harbor-UCLA’s Medical Executive Committee (“MEC”) discussed
allegations of the diversion or theft of controlled substances.
            On
September 8, 2022, Ryan made a CPRA request. 
As to the County Department of Health Services (“DHS”), Ryan requested
(1) all reports, correspondence and supporting documents relating to the discovery,
investigation, and reporting of the 2016 allegations and (2) any related
allegations, complaints, or reports made to the California Board of Pharmacy (“Board
of Pharmacy”) as required under Business and Professions Code (“Bus.
& Prof. Code”) section 4104 and California Code of Regulations Title
16 (“16 CCR”) section 1715.6.  As to the
Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department (“LASD”), Ryan requested records of any complaints,
arrests, charges against individuals based on involvement in the diversion and
or theft of controlled substances at Harbor-UCLA between March 2015 and May 23,
2016, subject to limitations in Government Code[1]
section 6254(f).
            The
County extended the deadline multiple times. 
On October 24, 2022, the County denied the requests in full based on
several exemptions.
            
            d.
Prayer for Relief
            Ryan
seeks declaratory relief holding that the County violated the CPRA when it
failed to disclose documents responsive to the requests and to timely respond
to the December 11, 2022 requests.  He
asks the court to order the disclosure of documents responsive to all of his requests.  Alternatively, the court should conduct an in
camera review of the requested records to determine which should be
disclosed.  Ryan also seeks attorney’s
fees and costs under either section 7923.115 or CCP section 1021.5.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
March 27, 2023, Ryan served the County with the Petition and Summons.
            On
April 26, 2023, the County filed an Answer.
            On
July 19, 2023, Ryan filed a Notice of Related Cases for eight state and four
federal cases.  On July 27, 2023, Ryan
clarified that he did not want this case transferred to another court or
consolidated with the other cases.
            On
August 29, 2023, the court informed counsel that it would not order a privilege
log before trial.
            On
March 28, 2024, the court granted Ryan’s Petition for traditional writ of
mandate in part.
On July 16, 2024, the court permitted briefing on the scope
of the Kwong Requests.
            On
September 3, 2024, after briefing, the court ruled that the scope of the Kwong
Requests would not be expanded. 
 
B. Governing Law 
            1.
The CPRA 
The CPRA was enacted in 1968 to safeguard the accountability
of government to the public.  San
Gabriel Tribune v. Superior Court, (1983) 143 Cal.App.4th 762, 771-72.  Government Code section 7921.000[2]
declares that “access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s
business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this
state.”  The CPRA’s purpose is to
increase freedom of information by giving the public access to information in
possession of public agencies. CBS. Inc. v. Block, (1986) 42 Cal. 3d
646, 651.  The CPRA was intended to
safeguard the accountability of government to the public, and it makes public
access to governmental records a fundamental right of citizenship.  Wilson v. Superior Court, (1996) 51
Cal.App.4th 1136, 1141.  This requires
maximum disclosure of the conduct of government operations.  California State University Fresno Assn.,
Inc. v. Superior Court, (“California State University”) (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 810, 823.  In 2004, the
voters endorsed the CPRA by approving Prop 59, which amended the state
Constitution to declare that “the writings of public agencies…shall be open to
public scrutiny.”  Cal. Const. art. I,
§3(b)(1).  Accordingly, any statute,
court rule, or other authority shall be broadly construed if it furthers the
people’s right of access, and narrowly construed if it limits the right.  Cal. Const. art. I, §3(b)(2).  
            The
CPRA makes clear that “every person” has a right to inspect any public
record.  §7922.525(a).  The inspection may be for any purpose; the
requester’s motivation is irrelevant. §7921.300.  The term “public record” is broadly defined
to include any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the
people’s business prepared, owned, used or retained by any state or local
agency regardless of physical form or characteristics.  §7920.530(a). 
The definition of “state agency” excludes agencies described in articles
IV and VI of the state constitution, which describe the legislative and
judicial branches, except the State Bar of California.  §7920.540.
            A
CPRA request must reasonably describe an identifiable public record or
records.  §7922.530(a).  Upon receiving a request for a copy of public
records, an agency must determine within ten days whether the request seeks
public records in the possession of the agency that are subject to disclosure,
but that deadline may be extended up to 14 days for unusual circumstances.  §§ 7922.535(a), (b).  Nothing in the CPRA “shall be construed to
permit an agency to delay or obstruct the inspection or copying of public
records.”  §7922.500.  
            Even
significant expense to the agency will not excuse an agency from conducting a
thorough search for responsive records unless it constitutes an undue
burden.  See, e.g., CBS
Broadcasting Inc. v. Superior Ct., (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 892, 909
($43,000 cost to agency to compile responsive public records was not valid
reason to deny CPRA request). 
“Reasonable efforts do not require that agencies undertake
extraordinarily extensive or intrusive searches, however.  In general, the scope of an agency’s search
for public records ‘need only be reasonably calculated to locate responsive
documents.’” City of San Jose v. Superior Court, (2017) 2 Cal.5th 608,
627 (citation omitted). 
The “CPRA does not prescribe specific methods of searching
for those documents and agencies may develop their own internal policies for
conducting searches.  Some general
principles have emerged, however. Once an agency receives a CPRA request, it
must “‘communicate the scope of the information requested to the custodians of
its records,’ although it need not use the precise language of the request...” Ibid.
(citation omitted).  If the agency
determines that the requested records are subject to disclosure, it must state
in the determination “the estimated date and time when the records will be made
available.”  §7922.535(a). There is no
deadline expressed in number of days for producing the records.  Rather, the agency “shall make the records
promptly available.”  §7922.530(a).
            If
the agency determines that the requested records are not subject to disclosure,
the agency must promptly notify the person making the request and provide the
reasons for its determination. §7922.535(a). 
The agency must justify withholding a responsive record by demonstrating
it is exempt or that on the facts of the case the public interest served by not
disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by
disclosure of the record.  §7922.000.  The determination that the request is denied,
in whole or part, must be in writing. 
§7922.540(a).
 
2. Exemptions
            The
right to inspect is subject to certain exemptions, which are narrowly
construed.  California State
University, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at 831.  The burden of demonstrating that exemptions
apply lies with the governmental entity. 
§7922.000.  Additionally, if a state or local agency discloses a public
record that is otherwise exempt to a member of the public, this disclosure
shall constitute a waiver of the applicable exemptions.  §7921.505(b).  This does not apply to disclosures (1) made through
legal proceedings or as otherwise required by law (§7921.505(c)(2)); (2) within the scope of disclosure of a statute that
limits disclosure of specified writings to certain purposes (§7921.505(c)(3)); or (3) made to a governmental agency that agrees to treat
the disclosed material as confidential (§7921.505(c)(5)).  
 
3. Enforcement
            A
CPRA claim to compel compliance with a public records request may proceed
through either mandamus or declaratory relief. 
§7923.000.  Because the petitioner
may proceed through either mandamus or declaratory relief, the trial court
independently decides whether disclosure is required.  See
City of San Jose v. Superior Court, (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1018
(appellate court independently reviews trial court CPRA decision).  No administrative record is required, and the
parties must submit admissible evidence.
            A
traditional writ of mandate under CCP section 1085 is the method of compelling
the performance of a legal, ministerial duty. 
Pomona Police Officers’ Assn. v. City of Pomona, (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 578, 583-84.  Generally,
mandamus will lie when (1) there is no plain, speedy, and adequate alternative
remedy, (2) the respondent has a duty to perform, and (3) the petitioner has a
clear and beneficial right to performance. 
Id. at 584 (internal citations omitted).  Whether a statute imposes a ministerial duty
for which mandamus is available, or a mere obligation to perform a
discretionary function, is a question of statutory interpretation.  AIDS Healthcare Foundation v. Los Angeles
County Dept. of Public Health, (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 693, 701.
            Whenever
it is made to appear, by verified petition to the superior court of the county
where the records or some part thereof are situated, that certain public
records are being improperly withheld from a member of the public, the court
shall order the officer or other person charged with withholding the records to
disclose those records or show cause why that person should not do so.  §7923.100. 
The court shall do so order after it has (a) examined the record in
camera, if so permitted by Evid. Code section 915(b); (b) examined the
papers filed by the parties; and (c) considered any oral argument and
additional evidence as the court may allow. 
§7923.105.
            If
the court finds that the public official’s decision to refuse disclosure is not
justified, the court shall order the public official to make the record
public.  §7923.110(a).  If the court finds that the public official
was justified in refusing to make the record public, the court shall return the
record to the public official without disclosing its content, together with an
order supporting the decision refusing disclosure.  §7923.110(b).
            If
the requestor prevails in such litigation, the court shall award court costs
and reasonable attorney’s fees, to be paid by the public agency at issue.  §7923.115(a). 
If the case was clearly frivolous, the court shall award court costs and
reasonable attorney’s fees to the public agency.  §7923.115(b).
            
C. Statement of Facts
             1. The County’s Evidence
            a.
Ryan’s August 15, 2022 Request and the County’s Response 
            On
August 15, 2022, Ryan served via email a request for records relating to Kwong.
Bolan Decl., ¶6; Bolan Decl., Ex. A.  Specifically,
Ryan requested all communications and documents (a) from Dr. Badkoobehi about Kwong
since July 1, 2021 (Request No. 1); (b) from Dr. Mahajan about Kwong, including
allegations of his improper behavior, since July 1, 2021 (Request No. 2); (c)

Department of Public Health’s June 14, 2022 statement relating to allegations
about its facilities or staff (Request No. 6). 
Bolan Decl., ¶18.   
            In
the same August 15, 2022 request, Ryan also requested all documents, including
notes, recordings and evidence collected, from all interviews that any County
employee conducted about allegations of improper activity by Kwong (Request No.
5).  Bolan Decl., ¶19.  
            On
October 12, 2022, the County responded to the August 15, 2022 requests.  Hashmall Supp. Decl., ¶3.  The County asserted the attorney-client
privilege exemption and provided legal authority supporting its position.  Hashmall Supp. Decl., ¶3.  
 
            b.
Ryan’s October 4, 2022 Request and the County’s Response 
            On
October 4, 2022, Ryan served additional CPRA requests relating to Kwong.  Bolan Decl., ¶20.  He requested all documents (a) indicating,
suggesting, implementing or notifying any County employees of Kwong’s
suspension in April 2022 (Request No. 1); and (b) referring to or identifying
the reasons for Kwong’s suspension (Request No. 2).  Bolan Decl., ¶20; Bolan Decl., Ex. B.  
            The
County, through outside counsel, responded to the requests on November 11,
2022.  Bolan Decl., ¶21; Bolan Decl., Ex.
C.  In its response, the County reviewed
why the requests relating to Kwong were exempt from disclosure under the CPRA.  Bolan Decl., ¶22.  The County stated that documents and
communications responsive to the requests were subject to the catch-all public
interest exemption, the deliberative process exemption, and the constitutional
right of privacy.  Bolan Decl., ¶22.  The County asserted the documents were also
protected from disclosure to the extent they contained attorney-client
privileged communications.  Bolan Decl., ¶23.  The County explained that “the CPRA has made
the attorney-client privilege applicable to public records.”  Bolan Decl., ¶23.  
            Ryan,
through his counsel, responded on November 21, 2022.  Bolan Decl., ¶24; Bolan Decl., Ex. D.  Ryan stated that he disagreed with the
County’s positions, including the County’s assertion of the attorney-client
privilege.  Bolan Decl., ¶25.  Ryan’s counsel wrote that “you assert the
attorney-client privilege, but you do not identify any communications which
would fall within that privilege.”  Bolan
Decl., ¶25.  
            The
County responded on December 5, 2022. 
Bolan Decl., ¶26; Bolan Decl., Ex. E. 
In its response, the County continued to assert the attorney-client
privilege.  Bolan Decl., ¶27. 
 
            c.
Ryan’s November 15, 2022 Request and the County’s Response 
            On
November 15, 2022, Ryan served a request for records relating to complaints
that Ryan filed with the County Intake Specialist Unit (“CISU”) in 2018, as
well as investigations by the County Equity Investigation Unit (“CEIU”).  Bolan Decl., ¶28; Bolan Decl., Ex. F.  Ryan requested all documents related to (a)
CISU matter number 2018-5003062, including notes, recordings, reports,
conclusions and recommendations (Request No. 1); and (b) CEIU matter number
2019-13746, including notes, recordings, reports, conclusions and recommendations
(Request No. 2).  Bolan Decl., ¶29.  Ryan also requested recordings, video and
audio of interviews conducted with three witnesses, as well as any other
related interviews (Request No. 3). 
Bolan Decl., ¶29.  
            The
County, through outside counsel, responded on December 6, 2022.  Bolan Decl., ¶30; Bolan Decl., Ex. G.  In its response, the County reviewed why the
requests relating to Ryan’s whistleblower allegations were exempt from
disclosure under the CPRA, and it cited law supporting its position.  Bolan Decl., ¶31.  The County stated that the requests were
subject to the catch-all exemption, the deliberative process exemption, and
were otherwise barred from disclosure by the official information and
preliminary drafts exemptions.  Bolan Decl.,
¶31.  The County also asserted that the attorney-client
privilege exempted the documents from disclosure.  Bolan Decl., ¶32.  
 
            d.
Ryan’s December 11, 2022 Request and the County’s Response 
            On
December 11, 2022, Ryan served a request for records relating to any
investigations of complaints against Ryan, by the County’s outside counsel.  Bolan Decl., ¶33; Bolan Decl., Ex. H.  Ryan requested (a) all documents related to
law firm Sheppard Mullin’s bills to the County relating to its 2018
investigation of allegations against Ryan (Request No. 1); (b) all documents,
reports, notes and findings created or collected in the course of the 2018
investigation (Request No. 2); (c) all communications to/from County employee
Tito Rodriguez and/or any County employee relating to the 2018 investigation
(Request Nos. 3 & 4); and (d) all communications relating to the 2018
investigation to/from Sheppard Mullin attorney, Robert Barker3 (Request No. 5).  Bolan Decl., ¶34.  
            The
County, through outside counsel, responded on February 7, 2023.  Bolan Decl., ¶35; Bolan Decl., Ex. I.  In its response, the County reviewed why the
requests relating to attorney work and communications involving allegations
against Ryan were exempt from disclosure under the CPRA and cited law
supporting its position.  Bolan Decl., ¶36.   The
County asserted the attorney-client communications and attorney work product
privileges.  Bolan Decl., ¶37. 
 
            e.
Ryan’s September 8, 2022 Request and the County’s Response 
            On
September 8, 2022, Ryan served a request for records relating to allegations of
theft and/or diversion of controlled substances at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.  Bolan Decl., ¶38; Bolan Decl., Ex. J.  Ryan requested (a) all reports,
correspondence and supporting documents relating to the discovery,
investigation, and reporting of the drug theft or diversion allegations
(Request No. 1); (b) any related allegations, complaints, or reports made to
the Board of Pharmacy (Request No. 2); and (c) all Sheriff Department records
relating to complaints, arrests, and charges against individuals alleged to be
involved in the diversion and/or theft of controlled substances at Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center between March 2015 and May 23, 2016 (Request No. 3).  Bolan Decl., ¶39.  
            The
County, through outside counsel, responded to the theft of controlled
substances requests on October 24, 2022. 
Bolan Decl., ¶40; Bolan Decl., Ex. K. 
In its response, the County reviewed why the requests were exempt from
disclosure under the CPRA, and it cited law supporting its position.  Bolan Decl., ¶41.  As with the other requests, the County stated
that the documents and communications responsive to the requests were subject
to multiple exemptions.  Bolan Decl., ¶41.  The County specifically referenced the
attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine no fewer than six
times in its response.  Bolan Decl., ¶41.  
 
            f.
Post-Petition Communications 
            On
March 16, 2023, Ryan filed the Petition. 
Bolan Decl., ¶42.  On June 23,
2023, Ryan’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter requesting the County too produce
a privilege log of documents withheld as to each CPRA request.  Bolan Decl., ¶44; Bolan Decl., Ex. N.  County’s counsel met and conferred with Ryan’s
counsel with respect to his request for a privilege log.  Bolan Decl., ¶45.  County’s counsel explained that the County
was not aware of any authority to compel a privilege log to be produced prior
to the merits hearing.  Bolan Decl., ¶45.

            Ryan
informed the court at the July 6, 2023 trial setting conference that he intended
to move the County to produce what is commonly called a “Vaughn Index.”  Bolan Decl., ¶46.  The court ordered the parties to submit short
briefing on any authority for a privilege log. 
Bolan Decl., ¶46; Bolan Decl., Ex. O, Ex. P.  
            At
the August 29, 2023 hearing, the court ruled “that a privilege log will not be
ordered before trial.”  Bolan Decl., ¶48.  The court’s minute order stated that Ryan
intended to conduct discovery on the exemptions.  Bolan Decl., ¶48.  
            Ryan
did not serve his Special Interrogatories, Set One, until October 23, 2024.  Bolan Decl., ¶49.  This included 28 special interrogatories.  Bolan Decl., ¶49.  The interrogatories only asked the County
about two categories of documents relating to Kwong: (1) records “indicating,
suggesting, implementing or notifying any [County] employee/officer/agent” that
the County had “not yet disclosed regarding Kwong’s suspension; and (2) records
that the County had not disclosed “referring to or identifying the reason(s)”
for Kwong’s suspension.  Bolan Decl., ¶49.  The Kwong-related special interrogatories
directly correspond with the two categories of documents set forth in Ryan’s
October 4, 2022 request.  Bolan Decl., ¶50.  The special interrogatories did not reference
the six other categories of documents identified in his prior August 15, 2022
request related to Kwong.  Bolan Decl., ¶50.  
            The
County responded to the special interrogatories, including the interrogatories
relating to Kwong, and stated that they sought information “protected by the
attorney-client privilege,” the “work product doctrine,” and catch-all
exemption, among others.  Bolan Decl., ¶51;
Bolan Decl., Ex. Q.  Ryan did not seek to
compel a further response to the County’s interrogatory responses.  Bolan Decl., ¶52.   
            Because
Ryan’s opening merits brief did not even mention the County’s assertion of
attorney-client privilege relating to the August 15, 2022 Kwong requests, and
did not specifically address any of the communications sought by the August 15,
2022 requests, the County’s counsel was under the impression that Ryan was not
challenging the County’s attorney-client privilege assertion as to those
records.  Bolan Decl., ¶54. 
            The
County filed its opposition merits brief on February 29, 2024.  Bolan Decl., ¶55.  The opposition focused on the exemptions that
were challenged in Ryan’s opening brief. 
Bolan Decl., ¶55.  The County
argued that it was entitled to withhold documents relating to Kwong based on
the constitutional right of privacy, the deliberative process and official
information exemptions, and the catch-all exemption, among other things.  Bolan Decl., ¶55.  The County further reiterated that “even just
affirming or denying Kwong’s employment and/or discipline status” would invade
“attorney-client privilege.”  Bolan Decl.,
¶56.  The County stated in its opposition
that it “cannot further expand on the issues of (1) burdens imposed by the
Requests, (2) attorney-client communications, or (3) attorney work product,
without divulging exempt information.” 
Bolan Decl., ¶56.  
            In
his reply, Ryan generally stated that the County had waived any exemptions that
it did not “respond to” in the opening brief. 
Bolan Decl., ¶57.  Ryan did not
mention that the County waived attorney-client privilege as to the requests
relating to Kwong.  Bolan Decl., ¶57.  
            
g. March 28, 2024 Hearing  
            A
hearing on the Petition was held on March 28, 2024.  Bolan Decl., ¶58.  Ahead of the hearing, the court issued a
tentative order granting in part, and denying in part, the Petition.  Bolan Decl., ¶58.  The court subsequently adopted its tentative
ruling as the final order, as “orally modified” at the hearing.  Bolan Decl., ¶58.  
            In
the court’s decision, the court addressed the catch-all, deliberative process
and information exemptions.  Bolan Decl.,
¶60.  The court’s decision states that
the “key issue” is the “ongoing nature of the investigations” of Kwong’s
misconduct.  Bolan Decl., ¶60.  Furthermore, the court’s decision held that
“[b]ased on the existing evidence,” the catch-all exemption applied.  Bolan Decl., ¶60.  
The decision does not state that the County waived
attorney-client privilege as to the requests relating to Kwong.  Bolan Decl., ¶61.  The only mention of waiver was in a footnote
where the court ruled the County had waived the personnel records, records of
investigation, and right to privacy exemptions. 
Bolan Decl., ¶61.   There was no
law or analysis supporting this finding of waiver and there was no analysis of
whether the County waived the attorney-client privilege.  Bolan Decl., ¶61.  
            In
addition, in the “Preliminary Issues” section of the decision—which addresses
all the requests—the order states that “the court will permit the County to
rely on the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work product doctrine
upon presentation of an adequate privilege log.”  Bolan Decl., ¶62.  The decision also directs the County to
produce a privilege log as to certain requests. 
Bolan Decl., ¶62.  
            At
no time during the March 28, 2024 hearing did County’s counsel believe the court
had made a ruling that the County waived attorney-client privilege relating to
the Kwong requests.  Bolan Decl., ¶63.  Neither Ryan’s counsel, nor the court, ever
addressed waiver of attorney-client privilege as to the Kwong requests during
the hearing.  Bolan Decl., ¶63.  
            After
the hearing, Ryan prepared a Notice of Ruling, but that notice does not clarify
how the court orally modified the tentative ruling.  Bolan Decl., ¶64.  The notice attaches the tentative ruling,
excerpts of the transcript, and the short minute order summarizing the hearing.  Bolan Decl., ¶64.  Nowhere did the notice or the attached
materials assert that the County waived the attorney-client privilege.  Bolan Decl., ¶64; Bolan Decl., Ex. V.  
 
            h.
The County’s Privilege Log 
            After
the March 28, 2024 hearing, the County worked to log the attorney-client
privileged communications responsive to the Kwong requests.  Bolan Decl., ¶65.  On May 30, 2024, the County prepared a letter
to Ryan and produced a draft privilege log, which included attorney-client
communications relating to the August 15, 2022 Kwong requests.  Bolan Decl., ¶66.  In total, the County withheld 136 emails
relating to the misconduct and investigation of Kwong, including 122 emails
from Harbor’s Chief Medical Officer to County Counsel, and four emails from Dr.
Badkoobehi to County Counsel.  Bolan Decl.,
¶66.  
            Ryan
sent a letter on July 6, 2024 challenging the sufficiency of the privilege log
and arguing the County had waived the privilege as to all communications
relating to Kwong, including those protected by the catch-all exemption.  Bolan Decl., ¶67; Bolan Decl., Ex. X.  County’s counsel was surprised to read that Ryan
believed the County had waived its sacrosanct attorney-client privilege after
producing an extensive draft privilege log. 
Bolan Decl., ¶67.  
 
            i.
The July 16, 2024 Hearing 
            The
parties appeared for a status conference with the court on July 16, 2024.  Bolan Decl., ¶68.  At the hearing, Ryan and the County expressed
their positions on the privilege log produced by the County.  Bolan Decl., ¶68.  For the first time, the court stated that its
finding of waiver encompassed communications relating to Kwong that were
subject to the attorney-client privilege. 
Bolan Decl., ¶68; Bolan Decl., Ex. Y. 
            County’s
counsel was surprised when the court ruled the County had waived its
attorney-client privilege over these requests. 
Bolan Decl., ¶69.  The County
never authorized it’s counsel to waive the attorney-client privilege as to any
of the CPRA requests, including the requests relating to Kwong.  Bolan Decl., ¶69.  Had County’s counsel understood that Ryan was
challenging the County’s assertion of privilege over emails and other
communications, they would have taken on this issue directly in the County’s opposition
brief.  Bolan Decl., ¶69.  
 
2. Ryan’s Evidence 
            a.
The Privilege Log Issue
Ryan requested that the County provide a privilege log and his
counsel explained in a June 23, 2023, letter the particular need for a log
given the County’s blanket denials.  Field
Decl., Ex. C.  The County declined to
provide a privilege log.  Field Decl., ¶4.  The court directed the parties to meet and
confer about the possibility of producing a privilege log in person, and the
parties did so.  Field Decl., ¶4.  At the meet and confer session, the County refused
to reconsider its exemption claims and its decision not to provide a privilege
log to Ryan.  Field Decl., ¶4.  
The parties then briefed whether a privilege log should be
ordered, and the court declined to order a log. 
Field Decl., ¶4.  Instead, it
authorized Ryan to propound a limited set of interrogatories to try to learn
more about the County’s exemption claims. 
Field Decl., ¶4.  Ryan did so.  Field Decl., ¶4.  The County’s answers were uninformative.  Field Decl., ¶4.  Rather than continuing to debate the issue, Ryan
elected to proceed to merits briefing.  Field
Decl., ¶4.  
 
b. The March 28, 2024 Trial 
At the merits hearing, Ryan advocated that the court’s
tentative ruling should be revised to require the disclosure of many of the
records sought in the August 15, 2022 request on the grounds that the catch-all
exemption did not apply across the board. 
Field Decl., Ex. D.  The court
agreed as to five categories of records sought in the August 15, 2022 request,
holding that it will “modify the tentative to require disclosure of 1, 2, 3, 4,
6 in the Kwong Request…and so those are ordered to be produced.”  Field Decl., Ex. D.  
Ryan served the Notice of Entry of Order memorializing the court’s
merits ruling in this case on April 19, 2024. Field Decl., Ex. A.  
In response to the court’s merits ruling, the County
produced a privilege log for one of the two requests directed by the court, but
not the other.  Field Decl., ¶6.  Further, the County asserted, in an
additional privilege log, the attorney-client privilege and work product
doctrine as to many records responsive to categories 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 of Ryan’s
August 15, 2022 request despite the court’s merits ruling.  Field Decl., ¶6.  
On July 6, 2024, Ryan’s counsel sent a letter to the County’s
counsel explaining the court’s merits ruling and demanding that the County
comply.  Field Decl., ¶6.  
 
D. The Motion for Reconsideration
The County moves for reconsideration of the court’s
order holding that it waived the attorney-client privilege exemption.
 
1. Applicable Law
Code of Civil Procedure[3]
section 1008(a) provides for reconsideration of court orders.  Section 1008(a)’s motion to reconsider is
broad in scope and allows any party affected by the order to seek
reconsideration and modification, amendment, or vacation of prior orders.  Relief under section 1008(a) is strictly
limited.  Motions to reconsider must be
brought within ten days of service of written notice of the original
order.  
A motion for reconsideration constitutes the exclusive means
for a party seeking modification, amendment or revocation of an order.  Morite of Calif. v. Superior Court,
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 485, 490.  To be
entitled to reconsideration, a party must show (1) new or different facts, circumstances,
or law, and (2) a satisfactory explanation for failing to produce such evidence
earlier.  Kalivas v. Barry Controls
Corp., (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1160-61. 
The requirement of satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the
evidence earlier can only be described as a strict requirement of
diligence.  Garcia v. Hejmadi
(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690.  A motion
for reconsideration cannot be granted on the ground that the court misapplied
the law in its initial ruling.  Gilberd
v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.
Apart from the parties, the court has inherent power to
reconsider its rulings in a particular case for any reason.  Darling, Hall & Rae v. Kritt,
(1999) 75 Cal.App. 4th 1148. 
The court may even entertain suggestions from the parties for such sua
sponte reconsideration.  However, the
inherent power to reconsider, unlike the power under section 1008, is entirely
up to the court.  Other than a
“suggestion,” the court need not, and will not, entertain argument from a party
as to why it should exercise this inherent power.  
 
2. Analysis
            A
motion to reconsider is a two-part analysis: (1) whether the court should
reconsider and (2) if so, the merits of the reconsideration.  
            
a. The County’s Counsel Wrongly Believed It Did Not
Have to Raise an Exemption for the March 28, 2024 Merits Hearing
The County argues that the
parties’ correspondence, pleadings, and discovery responses spanning 17 months
show that it consistently asserted the attorney-client privilege.  Bolan Decl., ¶¶ 21-23, 26-27, 30-32, 35, 37,
40-41, Exs. C, E, G, I, K; Supp. Hashmall Decl., Ex. 3).   Declarations from the County’s internal and
external counsel affirm that there was never a decision to waive the
attorney-client privilege.  Mathers
Decl., ¶ 9; Bolan Decl., ¶¶ 5, 69; Hashmall Decl., ¶6.  Reply at 7.
In preparing its opposition for the merits hearing, the
County’s counsel mistakenly understood that Ryan
was no longer contesting the County’s attorney-client privilege exemption.  Bolan Decl., ¶¶ 8-9, 12, 53-54.  Ryan’s opening brief in support of his
Petition challenged the County’s assertion of the official information,
deliberative process, and catch-all exemptions to the Kwong Requests without
addressing the County’s other asserted exemptions, including attorney-client
privilege.  Because Ryan’s brief did not
challenge the County’s attorney-client privilege exemption as to the Kwong
Requests, the County believed he was no longer contesting the exemption based
on attorney-client privilege.  Thus, the
County’s opposition focused on only the contested exemptions for the Kwong
Requests, and its understanding that Ryan had narrowed the requests.  Mot. at 10.
This was an error. 
The County bore the burden of proving any exemption to the Kwong
Requests.  See Cal. State Univ. Fresno v. Superior Court, (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 810, 831. Ryan
had no obligation to raise any challenge to an exemption in his opening brief and
the County could not reasonably rely on the scope of Ryan’s opening brief to conclude
that a portion of the requested Kwong-related documents were exempt under the attorney-client
privilege.  Ryan was seeking the
disclosure of documents pursuant to the Kwong Requests.  If it did not want to produce them, the
County had the burden of showing they were exempt, whether under the
attorney-client privilege or any other ground for exemption.
Further, Ryan shows that his opening trial brief generally did
raise the attorney-client privilege issue. 
In his Introduction, he flagged “the
attorney-client privilege, Gov. Code § 7927.705; Evid. Code § 954” and “the
attorney work product doctrine, Gov. Code § 7927.705; Civ. Proc. Code §§
2018.020, 2018.030” as two of the “five exemptions” the County had “primarily
assert[ed]” in attempting to justify nondisclosure.  Fields Decl., Ex. B, p. 2.  He then argued: “These exemptions do not, and
cannot, justify the County’s blanket denial of all of the requests in this
case”.  Ex. B, p. 2.  Ryan added that “the County has not proven
the attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine, Gov. Code §
7927.705; Civ. Proc. Code §§ 2018.020, 2018.030; Evid. Code § 954, justify
nondisclosure. (E.g., Caldecott v. Superior Court, (2015) 243
Cal.App.4th 212, 227.)”  Ex. B, p.
3.  Finally, Ryan devoted a half page to
a general argument against an exemption for attorney-client privilege and work
product doctrine.  Ex. B, p. 14.  
 
b. The County’s Counsel Made a Second Mistake in
Misunderstanding the Court’s March 28, 2024 Ruling
The County made a second mistake
in misinterpreting the court’s ruling from the March 28, 2024 merits
hearing.  The court addressed Ryan’s
Petition in a tentative issued for the hearing.   Under the heading “Preliminary Issues”, the
court ruled on the exemptions that were at issue:
 
“The burden of demonstrating that exemptions apply lies
with the governmental entity.  §7922.000;
Cal. State Univ. Fresno v. Superior
Court, (“CSU Fresno”)
(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 810, 831.  In
denying the five Requests and in pre-lawsuit correspondence, the County cited a
litany of statutes and exemptions.  See
Pet. Op. Br. at 15, n. 5.  The
County’s opposition does not rely on many of these previously raised
exemptions.  
For the Kwong Requests, the County asserts the catch-all
exemption (§7922.000), the deliberative
process doctrine, and the official information privilege (Evid. Code §1040). 

For the Retaliation
Requests, the County asserts the catch-all exemption (§7922.000), the deliberative process doctrine,
the official information privilege (Evid. Code
§1040), the attorney-client privilege, and the attorney work product
doctrine.  
For the Drug Theft Requests, the County asserts the peer
review privilege. Evid. Code §1157).  
Because the County asserts
only these exemptions, all others are waived.[4]  See Evans
v. Centerstone Development Co., (2005) 134 Cal. App. 4th 151, 165 (issues
not fully or properly briefed are waived).”
 
The court adopted this tentative
as its order with modifications inapplicable to the attorney-client privilege
for the Kwong Requests.  Despite the
County’s argument to the contrary, the court’s ruling was clear.  The court explained that the County had the
affirmative burden to raise and proof its objections, it raised a myriad of
objections to different requests, and for the Kwong Requests, the County
asserted the catch-all exemption (§7922.000),
the deliberative process doctrine, and the official information privilege (Evid. Code §1040). 
It did not assert attorney-client privilege.  In contrast, the County did assert
attorney-client privilege for the Retaliation Requests.  Therefore, any exemptions for the Kwong
Requests other than those asserted were waived, including attorney-client
privilege.
The
County’s consistent assertion of attorney-client privilege for the Kwong
Requests in the parties’ correspondence and discovery responses supports
its position that it mistakenly failed to assert the attorney-client privilege
to the Kwong Requests, but it does not excuse the County’s failure.  As the court’s tentative stated, the County
relied on a litany of statutes and exemptions before the trial.  As a result, the County had to make tactical
choices about which exemptions to rely upon and prove for its merits opposition.  It chose to assert attorney-client privilege
for the Retaliation Requests but did not do so for the Kwong Requests.  Both Ryan and the court were entitled to conclude
that the County was not asserting attorney-client privilege for the Kwong
Requests. 
County
Counsel’s failure to understand the plain language of the court’s March 28
ruling was counsel’s second mistake, and the County’s profession of surprise
when the court stated at the July 16, 2024 hearing that the attorney-client
privilege had been waived for the Kwong Requests was unreasonable.  See Bolan Decl., ¶69.
 
c. The Motion to Reconsider Is Untimely
The County’s double error has repercussions for its motion
to reconsider.  Section 1008(a) expressly
states that the ten-day period for a motion to reconsider is triggered by the
notice of entry of the order.  The
purpose of the statute is to assure a ten-day period from notice of the ruling
to make a motion to reconsider.  See Forrest v. Department of
Corporations, (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 183, 203, disapproved on other grnds in Shalant
v. Girardi, (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1164, 1172.  
The court’s March 28 order required Ryan to give
notice.  The court file reflects that Ryan’s
counsel did so on April 19, 2024.  The
County filed its motion to reconsider four months later, on August 23,
2024.  Plainly, the motion is untimely.
The County argues that it timely moved for reconsideration
within ten days of the notice of ruling from the July 16, 2024 status
conference.   See Hashmall Decl.,
Ex. 2.  The County notes that there is no
language in the March 28 ruling, the hearing transcript, or the minute order expressly
stating that the County had waived the attorney-client privilege for the Kwong
Requests.  It was not until the July 16,
2024 hearing that the court stated, for the first time, that the County waived the
attorney-client privilege.  Reply at 9.
The operative date for the motion to reconsider is the March
28 date of the court’s ruling.  The
County’s mistakes do not entitle it to seek reconsideration of the court
statements at a later status conference. 
The County also argues that the court can always reconsider
an interim order on its own motion, regardless of whether the timing
requirements of section 1008 are met.  Le
Francois v. Goel, (2005) 35 Cal. 4th 1094, 1096-97, 1108.  Reply at 9. 
True, and the court declines to do so.
The motion for reconsideration is
denied as untimely.
 
d. New or Different Facts,
Circumstances, or Law That Could Not Have Been Presented in the Exercise of
Diligence
Ryan argues that the County has not shown that the motion is supported
by any qualifying new or different facts, circumstances, or law.  The County spends pages discussing how the
attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine can and cannot be waived
and contends that the court’s waiver finding was in error.  Even if the County were correct, that would
not justify granting the motion. The legal authorities relied upon by the
County pre-date the court’s March 28 ruling, so they are not new or different.  See Baldwin v.. Home Savings of
America, (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 1192, 1196 (motion to reconsider relied on law that could have been
provided to trial court for its initial ruling).  To the extent the County contends that the
relevant new or different fact or circumstance is its realization that its
attorney-client privilege and work product exemption claims for the Kwong
Requests were at issue, that does not qualify.  The County cannot show that it could not, with
reasonable diligence, have discovered the waiver issue or addressed it for the
court’s merits ruling on March 28.  Op.
at 9-10.
The County replies that it has
presented new or different facts, circumstances, or law because its motion is
based on the law governing waiver of the attorney-client privilege.  Had the law governing waiver been considered,
the outcome would have been different because the County’s failure to invoke
the attorney-client privilege was caused by outside the County’s attorney’s mistaken
understanding that Ryan was no longer contesting the County’s attorney-client
privilege exemption.  Bolan Decl., ¶¶
8-9, 12, 53-54.  Under the CPRA, there is
no waiver of attorney-client privilege through inadvertence or accident by
outside counsel.  Ardon v. City of Los
Angeles, 62 Cal. 4th 1176, 1189), and none of the three narrow grounds for
establishing a waiver were met here.  Reply
at 6-7.
The court accepts that the
County is relying on a new issue concerning the law concerning attorney-client
privilege waiver.
The second requirement for
reconsideration is due diligence – that is, why the County did not present this
new issue earlier.  The County argues
that its attorney reasonably believed Ryan was not challenging the County’s
assertion of the attorney-client privilege. 
Its counsel did not sit idly by and was not derelict.  The County promptly moved for relief after
the court announced, for the first time, that the County had waived the
attorney-client privilege exemption.  Reply
at 8.
The County argues that it was
not ignorant about the law.  Rather, the
County believed that Ryan and his counsel had narrowed the scope of the
requests, which as the court observed, happens “all the time” in CPRA
matters.  Bolan Decl., Ex. Y, p. 19.
Nothing in Ryan’s opening brief specifically challenged the attorney-client
privilege exemption for the Kwong Requests. 
Instead, his opening brief made only vague, conclusory references to the
privilege exemption generally.  More
importantly, Ryan did not address the attorney-client privilege exemption in
his oral argument about the Kwong Requests. 
The court’s ruling also did not address attorney-client privilege or
otherwise state that the County waived that privilege.  Reply at 8-9.
The County has not been diligent
in presenting and proving the attorney-client privilege exemption.  It also has not been diligent in reviewing
and understanding the court’s March 28 ruling. 
Once the County understood on July 16 that the privilege had been
waived, it was diligent in presenting the law and its arguments why it did not
waive the issue.  But this does not
suffice.  Because the County failed to
act between March 28 and July 16, it has not diligently presented its arguments
on waiver.  This is a second reason to
deny the motion for reconsideration.
 
e. Merits
If, arguendo, the court
were to reconsider, the motion would be denied. 
The County argues that it did not waive its attorney-client privilege for
the Kwong Requests for three reasons. 
First, the County’s Board of Supervisors
holds the privilege, not outside counsel. 
Mathers Decl., ¶7; Bolan Decl., ¶5; Hashmall Decl., ¶6, Ex. 1 (County
Charter art. VI, §21).  Only the Board
can waive privilege and it indisputably did not do so.  The court’s waiver ruling presumes,
incorrectly, that counsel can inadvertently waive the County’s privilege.  See Bice v. Stevens, (1958)
160 Cal. App. 2d 222, 232 (“[w]ithout his client’s free and intelligent
consent, after full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances, an attorney
may not surrender any substantial right of his client[.]”).  Mot. at 17.
Second, case law recognizes that
the attorney-client privilege can only be waived in three ways: (1) disclosure
of “a privileged communication in a nonconfidential context”; (2) failure
“to claim the privilege in a proceeding in which the holder has the legal
standing and opportunity to do so”; and (3) failure “to assert the
privilege in a timely response to an inspection demand.”  Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior
Court, (“Catalina Yacht Club”) (2015) 242 Cal. App. 4th 1116,
1126.  The first and third non-starters.  There was no disclosure of attorney-client
communications and there is no issue whether the County timely responded to
discovery.  Mot.. at 16, 17.
The second circumstance also
does not exist because the County did not fail to claim the attorney-client privilege.  On the contrary, it consistently asserted the
privilege in its correspondence with Ryan, its answer to the Petition, and
discovery responses.  The County only
failed to address the attorney-client privilege for the Kwong Requests in its
merits opposition because it believed that Ryan—based on his opening brief and
prior discovery—was not challenging the attorney-client privilege
exemption.  Mot. at 17.
Third, even if the County were
incorrect about whether Ryan was contesting the privilege exemption, the law is
clear that mistake or inadvertence of counsel is not enough to support a
finding of waiver.  Ardon v. City of
Los Angeles, supra, 62 Cal. 4th at 1182.  Other CPRA cases reject waiver of
attorney-client privilege based on the mistakes or strategic missteps of
counsel.  City of Los Angeles v.
Superior Court, (“City of Los Angeles”) (2017) 9 Cal. App. 5th 272,
292-94 (rejecting that city waived attorney-client privilege when it employed
the ‘“risky tactic’” of challenging applicability of Discovery Act and not
enumerating specific objections).  Mot.
at 18.
The County is wrong.  Its waiver of attorney-client privilege is
not based on inadvertent disclosure but rather the failure to claim it. The
fact that the County may have consistently asserted the privilege in its
correspondence with Ryan, its answer to the Petition, and in discovery
responses does not excuse the fact that it failed to claim the exemption in its
merits opposition and at trial.
Ryan correctly notes (Opp. at
11) that, under Evidence Code section 912(a), “Consent to disclosure”
sufficient to waive the attorney-client privilege “is manifested by any
statement or other conduct of the holder of the privilege indicating consent to
the disclosure, including failure
to claim the privilege in any proceeding in which the holder has legal standing
and the opportunity to claim the privilege.” (emphasis added); Catalina Island Yacht Club, supra, 242
Cal.App.4th at 1126 (waiver occurs for failure “to claim the privilege in a
proceeding in which the holder has the legal standing and opportunity to do
so.”).  That is exactly why the County
waived the privilege.  
The only case cited by the County that has any bearing on this issue, City
of Los Angeles, supra, 9
Cal.App.5th at 292-94, is distinguishable. There, the city objected in response
to real party-in-interest’s discovery requests that the Civil Discovery Act does
not apply in a CPRA case.  Id. at
280.  The appellate court decided
otherwise.  Id. at 290.  The real party argued that the city had
waived the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine by not objecting
on privilege grounds.  Id. at 280.  The appellate court
held that the city did not waive those privileges objections under the unusual
circumstances of that case.  Id. at 292-94.  
In effect, the city’s blanket
position in City of Los Angeles that no discovery could be taken in a
CPRA case covered the city’s subsequent assertion of exemptions based on attorney-client
privilege and attorney work product.  The
County’s failure to assert and prove attorney-client privilege for the Kwong
Requests has no such blanket protection. 
 
f. Conclusion
The motion for reconsideration
is denied, both procedurally and on the merits.
 
E. The Section 473(b)
Motion
Alternatively, the County moves
for relief under section 473(b).
 
1. Applicable Law
A trial court has discretion to
relieve a party “from a judgment, dismissal, order or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.”  §473(b).  Although the mandatory prong of section
473(b) based on an attorney declaration of fault requires a judgment or
default, the discretionary prong “applies to any judgment, dismissal,
order, or other proceeding”.  Zamora
v. Clayborn Contracting Grp., Inc., (2002) 28 Cal. 4th 249, 254 (emphasis
in original); Henderson v. Pac. Gas & Elec. Co., (2010) 187 Cal.
App. 4th 215, 229.
To obtain discretionary relief
under section 473(b), the moving party must show (1) that it timely moved
for relief, and (2) had one or more valid grounds for relief.  Henderson v. Pac. Gas & Elec. Co.,
supra, 187 Cal. App. 4th at 229.  The
motion must be made within a reasonable time not to exceed six months after the
judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding.” 
§473(b).  The moving party must also show diligence in promptly making
a section 473(a) motion. Id; Stafford v. Mach, (1998) 64
Cal.App.4th 1174, 1183-84.
The grounds for relief are
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  To
determine whether the mistake or neglect identified by the moving party was
excusable, “the court inquires whether ‘a reasonably prudent person under the
same or similar circumstances’ might have made the same error.” Garcia v. Hejmadi, (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 674, 682 (quoting Bettencourt
v. Los Rios Community College Dist., (1986) 42 Cal.3d 270, 276).  “Conduct
falling below the professional standard of care, such as failure to timely
object or to properly advance an argument, is not therefore excusable.”  Ibid.  The moving
party bears the burden of proof.  Ibid. 
 
2. Merits
The County argues that its motion
is timely because it was made within days of service of the notice of ruling on
the July 16 status conference.  Mot. at
2. Ryan responds that the County delayed in raising this issue for more than
four months after service of the April 19, 2024 notice of order and has not
explained this delay.  Opp. at 14.
The court need not resolve this
issue, or the procedural issue of whether the County attached a proposed pleading
as required by section 473(b).  Opp. at
14-15; Reply at 12-13.   This because the
County’s neglect is not excusable.  As
stated ante, the County’s counsel made two errors for the
attorney-client privilege exemption for the Kwong Requests: (a) counsel failed
to raise and prove the exemption for the March 28 trial even though the County
had the burden of proof and (b) counsel failed to read and understand the
court’s March 28 ruling even though the meaning was plain.
As Ryan argues (Opp. at 13), a
reasonable attorney would have understood that, to justify withholding records
in response to the Kwong Requests, it was necessary that the County prove the
attorney-client privilege exemption applied. 
The County has shown that it was surprised and made a mistake, but that
is insufficient to justify relief.   Under
section 473(b), surprise must involve “some condition or situation in which a
party … is unexpectedly placed to his injury, without any default or negligence
of his own, which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against.”  Credit
Managers Ass'n of Southern Calif. v. National Independent Business Alliance, (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 1166, 1173.  Similarly, a mistake cannot be “simply the result of
professional incompetence, general ignorance of the law, or unjustifiable
negligence in discovering the law.”  Hearn v. Howard, (2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 1193, 1206; Toho-Towa Co., Ltd. v. Morgan Creek Productions,
Inc. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1111-12 (no relief for mistake of law based on attorney’s
failure to submit evidence in opposition to motion).  Excusable neglect also turns on reasonableness and “excludes conduct falling
below the professional standard of care, such as failure to timely object or to
properly advance an argument.”  Garcia v.
Hejmadi, supra, 58 Cal.App.4th at 682.  A
reasonable attorney exercising diligence would not have made the errors made by
the County’s counsel.
 
3. Conclusion
The section 473(b) motion is denied.
 
F. The Motion to Clarify
The County argues that the court
should clarify that the catch-all exemption applies to the Kwong emails.  Mot. at 23. 
Ryan responds that the County’s request for clarification is really a
second request for the court to reconsider its March 28, 2024 merits ruling.  Opp. at 15.
It is true that a motion for
clarification is subject to the same legal standard as a motion for
reconsideration.  Lennar Homes of
Cal., Inc. v. Stephens, (2014) 232 Cal. App. 4th 673, 681-82.  The court has denied the County’s motion for
reconsideration.  Nonetheless, there is a
material difference between seeking reconsideration  of a ruling and clarifying it.  Where there is confusion about a ruling, the
court should clarify it.
The County argues that the catch-all
exemption allows governments to withhold records if they can demonstrate “on
the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing
the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the
record.”  Govt. Code §7922.000.  Non-disclosure of employee investigative
materials promotes effective government and participation in
investigations.  See Johnson v.
Winter, (1982) 127 Cal. App. 3d 435, 439 (non-disclosure of employee
investigation file “serves the public interest”).  Mot. at 23.
The overwhelming majority, if
not all, of the 136 attorney-client privileged emails responsive to the Kwong
Requests fit within the catch-all exemption. 
Mathers Decl., ¶6.  The emails
discuss the investigations into the allegations against Kwong, including the
evidence of misconduct, witnesses, the investigation by outside counsel, and
investigations of Kwong by regulatory agencies. 
Mathers Decl., ¶¶ 5, 6; Hashmall Decl. ¶¶ 8-9.  The emails fit the catch-all exemption: their
disclosure would reveal highly confidential, investigative materials and
statements made while the investigations were ongoing, and would hinder the
County’s ability to assure confidentiality for future investigations.  See Wilson v. Superior Court, (1996)
51 Cal. App. 4th 1136, 1143-44 (no disclosure of employee applications; it
would have chilling effect on applications and a negative impact on government
decision-making).  Mot. at 24.
The County argues that it has
consistently asserted the catch-all exemption regarding the Kwong
Requests.  As Catherine Mathers, the
Director of Risk Management for the County’s Department of Public Health,
explains: “The County intentionally fosters a culture in which candid
consultation with County Counsel on pending employee investigations is the
norm,” adding that disclosure would undercut the public’s interest “in an
efficient, effective, and robust investigative process.”  Mathers Decl., ¶12.a.  Mot. at 24.
It is not clear why the County
argues the merits of the catch-all exemption. 
The County only seeks clarification of the court’s previous ruling which
does not require any party or the court to readdress the merits of such
exemption.
According to the County, the court
ruled that the catch-all exemption applies to documents related to the ongoing
investigation of Kwong.  Bolan Decl., Ex.
Y, p. 29.  The court’s waiver ruling does
not change that.  While the court has
indicated the exemption applies (Bolan Decl., Ex. Y, p. 29), Ryan is asserting
that all emails responsive to the Kwong Requests must be produced.  Bolan Decl., Ex. X.  The court should clarify that, to the extent
that a privileged document is subject to the catch-all exemption, the County
can withhold it notwithstanding the waiver ruling.  Mot. at 23-24.
The court’s March 28 tentative ruled that, while the pending
nature of the Kwong investigation at the time of the Requests is not
dispositive under Bakersfield/ AFSCME, it is an important
factor and the evidence before the court was insufficient to constitute
reasonable cause that the allegations against Kwong are well founded.  The pending nature of the investigation also
meant that there would be few or no records for the court to review in
camera.  To ensure that Ryan has not
overcome the catch-all exemption, the court would inquire of the County
whether any portion of the Kwong investigation was available -- such as written
witness interviews -- on the November 11, 2022 date the Kwong Requests were
denied.  If so, the court might consider
reviewing them in camera.  Based on the existing evidence, however, the
catch-all exemption applies to the Kwong Requests.[5]
At the March 28 hearing, Ryan advocated that the tentative
ruling should be revised to require the disclosure of many of the records
sought in the August 15, 2022 request on the grounds that the catch-all
exemption did not apply across the board. 
Field Decl., Ex. D, p. 11-16.  The
court agreed and orally modified its tentative to rule that the catch-all
exemption does not apply or justify nondisclosure of categories 1, 2, 3, 4, and
6 of the August 15, 2022 request in this case: 
“I’m going to modify the tentative to require disclosure of 1, 2, 3, 4,
6 in the Kwong Request. . . . and so those are ordered to be produced.”  Field Decl., Ex. D, p. 56.  As to the remaining Kwong records, the court
held, as to “5 and the October 4th” – i.e., category 5 of the August 15,
2022 request and the entirety of the October 4, 2022 request – “I am sticking
by my ruling that the catch-all covers them unless there is a basis not to.”  Field Decl., Ex. D, p 56.  The court’s March 28 minute order is to the
same effect.
The County replies that the court did not find that the
catch-all does not apply to these requests. 
To the contrary, it invited the County to submit further briefing on the
exemption, subsequently ruling that the investigation of Kwong was still
ongoing through November 2022.  Bolan
Decl., Ex. V, p. 316 (March 28 minute order).[6]  Reply at 13.
The County raised this apparent discrepancy at the July 16,
2024 hearing.  In response, the court
indicated the catch-all exemption was in play and did apply to the Kwong
Requests—specifically, numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 in the August 5, 2022
requests:  
 
·        
THE
COURT:  “And that ruling is for the Kwong
requests we have a catch-all, delivery process and official information.  We do not have attorney-client
privilege.”  Bolan Decl., Ex. Y, p. 25.
·        
THE
COURT:  “This issue had been resolved.
And you are correct: You do not have to produce the Kwong documents unless for
some reason the catch-all doesn’t apply. 
Right?”  Bolan Decl., Ex. Y, p. 29.
      The County concludes that Ryan cannot
square his argument with these statements. 
Reply at 14.
Ryan is correct.  At the March 28 trial, his counsel argued
that the Kwong Requests should not be covered by the catch-all because the
County had not made a specific showing concerning the requested records. Ex. D,
p. 12.  Most of  the categories in the August 15 Requests
would not have an adverse impact on an investigation if disclosed.  Ex. D, p.14. 
The County’s blanket claim could not justify withholding every
responsive record.  Ex. D, p. 15.  The court stated that it tended to agree
because it had been focusing the catch-all analysis on an investigation of
Kwong, which is category 5.  Ex. D, p. 16-17.  But categories 1, 2, 4, and 6 did not have
the same public interest.   Ex. d, p.
17.  Consequently, the court ordered
categories 1, 2, 4, and 6 to be produced. 
Ex. D, pp, 25, 56.  There was no
qualification of this order.
The July 16 status
conference concerned the issue of in camera review.  Bolan Decl., Ex. Y, p. 344.  When Ryan’s counsel brought up the scope of
category 5 to include other investigations (Ex. Y, pp. 343-44), the court
declined to expand the scope of its previous ruling absent a showing that the
parties had discussed a broader view of “investigation”.  Ex. Y, p. 347, 351-53, 354-55.[7]  
Ryan’s counsel then brought up the fact that the County had
produced a privilege log asserting attorney-client and work product privileges
to categories 1, 2, 4, and 6.  Ex. Y, p.
357.  The court stated that it would not
back up; it had made its ruling on March 28. 
 And that ruling is for the Kwong
requests we have a catch-all, delivery process and official information.  We do not have attorney-client
privilege.”  Bolan Decl., Ex. Y, p. 25.  The court added that [the attorney-client
privilege issue “had been resolved.  And
you are correct: You do not have to produce the Kwong documents unless for some
reason the catch-all doesn’t apply.”  Ex.
Y, p. 362.
Contrary to the County’s argument, the court’s reference to
the catch-all was the catch-all for category 5. 
The court made no modification of the March 28 ruling on categories 1,
2, 4, and 6.  In fact, the court
expressed lack of recollection as to certain things ordered to be produced (Ex.
Y, p. 363-64) and inquired of Ryan’s counsel whether its March 28 ruling on
those categories was written or oral, receiving verification that it was oral.
Ex. Y, pp. 364-65.
The motion for clarification is granted in the sense that
the court confirms that the catch-all exemption does not apply to categories 1,
2, 4, and 6 of the August 15, 2022 requests.
 
F. Conclusion
The motion for reconsideration and section 473(b) relief
from default are denied.  The court
clarifies that the catch-all exemption does not apply to categories 1, 2, 4,
and 6.
