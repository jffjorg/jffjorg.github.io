[1] Tenant
failed to provide a courtesy copy of its opposition in violation of the
Presiding Judge’s First Amended Order Re: Electronic Filing.  Tenant’s counsel is admonished to follow this
order in all future filings.  One of the
opposition documents, the Declaration of Jeremy A. Rhyne, is 247 pages
long.  The court has exercised its
discretion to read and consider only the declaration and not its supporting
exhibits.


[2]
The court has ruled on Tenant’s written evidentiary objections.  All of Tenant’s objections to the two Gomez
declarations were overruled.  The clerk
is ordered to scan and electronically file the rulings.


[3]
Landlord provides evidence that this amount has increased to $1,000,920.78
since the January date the application was filed but Landlord is limited to the
amount sought in the application.  See
Gomez Supp. Decl., Chart B.


[4]
The court is not adding in the rent and charges accrued since January 2024
because it is not part of the moving papers. 
Tenant gets the benefit of the more accurate reconciliation but does not
have to suffer attachment of assets for rent incurred after the application.
