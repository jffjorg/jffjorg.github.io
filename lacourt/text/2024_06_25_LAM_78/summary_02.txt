And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by Defendant Ford Motor Company to the complaint filed by Plaintiffs Felix Rivera, et al. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of express and implied warranty, and that the complaint is barred by the statute of limitations. The Judge sustains the demurrer as to the first through fourth causes of action for breach of express warranty, finding that the complaint fails to allege that the defects appeared within the express warranty period. The Judge overrules the demurrer as to the sixth cause of action for fraudulent inducement, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleges a duty to disclose and a breach of that duty.

The Judge grants leave to amend as to the first through third causes of action for breach of express warranty, allowing Plaintiffs to cure the defects in their pleading. The Judge denies leave to amend as to the cause of action for breach of implied warranty, finding that the complaint is barred by the statute of limitations.

The Judge's ruling also addresses the economic loss rule, finding that it does not apply to the Plaintiffs' claim for fraudulent inducement. The Judge also discusses the duty to disclose and the relationship between the parties, finding that a duty to disclose arises where there is a transactional relationship between the parties.
