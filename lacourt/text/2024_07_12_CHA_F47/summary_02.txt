And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendant Luis Rojas to the entire complaint filed by plaintiff Martha Cuevas. Rojas argued that the complaint fails to identify the actual owner of the dog, the address or location from which the dog escaped, and who had control of the dog. However, the judge found that the complaint adequately alleges that Rojas was one of the owners of the dog and that the dog escaped from their property. The judge overruled the demurrer and ordered Rojas to file an answer to the complaint within 20 days.
