The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees in part and denied it in part. The plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees as the prevailing party in the case. The judge has reduced the amount of attorney fees requested by 25% due to excessive and vague billing entries. The plaintiff's request for expert fees is denied because the attorney's fee provisions in the lease and guaranty do not cover expert fees. The total amount of attorney fees awarded is $49,157.81.
