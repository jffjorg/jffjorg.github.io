 Case Number:  24VECV00780    Hearing Date:   November 18, 2024    Dept:  T 24VECV00780
FEIGENBAUM V LOGUIDICE

Tentative ruling: Motions to compel – Denied.  To the extent that plaintiff seeks an order
on any of the discovery, he failed to attach a copy of any of the discovery and
any responses to the discovery.  He also
failed to file his motion to compel further responses within 45 days of
the response and without a written stipulation to extend the time, such a
motion is untimely.  On a motion to compel
a further response, he failed to submit a Separate Statement which is required
by California Rules of Court 3.1345. 
Finally, supplemental interrogatories cannot be a repeat of the same
interrogatories already served.  CCP
section 2030.070 states that a supplemental interrogatory may be propounded “to
elicit any later acquired information bearing on all answers previously made by
any party in response to interrogatories.” 
The statute does not allow the service of the same interrogatories.  For all of these failures, the motions to compel
filed on 9/20/2024 are denied.
