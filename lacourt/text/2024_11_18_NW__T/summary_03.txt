And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the case between Tariz Jabaiti and Armita Amini as plaintiffs, and State Farm General Insurance Company as the defendant. The defendant demurred to the second amended complaint, arguing that the second cause of action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing is insufficiently pled. The judge disagreed, finding that the new factual allegations highlight a claim of bias, including allegations that the defendant's expert, Zane Street, conducted a biased investigation and displayed hostility towards the plaintiffs' representatives. The judge ruled that these allegations are sufficient to plead facts to show the defendant's unreasonableness and bad faith conduct, and therefore overruled the demurrer. The judge also denied the defendant's motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the allegations of a biased investigation and expert are sufficient to support the element of malice and despicable conduct. The defendant is ordered to file an answer within 20 days.
