And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motions to compel discovery and further responses from the defendant. The plaintiff failed to attach copies of the discovery documents and responses to the discovery, and also failed to file the motion to compel within the 45-day time limit without a written stipulation to extend the time. Additionally, the plaintiff failed to submit a Separate Statement, which is required by California Rules of Court 3.1345. Furthermore, the supplemental interrogatories served by the plaintiff were repetitive and did not elicit any new information, which is prohibited by CCP section 2030.070. As a result, all of the plaintiff's motions to compel filed on September 20, 2024, are denied.
