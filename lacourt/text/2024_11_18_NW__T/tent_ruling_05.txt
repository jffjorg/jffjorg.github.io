BC696215
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendant Gazzy Garcia’s Motion to Tax Costs
is GRANTED in Part and DENIED in Part. 
The motion is GRANTED only as to $600.00 requested in Item 11 and
otherwise DENIED.  
Introduction 
Defendant Gazzy Garcia
(Defendant) moved to tax the costs requested by Plaintiff Donal Barron
(Plaintiff).  Defendant placed into issue
Item nos. 11 ($7,780.39) and 16 ($2,100.00).
Discussion 
As to Item 11, Defendant only
disputed the $6,920.39 charged for photocopying of exhibits to be excessive
because the cost for photocopying could have been done at a cheaper price and
because the $600.00 cost for delivery was unnecessary.  Preliminarily, cost for delivery is not an
allowed cost.  The statute expressly
provides for “Models, the enlargements of exhibits and photocopies of exhibits,
and the electronic presentation of exhibits, including costs of rental
equipment and electronic formatting”.  (Code
Civ. Proc., sec. 1033.5(a)(13).)  The
statute does not make any reference to delivery charges of the
photocopies.  The $600.00 charge for
delivery is not an awardable cost and is stricken.  
The motion to tax $600.00 from
Item 11 is GRANTED.
Although Defendant presents
evidence showing that FedEx charges a lesser price for making photocopies,
Defendant’s evidence is insufficient to show that the lesser charge is for the
same photocopying service utilized by Defendant.  The Court does not find that the amount
charged by Suite Trial Services to be unreasonable or excessive.
The motion to tax $6,920.39 from
Item 11 is DENIED.
As to Item 16 ($2.100.00),
Defendant argued that the cost of video editing to be excessive and
unreasonable.  However, the cost on its
face appears to be proper.  Defendant
argued that the work performed to edit the two video depositions was excessive
because the actual length of the two video depositions were relatively
short.  However, Defendant failed to
present any facts/evidence to support their contention that the time to edit
the depositions went beyond the time it “normally” takes to edit video depositions.  Defendant failed to meet its burden on the
motion.
The motion to tax $2,100.00 from
Item 16 is DENIED.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
