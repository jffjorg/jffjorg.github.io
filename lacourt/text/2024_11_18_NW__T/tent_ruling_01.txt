Salinas v Transit
Tentative
rulings
Acrisure of
California LLC d/b/a/ TIB Transportation Insurance Brokers’ Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Inspection Demands: Deny. 
The court is in general agreement with the opposition to the
motions.  While undoubtedly, Acrisure has
a right to determine the nature and amount of US Bus Charter’s damages, it
agrees because the underlying claims are still pending that there is no reason
at this time to force disclosure of otherwise protected attorney client information
when the damages cannot yet be fixed. 
Similarly, it is overbroad to seek all information with responding party’s
carriers which may not, at this time, even be relevant.  At some point in time, US Bus Charter will be
required to disclose its damages but given the status of the underlying claim,
the court will not order it at this time. 
Similarly,
the court takes the same position on the motion by TIB against US Bus Charter
on Special Interrogatory No. 3.
The court
queries whether a stay of the cross-complaints may be in order under the underlying
cases are all resolved and will discuss this at the next group meeting on
11/20/2024.
