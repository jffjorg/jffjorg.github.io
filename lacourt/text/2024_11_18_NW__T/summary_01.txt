And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion by Acrisure of California LLC, d/b/a TIB Transportation Insurance Brokers, to compel further responses to inspection demands. The judge agrees with the opposition that Acrisure has a right to determine the nature and amount of damages, but there is no reason to force disclosure of protected attorney-client information at this time, as the underlying claims are still pending and the damages cannot yet be fixed. Similarly, the judge finds it overbroad to seek all information from the responding party's carriers, which may not be relevant at this time. The judge will discuss the possibility of staying the cross-complaints at the next group meeting on November 20, 2024.
