Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Coral Wood Court Community Partners, LP (Defendant) to the seventh cause of action in the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by Acioli Tesseroli, Cristhal Tesseroli, Maria Libano, Leonardo Tesseroli, Leya Tesseroli, Lorelei Tesseroli, and Luke Tesseroli (Plaintiffs).

The Defendant argued that the seventh cause of action, which alleges a violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), failed to allege sufficient facts to show that the Plaintiffs are "aggrieved persons" as defined by FEHA. The Plaintiffs alleged that Maria Libano, who had a disability, was not accommodated by the Defendant, which made it difficult for her care. However, Libano passed away in January 2024 and was removed as a party-plaintiff.

The Court found that the FEHA violation cause of action failed to plead facts showing how the Plaintiffs were injured in fact. The Plaintiffs argued that Acioli Tesseroli and Cristhal Tesseroli, only, could cure the pleading defect and plead facts showing actual injury. Therefore, the Court grants leave to amend only to these two Plaintiffs.

The demurrer to the seventh cause of action is sustained without leave to amend as to the minor Plaintiffs (Leonardo Tesseroli, Leya Tesseroli, Lorelei Tesseroli, and Luke Tesseroli) because they are not alleged to have suffered actual injury.
