Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal to January 25, 2024. The plaintiff, Leon Wilson, must file and serve a memorandum of points and authorities by December 19, 2023, along with any supporting evidence. If the plaintiff fails to comply with this order, the motion may be denied. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the plaintiff failed to provide a memorandum of points and authorities as required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1113, which is an admission that the request is without merit and cause for its denial.
