And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the hearing on Defendant Rachel Nicole Lee's Motion for Terminating Sanctions to December 13, 2023, at 8:30 AM in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. Defendant is required to file proof of service of the notice of continuance by December 1, 2023. The judge has found that terminating sanctions are warranted for Plaintiff Luelle Llorens' non-compliance with the discovery order. The plaintiff failed to comply with the court's orders despite notice of the court's ruling and has not filed an opposition to the motion. The judge concludes that compliance with the court's orders cannot be achieved through lesser sanctions and therefore grants the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions.
