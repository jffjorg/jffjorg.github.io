ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Leon Wilson (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action
against Defendant ND Sepulveda II, LP (“Defendant”) on March 3, 2022. The case
came for trial on August 31, 2023 and upon Plaintiff’s failure to appear, the
Court dismissed the case without prejudice. (Minute Order, 08/31/23.) Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on October 24, 2023. No opposition
has been filed to date. 
 
The Motion is not accompanied by a
memorandum of points and authorities, as required. “The memorandum must contain
a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments
relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in
support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b).)
Indeed, Plaintiff’s failure to provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is
an “admission that the [request] is without merit and cause for its denial.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone &
Fyke (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the hearing on Plaintiff Leon Wilson’s Motion to Vacate
Dismissal is CONTINUED TO JANUARY 25, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE
SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY DECEMBER 19, 2023, PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE
A MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES AS REQUIRED BY CAL. RULES OF COURT RULE
3.1113 ALONG WITH ANY SUPPORTING EVIDENCE. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE COURT’S
ORDER MAY RESULT IN THE MOTION BEING DENIED.
