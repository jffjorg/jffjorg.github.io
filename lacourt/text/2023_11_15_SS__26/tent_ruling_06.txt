ANALYSIS:
 
On June 12, 2023, Defendant Mercury Insurance Company
(“Defendant”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Production
of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff Ernesto Gonzalez (“Plaintiff”) (Motions, Pelanda Decl., Exh. 1.) Despite a meet
and confer effort extending the deadline to serve verified responses without
objections, Plaintiff has not done so. (Id. at Exh. 2.) Defendant filed
the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Sanctions; and (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on October 20,
2023. No oppositions have been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) Based on Plaintiff’s failure to timely
respond to the propounded discovery, Defendant is entitled to an order compelling
service of verified responses to the discovery requests without objections. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
awarded in the amount of $723.30 based on two hours of attorney time billed at
$300.00 per hour and filing fees of $61.65 per motion. (Motions, Pelanda Decl.,
¶¶7-8.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Mercury Insurance
Company’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and
Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF ERNESTO GONZALEZ IS TO
SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS WITHOUT OBJECTIONS WITHIN 20
DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF AND COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE JOINTLY AND
SEVERALLY ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $723.30 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20
DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
