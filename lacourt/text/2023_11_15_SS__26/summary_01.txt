And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling continues the hearing on Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club's Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enforce Settlement to December 13, 2023 at 8:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. Plaintiff is required to file proof of service of the notice of continuance by December 1, 2023. The judge notes that there is no evidence that Defendant was given notice of the current hearing date, and the hearing must be continued to give proper notice.

The judge also analyzes the merits of the motion. Plaintiff filed the instant action for automobile subrogation against Defendants Marine Charchyan and Avetik Charchyan on June 15, 2020. The case came for trial on September 19, 2022, at which time the parties represented that the case had been settled. However, when Plaintiff failed to appear at the order to show cause on January 25, 2023, the case was dismissed without prejudice. Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on July 20, 2023, which was initially set for hearing on September 6, 2023, but was continued for further briefing to November 8, 2023. Plaintiff appeared at the hearing on November 8, 2023, but the hearing was continued to November 15, 2023 due to the judge's unavailability.

The judge finds that the request to vacate the dismissal is timely and is supported by an affidavit of attorney fault. Therefore, the case is reinstated under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). However, the judge also finds that the settlement agreement reached with Defendants is not enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 because it was not signed by Plaintiff, Plaintiff's counsel, or agent, as required by the statute.
