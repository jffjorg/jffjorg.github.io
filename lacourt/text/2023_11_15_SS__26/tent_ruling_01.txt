ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for automobile subrogation against Defendants Marine Charchyan and
Avetik Charchyan (“Defendants”) on June 15, 2020. Defendants filed answers on
September 28, 2021. The matter came for trial on September 19, 2022, at which
time the parties represented that the case had been settled. (Minute Order,
09/19/22.) The Court set an order to show cause regarding dismissal for January
25, 2023. (Ibid.) When Plaintiff failed to appear at the order to show
cause, the Court dismissed the case without prejudice. (Minute Order,
01/25/23.) 
 
Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on July 20, 2023. The Motion initially
came for hearing on September 6, 2023 and was continued for further briefing to
November 8, 2023. (Minute Order, 09/06/23.) Plaintiff filed a supplemental
declaration on September 14, 2023. On November 8, 2023, Plaintiff appeared but the
hearing was continued to November 15, 2023 due to the Court’s unavailability.
(Minute Order, 11/08/23.) Plaintiff was ordered to give notice of the
continuance. (Ibid.) However, no proof of service of the notice of
continuance has been filed to date. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Initially, the
Court notes that there is no evidence Defendant was given notice of the current
hearing date. The hearing must be continued to give proper notice. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005.) 
 
Substantively, the
request to vacate the dismissal is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure,
section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute, an
application for relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the
order from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an affidavit of
fault attesting to the moving party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business
Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) When based on attorney fault
with respect to entry of default, default judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a
timely request for relief must be granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)
When brought pursuant to the provision for discretionary relief based on party
fault, the request must have been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 

 
The motion was timely filed within six months of dismissal
of the action and is supported by an affidavit of attorney fault. Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that they failed to calendar the January 25, 2023 order to
show cause. (Motion, Bailey Decl., ¶5.) Therefore, the case is reinstated under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
 
Plaintiff also moves to enforce
the settlement agreement reached with Defendants pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6. which states
in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” to a written agreement include “an attorney who
represents the party” and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(b).) The written settlement must include the signatures of the parties seeking
to enforce the agreement, and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) The
settlement agreement here does not comply with the statutory requirements set
forth above because it was only signed by Defendants. (Motion, Kalpakian Decl.,
Exh. A, p. 2.) The agreement was not signed by Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s counsel,
or agent, as required by the statute. Therefore, the settlement agreement is
not enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.

Vacate Dismissal and Enforce Settlement is CONTINUED TO DECEMBER 13, 2023 AT
