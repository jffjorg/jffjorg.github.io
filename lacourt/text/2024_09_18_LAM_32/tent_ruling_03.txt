            v.
 
AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR
  CO., INC.,  et al.,
                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  24STCV16702
  Hearing Date:  September 18, 2024 
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s demurrer and motion to
  strike




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 5, 2024, Plaintiff Freddie
Torres filed this lemon law action against Defendant American Honda Motor Co.,
alleging breach of warranty in violation of the Song-Beverly Act and fraud by concealment.  Plaintiff alleges that he purchased a 2021 Honda
Odyssey (Vehicle) which contained or developed defects.  
            On August 7, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant demurrer as to the fifth cause of action for fraudulent concealment,
and motion to strike punitive damages.  
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading, may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part of that pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b).) The
court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper, strike (1) any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading and (2) all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Id., § 436.) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face
of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id., § 437.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer
requirement.  
DISCUSSION
I.
Economic Loss Rule
            Economic loss consists of “damages
for inadequate value, costs of repair and replacement of the defective product
or consequent loss of profits—without any claim of personal injury or damages
to other property.” (Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004)
34 Cal.4th 979, 988.) The economic loss rule requires a purchaser to recover in
contract for purely economic loss due to disappointed expectations, unless the
purchaser “can demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken contractual promise,”
such as some form of personal injury or damage to property other than the
defective product itself. (Ibid.) The economic loss rule exists to
prevent “the law of contract and the law of tort from dissolving one into the
other.” (Ibid.) 
“[T]he economic loss rule is not a defense
to a cause of action. Rather, the existence of damages other than purely
economic loss is an element of a plaintiff’s common law cause of action.” (Greystone
Homes, Inc. v. Midtec, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1215.) “Under the
economic loss rule, appreciable, nonspeculative, present injury is an
essential element of a tort cause of action.” (Rosen v. State Farm General
Ins. Co. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1070, 1079.) In this case, Plaintiff has not
alleged that she suffered any physical injury or that there was any physical
damage to property other than to the vehicle itself. Plaintiff has alleged only
economic loss. The speculative risk associated with an engine defect is not a
present injury sufficient to overcome the rule. Additionally, Robinson
Helicopter limited the fraudulent inducement exception to instances of
affirmative representation. (See Robinson Helicopter, supra, 34 Cal.4th
at p. 993.) For this reason, Plaintiff’s fraudulent concealment claim is barred
by the economic loss rule. 
In this case, Plaintiff has not alleged that
he suffered any physical injury or that there was any physical damage to
property other than to the Vehicle itself. 
Plaintiff has alleged only economic loss.  For this reason, Plaintiff’s fraudulent
concealment claim is barred by the economic loss rule.  
Our California Supreme Court supports this
result.  In Rattagan v. Uber (August
22, 2024, No. S272113) 2024 WL 3894629, our California Supreme Court ruled that
a plaintiff may assert a cause of action for fraudulent concealment based on
conduct occurring in the course of a contractual relationship, if the elements
of the claim can be established independently of the parties' contractual
rights and obligations and the tortious conduct exposes the plaintiff to a risk
of harm beyond the reasonable contemplation of the parties when they entered
into the contract.
 
The weight of authority within the Ninth
Circuit also concurs with this result. (See, e.g., Sloan v. General
Motors LLC (N.D. Cal., Apr. 23, 2020, No. 16-CV-07244-EMC) 2020 WL 1955643,
at *23-*24 (Judge Chen) (collecting cases); Mosqueda v. American Honda Motor
Company, Inc. (C.D. Cal., Mar. 6, 2020, No. SACV19839MWFMAAX) 2020 WL
1698710, at *13; Hsieh v. FCA US LLC (S.D. Cal., Feb. 20, 2020, No.
19-CV-01691 W (AHG)) 2020 WL 835310, at *3; Zagarian v. BMW of North
America, LLC (C.D. Cal., Oct. 23, 2019, No. CV 18-4857-RSWLPLA) 2019 WL
6111731, at *3; Thompson v. BMW of North America, LLC (C.D. Cal., Jan.
10, 2019, No. SACV 17-01912-CJC-KS) 2019 WL 988694, at *5.) 
II.
Punitive Damages
            A plaintiff may not recover
statutory penalties and punitive damages for the same conduct, because that
would amount to a double recovery. (Anderson v. Ford Motor Co. (2022) 74
Cal.App.5th 946, 970-71.) While a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for
conduct that is distinct from the statutory violation, such as fraud, Plaintiff
has not asserted a valid fraud claim. The Song-Beverly Act itself does not
provide for punitive damages, only penalties. (See Imperial Merchant
Services, Inc. v. Hunt (2009) 47 Cal.4th 381, 390 [“the fact that the
Legislature expressly designated specific damage remedies while omitting others
. . . reflects that it intended the prescribed remedies to be exclusive”];
Troensegaard v. Silvercrest Industries, Inc. (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 218, 228
[“had the Legislature, by Civil Code sections 3294 (permitting punitive
damages) and 1794 (permitting a civil penalty), intended a double recovery of
punitive and penal damages for the same willful, oppressive, malicious, and
oppressive acts, it would in some appropriate manner have said so”].) Therefore,
punitive damages are stricken. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s demurrer to the fifth cause
of action for fraud by concealment is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
Defendant’s motion to strike is GRANTED as to punitive damages without leave to
amend.   
            Defendant shall file an answer to
the complaint within 20 days of this order.
