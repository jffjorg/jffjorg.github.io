  - "A plaintiff may assert a cause of action for fraudulent concealment based on conduct occurring in the course of a contractual relationship, if the elements of the claim can be established independently of the parties' contractual rights and obligations and the tortious conduct exposes the plaintiff to a risk of harm beyond the reasonable contemplation of the parties when they entered into the contract." (Rattagan v. Uber)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The plaintiff, Freddie Torres, filed a lemon law action alleging breach of warranty and fraud by concealment in connection with the purchase of a 2021 Honda Odyssey.

The judge found that the plaintiff's claim for fraudulent concealment is barred by the economic loss rule, which holds that a plaintiff cannot recover for purely economic loss without alleging some form of personal injury or damage to property other than the defective product itself. The judge also found that the plaintiff has not alleged any physical injury or damage to property other than the vehicle itself, and therefore, the claim for fraudulent concealment is not viable.

The judge also struck the claim for punitive damages, finding that a plaintiff may not recover statutory penalties and punitive damages for the same conduct, and that the plaintiff has not asserted a valid fraud claim.

The judge sustained the defendant's demurrer to the fifth cause of action for fraud by concealment without leave to amend and granted the motion to strike punitive damages without leave to amend. The defendant is required to file an answer to the complaint within 20 days of the order.
