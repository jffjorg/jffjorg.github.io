And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiffs' motion for attorney's fees in the case of Clare P. Sassoon and Thomas Kielty against Air Venezuela, LLC. The Plaintiffs initiated the lawsuit in March 2022, alleging breaches of contract, the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tenant harassment, and other claims. The case involves the enforcement of a Tenant Settlement Agreement (TSA) that granted the Plaintiffs tenancy for life at the subject premises. The Judge found that the Plaintiffs did not sublet their unit in violation of the TSA and were not required to use the unit as their primary residence.

The Plaintiffs seek attorney's fees incurred in vindicating their own interests, but the Judge rules that the rule of Trope applies, which bars recovery of attorney's fees for a pro per plaintiff who simultaneously represents their spouse or another person with identical interests. The Judge also cites Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. and Gillotti v. Stewart, which hold that attorney's fees are not recoverable for a spouse who represents themselves and their spouse in a joint and indivisible interest. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiffs' motion for attorney's fees is denied.
