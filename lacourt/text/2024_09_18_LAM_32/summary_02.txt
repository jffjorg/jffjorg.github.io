And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court has considered the motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Olivia Jeong and has denied the motion. The Court finds that Defendant Jeong was served at the proper address and that the service substantially complied with the statutory requirements. The Court notes that the address where service was made is Defendant Jeong's usual place of business or usual mailing address, making it a proper place for substitute service.

Defendant Jeong argues that she does not reside at the address where service was made, but she has no sworn declaration to that effect. The Court finds that the additional evidence presented by Defendant Jeong, including a screenshot of the purported Ring camera footage and purported photos from the social media profile of the process server, is insufficient to rebut the presumption of valid service.

The Court concludes that Defendant Jeong's motion to quash service of summons is denied.
