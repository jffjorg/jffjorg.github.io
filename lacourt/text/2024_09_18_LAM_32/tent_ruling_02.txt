  order RE:
defendant olivia jeong’s motion to quash
  service of summons 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff
Justin Smith filed this action against Defendants Alla Zorikova, Olivia Jeong,
and Joycelyn Yew. The complaint asserts causes of action for (1) violation of
the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA), (2) violation of the Unfair Competition
Law (UCL), and (3) fraud. 
            Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
run an illegal dog breeding operation and operate out of Defendant Lew’s home
in Los Angeles. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants falsely advertise their dogs
as healthy, trained, and top quality. Plaintiff allegedly purchased a puppy
from Defendants that turned out to be sick, dirty, and not properly socialized.
Plaintiff allegedly contacted Defendant Zorikova for a refund, and Defendant
Zorkova allegedly refused, instead instructing Plaintiff to sell the dog to
another buyer himself. 
            On July 18, 2024, Defendant Jeong
filed the instant motion to quash based on defective service of the summons and
complaint. Plaintiff filed his opposition on September 5, 2024. Defendant filed
her reply on September 6, 2024. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
“[T]he court in which an action is pending
has jurisdiction over a party from the time summons is served on him as
provided by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10).” (Code Civ. Proc, §
410.50(a).) “[A] court acquires jurisdiction over a party by proper service of
process or by that party's general appearance.” (In re Jennifer O.
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 539, 547.) Actual notice of a lawsuit is not a
substitute for proper service of process. (Abers v. Rohrs (2013) 217
Cal.App.4th 1199, 1206.) A defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to
quash service of summons on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).) 
DISCUSSION
            “A summons may be served by personal
delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be
served.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) Alternatively, a summons may be served by
leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person’s dwelling house,
usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address, in the
presence of a competent member of the household or a person apparently in
charge, at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents
thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the
same location. (Id., § 415.20.)
According to a proof of service filed June
13, 2024, a registered process server effectuated substitute service on
Defendant Jeong at 3:22pm on February 29, 2024 by serving a John Doe standing
outside the front door. According to the proof of service, John Doe confirmed
that the defendants (other than Olivia Jeong) resided at the address but were
unavailable at the moment. John Doe then allegedly refused to accept the
summons and complaint, whereafter the server left the papers at the front door.

Defendant Jeong argues that she does not
reside at the 5644 Park Oak Place address, but she has no sworn declaration to
that effect. Moreover, contracts and communications produced by Defendant Lew
show that Defendant Jeong leased the premises from Defendant Lew for her
business. (Pease Decl., Ex. 1, 2.) Defendant Jeong lists 5644 Park Oak Place as
her address in the caption of her motion and reply. Thus, the address is Defendant
Jeong’s usual place of business or usual mailing address, making it a proper place
for substitute service even if Defendant does not reside there. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 415.20.)   
Defendant Jeong’s motion otherwise makes
arguments that the Court has already rejected in denying Defendant Lew’s motion
to quash. Specifically, Defendant Jeong argues that resident Kim Marra
encountered the process server on a different day and that the Ring camera did
not capture the process server at 3:22pm on February 29, 2024 but instead
captured an unspecified delivery at 5:13pm. As the Court held, this does
nothing to negate the process server’s account and is insufficient to rebut the
presumption of valid service. (See Evid. Code, § 647.) 
On August 7, 2024, Defendant Jeong filed a
supplemental declaration attaching a screenshot of the purported Ring camera
footage, along with purported photos from the social media profile of the
process server, Ryan Sallee. However, Defendant has no personal knowledge or
foundation to determine that the social media page is authentic or belongs to
the process server who executed the proof of service. The screenshot of the
Ring footage is also too blurry to match the purported profile photos. The
additional unauthenticated evidence does nothing to rebut the presumption of
valid service.
Ultimately, the Court finds that Defendant
Jeong was served at the proper address and that the service substantially
complied with statutory requirements. (See Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210
Cal.App.4th 1154, 1165.) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Jeong’s motion to quash
service of summons is DENIED.
