Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motions to compel responses to their discovery requests, including requests for production of documents, requests for admissions, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories. The judge orders the plaintiff to serve his responses to these requests without objections and with verification within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling. The judge also awards sanctions against the plaintiff in the amounts of $400.00 and $230.00, respectively, for the defendants' attorney's fees and costs incurred in bringing the motions. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests justifies these sanctions.
