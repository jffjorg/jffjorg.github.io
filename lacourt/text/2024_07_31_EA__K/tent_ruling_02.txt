[1]              Counsel for Plaintiff David Dauer’s
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel was granted on April 4, 2024 effective upon
filing a proof of service of the court’s order on the client. A review of
ecourt indicates that no such proof of service has been made and, as a result,
the court’s April 4, 2024 order is not valid. Therefore, the sanctions ordered
below are ordered jointly and severally.
