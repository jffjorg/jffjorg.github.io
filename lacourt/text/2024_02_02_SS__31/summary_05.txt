Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the Uber Defendants' motions to compel further discovery responses from the plaintiff, Brittany Moore. The court finds that the motions are premature because the parties did not schedule and participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) prior to filing the motions. The judge orders the parties to participate in an IDC, which is currently scheduled for February 20, 2024, and to continue the hearing on the motions to compel further discovery responses at a later date. The parties are encouraged to resolve outstanding issues through the IDC and are ordered to submit a joint statement of items in dispute if they are unable to resolve all issues. The judge notes that the parties should meet and confer to reach an agreement and may submit the tentative ruling to confirm their agreement or disagreement. If the parties do not submit or appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
