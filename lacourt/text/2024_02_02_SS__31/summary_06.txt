Here is a brief English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has ruled on the demurrer to the first amended complaint and the motion to strike the request for punitive damages. The demurrer to the fourth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) is sustained without leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff cannot re-file the claim. The motion to strike the request for punitive damages against Target is granted without leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff cannot seek punitive damages against Target. The court found that the plaintiff's allegations did not rise to the level of malice, fraud, or oppression, and that the conduct described was a claim sounding in negligence, not intentional infliction of emotional distress.
