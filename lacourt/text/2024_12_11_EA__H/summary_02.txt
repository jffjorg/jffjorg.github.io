And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Ally Bank's application for a writ of possession after hearing without prejudice. This means that the application has been rejected, but the plaintiff still has the opportunity to re-file or re-argue the case. The reason for the denial is that Ally Bank failed to provide notice to the defendant, Qianmin Shu, of the continued hearing date. The case involves a retail installment sales contract between Shu and Mercedes-Benz of West Covina, and Ally Bank is seeking to recover a 2022 Mercedes-Benz C300W vehicle that is in Shu's possession. The judge's decision is based on a failure by Ally Bank to comply with the court's orders and to provide adequate notice to the defendant.
