Bank v. Shu, Case No. 24PSCV01892


ORDER ON APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF POSSESSION


Plaintiff Ally Bank’s Application for
Writ of Possession After Hearing is DENIED
without prejudice.
Background 
Plaintiff Ally Bank (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows: 
          On
May 10, 2022, Defendant Qianmin Shu (“Defendant”) entered into a Retail
Installment Sales Contract (the “Agreement”) with Mercedes-Benz of West Covina (“Assignor”),
wherein Assignor agreed to finance a 2022 Mercedes-Benz C300W, VIN
#W1KAF4GB3NR011889 (“subject vehicle”) to Defendant in exchange for Defendant’s
payments. Defendant has failed to make payments
owing under the Agreement. 
On June 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting
causes of action against Defendant and Does 1-10 for (1) claim and delivery of
personal property and (2) money on a contract. 
Pending before the Court is Plaintiff’s application for
writ of possession after hearing. The application is summarily denied without
prejudice due to Plaintiff’s failure to provide notice of the continued hearing
date to Defendant.
Discussion
Plaintiff applies for a writ of possession after
hearing pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 512.010 et
seq.  Plaintiff seeks to recover the subject vehicle now in the possession of Defendant.
The
application was filed on July 8, 2024 and originally set for hearing on October
10, 2024. On July 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service, which reflected
that Defendant had been personally served with the application on July 22,
2024. On August 13, 2024, the Court issued a “Notice Re: Continuance of Hearing
and Order,” wherein the October 10, 2024 scheduled hearing was continued to
October 21, 2024; the notice was given to Plaintiff’s counsel only, who was
ordered “to give notice by mail forthwith of such fact to all parties and to
file proof of service of such notice forthwith.”
Because
there was nothing on the docket reflecting that Plaintiff had given notice of
the rescheduled October 21, 2024 hearing date to Defendant, the Court issued an
order on October 16, 2024 rescheduling the October 21, 2024 hearing date to
December 11, 2024. The Court instructed counsel for Plaintiff to provide notice
of the continued hearing date to Defendant forthwith and to file proof of service
of said notice no later than five court days prior to the continued hearing
date (i.e., December 4, 2024). There is nothing on the docket reflecting that
Plaintiff provided notice of the rescheduled December 11, 2024 hearing date to
Defendant.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s application is summarily denied without prejudice, due to
the notice deficiency noted above.
