At the hearing on December 11, 2024,
the Court would like the parties to address whether the City of Covina is
entitled to attorneys’ fees under the provisions that are cited in its motion
but do not appear in the operative complaint.
On February 25, 2019, Plaintiffs People of the
State of California and City of Covina (together, the “City”) filed the instant
case, asserting the following causes of action against Ronald Knox, Olivia
Knox, and Does 1-50: (1) Violation
of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act—Abatement (Cal. Health and Safety Code
§11570 et seq.), (2) Public Nuisance, (3) Municipal Code Violations, and (4) Declaratory
and Injunctive Relief.
On
September 27, 2019, an “Order for Preliminary Injunction” was filed.
On
October 25, 2019, an “Amendment to Complaint” was filed, wherein Saxon
Mortgage, Inc. dba Saxon Home Mortgage (“Saxon”) was named in lieu of Doe 2. On
October 30, 2019, another “Amendment to Complaint” was filed, wherein First
American Title Company (erroneously sued as “First American Title”) was named
in lieu of Doe 1.
On
December 6, 2019, First American Title Company filed a “Disclaimer of
Interest.”
On
December 20, 2019, an “Order for the Appointment of a Receiver and Related
Injunction” was entered.
On
April 6, 2020, the City dismissed First American Title Company and Saxon,
without prejudice.
On
May 8, 2020, the City filed an “Amendment to Complaint,” wherein PHH Mortgage
Corporation, successor by merger to Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (erroneously sued
as “Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC”) (“PHH”) was named in lieu of Doe 3.
On
September 14, 2020, the Court ordered Olivia Knox’s answer stricken.
On

and Authorizing the Receiver to Issue a Second Certificate of Indebtedness” was
entered.
On
April 28, 2023, an “Order Approving and Confirming the Receiver’s Sale of Real
Property” was entered. On August 15, 2023, an “Order of Instructions to the
Receiver” was entered.

Pending before the Court are: (1) the City’s motion
for attorney fees and costs, brought pursuant to pursuant to Health and Safety
Code section 11570 et seq., Civil Code section 3496(c), and Covina Municipal
Code section 1.28.030, and (2) the Receiver’s motion for an order (a) approving the receiver’s final report
and final accounting, (b) approving the receiver’s fees and costs, (c)
instructing the receiver to distribute the remaining asset of the receivership
estate, (d) exonerating the receiver’s undertaking, and (e) discharging the
receiver. A hearing on the motions is scheduled for December 11, 2024,
at 9:30 a.m. 
The Court declines to issue a tentative ruling at
this time, but provides the following guidance to the parties in advance of the
hearing:
          1.       As to the City’s
motion for attorney fees and costs, the parties are directed to address whether
the City is entitled to attorney’s fees under Civil Code
section 3496(c) and/or Covina Municipal Code section 1.28.030, where, as here,
the operative complaint does not cite to Civil Code section 3496(c) and/or
Covina Municipal Code section 1.28.030 and appears to seek attorneys’ fees only
“pursuant to Cal. Health and Safety Code § 17980.7.”
          2.       As to
Receiver Eric P. Beatty’s motion, the Court intends to defer ruling on the
motion pending resolution of the attorneys’ fees issue set forth above.
