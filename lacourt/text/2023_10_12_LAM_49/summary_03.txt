And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Plaintiff's Motion for Attorney's Fees in the amount of $33,600.00. The Court has also awarded the Plaintiff full costs in the amount of $722.50. The Plaintiff brought this action against her former employer(s) for various violations of the Labor Code and FEHA. The matter proceeded to trial on August 25, 2023, and the trial proceeded as uncontested as to defendant Nelly Bunay and prove-up as to defaulted defendant 24K Chef LLC. The Court entered judgment in favor of the Plaintiff against both defendants for a total amount of $38,469.00. The Plaintiff seeks attorney's fees and costs as the prevailing party in this action under the Labor Code and FEHA. The Court determines the reasonable hourly rate for attorney's fees to be $700.00 per hour and finds that the hours expended in this matter were reasonable. The Court declines to apply a multiplier given the matter did not present any complex or novel issues and proceeded as uncontested at trial.
