Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is issued by Judge Randolph M. Hammock regarding a motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Nala Mena, a minor. The plaintiff is suing the Los Angeles Unified School District for negligence and negligent hiring, training, and supervision, alleging that she was the victim of physical and mental bullying while attending kindergarten at Fullbright Avenue Elementary school. The defendant moves to compel the deposition, which the plaintiff opposes. The court grants the motion, but sets a deposition date in April or May 2024, approximately six months from the date of the ruling, to permit the plaintiff to undergo further therapy beforehand. The court also vacates the current trial dates and sets a trial setting conference for June 3, 2024.
