The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support respondeat superior liability against Defendant YMCA and that the sexual assault was within the scope of employment. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has adequately stated a claim for IIED, alleging that Defendant YMCA's conduct was extreme and outrageous and intentionally or recklessly caused the Plaintiff emotional distress. The Judge orders Defendant YMCA to file an answer to the Second Amended Complaint within 21 days and orders the Plaintiff to give notice, unless waived.
