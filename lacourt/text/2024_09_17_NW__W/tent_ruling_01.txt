BACKGROUND
 
On February
6, 2024, Plaintiff/Appellant initiated its appeal of the Labor Commissioner
Award, which was found in Ilana Simona’s favor. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff Yor
Construction & Investments, Inc.’s Motion for an Order Compelling Leeor
Perez to Comply with Deposition Subpoena and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff/Appellant Yor Construction
& Investments, Inc. moves this court for an order compelling third-party
witness Leeor Peretz to comply with a deposition subpoena served upon him by
appearing at a deposition and producing documents. Plaintiff also seeks an
award of sanctions for $3,484.00 against Leeor Peretz to compensate it for the
costs and fees associated with the missed deposition and bringing the instant
motion. 
 
A party may move to compel a
non-party’s compliance with a subpoena that requires the attendance of a
witness.  (CCP § 1987.1.)  Unlike a motion to compel a party’s
deposition under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, the movant is not required
to show good cause or include an accompanying meet and confer declaration. 
 
Plaintiff issued a deposition subpoena
on non-party witness, Leeor Peretz on May 22, 2024. (Shem-Tov Decl. ¶¶2-3, Exh.
A.) The deposition was set for June 26, 2024. (Shem-Tov Decl., Exh. A.) On June
20, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a text message to Mr. Perez reminding him of
the upcoming deposition. (Shem-Tov Decl. ¶ 4; Exh. C). Mr. Peretz did not
appear for his deposition that was scheduled to take place on June 26, 2024,
nor did Mr. Peretz serve any objections thereto. (Shem-Tov Decl. ¶ 5.) 
 
The unopposed motion is GRANTED.  Leeor
Peretz is ordered to appear for deposition within 20 days.
 
The request for sanctions is GRANTED IN
PART.  Leeor Peretz is ordered to pay sanctions of $1,334.00 ($500
pursuant to CCP §1992, $774 court reporter fee, and $60 filing fee). (See Vidrio
v. Hernandez (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1454-1455 [“California courts
have inherent power ‘to take appropriate action to secure compliance with . . .
orders, to punish contempt, and to control its proceedings’” but “our trial
courts have no inherent power to impose monetary sanctions” against a
nonparty].)
