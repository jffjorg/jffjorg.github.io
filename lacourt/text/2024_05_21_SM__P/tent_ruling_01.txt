Oscar Martinez v. Geoffrey Palmer, et al., Case No.
23SMCV05217
Hearing date May 21, 2024 
Defendants Palmer & Lin’s Demurrer to Complaint 
 
Plaintiff Martinez alleges he was injured at defendants’
home when large, heavy pieces of glass he was unloading fell on him. Defendants
demur to the first and second causes of action for negligence and premises
liability. 
 
Negligence
The elements for a cause of action negligence are: (1)
duty; (2) breach; (3) causation; and (4) damages. County of Santa Clara v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318. In
California, negligence may be pleaded in general terms. Landeros v. Flood
(1976) 17 Cal.3d 399, 407-408.
Defendants argue plaintiff’s form complaint has
not adequately alleged the allegedly negligent conduct. The complaint alleges, at
p. 4, GN-1, that the defendants were negligent in their maintenance and
operation of the premises, required plaintiff to work in an unsafe work
environment, failed to properly train employees, all of which allege duty and
breach. The complaint alleges damages as well. These allegations, under liberal
pleading standards are sufficient to state a cause of action and to put
defendants on notice of the allegations. OVERRULED. 
Premises Liability
 
The
elements of a cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for
negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages.¿¿Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp¿(2013)
220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.¿¿
 
“Ordinarily, negligence may be alleged in general terms, without
specific facts showing how the injury occurred, but there are ‘limits to the
generality with which a plaintiff is permitted to state his cause of action,
and . . . the plaintiff must indicate the acts or omissions which are said to
have been negligently performed.  He may not recover upon the bare
statement that the defendant’s negligence has caused him injury.’ [Citation].” Berkley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 527.
 
Defendants argue the complaint has not identified the
allegedly dangerous condition (Complaint, p. 5). The court agrees. All
plaintiff alleges is “the subject premises was in a dangerous condition,” but
he does not allege what about the premises was allegedly dangerous. This is too
vague to put defendants on notice of the allegedly dangerous condition. SUSTAINED
with 20 days leave to amend.
