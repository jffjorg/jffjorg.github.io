And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling outlines the court's consideration of the defendants' demurrer to the complaint. The plaintiff, Oscar Martinez, alleges he was injured at the defendants' home when large, heavy pieces of glass fell on him. The defendants argue that the complaint does not adequately allege the allegedly negligent conduct. The court finds that the complaint does not sufficiently identify the allegedly dangerous condition of the premises, and therefore, sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend.
