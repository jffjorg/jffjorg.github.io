12518 Sunset Group,
LLC, et al. v. Lionscove Fund 1, LLC, Case No. 24SMCV00772
Hearing Date: May 21,
2024
Plaintiffs’ Motion
for Preliminary Injunction 
 
Plaintiff brings
this motion for a preliminary injunction to stop a foreclosure sale. The underlying
action alleges Lionscove failed to provide funds under the parties’ loan
agreement, so plaintiff is unable to make timely payments. A TRO is currently
in place.
 
Plaintiffs’ request
for judicial notice of the Modification of Mortgage, recorded on May 2, 2023, as
Document Number 20230284765 (plaintiffs’ Exhibit A); the Amended Complaint and
Summons filed on May 3, 2024, in Case Number 24SMCV00772 (plaintiff’s Exhibit B),
are GRANTED under Evidence Code §452(b) & (d), as Exhibit A is an official record
of the Los Angeles County Recorder, and Exhibit B is a record of the Los Angeles
Superior Court.
 
A preliminary
injunction will issue if 1) moving party is likely to suffer greater injury
from a denial than the non-moving party is likely to suffer from its grant, and
2) a reasonable probability that the moving party will prevail on the merits. IT
Corp. v. County of Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d 63, 69-70. When a strong
showing is made on one of these two elements, the showing as to the other
element does not need to be as strong. Right Site Coalition v. Los Angeles
Unified School Dist. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 336, 339. A preliminary
injunction will only be issued if money damages would be an inadequate remedy. Tahoe

1459, 1471. 
 
Despite the previously
ordered TRO, the Notice of Trustee's Sale was recorded on January 3, 2024, and
foreclosure is imminent. Plaintiffs likely face a greater injury from a denial
than defendant, as plaintiff stands to lose title to the property and suffer
severe economic harm. The foreclosure action stems from plaintiffs’ inability
to pay a loan amount on his property. Cambell Decl. ¶ 5. Plaintiffs allege the inability
to pay the loan is due to defendant’s delay in paying the agreed-upon amount
per the parties’ loan agreement. Id. ¶¶ 34-37, 39. 
 
In opposition, EF
Mortgage, LLC contends that plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof
showing a reasonable probability of success because they have provided nothing
but generic allegations and conclusory statements. 
 
The Court disagrees.
The property is considered unique, and plaintiffs would be prejudiced should
the property be foreclosed upon. By contrast, defendant would face minimal
hardship beyond temporarily being unable to foreclose on the property, and any
losses would be monetary only.
 
Plaintiffs
additionally show a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of their
breach of contract action and that the relief sought can offset the mortgage
owed on the property. Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(II)-A.
Further, Cambell does have standing to bring the action as he is the
titleholder of the property and a member of 12518 Sunset Group, LLC. Reply p. 5;
Cambell Decl. ¶ 2.   
 
Plaintiffs argue
Sunset obtained a mortgage loan from defendant Lionscove for $2,737,050,
secured by property owned by Campbell. The loan included $722,050 in
construction funds, which were to be made available as construction expenses
were incurred. Plaintiffs agreed to and did make regular monthly payments.
Plaintiffs completed construction and requested reimbursements; however, plaintiffs
argue Lionscove acted in bad faith, stalling reimbursements, delaying
inspections, and disbursing smaller payments than warranted, intending to stall
the project and foreclose on the property. 
 
The resulting
delay resulted in additional interest expenses and costs. Plaintiffs allege
rather than disperse the construction funds, Lionscove is attempting to foreclose.
Plaintiffs meet their burden of showing a reasonable probability of success on
the merits. As the property is unique and monetary damages would be inadequate,
the injunction is GRANTED. 
 
An undertaking per
Code of Civil Procedure §529(a) is appropriate. Plaintiffs to post an
undertaking for $1,000,000 within 30 days.
