And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants a preliminary injunction to stop a foreclosure sale. The underlying action alleges that Lionscove failed to provide funds under the parties' loan agreement, making it impossible for the plaintiff to make timely payments. The court finds that the plaintiff is likely to suffer greater injury from a denial than the defendant, and that the plaintiff has a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of their breach of contract action. The court also finds that the property is unique and that monetary damages would be inadequate. The injunction is granted, with the plaintiff required to post an undertaking of $1,000,000 within 30 days.
