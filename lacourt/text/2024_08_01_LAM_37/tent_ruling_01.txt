Background
 
On July 14, 2023,
Devan Fetherston (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Los Angeles Dodgers,
LLC (“Defendant”). 
 
On March 20, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). The FAC alleges
causes of action for General Negligence and Premises Liability, Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Violations of Penal Code §§ 347 and 182. 
 
On June 12, 2024,
the Defendant filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (“MJOP”). No
opposition or reply has been filed. The matter is now before the court. 
 
 
motion for
judgment on the pleadings[1]
 
I.         Legal
Standard
 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same
function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the
face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.” (Burnett
v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064.) “In deciding or
reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all properly pleaded material facts are
deemed to be true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from
those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) When considering demurrers and judgment on the
pleadings, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v.
Transit Authority of City of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.)
A motion for judgment on the pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause
of action. (Id.) “In the case of either a demurrer or a motion for
judgment on the pleadings, leave to amend should be granted if there is any
reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Gami
v. Mullikin Medical Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.) A non-statutory
motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made any time before or during
trial. (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
Defendants move for a judgment on the
pleadings on the grounds that the FAC (1) fails to state a cognizable cause of
action against Defendant, (2) Plaintiff cannot bring claims against Defendant
under the alleged Penal Code statutes, and (3) Plaintiff's claims for general
negligence, premises liability, negligent and intentional infliction of
emotional distress are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. 
 
            A.        Penal
Code Violations
 
Defendant asserts that the
alleged Penal Code violations— section 347 (unlawful mingling of poison or
harmful substance with food, drink, medicine, or water supply), section 646.9
(stalking),section 422 (criminal 5 threats), section 182 (conspiracy), and
section 236.1 (human trafficking)—do not confer a private right of action. (See
Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Mendes
(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 136, 144 [“[I]n  the absence of an intent to provide a private
right of action, that the courts were not to create such a right.”];  Ellis v. City of San Diego,
Cal. (9th Cir. 1999) 176 F.3d 1183, 1189 [No private right of action
for alleged Pen. Code violations].)
 
 
 
 
B.        Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress (IIED) and Negligence Based-Causes of Action
 
The FAC alleges that
Plaintiff attended an event at Dodgers’ stadium on June 2, 2019, and was then
assaulted by non-party members of a criminal and/or terrorist organization.
(Compl. at p. 4.) Plaintiff further alleges that “these
same individuals” “poisoned” him prior to an assault that occurred on February
4, 2019. (Ibid.) Defendants demur to the IIED claim because there are no
facts regarding the Defendant’s conduct that would give rise to liability under
IIED. Defendants further assert that the FAC alleges no facts showing that
Plaintiff suffered extreme emotional distress. The court agrees. 
 
Defendant also asserts that
Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. 
 
CCP § 335.1 imposes a two-year
statute of limitations for “[a]n action for assault, battery, or injury to, or for the
death of, an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another.
The IIED, negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress (“NIED”)
causes of action have a two-year statute of limitations. (CCP, § 335.1; Wassmann
v. South Orange County Community College District
(2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 825, 852–853; Miller v. Bank of America, Nat.
Ass'n (S.D. Cal. 2012) 858 F.Supp.2d 1118, 1127 [explaining NIED
claims is now governed by a two-year statute of limitations rather than the
previous one-year statute of limitations].) The FAC alleges that Plaintiff’s
injury-causing event occurred on June 2, 2019, but Plaintiff did not file this
action until over four years later on July 14, 2023. Therefore, the action is time-barred.

 
Plaintiff failed to
oppose the MJOP and failed to show that the FAC is capable of successful
amendment. For this reason, the court grants the motion without leave to amend.

 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s MJOP is granted without leave to amend. The action is
dismissed. Defendant to give notice.
