And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Harvey Champlin's motion for trial setting preference under California Code of Civil Procedure section 36(a). The motion is granted because the judge finds that Champlin is over 70 years old, has a substantial interest in the action as a whole, and that his health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing his interest in the litigation. The judge notes that Champlin has advanced age and serious medical comorbidities, including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and uses a pacemaker for cardiac issues. The judge also finds that Champlin's health condition poses an increased risk of hospitalization and death, and that his ability to participate in physical activities, including attending lengthy court proceedings, will be impaired as he ages. As a result, the judge grants Champlin's motion and sets the trial date for September 25, 2024, within 120 days of the date of the order.
