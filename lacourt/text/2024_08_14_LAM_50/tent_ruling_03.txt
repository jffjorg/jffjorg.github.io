                        Plaintiffs,
            vs.
HUGO RODRIGUEZ, et
  al.,
 
                        Defendants.


Case No.:

Hearing Date:

Hearing Time:


10:00 a.m. 




ORDER RE:  
 
MOTION TO COMPEL
  RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST PLAINTIFFS AND
  PLAINTIFF’S ATTORNEYS 




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Defendant Hugo Rodriguez
(“Defendant”) moves for an order “compelling Plaintiffs Hilda Bennett, Yolanda
Tellez, and Gustavo Rodriguez to provide proper and complete responses to
Defendant’s interrogatories, and for sanctions against Plaintiffs and
Plaintiff’s attorneys for their failure to comply with their discovery
obligations.” (Mot. at p. 2:2-5.) 
As an initial matter,
the Court notes that the proof of service attached to Defendant’s motion is not
signed or dated. Thus, it is unclear if Defendant’s instant motion was
served.  
In addition, Defendant’s motion will be continued to a new date as set forth below.
NO HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON AUGUST 14, 2024.    
Pursuant to the
Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conform
to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court orders
the parties in this case to participate in a meet and confer with the Court (“Informal
Discovery Conference” or “IDC”). Lead or other designated counsel for
the parties with full authority and
any self-represented parties are ordered to participate in person in an
IDC. 
It appears Defendant reserved an IDC for August 16, 2024
that pertains to the discovery that is the subject of the instant motion.
On July 1, 2024, Defendant filed an IDC Statement providing, inter alia,
that “[i]nterrogatories were served upon Plaintiffs whom responded vaguely,
evasively and incompletely. Defendant on 6/3/24[1]
served and prematurely filed a motion to compel and sanctions on those
interrogatories responses prior to filing this IDC. The scheduled hearing on
that motion is set for 8/14/24.”  
The Court notes that the responding parties may file an IDC form in Department 50 setting
forth a response to Defendant’s IDC Statement three days prior to the IDC.   
Defendant must use the Court’s online reservation system to continue
the motion to a post-IDC discovery hearing date. The parties are ordered to
have with them whatever materials are needed to make the IDC session productive
and successful. Prior to the IDC date, lead or other designated counsel for the
parties with full authority, and any
self-represented parties are to meet and confer, in person or
via telephone in a further attempt to resolve as many of the
issues as possible before the IDC. (See CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).)
If the parties resolve their discovery disputes before the IDC date, Defendant is ordered to take both the August 16, 2024 IDC and the
motion off calendar as soon as possible. 
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
