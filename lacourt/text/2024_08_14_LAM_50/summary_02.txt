And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Teresa A. Beaudet, has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Masis Tamazyan and Elen Tahmasian (the "Moving Parties") against Siranush Akherdyan's complaint. The complaint alleges causes of action for declaratory relief related to real property resulting trust and deed of trust priority. The cross-complaint filed by Tahmasian against Akherdyan, Tamazyan, and others alleges causes of action for fraudulent conveyance, quiet title, cancellation of instrument, negligence, and declaratory relief.

The Judge notes that the Moving Parties' counsel's declaration identifies deficiencies in the complaint, including the applicability of the Statute of Frauds and the failure of Akherdyan's allegations regarding a deed of trust to establish ownership of the property at issue. However, the Judge finds that the Moving Parties did not demonstrate that they met and conferred with Akherdyan's counsel, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 439, subdivision (a).

As a result, the Judge orders the Moving Parties to meet and confer with Akherdyan within 10 days of the date of this order. If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues or are unable to meet and confer in good faith, the Moving Parties must file and serve a declaration setting forth their efforts to meet and confer within 15 days of this order. The hearing on the motion for judgment on the pleadings is continued to a date to be determined.
