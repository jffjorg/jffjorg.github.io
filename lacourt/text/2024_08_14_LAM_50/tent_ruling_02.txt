[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
MASIS TAMAZYANS
  AND ELEN TAHMASIANS MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS AGAINST PLAINTIFFS
  [sic] COMPLAINT




AND RELATED
  CROSS-ACTION


 



            
Background
Plaintiff Siranush Akherdyan (“Akherdyan”)
filed this action on April 25, 2023 against Defendants Masis Tamazyan
(“Tamazyan”) and Elen Tahmasian (“Tahmasian”). The Complaint alleges causes of
action for (1) declaratory relief re: real property resulting trust and (2) “in
the alternative,” declaratory relief re: deed of trust priority. 
On July 7, 2023, Tahmasian filed a
Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants Siranush Akherdyan, a.k.a Siranush
Akhverdyan, Soorage Tomasian, and Tamazyan. The Cross-Complaint alleges causes
of action for (1) fraudulent conveyance, (2) quiet title, (3) cancellation of
instrument, (4) negligence, and (5) declaratory relief.  
Tamazyan and Tahmasian (jointly, the “Moving
Parties”) now move for judgment on the pleadings as to both causes of action of
Akherdyan’s Complaint. Akherdyan opposes. 
Discussion

As an initial matter, the Court notes that the
Moving Parties’ counsel’s declaration filed in support of the motion provides, inter
alia, that “[o]n May 23, 2024, I sent a letter to Plaintiff’s attorney,
Manuel Duran, identifying deficiencies in the Complaint filed by Plaintiff
Siranush Akherdyan. In that letter, I outlined the reasons why the Complaint
fails to state a viable cause of action against my clients, including the
applicability of the Statute of Frauds and the failure of Plaintiff’s
allegations regarding a deed of trust to establish ownership of the property at
issue…To date, I have not received any response from Mr. Duran indicating that
Plaintiff will amend or dismiss her Complaint to address these deficiencies.” (Kakoian
Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.)
Mr. Kakoian’s declaration does not
demonstrate that the parties met and conferred by telephone, in person, or by
video conference regarding the Moving Parties’
motion for judgment on the pleadings. 
 Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 439, subdivision (a),
“[b]efore filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to this
chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or
by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject
to the motion for judgment on the pleadings for the purpose of determining if
an agreement can be reached that resolves the claims to be raised in the motion
for judgment on the pleadings. If an amended pleading is filed, the responding
party shall meet and confer again with the party who filed the amended pleading
before filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings against the amended
pleading.” (Emphasis added.) Such meeting and
conferring must be done in good faith with an effort to try to resolve the
issues subject to the motion for judgment on the pleadings.  
In light of the foregoing, the hearing on the Moving Parties’ motion for judgment on the pleadings is continued
to _______________, 2024
at 2 p.m. in Dept. 50.  
The Moving Parties are¿ordered
to meet¿and confer¿with Akherdyan within 10 days of the date of this order.¿If the parties
are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the parties are otherwise
unable to meet and confer in good faith, the Moving Parties are
to¿thereafter¿file and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet
and confer in compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 439, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿
The Moving Parties are
ordered to give notice of this order.
