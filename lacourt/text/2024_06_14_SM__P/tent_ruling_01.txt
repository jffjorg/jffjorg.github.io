Tebbens v. McKinnon, et al., Case No. 23SMCV02548
Hearing date June 14, 2024
Defendant McKinnon’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons
and Complaint
 
At the hearing on defendant’s
motion to quash on 3/15/24, plaintiff in pro per was ordered to serve
defendant via regular and certified mail at two Chicago addresses provided by
defense counsel. The motion was continued to 6/14/24 to allow plaintiff to
comply with the court’s order. Plaintiff has not filed proofs of service with
the court, nor other pleading responsive to the court's order. 
 
Defense counsel filed a
supplemental declaration dated 6/6/24, stating that on April 18, 2024, McKinnon
advised Schofield that he received the summons and complaint at both addresses.
Schofield Decl. ¶3. However, there was no proof of service, nor does it appear
the documents were served on defendant via certified mail, as ordered by the
court. 
 
Plaintiff must produce the
proof of service, showing that the documents were served both by certified mail
and U.S. mail. Further, if the documents were not served via certified mail,
that must be done. If not, the motion will be granted.
