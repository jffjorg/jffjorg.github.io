Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Tesla, Inc., moves to compel arbitration in this Song Beverly claim. The plaintiff did not file opposition. The lease agreement includes an arbitration provision, which states that any disputes arising out of or relating to the relationship between the parties will be resolved by a single arbitrator in an arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association. The court grants the defendant's motion and stays the action pending the completion of the arbitration. The court finds that the arbitration provision is enforceable under California law and the Federal Arbitration Act.
