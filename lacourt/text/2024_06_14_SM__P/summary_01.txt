And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint will be granted if the plaintiff does not provide proof of service showing that the documents were served both by certified mail and U.S. mail. The plaintiff was previously ordered to serve the defendant via regular and certified mail at two Chicago addresses, but has failed to file proofs of service with the court. Despite defendant's supplemental declaration stating that he received the summons and complaint at both addresses, no proof of service has been provided.
