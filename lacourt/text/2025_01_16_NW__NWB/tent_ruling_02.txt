Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability 
 
Respondent:
NO OPPOSITION
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Petitioner
Dwain Jackson’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability is GRANTED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This
action arises from a September 24, 2020, incident in which Claimant Nathan
Jackson (“Claimant”) alleges Defendants Paul Burke (“Burke”), Yordanose
Tesfasilase (“Tesfasilase”), and Does 1 to 10 (collectively “Defendants”) negligently
entrusted Claimant with an MX350 dirt bike, causing Claimant to sustain serious
injuries as a result.
 
On March 5, 2021, Claimant filed an action against
Defendant Forum Entertainment LLC (“Forum”) alleging one cause of action for premises
liability. On the same day, Claimant also filed an action against Burke and
Tesfasilase for general negligence.
 
On March 18, 2021, Petitioner Dwain Jackson
(“Petitioner”)’s application for appointment as Claimant’s guardian ad litem
was granted.
 
On February 8, 2024, Claimant filed a notice of
settlement.
 
On June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned to the
Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On October 4, 2024, Petitioner filed the
instant Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability on
behalf of Claimant.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Petitioner
seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $225,000.00
from Defendants.
 
Legal
Standard
 
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s or
incompetent’s claim can only be consummated with court approval. (Cal. Prob.
Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Cal. Code of Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this
purpose, a petition for approval must be presented to the court and, until it
is granted, there is no final settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co.
(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is
voidable by the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Ibid. at 1606.) 
 
Prob. Code § 3600, et seq., governs how the
settlement proceeds are to be paid. Pursuant to § 3601, the order shall approve
payment of reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows: 
 
The court making the order or giving the
judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further
order authorizing and directing that such reasonable expenses (medical or
otherwise and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator),
costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall
be paid from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the
benefit of the minor or incompetent person. (Prob. Code § 3601(a).) 
 
In cases pursuant to § 3601, “unless the court
has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee
standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from
money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person
with a disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 7.955(a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he
court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made
between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances
existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the
representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the
attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (CRC Rule 7.955(a)(2).)
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner
seeks court approval for a settlement under which Claimant would receive $225,000.00.
Of the $225,000.00 settlement, $3,320.08 is to be deducted for medical expenses,
$56,250.00 for attorney’s fees, and $2,122.33 for costs. Therefore, Claimant’s
proposed net settlement amount is $163,307.59.
 
The
Petition sets forth information that bears upon the reasonableness of the
compromise pursuant to CRC Rule 7.950. (MC-350 Exh. A [medical records].)
Additionally, attorney’s fees represent 25% of the total settlement agreement.
(MC-350 Attachment 17a.) Claimant’s counsel provides their retainer agreement as
Attachment 17a. Costs are reasonable considering the extent of litigation.
 
 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly,
the Petition filed on behalf of minor Claimant Nathan Jackson is GRANTED.  However, the proposed orders submitted on
7/29 must be corrected as to the hearing date and the net settlement amount.   The Court sets an OSC re submission of
proposed orders and dismissal on 2/19/2025.
 
Petitioner to give notice.
