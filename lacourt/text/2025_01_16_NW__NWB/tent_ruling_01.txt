BACKGROUND
 
On October
16, 2020, Plaintiff Haikanush Atoyan (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Hilalian Corporation (“Hilalian”), BP America, Inc. (“BP”), Atlantic
Richfield Company (“Atlantic Richfield”), and Does 1 to 50, alleging two causes
of action: (1) premises liability; and (2) general negligence. The complaint
alleges that, on or about October 16, 2018, Plaintiff slipped and fell due to
Defendants’ negligence and sustained injuries as a result.
 
A final
status conference (“FSC”) was held on August 26, 2024. Neither Plaintiff nor
Plaintiff’s counsel appeared. (See August 26, 2024, Minute Order.)
Defense counsel noted they had no contact with Plaintiff’s counsel for several
weeks. (Ibid.) This was the second FSC for which Plaintiff failed to
appear. Therefore, the Court dismissed the action, without prejudice, for
failure to prosecute pursuant to Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 583.210.
 
On September 20, 2024, Plaintiff
filed their first motion to set aside the dismissal. On December 5, 2024, the
motion was denied due to procedural deficiencies.
 
On December 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to set aside/vacate dismissal. The motion remains unopposed.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Section 473(b) provides for both
discretionary and mandatory relief [from dismissal]. [Citation.]” (Pagnini
v. Union Bank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 298, 302.) An application for
relief under this section must be made no more than six months after entry of
the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. § 473(b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
130, 143.) Additionally, an application for relief under this section “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
herein, otherwise the application shall not be granted.” (CCP § 473(b).) Relief
under this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Ibid.) When dismissal is the attorney’s
fault, the six-month period starts to run from the date of the entry of dismissal.
(CCP § 473(b); Sugasawara v. Newland (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294, 295.)
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff claims that dismissal was entered
as a result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Ter-Oganesyan
Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.) Plaintiff alleges that their non-appearance at the August 26,
2024, FSC was due to a calendaring error after the FSC, originally scheduled
for July 15, 2024, was vacated and continued. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 3-5.)
The Court
finds that Plaintiff’s argument has merit. 
Courts have found excusable neglect where a counsel calendaring error
resulted in dismissal. (Renteria v. Juvenile Justice, Dept. of Corrections
and Rehabilitation (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 903, 911; Bergloff v.
Reynolds (1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 349, 358-359.) Plaintiff’s motion now
includes an affidavit of fault as required by CCP § 473(b). 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Haikanush
Atoyan’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal is GRANTED.
