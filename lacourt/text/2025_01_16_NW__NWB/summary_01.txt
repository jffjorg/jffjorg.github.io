And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by Haikanush Atoyan, the plaintiff, to set aside a dismissal of their case against Hilalian Corporation, BP America, Inc., Atlantic Richfield Company, and Does 1 to 50. The case involves a premises liability and general negligence claim stemming from a slip-and-fall incident on October 16, 2018. The plaintiff failed to appear at a final status conference on August 26, 2024, and the court subsequently dismissed the case for failure to prosecute. The plaintiff has since filed two motions to set aside the dismissal, with the second motion being unopposed. The judge has found that the plaintiff's argument has merit and that the dismissal was the result of a calendaring error. Therefore, the judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal.
