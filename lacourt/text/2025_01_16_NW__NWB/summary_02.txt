And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition filed by Dwain Jackson, the guardian ad litem of minor Claimant Nathan Jackson, seeking approval of a settlement agreement between Claimant and Defendants Paul Burke, Yordanose Tesfasilase, and others. The settlement agreement provides that Claimant will receive $225,000.00, with $3,320.08 deducted for medical expenses, $56,250.00 for attorney's fees, and $2,122.33 for costs. The court finds that the proposed net settlement amount of $163,307.59 is reasonable.

The court grants the petition and approves the settlement agreement, subject to the correction of the proposed orders to reflect the correct hearing date and net settlement amount. The court sets a new hearing date of February 19, 2025, for the submission of proposed orders and dismissal.
