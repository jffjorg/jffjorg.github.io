TRIAL
  DATE: NONE



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
On March 1, 2022, Plaintiff Jill Stager
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Parmount Pictures
Corporation (“Paramount”) and Does 1 to 20 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging
two causes of action: (1) general negligence; and (2) premises liability.
On August 5, 2024, the action came for jury
trial, returning a verdict in Plaintiff’s favor.
On November 20, 2024, Paramount filed the
instant motion for new trial.
On December 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed their
opposition.
On December 19, 2024, Paramount filed their
reply.
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
The determination of a motion for new trial
rests so completely within the trial judge’s discretion that it will not be
disturbed on appeal unless a manifest and unmistakable abuse of discretion
clearly appears. (Schelbaurer v. Butler Mfg. Co. (1984) 35 Cal.3d 442,
452.) The rationale is that the trial judge is familiar with the evidence,
witnesses and proceedings of the case and is in the best position to determine
whether a new trial should be granted. (Jacoby v. Feldman (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d
432, 446.)
A motion for new trial asks the trial court
to reexamine one or more issues of fact or law after a trial and decision by
judge or jury. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc §§ 656 and 657.) Since the right to a
new trial is purely statutory, exact compliance is required with the procedural
steps for making and determining a motion for new trial. Any significant
departure from the procedural requirements deprives the trial court of any power
to grant the motion. The grounds for new trial are also entirely statutory and,
thus, the motion must be based on one or more of the following statutory
grounds:
(1) Irregularity in the proceedings;
(2) Jury misconduct;
(3) Accident or surprise;
(4) Newly discovered evidence;
(5) Excessive or inadequate damages;
(6) Insufficient evidence;
(7) Verdict or decision “against law;” or
(8) Error in law during trial.
(CCP § 657(1)-(7).)
If a motion for new trial is “made for a
cause mentioned on the first, second, third and fourth subdivisions of Section
657, it must be made upon affidavits; otherwise, it must be made on the minutes
of the court.” (CCP § 658.) Thus, a motion for new trial based on irregularity
in the proceedings, misconduct of the jury, accident or surprise, or newly
discovered evidence must be supported by affidavits. Other motions based on
insufficiency of the evidence, a verdict or decision against law, an error in
law, or excessive or inadequate damages must be made on the minutes of the
court. It is “implicit in the statement of the grounds of the motion whether it
will be made upon affidavits or the minutes of the court, or both.” (Nichols
v. Hast (1965) 62 Cal.2d 598, 601.) 
 
III.      
DISCUSSION 
Paramount
moves for a new trial based on excessive damages. (Memorandum of Points &
Authorities (“MPA”) p. 2:3-6.) Specifically, Paramount argues that the jury
failed to allocate any liability or damages to Plaintiff’s employer and that
future economic damages were excessive in the form of lost wages. (Ibid. at
2:7-11.) Finally, Paramount alleges insufficiency of the evidence instructional
error. (Ibid.)
 
Procedural
Deficiencies
As a preliminary matter, the Court
notes that Paramount failed to provide the minutes of the court upon which
their motion for new trial based on excessive damages and insufficiency of the
evidence relies. This provision is a strict statutory requirement pursuant to
CCP § 658. Therefore, Paramount’s motion is denied for procedural deficiencies.
However, for both parties’ benefit, the Court now analyzes the motion’s
substance.
 
Excessive
Damages
Paramount argues that the jury erred
in finding Paramount solely responsible for Plaintiff’s injuries, thereby failing
to apportion fault to Plaintiff’s employer and awarding excessive damages
against Paramount. (MPA p. 7:15-22.) Specifically, Paramount alleges that
Plaintiff’s employer, Fox studios (“Fox”), contributed to Plaintiff’s injuries
when their COVID-19 monitor pointed Plaintiff in the direction of the utility
closet where she fell. (Ibid.)
“When a motion for new trial is
based on the ground of excessive damages, the trial court is restricted to the
evidence presented at trial.” (Stevens v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. (1996)
49 Cal.App.4th 1645, 1660.) If a motion for new trial is granted because of
excessive damages, it must be based upon the totality of the evidence rather
than any particular portion of the record which can be readily pointed out. (Collins
v. Lucky Markets, Inc. (1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 645, 651.) The assessment of
damages is primarily the province of the jury and secondarily the province of the
trial court when ruling upon a motion for new trial. (Gersick v. Shilling (1950)
97 Cal.App.2d 641, 645.) “In the first instance, it is for the jury to fix the
amount of damages, and secondly, for the trial judge, on a motion for a new
trial, to pass on the question of adequacy.” (Ibid.) When granting a
motion for new trial on grounds of excessive damages awarded by a jury, the
trial court must find that the jury “clearly” should have reached a different
verdict. (Martinides v. Meyer (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1185, 1195.) “The
judge is not permitted to substitute his judgment for that of the jury on the
question of damages unless it appears from the record [that] the jury verdict
was improper.” (Bigboy v. County of San Diego (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 397,
406.)
The Court now looks to the evidence
presented at trial to determine if the jury was “clearly” wrong in finding
Paramount solely responsible for Plaintiff’s injuries. (On this point, the
Court notes that such review is made more difficult due to Paramount’s failure
to provide the minutes of the Court upon which their argument is based). The
underlying incident occurred when Plaintiff, a costumer for Fox studio’s
television show This Is Us, fell and incurred injuries while on Stage 3
at Paramount’s studio lot, which Fox had contracted for filming. (Complaint
First Cause of Action – General Negligence.) Specifically, Plaintiff fell in a
hole on stage which Paramount allegedly created. (Ibid.) The incident
occurred on March 26, 2021. (Ibid.) At the time, Fox employed a COVID-19
monitor on set to enforce COVID-19 safety protocols. (Cooper Decl. Exh. 5
[Norman (Scott) Dalrymple August 12, 2024, testimony] at 59:22-28.) This
monitor reportedly directed Plaintiff in the direction where she ultimately
fell. (Ibid.) Based on this fact, Paramount argues that the jury erred
in failing to find Fox liable to some degree. (MPA p. 7:15-22.) Paramount
compares the instant case to Schelbauer v. Butler Manufacturing Co. (1984)
35 Cal.3d 442, where the Supreme Court ordered a new trial on apportionment of
fault where “the evidence showed that: (1) the plaintiff, an experienced
ironworker, knew the roofing panels he was installing were coated with slippery
oil that increased the risk of falling, yet he took insufficient personal
safety precautions; (2) his employer had previous experience with the panels
and knew of the dangerous thick oil coating, yet neither wiped the panels nor
employed any safety methods to protect its workers; and (3) the defendant
manufacturer of the panels did not inspect them for excessive oil or include
warnings.” (MPA p. 9:7-12 [citing Schelbauer, supra, (1984) 35 Cal.3d at
456-457].) However, unlike the employer in Schelbauer, Paramount, both
in the instant motion and at trial, set forth no evidence that the COVID-19
monitor knew, or should have known, that there was a hole in the stage surface
in the direction where they pointed Plaintiff. For a defendant to be negligent,
or in this case Fox, a non-party to the litigation, they must show a “failure
to exercise [a] degree of care in a given situation . . .” (Federico v.
Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1207, 1214.) Pointing Plaintiff in a
particular direction, absent other evidence, does not show that Fox’s COVID-19
monitor failed to exercise a degree of care in that particular situation.
Conversely, the record provides evidence that Paramount failed to maintain the premises
resulting in an unexpected floor opening on Stage 3, which Plaintiff then fell
through. (Opp. Exh. B [August 9, 2024, trial transcript] 45:7-14.) Therefore,
the record does not show that the jury “clearly” should have reached a
different verdict when they found Paramount solely responsible for Plaintiff’s
injuries.
Accordingly, on the grounds of
excessive damages due to mistaken apportionment of fault, Paramount’s motion
fails.
 
Insufficient
Evidence – Future Wage Loss
Next, Paramount argues that there
is insufficient evidence to support the jury’s award of future wage loss
damages. (MPA p. 10:1-5.) Specifically, Paramount argues that Plaintiff’s
future wage loss damages mistakenly assume that, absent the accident, she would
have worked until the age of 70. (Ibid.) 
However, just because Paramount
disagrees with how the jury weighed Plaintiff’s evidence regarding future wage
loss, does not mean that there was an insufficiency of evidence for the purpose
of CCP § 657. “[A] new trial shall not be granted upon the ground of
insufficiency of the evidence . . . unless after weighing the evidence the
court is convinced from the entire record, including reasonable inferences
therefrom, that the court or jury clearly should have reached a different
verdict or decision.” (CCP § 657)(emphasis added.) Here, Paramount takes
issue with the trial testimony of Plaintiff’s economist Timothy Lanning
(“Lanning”). (See MPA pp. 10-13.) Specifically, Paramount argues that
Lanning’s estimate of Plaintiff’s retirement age was based on “various
assumptions. . .” (Ibid. at p. 10:22-24.) In contrast, Paramount points
to their expert’s estimation that Plaintiff’s projected retirement age is  65. (See MPA at pp. 11:18-28
and 12:1-9.) However, Paramount’s expert’s estimate is also an assumption based
on Plaintiff’s level of education and her age at the time of the incident. (Ibid.)
The jury weighed the conflicting expert and other testimony provided by both
sides, and neither shows that the jury “clearly should have reached a different
verdict or decision.” (CCP § 657.) In fact, Paramount admits that “[i]t does
not seem possible to quantify the precise retirement age assigned by the jury
in calculating the award of future wage loss.” (MPA p. 12 n. 5.) Therefore, it
appears that Paramount agrees with the Court that there is no clear showing
that the jury should have reached a different verdict or decision. As a result,
pursuant to CCP § 657, Paramount’s motion is denied on this basis.
 
Insufficient
Evidence – Paramount's Control of the Premises
Finally, Paramount argues that
there was insufficient evidence to prove that Paramount controlled the premises
at the time of the underlying incident. (MPA pp. 13:8-23 and 14:1-4.) To this
point, Paramount argues that Paramount was unable to freely access the stage
during Fox’s use. (MPA p. 14:7-15.) To support this argument, Paramount notes the
stringent COVID-19 restrictions in place as well as proprietary concerns that
prohibited Paramount from accessing Stage 3 during filming. (Ibid. at
16-26.) However, substantial evidence was provided during trial showing that
Paramount exercised control over the hole through which Plaintiff fell. Among
this evidence includes testimony that Paramount created the opening as a means
of accessing the utilities under its stage, that open stage doors were the
exact kind of hazard that Paramount’s security was to inspect during its daily
inspections, and that Paramount had previously exercised control over the hole
by covering the opening. (See Opp. Exh. A [August 8, 2024, trial
transcript] at 32:26-33:5, 48:21-50:6, 53:10-15, and 65:3-66; Opp. Exh.
C [August 12, 2024, trial transcript] at 45:6-12, 70:9-24, 71:6-19.) Once
again, just because Paramount disagrees with how the jury weighed Plaintiff’s
evidence regarding Paramount’s control of the premises, does not mean that
there was insufficiency of evidence for the purpose of CCP § 657. Paramount
fails to argue that the jury “clearly” should have arrived at a different
decision or verdict. Accordingly, pursuant to CCP § 657, Paramount’s motion is
denied.
 
Alleged
Instructional Error
Finally, Paramount argues that the
jury was erroneously instructed as to the control element of premises
liability, thereby justifying a new trial on the grounds of an “irregularity in
the proceedings.” (MPA p. 15:4-13.) However, pursuant to CCP § 658, a motion
for new trial based on irregularity in the proceedings must be supported by
affidavits. (CCP § 658.) Here, Paramount fails to provide any such affidavits.
Consequently, Paramount’s motion is denied on this ground, as well. 
 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
On both procedural and substantive
grounds, Paramount’s motion for a new trial pursuant to CCP § 657 is DENIED.
