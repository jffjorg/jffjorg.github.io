  FILED: MAY 19, 2022
TRIAL DATE: JANUARY 27,
  2025



 
I.       BACKGROUND
On May 19, 2022, Plaintiffs Evan Pugrad
(“Pugrad”), Trenton Hearin (“Hearin”), and Caroline Draper
(“Draper”)(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendant Nancy
Martinez (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50 alleging one cause of action for
motor vehicle negligence. Plaintiffs allege that, on or about May 22, 2020,
Defendant negligently operated her vehicle, colliding with Plaintiffs’ vehicle
and causing injuries thereof.
On December 19, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant motion to dismiss through terminating sanctions pursuant to
CCP §§ 2023.010 et seq.
 
Plaintiffs
have not filed an opposition.
A
non-jury trial is scheduled for January 27, 2025.
 
II.   
LEGAL STANDARD
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2023.030 permits
the Court, in its discretion, to impose the following types of terminating
sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a “misuse of the discovery
process”:
(1) An order striking out the pleadings or
parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
(2) An order staying further proceedings by
that party until an order for discovery is obeyed.
(3) An order dismissing the action, or any
part of the action, of that party.
(4) An order rendering a judgment by default
against that party.
(CCP § 2023.030(d).) 
Conduct that is a “misuse of the discovery
process” includes failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery and disobeying a court order to provide discovery. (CCP § 2023.010(d)
and (g).) “Imposition of sanctions for misuse of discovery lies within the
trial court's discretion, and is reviewed only for abuse.” (Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 991.) “The trial court
should consider both the conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party
seeking discovery[.]” (Ibid. at 992.) Sanctions should be tailored to
the harm created by the withheld discovery and should not be used as
punishment. (Ibid.) The court should also consider whether the discovery
misconduct was “willful” and whether the requesting party was prejudiced by the
other’s failure to comply. (Do It Urself Moving & Storage, Inc. v.
Brown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 27, 37.)
Lastly, courts have held that terminating
sanctions are warranted when a party repeatedly fails to propound adequate
discovery responses, even after the court imposed monetary sanctions. (Liberty
Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrations, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th
1093.) For example, in Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 262, the Court of Appeal held that five motions to compel created a
record “replete with evidence of [appellant’s] failures to answer discovery
requests.” (Ibid. at 279–280.)
 
III.  ANALYSIS
Defendant makes this motion on the grounds
that Plaintiffs failed to comply with the Court’s October 14, 2024, order to
provide discovery responses and pay sanctions. (Anderson Decl. ¶ 6; Exh. A
[ruling].) Additionally, Defendant claims that Plaintiffs have “abandoned their
case,” making dismissal appropriate pursuant to CCP § 2023. The Court notes
that, due to a significant breakdown in the attorney-client relationship,
Plaintiffs’ former counsel was relieved in November 2024. Plaintiffs have
remained wholly unresponsive in this action since serving Defendant in October
2023.
“A decision to order terminating sanctions
should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a
history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) Here, Plaintiffs did not comply with the Court’s
October 14, 2024, order. Additionally, Plaintiffs refuse to participate in this
litigation, indicating that less severe sanctions would fail to produce
Plaintiffs’ compliance. This action’s trial date of January 27, 2025, is
quickly approaching, while Defendant has been deprived of the opportunity to
prepare a meaningful defense due to Plaintiffs’ nonparticipation. Therefore,
the Court finds terminating sanctions proper.
 
IV.
 CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion
for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. Plaintiffs’ operative complaint is
dismissed with prejudice.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
