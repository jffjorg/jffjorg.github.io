And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant Nancy Martinez's motion to dismiss the action against her with prejudice due to Plaintiffs' failure to comply with discovery orders. The Plaintiffs, Evan Pugrad, Trenton Hearin, and Caroline Draper, alleged motor vehicle negligence against the Defendant, but failed to provide discovery responses and pay sanctions as ordered by the Court. The Court notes that the Plaintiffs' former counsel was relieved in November 2024, and the Plaintiffs have remained unresponsive in the action since serving the Defendant in October 2023. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs' non-participation in the litigation and failure to comply with the Court's orders warrant terminating sanctions, and grants the motion to dismiss the action with prejudice.
