And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the ex parte application for a writ of attachment and temporary protective order filed by United Guard Security, Inc. (Plaintiff). The application was denied due to multiple reasons, including that it must be heard in the Writs & Receivers Department, not the home court, and that Plaintiff did not serve the receiver or interested parties. The judge also orders Plaintiff to file a notice of related case in both the instant case and Case Number 23STCP01011, which is pending in Department 82. Additionally, Plaintiff's counsel must provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
