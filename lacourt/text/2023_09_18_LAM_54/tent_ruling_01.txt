BACKGROUND
                On July 15, 2020, Plaintiff Khaled J. Al-Sabah filed the
operative first amended complaint against Defendants Michael Edward Bass,
Ronald Richards, and Usman Shaikh, asserting causes of action for breach of
fiduciary duty, breach of contract, theft, money had and received, conversion,
and accounting. Al-Sabah alleges that Bass was to be Al-Sabah’s
“representative” in the United States. Al-Sabah alleges he wired Bass $2.5
million to hire attorney Defendant Shaikh to represent Al-Sabah in an unrelated
embezzlement lawsuit. Al-Sabah alleges that Bass kept $2 million of his money.
 
On December 20, 2022, Bass filed the
operative third amended cross-complaint against Al-Sabah, asserting causes of
action for (1) breach of written contract; (2) breach of oral contract; (3)
intentional interference with prospective economic advantage; and (4)
intentional interference with contractual business relations. The Court
sustained Al-Sabah's demurrer to the TACC without leave to amend.
 
On March 2, 2023, Plaintiff Al-Sabah
filed a new action for fraudulent conveyance against Defendant Bass in case no.
23STCV04590. This action was consolidated with 20STCV19934. On July 12, 2023,
Bass filed a first amended cross-complaint in case no. 23STCV04590 against
Al-Sabah for RICO violations.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken
to the whole complaint or to any of the causes of action in it.  (CCP § 430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only the legal
sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual allegations or the
plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations. 
(Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.
App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court must treat
as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law. 
(Id. at 732-33.)  The complaint
is to be construed liberally to determine whether a cause of action has been
stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
Al-Sabah demurs to the FACC for RICO
violations on the ground that it fails to state sufficient facts. RICO requires conduct of an enterprise
through a pattern of racketeering activity affecting interstate commerce, and
an injury caused to plaintiff’s business or property. (McMartin v.
Children’s Institute International (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1393, 1406.)
Plaintiffs are required to “‘specifically plead the time, place or nature of
the alleged communications constituting racketeering activity . . . .’” (People
v. Highland Federal Savings & Loan (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1692, 1713,
1715.)
 
Bass alleges Al-Sabah engaged in
racketeering activity by breaching Bass’s and Al-Sabah's alleged agreement that
Al-Sabah would pay Bass $5,000,000.00 in exchange for vague services. Bass also
alleges Al-Sabah engaged in racketeering activity by scheming with third-party
David Ross to transfer title of a corporation owned by Bass to another
third-party, David Turner. 
 
These allegations are insufficient to
state RICO claims against Al-Sabah. Al-Sabah's alleged breach of contract is
not racketeering activity and the remaining allegations against Al-Sabah are
limited and conclusory. Bass has not alleged an enterprise or pattern of
racketeering activity. Nor has Bass shown how a further amended complaint would
address these deficiencies.
 
Al-Sabah's demurrer is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend.
