And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Chad Darling vs. Arc Point Law and Mark Piesner. The case concerns a complaint filed by Darling against the defendants alleging legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract.

The defendants filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the third cause of action for breach of contract is insufficient because it does not attach a copy of the contract or plead its terms. The Judge overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations of breach of contract are sufficient.

The defendants also filed a motion to strike certain allegations from the complaint, including allegations regarding the failure to file a CCP § 473(b) motion in the underlying action, allegations regarding violations of professional rules, and the prayer for prejudgment interest. The Judge granted the motion as to the allegations regarding the failure to file a CCP § 473(b) motion and the allegations regarding violations of professional rules, finding them to be irrelevant or contradictory. However, the Judge denied the motion as to the prayer for prejudgment interest, finding that a basis for prejudgment interest may be apparent later in the action.

The Judge has given the parties 30 days from the notice of the ruling to file and serve a first amended complaint, and the defendants 30 days thereafter to file and serve a response.
