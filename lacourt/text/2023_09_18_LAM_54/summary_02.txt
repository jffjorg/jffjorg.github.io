And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions for sanctions filed by defendants Christopher Sorley and Michele Dobson against plaintiff Saul Larner. The motions were filed in response to Larner's complaint alleging malicious prosecution and SLAPP-back, which the Judge has previously determined to be without legal merit.

The Judge granted both motions, finding that Larner brought and maintained the action in bad faith. The Judge found that Larner was informed of the lack of legal basis for the action multiple times, but refused to dismiss the case and instead engaged in bad faith litigation tactics, including threats and frivolous State Bar complaints.

As a result, the Judge ordered Larner to pay $7,600.00 in attorney's fees to Sorley and $1,280.00 in attorney's fees to Dobson. The Judge also ordered that the sanctions be payable within 30 days.

**English Text Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

Judge Leiter has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motions for sanctions against the plaintiff, Saul Larner. The defendants, Christopher Sorley and Michele Dobson, argued that Larner's lawsuit for malicious prosecution and SLAPP-back was brought and maintained in bad faith, lacking legal basis. The judge agrees, noting that Larner was repeatedly informed of the flaws in his case but refused to dismiss it, instead engaging in threatening behavior and filing frivolous bar complaints.  Sorley is awarded $7,600 and Dobson is awarded $1,280 in attorney's fees, payable within 30 days.  The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.7 and 128.5, which allow for sanctions when a party's actions are frivolous or intended to harass.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

Judge Maurice A. Leiter tentatively granted the motions for sanctions filed by Defendants Christopher Sorley and Michele Dobson against Plaintiff Saul Larner.  The judge found that Larner's lawsuit, alleging malicious prosecution and a "SLAPP-back" claim, was brought in bad faith and had no legal basis.  The judge noted that Larner had been repeatedly informed by the Defendants that his claims were invalid, citing relevant statutes, but Larner refused to dismiss the case and instead made threats and filed complaints with the State Bar.  Because the underlying lawsuit was frivolous and intended to harass, the judge granted Sorley's request for $7,600.00 in attorney's fees and Dobson's request for $1,280.00 in attorney's fees. The sanctions are payable within 30 days. The Defendants are to provide notice of the ruling.
