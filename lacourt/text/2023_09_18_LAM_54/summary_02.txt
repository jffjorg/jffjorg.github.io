And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions for sanctions filed by defendants Christopher Sorley and Michele Dobson against plaintiff Saul Larner. The motions were filed in response to Larner's complaint alleging malicious prosecution and SLAPP-back, which the Judge has previously determined to be without legal merit.

The Judge granted both motions, finding that Larner brought and maintained the action in bad faith. The Judge found that Larner was informed of the lack of legal basis for the action multiple times, but refused to dismiss the case and instead engaged in bad faith litigation tactics, including threats and frivolous State Bar complaints.

As a result, the Judge ordered Larner to pay $7,600.00 in attorney's fees to Sorley and $1,280.00 in attorney's fees to Dobson. The Judge also ordered that the sanctions be payable within 30 days.
