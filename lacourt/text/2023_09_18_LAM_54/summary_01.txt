Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint, which alleged RICO violations. The court found that the allegations were insufficient to state RICO claims against the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant engaged in racketeering activity by breaching a contract and scheming with a third party to transfer title of a corporation. The court held that these allegations were limited and conclusory, and that the defendant failed to allege an enterprise or pattern of racketeering activity. The court also held that the defendant's allegations against the plaintiff were based on a breach of contract, which is not racketeering activity. The court sustained the plaintiff's demurrer without leave to amend.

The Judge has sustained Al-Sabah's demurrer without giving Bass an opportunity to amend the complaint.

**English Summary of Tentative Ruling:**

Judge Leiter has issued a tentative ruling sustaining Plaintiff Khaled Al-Sabah's demurrer to Defendant Michael Bass's first amended cross-complaint (FACC) for RICO violations, *without* granting Bass leave to amend. This means Bass's RICO claim against Al-Sabah is dismissed and Bass cannot refile it in this case. The Judge found that Bass's allegations of racketeering activity were insufficient and conclusory, failing to adequately plead an enterprise or pattern of racketeering. The alleged breach of contract by Al-Sabah is not considered racketeering, and the other allegations lack the required specificity. Al-Sabah must provide notice of this ruling. If the parties agree with the tentative ruling, they can notify the court via email before 8:00 AM on September 18, 2023.

**Summary in English Text:**

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by Khaled J. Al-Sabah (Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant) against a First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) filed by Michael Edward Bass (Defendant/Cross-Complainant) alleging RICO violations.  Judge Maurice A. Leiter states that the Court has reviewed the relevant filings. The original case involves Al-Sabah's claims against Bass for breach of contract and other related issues stemming from Al-Sabah sending Bass $2.5 million, allegedly for legal representation, of which Bass allegedly kept $2 million.  Bass's FACC alleges Al-Sabah violated RICO through breach of a separate $5 million agreement and a scheme involving third parties.  The Judge *tentatively rules* that Al-Sabah's demurrer is **sustained without leave to amend**, meaning Bass's RICO claim is dismissed and he is not given another opportunity to revise it.  The Judge finds that Bass's allegations are insufficient to establish a RICO claim, specifically noting that a breach of contract is not racketeering activity and that Bass failed to allege an enterprise or pattern of racketeering activity. Al-Sabah is to provide notice of the ruling.
