Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint, which alleged RICO violations. The court found that the allegations were insufficient to state RICO claims against the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant engaged in racketeering activity by breaching a contract and scheming with a third party to transfer title of a corporation. The court held that these allegations were limited and conclusory, and that the defendant failed to allege an enterprise or pattern of racketeering activity. The court also held that the defendant's allegations against the plaintiff were based on a breach of contract, which is not racketeering activity. The court sustained the plaintiff's demurrer without leave to amend.
