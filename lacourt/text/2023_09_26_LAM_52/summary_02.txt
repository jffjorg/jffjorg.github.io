And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel further responses from defendant C.R. Laurence Co., Inc. to requests for production. The plaintiff, Federico Hernandez, is seeking to compel the defendant to serve further responses to requests Nos. 1-7, 12-15, 17-24, 26-33, 35-53, 55-65, and 68. The defendant objected to these requests, citing attorney-client privilege and work product. However, the defendant did not provide a privilege log, which is required by California Civil Code (CCP) § 2031.240(c)(1).

The court finds that the defendant's objections are sustained as to requests Nos. 6, 7, and 38, and the defendant is ordered to serve further verified responses, including a privilege log, within 20 days. The defendant is also ordered to serve a further verified response without objections to request No. 70 within 20 days.

The court also denies the defendant's request for $2,588.25 in sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel. The court finds that the plaintiff acted with substantial justification in bringing this motion and that the motion achieved meaningful results.

Overall, the court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant as to requests Nos. 6, 7, 38, and 70.
