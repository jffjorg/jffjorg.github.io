And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Charter Communications, Inc. is sustained without leave to amend as to the 14th Amendment and 15 USC § 45 claims. The judge has also held that the Unruh Act claim is not viable because a lack of a physical address is not a protected class under the statute. Additionally, the judge has ruled that the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) claim is not viable because the plaintiff has not alleged any economic injury or loss.

The judge's ruling is based on the doctrine of res judicata, which bars re-litigation of claims that have been previously litigated and decided with finality. The judge has also relied on the case law interpreting the UCL and the Unruh Act.

The plaintiff, Shannon Irons, had alleged that Charter Communications, Inc. discriminated against him by refusing to provide him with a Charter account based on his lack of a physical address. However, the judge has held that the claims are barred by res judicata because the plaintiff had previously filed a complaint in federal court alleging the same claims and the complaint was dismissed without leave to amend.

The judge has ordered the defendant to prepare a proposed judgment.
