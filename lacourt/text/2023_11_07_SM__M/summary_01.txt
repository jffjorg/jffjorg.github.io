And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for leave to amend its answers to the complaints of the plaintiffs. The defendant seeks to add two new affirmative defenses, the business judgment rule and the rule of judicial deference, and to clarify and assert references to specific sections of California's statute of limitations defenses. The judge finds that the proposed amendments are technical and do not substantially prejudice the plaintiffs. The judge also notes that the defendant's answers and motion for summary judgment previously put the plaintiffs on notice of the relevant issues. The judge denies leave to amend only if the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory and the delay has prejudiced the opposing party. In this case, the judge finds that the defendant's proposed amendments are not dilatory and will not prejudice the plaintiffs. The motion is granted.
