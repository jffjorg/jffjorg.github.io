And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Plaintiff's Counsel, Edgar Manukyan. The Motion was unopposed and complies with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. The parties had previously agreed to binding arbitration, and the action was dismissed. The declaration in support of the Motion states that the Plaintiff and Plaintiff's Counsel have irreconcilable differences regarding the further handling of the action. The Court finds that the withdrawal of Plaintiff's Counsel does not appear to be unduly prejudicial to the Plaintiff at this time.
