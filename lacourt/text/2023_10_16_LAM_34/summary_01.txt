And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Motion to Amend Judgment to add Dr. Leevil SPE, LLC as a judgment debtor and identify D-Day Capital, LLC as an alter ego of Dr. Leevil, LLC without prejudice. The Judge found that the Motion was untimely and that Judgment Debtors were not served with the Motion. The Judge also found that the alleged alter ego, Dr. Leevil SPE, LLC, was not a party to the original lawsuit and was not served with the Motion. Therefore, the Judge determined that it would be a violation of Dr. Leevil SPE, LLC's due process to reach the merits of the Motion without service. The Judge did not make a determination on whether Dr. Leevil SPE, LLC is an alter ego of Dr. Leevil, LLC or whether D-Day Capital, LLC is an alter ego of Dr. Leevil, LLC.
