ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
An attorney moving to be relieved as counsel under California Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) must meet the requirements set out in California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
 
To comply with rule 3.1362, the moving party must submit the following
forms: (1) Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; (2)
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; and (3)
Order Granting Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(a), (c), (e).) 
 
The moving party must serve the aforementioned forms on the client and
all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(d).) Further, when the client is served by mail, the attorney's
declaration must show that the client's address was confirmed within the last
30 days and how it was confirmed. (Id.) 

 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for
withdrawal should be granted. (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.) 
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel complies with all of the
requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, in that Counsel
provided notice of motion and motion to be relieved as counsel; proposed order
granting attorney’s motion to be relieved as counsel; and declaration in
support of the motion to be relieved as counsel. 
 
The declaration states that Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s Counsel have come
to a point of irreconcilable differences with regards to the further handling
of this action. No further details are provided. 
 
This
matter has been stayed so that the Parties may procced to binding arbitration. 
 
The motion is
unopposed, and the withdrawal of Plaintiff’s Counsel does not appear to be
unduly prejudicial to Plaintiff at this time.
 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED.
