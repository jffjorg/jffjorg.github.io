And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by a judge in a case between Plaintiff Bank of America, N.A. and Defendants Kelly Young Ok and Chaerin Hazel Ok. The Plaintiff has filed four motions: (1) Motion for an Order to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories to Plaintiff's Form Interrogatories (Set Nos. One and Two) [and] Request for Monetary Sanctions; (2) Motion for an Order to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories to Plaintiff's Special Interrogatories (Set One) [and] Request for Monetary Sanctions; (3) Motion for an Order to Compel Production of Documents to Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents (Set One) [and] Request for Monetary Sanctions; and (4) Motion for an Order that the Truth of the Matters Specified in Plaintiff's Request for Admissions (Set No. One) be Deemed Admitted [and] Request for Monetary Sanctions.

The Court grants all four motions, ordering the Defendants to provide initial responses to the discovery requests within 14 days. The Court also imposes monetary sanctions on the Defendants for failing to serve timely responses to the discovery requests.

The Court declines to award attorney's fees and costs to the Plaintiff due to an unreasonably inflated fee request. The Court finds that the hourly rate and costs incurred are reasonable, but the hours incurred for the hearings are duplicative and no reasonable attorney would take two hours to draft these motions.
