ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
An attorney moving to be relieved as counsel under California Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) must meet the requirements set out in California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
 
To comply with rule 3.1362, the moving party must submit the following
forms: (1) Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; (2)
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel; and (3)
Order Granting Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a), (c), (e).) 
 
The moving party must serve the aforementioned forms on the client and
all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(d).) Further, when the client is served by mail, the attorney's
declaration must show that the client's address was confirmed within the last
30 days and how it was confirmed. (Id.) 

 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for
withdrawal should be granted.  (People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Counsel’s Motions to be Relieved as Counsel comply with of the
requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, in that Counsel
provided notices of motion and motions to be relieved as counsel; proposed
orders granting attorney’s motions to be relieved as counsel; and declarations
in support of the motions to be relieved as counsel. 
 
The declarations state that “[i]rreconcilable differences between the
Defendants and Defendants’ current counsel of record” have occurred. No further
details are provided. 
 
This case was filed 1½ years ago. 
Trial is scheduled to begin in two months from the date of the hearing
on these Motions. Relieving Defense Counsel at this time would be prejudicial
to both Defendants because: (1) it is unlikely they would be able to find new
counsel in time for trial; and (2) a motion for summary adjudication has
already been filed in this matter and that motion is scheduled to be heard in
one month. 
 
Further, as a corporate entity, Defendant Restaurant Design Studio
Corp. could not participate in this action in propria persona even if it
wanted to. (Merco Constr. Eng’rs, Inc. v. Mun. Ct. (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724,
730.) 
 
Defense Counsel has not provided sufficient information that would
indicate that Defense Counsel must be relieved immediately. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motions to be Relieved as Counsel are DENIED.
