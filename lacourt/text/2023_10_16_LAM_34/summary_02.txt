And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motions to be relieved as counsel filed by Defense Counsel Mark Skapik and Skapik Law Group on behalf of Defendants Heriberto Camacho, Jr. and Restaurant Design Studio Corp. The motions were filed without opposition and the judge found that they comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. However, the judge noted that relieving Defense Counsel at this time would be prejudicial to both Defendants, as it is unlikely they would be able to find new counsel in time for trial and a motion for summary adjudication has already been filed. The judge also cited California law in support of its decision, including People v. Prince and Merco Constr. Eng'rs, Inc. v. Mun. Ct.
