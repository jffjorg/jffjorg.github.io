And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's ruling is a tentative decision made prior to a hearing on November 22, 2024. On November 19, 2024, the judge granted in part a defendant's ex parte application to continue the hearing. The judge notes that an earlier minute order from October 4, 2024, stated that all discovery deadlines remained in place unless the parties agreed otherwise or the court ordered otherwise after a motion to reopen discovery. The defendant did not file a motion to continue trial until November 4, 2024, and did not file a motion to reopen discovery. The judge granted the defendant's motion to shorten time, but did not reopen discovery. The judge's ruling suggests that the defendant's failure to file timely motions may have contributed to the outcome.
