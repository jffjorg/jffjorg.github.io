[1] On
November 19, 2024, the Court granted in part Defendant’s ex parte application
and continued the hearing for this motion to November 22, 2024. (Min. Order,
11/19/24.) 


[2] The
Court notes that in its October 4, 2024 minute order, the Court expressly
indicated that all discovery deadlines “remain associated with the prior trial
date unless otherwise stipulated by the parties or subject to Court order after
a noticed motion to reopen discovery.” (See Minute Order Dated 10/4/24.)
Defendant then did not file a motion to continue trial until November 4, 2024,
and did not file a motion to reopen discovery. Then, waiting until November 18,
2024, Defendant finally moved ex parte for an order shortening time, which the
Court granted in order to hear the motion.
