And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition filed by Petitioner Christel Reyna on behalf of Claimant Rafael Reyna, a person with a disability. The judge denies the petition without prejudice due to several issues with the petition. Specifically, the judge finds that Petitioner failed to complete certain items in the petition, including item 11b(2), 11b(3), and 11b(4). The judge also notes that the petition requests attorney fees, but the attorney declaration must provide more discussion of the factors in California Rules of Court, rule 7.995(b) in order to justify the amount. Additionally, the judge finds that the response in item 17e must be changed and attachment 17e must be provided. The judge instructs Petitioner to complete items 14 and 15 and to give notice and file proof of service of the denial. The hearing is scheduled for November 22, 2024.
