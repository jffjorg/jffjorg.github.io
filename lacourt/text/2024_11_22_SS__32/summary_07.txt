And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition filed by Nakeithia Robinson on behalf of Khalon Madison, a 16-year-old minor who was injured in a motor vehicle accident on January 23, 2020. The court denies the petition without prejudice due to several defects. The petition must be revised to correct the form MC-350 and include recent medical records showing that the claimant is fully recovered from his injuries. Additionally, the court requires a new application to appoint a guardian ad litem, which was previously rejected. The court also notes that the petition's request for attorney fees is not supported by the declaration of counsel and approves only 33% of the gross settlement. The court orders the petitioner to give notice and file proof of service of the denial.
