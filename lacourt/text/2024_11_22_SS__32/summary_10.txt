The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial and all related dates.

The parties have agreed to the continuance. The judge finds good cause to grant the continuance, citing the need for the parties to attend the mediation and the plaintiff's counsel having a trial in another case set for January 13, 2025. The trial is continued to August 11, 2025, and all discovery and pre-trial motion cut-off dates shall be in accordance with the new trial date.
