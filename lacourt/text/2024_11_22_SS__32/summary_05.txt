Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial and all related dates. The defendant had sought a continuance to conduct additional discovery, including deposing Plaintiff's former teachers from Kipp Academy and investigating Plaintiff's treatment at Centre for Neuro Skills. The judge found that the defendant had not made an adequate showing of good cause for the continuance, and that reopening discovery was not warranted. The judge also noted that the discovery deadlines had already passed, and that the defendant had not cited or discussed section 2024.050 to reopen discovery. As a result, the motion to continue the trial was denied.
