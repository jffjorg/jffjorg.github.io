  Case Number:  24PSCV00357    Hearing Date:   July 3, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
U.S. Bank’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment
Defendant: Freddy Alberto Duron AKA Freddy A. Duron
TENTATIVE RULING     
Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is an action for repossession. On February 5, 2024, plaintiff U.S. Bank
National Association (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Freddy
Alberto Duron AKA Freddy A. Duron (Defendant) and Does 1 through 10, alleging
one cause of action for replevin (claim and delivery) and recovery of personal
property – vehicle. 
            On
April 4, 2024, default was entered against Defendant. On May 22, 2024,
Plaintiff requested entry of default judgment.           
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’
fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks only possession of the subject vehicle. The Court finds that Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment has a couple issues. First, Plaintiff did
not submit the original loan agreement or a declaration in lieu of the original
explaining why the original cannot be produced. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1806; Kahn v. Lasorda’s Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109
Cal.App.4th 1118, 112.) Plaintiff must comply with this requirement before the
Court can award default judgment to Plaintiff. Second, since Plaintiff is the
assignee of the original creditor of this loan agreement, (Bevins Decl., ¶ 6),
Plaintiff needs also to have submitted the request for entry of default
judgment on Form CIV-105 per Rule 3.1800, subdivision (a), of the California
Rules of Court, (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a); see Code Civ.
Proc., § 1788.50 et seq. [Fair Debt Buying Practices Act]). 
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
