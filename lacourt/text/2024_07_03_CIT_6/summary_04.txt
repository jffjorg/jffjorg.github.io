The court concludes that plaintiff's claims against defendant are barred by the statute of limitations, and that defendant did not spend any time outside of California between October 2021 and November 2023. The court also rejects plaintiff's request to continue the hearing for 180 days to permit further discovery to be conducted, finding that plaintiff has failed to show a justifiable reason for the delay.
