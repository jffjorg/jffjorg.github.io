   [1] The Court  notes that Plaintiff moves under both Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.480  and 2025.610, subdivision (b), the latter of which does not appear to require  evidence of meet-and-confer efforts. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.480,  2025.610.)   [2] The Court does not read the May 31, 2024  deposition as a continued deposition, but rather as a second deposition under  Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.610, subdivision (b). The deadline for  Plaintiff to have moved to compel based on the prior deposition was 60 days  from the date the parties received the deposition transcript from the court  reporter. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (b); 15. [8:787] Motion to  Compel Answers:, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 8E-15 [“completion  of the record” determined upon either the court reporter sending the transcript  or the expiration of the time to sign or correct the transcript].) The  deposition transcript submitted with the moving papers does not indicate when  it was completed, but the Court infers it was completed more than 60 days  before Plaintiff filed this motion. (See Mohamadi Decl., Ex. 3; Id., Ex.  5 [March 21, 2024 email from Plaintiff’s counsel regarding second deposition  date].)
