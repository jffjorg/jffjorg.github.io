Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court grants Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant Rodriguez to appear and testify at a subsequent deposition. The Court finds that Plaintiff has good cause to conduct a second deposition, as Defendant Rodriguez's credibility could be questioned and specific responsive documents were not produced prior to his deposition. The Court orders Defendant Rodriguez to appear and testify at the second deposition within 30 days of the Court's order.
