Here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion for leave to file an amended answer. The defendants seek to add an affirmative defense of immunity under Government Code section 830.2, relating to trivial conditions. The judge finds that the defendants have generally complied with the rules of court and that the amendment is necessary and proper. Although the plaintiff argues that the defendants' motion is untimely and that the amendment would prejudice them, the judge disagrees, finding that the plaintiff has not shown prejudice and that the defendants' motion does not unduly delay the trial. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not argued that the affirmative defense has been waived. The motion is granted, and the defendants are ordered to file the proposed amended answer within 10 days of the order.
