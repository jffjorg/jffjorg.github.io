The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Kaylee Franco, a minor, versus Lisa Wiscombe. The Judge has excused the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, and allowed counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. The Judge has reviewed the petition to approve a compromise of the disputed claim of a minor and has identified several defects that preclude the granting of the petition at this time. These defects include a lack of reduction agreement from Orthopaedic Institution for Children, inconsistent medical expenses listed, and missing costs and medical expenses from Medi-Cal. The Judge has ordered counsel to file a new petition, proposed order, and order to deposit into a blocked account, correcting all errors identified. The petition is continued for 60 days in Department 30 at Spring Street.
