And here is the English text that summarizes the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants Defendant Jonathan Gille's motion to quash the deposition subpoena issued to his insurance carrier, Allstate. The subpoena demands production of a wide range of insurance records, including medical records, correspondence, payments, and policy information. The court finds that Defendant has raised an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in these records, and Plaintiff has failed to articulate any legitimate or important countervailing interest in their disclosure. As a result, the court quashes the subpoena, citing the California Constitution's protection of the right to privacy and the attorney-client privilege.
