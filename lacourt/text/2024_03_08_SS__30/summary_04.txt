Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motions to compel responses to Special Interrogatories and Request for Production, as well as the request for sanctions, as moot. The Defendant has now served responses to the discovery at issue, rendering the motions unnecessary. The judge also found that the Defendant's failure to serve timely responses was due to understaffing and mis-calendaring, and that the opposing counsel provided substantial justification for the delay. As a result, the request for sanctions was denied.
