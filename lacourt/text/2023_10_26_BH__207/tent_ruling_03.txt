Court notes the original September 15, 2023 Minute Order erroneously indicates,
“Pursuant to oral stipulation, the Non-Jury Trial scheduled for 10/02/2023 is
advanced to this date and continued to 11/13/23[.]”  (September 15, 2023 Minute Order.)  In fact, the Court continued the trial
date.  (See October 25, 2023 Minute Order
[Nunc Pro Tunc Order].)
