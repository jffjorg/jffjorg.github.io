And here is the English summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling dismissing the case for failure to bring it to trial within the statutory deadline. The case was filed on February 14, 2017, and the parties have failed to bring it to trial within the five-year statutory deadline. The parties had previously orally stipulated to waive the five-year statute of limitations and extend the trial deadline to October 2, 2023, but they did not stipulate to extend the time to bring the action to trial past that date. As October 2 has now passed, the Court finds it appropriate to dismiss the case for failure to bring it to trial in accordance with Section 583.330 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
