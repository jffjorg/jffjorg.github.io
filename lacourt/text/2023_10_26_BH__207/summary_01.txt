And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is a summary of the court's thinking based on information presented before the hearing. The ruling addresses two motions: a demurrer by the defendants and a motion to quash service of summons by the defendants. The demurrer argues that the unlawful detainer complaint fails to state a cause of action and that the notice to pay rent or quit is defective. The Judge finds that the notice is not defective, as it provides the required information and the amount listed is not a defect. The Judge also finds that the defendants were properly served by posting the summons and complaint. The motion to quash service of summons argues that the service was improper because the plaintiff did not obtain an order to post. The Judge finds that the service was proper, as the plaintiff obtained an order to post and the defendants were served by posting and certified mail. The Judge denies both motions and orders the defendants to file an answer to the complaint and respond to the motion to quash service of summons.
