MOTION
 
On February 14, 2017, Plaintiffs Christian Spannhoff, 10 NB Partnership,
and 01 BH Partnership (“Plaintiffs”) sued Defendant Derek Aghchay (“Defendant”)
for trespass, declaratory relief, injunctive relief and quiet title.  
 
Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiffs’ action failure to bring the
action to trial within 5 years after commencement of the action.  Plaintiffs have not opposed the motion.
  
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310, “[a]n action shall be brought to trial within
five years after the action is commenced against the defendant.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.310.)  “An action shall
be dismissed by the court on its own motion or on motion of the defendant,
after notice to the parties, if the action is not brought to trial within the
time prescribed in this article.  The
requirements of this article are mandatory and are not subject to extension,
excuse, or exception except as expressly provided by statute.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.360.)  Dismissal is warranted where the plaintiff
has failed to prosecute the action with “reasonable diligence.”  (Dunsmuir Masonic Temple v. Superior Court
(1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 17, 22-23.)  However,
Civil Code of Procedure section 583.330 provides:
 
The parties may extend the time within which an
action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article by the following
means: 
 
(a) By written stipulation.  The stipulation need not be filed but, if it
is not filed, the stipulation shall be brought to the attention of the court if
relevant to a motion for dismissal.  
 
(b) By oral agreement made in open court, if
entered in the minutes of the court or a transcript is made.
 
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
 
            Plaintiffs filed the complaint on
February 14, 2017.  The case was stayed
for a time due to a pending bankruptcy proceeding.  On April 30, 2021, a jury trial was set for
January 24, 2022.  (See June 1, 2021
Minute Order.)  On January 24, Plaintiffs
counsel did not appear, so the Court set a Final Status Conference for April 8,
2022 and scheduled a jury trial for April 25, 2022.  (January 24, 2022 Minute Order.)  
 
On April 8, 2022, the parties orally stipulated to “waive the five (5)
year statute of limitations to bring the matter to trial” and were “directed to
file a stipulation and proposed order regarding the waiver” and orally
stipulated to continue the trial from April 25, 2022 to September 12,
2022.  (April 8, 2022 Minute Order.)  On April 20, 2022, the parties filed a
written stipulation to extend the five-year deadline to October 22, 2022.  The Court granted the written stipulation.
 
At the September 12, 2022 trial, there were no appearances by either
party.  The Court continued the jury
trial to September 28, 2022.  (September
12, 2022 Minute Order.)  On September 28,
2022, the Court continued the final status conference, status conference re
mediation, and jury trial to October 18, 2022. 
(September 28, 2022 Minute Order.)
 
On October 18, 2022, the final status conference and jury trial were
placed off calendar so the parties could pursue a mandatory settlement
conference.
 
The February 17, 2023 Minute Order reflects, “All parties orally
stipulate to waive the five year statute of limitations to bring the case to
trial, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 583.330(b), to 09/01/2023.”  (February 17, 2023 Minute Order.)  The final status conference was scheduled for
April 28, 2023, and a non-jury trial were scheduled for May 8, 2023.  (Ibid.)  At the March 24, 2023 mandatory settlement
conference, the case did not settle. 
(See March 24, 2023 Minute Order.) 

 
The April 28, 2023 Minute Order indicates, “Pursuant to oral
stipulation, the Final Status Conference scheduled for 04/28/2023 is continued
to 09/15/23 at 09:30 AM in Department 207 at Beverly Hills Courthouse” and
“Pursuant to oral stipulation, the Non-Jury Trial scheduled for 05/08/2023 is
advanced to this date and continued to 10/02/23 at 10:00 AM in Department 207
at Beverly Hills Courthouse.”  Counsel
for Defendant was to give notice.  (April
28, 2023 Minute Order.)
 
On September 14, 2023, Defendant filed a “Notice of Violation of Code
of Civil Procedure 583.310.”
 
At the September 15, 2023 hearing, Defendant indicated that Plaintiffs
failed to serve Defendant with the trial documents, and Defendant argued the
case should be dismissed pursuant to the 5-year rule.  The Court permitted the parties to brief the
issue.  Further, the Court continued the
final status conference and trial because the parties were not ready for trial
as the Court did not receive joint trial documents as required. [1]  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant argues that at the February 17, 2023 hearing, Defendant orally
stipulated in court to temporarily waive the five-year statute to bring the action
to trial to September 1, 2023, and because the case was not brought to trial by
September 1, 2023, the case must be dismissed. 

 
“Section 583.330 does not address what terms comprise an oral
agreement extending the trial deadline.” 
(Nunn v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 346, 354
(hereafter Nunn).)  However, the
“Supreme Court concluded that parties may extend the trial deadline either by
expressly waiving the benefit of the mandatory dismissal statute or by agreeing
to postpone the trial to a specific date that is beyond the statutory
period.”  (Ibid.)  “The justification for permitting parties to
extend the trial deadline without expressly referring to the dismissal statute
is that ‘[a] stipulation to extend the time of trial beyond the [statutory]
period necessarily waives the right to a dismissal of the action’ under the
statute.”  (Id. at p. 355.)
 
Defendant acknowledges that at the April 28, 2023 Final Status
Conference, “the Court found the parties were not ready for trial” and on that
date the trial date was continued to October 2, 2023.  Despite Defendant’s characterization that
“the Court continued” the trial date to October 2, 2023, the April 28, 2023
Minute Order indicates, “Pursuant to oral stipulation, the Final Status
Conference scheduled for 04/28/2023 is continued to 09/15/23 at 09:30 AM in
Department 207 at Beverly Hills Courthouse” and “Pursuant to oral stipulation,
the Non-Jury Trial scheduled for 05/08/2023 is advanced to this date and
continued to 10/02/23 at 10:00 AM in Department 207 at Beverly Hills
Courthouse.”  
 
Thus, on April 28, 2023, the parties entered into an oral stipulation
to continue the trial date to October 2, and such oral stipulation was entered
into the Minute Order, satisfying the requirements of Section 583.330.  As such, October 2 became the date that the
trial needed to commence per Section 583.310. 
(See Nunn, 64 Cal.App.5th at p. 351 [“We conclude the parties’
agreement here to a trial date outside the three-year period extended the
statutory deadline to that trial date”].) 

 
However, the parties did not stipulate, either orally or in writing,
to extend the time to bring the action to trial past October 2.  As that date has now passed, the Court finds
it appropriate to dismiss for failure to bring the case to trial in accordance
with Section 583.330.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Defendant’s motion to dismiss for failure
to bring the action to trial by October 2, 2023 under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 583.310 and 583.360.  
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof
of service regarding the same.
