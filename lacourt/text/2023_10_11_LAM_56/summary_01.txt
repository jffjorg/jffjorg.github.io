```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the motion to compel responses to requests for production, set one (RFPs) filed by the defendant, 91 Enterprise, LLC. The plaintiff, Lavi Ben Hamo, had requested multiple extensions to respond to the RFPs due to illness, but ultimately provided the responses on September 21, 2023. The Judge finds that the defendant has provided evidence that the plaintiff had waived any objections by not responding to the RFPs in a timely manner. However, the Judge exercises its discretion and does not award monetary sanctions to the defendant, as it would not be equitable to assess sanctions under these circumstances. The motion is moot insofar as it seeks to compel responses, and the plaintiff should seek relief from the waiver by filing a motion.
