  RESPONSES 
 
Date: October 11, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.

MOVING PARTY: Defendant 91 Enterprise, LLC (“Moving Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
 
The Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of an
employment relationship.  The currently
operative first amended complaint (the “FAC”) alleges: (1) failure to pay
minimum wage; (2) failure to pay overtime compensation; (3) failure to pay
wages for missed rest periods; (4) failure to pay wages when due; (5) failure
to provide accurate and itemized wage statements; and (6) violation of the
Unfair Competition Law.  
 
 
            On
September 14, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s
responses to Requests for Production, Set One (“RFPs”) (the “Motion”).  The Motion also requests monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff and counsel for Plaintiff’s failure to submit timely
responses to the RFPs.  
             
DISCUSSION
Under California Code of Civil
Procedure (“CCP”) section 2031.300, where there has been no timely response
to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party
may seek an order compelling a response.  (CCP § 2031.300, subd.
(b).)  Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including
privilege and work product.  (CCP § 2031.300, subd. (a).)  The moving party is not required to meet and confer before filing a
motion to compel responses to requests for production, a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories, or a motion to deem requests for admission
admitted.  (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.)
 
In support of the Motion, Moving Defendant provides evidence that it
propounded the RFPs on July 31, 2023. 
(Declaration of Benjamin Davidson (“Davidson Decl.”) ¶ 3, Exhibit
1.)  On the day the responses were due,
September 1, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel requested that the deadline be extended
through September 6, 2023, which Moving Defendant confirmed.  (See Davidson Decl. ¶¶ 5-8,
Exhibit 2.)  On September 6, 2023, Moving
Defendant confirmed Plaintiff’s counsel’s request to further extend the
deadline to submit responses until September 8, 2023 due to illness.  (See Davidson Decl. ¶ 9, Exhibit
2.)  At the end of the business day on
September 8, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent an email stating that she tested
positive for the COVID-19 virus and requested an extension through September
12, 2023.  (See Davidson Decl.,
Exhibit 3.)  Upon learning of the third
extension request on September 11, 2023, Moving Defendant’s counsel responded that
a third extension would not be granted. 
(See Davidson Decl. ¶¶ 11-13, Exhibit 4.)  Although on September 11, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel served Moving Defendant with Plaintiff’s objections to his notice of
deposition, Moving Defendant’s counsel did not receive a response to the
September 11, 2023 email or receive RFP responses by the requested September
12, 2023 deadline.  (See Davidson
Decl. ¶ 14.)  
 
In support of the opposition (the “Opposition”), Plaintiff provides
evidence that responses to the RFPs were provided on September 21, 2023.  (Declaration of Charmaine L. Huntting
("Huntting Decl.") ¶ 9, Exhibit 3.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel visited an emergency room to seek medical treatment
for her illness on September 10, 2023,and was too sick to perform work on
September 12 through September 13, 2023, during which time the law firm’s other
attorney was appearing in an arbitration. 
(Huntting Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6.)  The
deposition objections that Plaintiff’s counsel served on September 11, 2023,
were prepared the previous week. 
(Huntting Decl. ¶ 5.)  
 
As Defendants have provided responses, the Motions are MOOT insofar
as they seek to compel responses. 
 
As it is undisputed that
Plaintiff served RFA responses by the time of the hearing, the RFA Motion is
MOOT.  As the responses were submitted
past the deadline, Plaintiff has waived any objections.  The proper procedure for Plaintiff to seek relief
from this waiver should she seek such relief is by motion.  (See CCP § 2033.280.)  
 
Monetary
Sanctions
Moving Defendant requests $1,960 in monetary sanctions in connection with
the Motion.  This amount represents: (1) two
hours preparing the moving papers; (2) an anticipated one hour reviewing and
responding to the Opposition; (3) an anticipated one hour appearing at the
hearing at an hourly rate of $475 per hour; and (4) a $60 filing fee.  (Davidson Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.)
 
The Court exercises its discretion and does not award sanctions.  In light of the illness of counsel, it would
not be equitable to assess sanctions under these circumstances.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this
ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive
an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed
off calendar.
