BACKGROUND¿¿¿¿A. Factual¿¿¿On May 12, 2023, Plaintiff, Raquel Mahoney (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Los Angeles International Airport, City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, State of California, and California Department of Transportation for dangerous condition of public property.Defendant Los Angeles World Airports, City of Los Angeles, erroneously sued as Los Angeles International Airport, (“Defendant”) demurs to Plaintiff’s Complaint on the grounds that it fails to state sufficient facts.¿B. Procedural¿¿¿On September 11, 2023, Defendant filed its demurrer. On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff opposed, and on April 2, 2024, Defendant replied.¿II. MOVING PARTY’S GROUNDS FOR THE DEMURRER¿¿¿¿¿Defendant demurs to the Complaint on the ground that Plaintiff provides no statutory basis for its premises liability claim, as required for a claim against a public entity.Defendant also makes an uncertainty argument, but only in reply and as such is not addressed.¿III. ANALYSIS¿¿A. Demurrer¿¿¿¿A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿¿¿¿Judicial NoticeDefendant requests judicial notice of the webpage of Los Angeles World Airports indicating that Los Angeles World Airports is a department of The City of Los Angeles, a public entity, and that the same owns and operates the Los Angeles International Airport.“[A] precondition to the taking of judicial notice in either its mandatory or permissive form—any matter to be judicially noticed must be relevant to the material issue.” (People ex rel. Lockyer v. Shamrock Foods Co. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 415, 422 fn. 2 (citing Mangini v. RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1057, 1063, overruled by In re Tobacco Cases II (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1257 on other grounds).)Here, it is unclear why Defendant is requesting judicial notice of the Los Angeles World Airports webpage. To the extent it is to show Defendant is a public entity, there is no need to do so when the Complaint has already alleged each of the defendants are public entities when naming them. (See Complaint.) Defendant’s request for judicial notice is DENIED.The Court notes that even if the information on the webpage were relevant, the webpage is not judicially noticeable under Evidence Code sections 452(g) and (h). The webpage is not a fact or proposition that is of such common knowledge that they cannot reasonably be the subject of dispute. Further, information on websites can be reasonably subject to dispute. (Huitt v. Southern Cal. Gas Co. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1586, 1605 fn. 10.)Evidentiary ObjectionsPlaintiff’s evidentiary objections are denied as immaterial.AnalysisDefendant demurs to the Complaint on the basis that Plaintiff fails to allege a statutory basis for its premises liability claim against it.Public entities cannot be liable for common law theories of general negligence. (Miklosy v. Regents of University of California (2008) 44 Cal.4th 876, 899 [“section 815 abolishescommon law tort liability for public entities”].) Therefore, liability against a public entity must be authorized by statute. (Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Authority (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1179; Gov. Code, § 815, subd. (a) [“A public entity is not liable for an injury . . . except as otherwise provided by statute”].) “Ordinarily, negligence may be pleaded in general terms and the plaintiff need not specify the precise act or omission alleged to constitute the breach of duty. [Citation]. However, because under the Tort Claims Act all governmental tort liability is based on statute, the general rule that statutory causes of action must be pleaded with particularity is applicable. Thus, ‘to state a cause of action against a public entity, every fact material to the existence of its statutory liability must be pleaded with particularity.’” (Lopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 795.)The Complaint does not set forth the statutory basis for Defendant’s liability in terms of dangerous condition of public property and does not cite to Government Code § 835. In fact, the opposition appears to rely on vicarious liability under Government Code § 815.2. “A public entity is not liable for injuries except as provided by statute (§ 815) and . . . section 835 sets out the exclusive conditions under which a public entity is liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition of public property. [Citation.]” (Metcalf v. County of San Joaquin (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1121, 1129.) “[P]ublic entity liability for property defects is not governed by the general rule of vicarious liability provided in section 815.2, but instead by the specific provisions set forth in section 830-835.4. Also, public employees’ liability for dangerous public property conditions resulting from the employees’ acts or omissions is provided by the special rules and limitations contained in sections 840-840.6.” (Van Kempen v. Hayward Area Park etc. Dist. (1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 822, 825.) Accordingly, Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged a statutory basis of liability against Defendant.Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.IV. CONCLUSION¿¿¿¿¿For the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.¿¿¿¿¿Moving party is ordered to give notice.¿¿
