And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant, alleging a dangerous condition of public property. The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state sufficient facts. The plaintiff opposed the demurrer, and the defendant replied. The judge has determined that the complaint does not set forth a statutory basis for the defendant's liability in terms of dangerous condition of public property, and therefore the demurrer is sustained. The plaintiff is given leave to amend the complaint to cure the deficiencies.
