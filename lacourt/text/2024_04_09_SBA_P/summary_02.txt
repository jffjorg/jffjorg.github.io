And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court considered the application for writ of possession filed by Ally Bank against Charhonda L. Bridges aka Charhonda Bridges. The application was denied without prejudice due to the plaintiff's failure to serve the summons and complaint on the defendant, as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 512.030. The court noted that the defendant failed to comply with the requirements for service and did not seek ex-parte relief. The court found that the plaintiff's claim for writ of possession was not supported by sufficient evidence and was therefore denied.
