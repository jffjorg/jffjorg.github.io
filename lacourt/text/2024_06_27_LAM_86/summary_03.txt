And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the second cause of action brought under the California Constitution and has determined that California law generally follows the same principles as the Fourth Amendment. When analyzing searches and seizures under California law, the court will apply federal legal standards. The judge also notes that high-risk stops, which involve handcuffing suspects at gunpoint with multiple officers, are a type of search and seizure. Finally, the judge rejects the respondent's contention that the petitioners are not entitled to declaratory or injunctive relief, as the respondent's demurrer does not address the entire cause of action.
