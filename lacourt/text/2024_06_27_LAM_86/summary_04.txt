And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case Nissan-Infiniti Lease Trust LLC v. Blanca Garcia et al. (24STLC00247). The plaintiff, Nissan-Infiniti Lease Trust LLC, has applied for a writ of possession to recover a 2023 Nissan Altima motor vehicle (VIN 1N4BL4DVXPN424480) from the defendant, Blanca Garcia. The Court has granted the plaintiff's unopposed application for a writ of possession, finding that the plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the property.

The Court's ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff is the assignee of a contract with the defendant for the lease of the motor vehicle, and the defendant has defaulted in payment on the agreement. The plaintiff received a lien sale notice indicating that Body Shop intended to sell the vehicle, and the Court has found that Body Shop remains in possession of the vehicle.

The Court has also denied the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction, as the plaintiff has not submitted sufficient evidence to show that there is an immediate danger that the property may become unavailable to levy by reason of being transferred, concealed, or removed or may become substantially impaired in value.

The Court has ordered the plaintiff to serve and lodge proposed orders on the appropriate Judicial Council Form.
