[1]           With respect to the second cause of
action based on the California Constitution, “California has generally adopted
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence for interpreting analogous provisions of the
California Constitution.” (People v. Perry (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 444,
466.) Accordingly, the Court “appl[ies] federal legal standards when analyzing
the reasonableness of a search or seizure under California constitutional law.”
(Ibid.)


[2]           In Green, high-risk stops were described as follows: “Officers
perform ‘high-risk’ stops when they perceive there to be a danger to the police
effecting the stop. Such stops typically involve handcuffing the suspect at
gunpoint and require the participation of multiple officers”. (Green,
751 F.3d at 1043.) 


[3]           The Court does not address respondents’
contention that petitioners are not entitled to declaratory or injunctive
relief. (Demurrer at 15:16-25.) “A demurrer
must dispose of an entire cause of action to be sustained.” (Fremont
Indemnity Co. v. Fremont Gen. Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.) Respondents’
attacks on the prayer for relief do not address any causes of action.
