[TENTATIVE] RULING ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF
  ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS 
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)




DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES,
 
 
 


 
 
Respondent.







 

 



 


 


 


 

 


Petitioner
Ismael Diaz petitions for a writ of administrative mandate directing respondent
Director, Department of Motor Vehicles to set aside an administrative decision and
reinstate his occupational license and business partner automation permit. Petitioner
alleges that the Administrative Law Judge revoked his occupational license
because petitioner had pled nolo contendere to a felony. The felony was
allegedly reduced to a misdemeanor, but the court docket reflecting the
reduction was purportedly not available during the administrative hearing. 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
February 24, 2023, petitioner filed a Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandamus.
On June 18, 2024, respondent filed an Answer. 
 
            On
February 13, 2024, the Court heard the instant petition for writ of mandate. No
opening brief had been filed at the time of the hearing. The Court continued
the hearing to June 20, 2024. The Court ordered petitioner’s opening brief to
be filed and served 60 days prior to the hearing date, i.e., April 22,
2024, as April 21 was a Sunday. The Court ordered respondent’s opposition to be
filed and served 30 days prior to the hearing date, i.e., May 21, 2024. The
Court ordered petitioner’s reply to be filed and served 15 days prior to the
hearing date, i.e., June 5, 2024. 
 
Both petitioner and respondent were present at the
February 13, 2024 hearing when the Court continued the hearing on the writ
petition and ordered a new briefing schedule based on the continued hearing
date. Respondent also provided written notice of the briefing schedule to
petitioner. (See Notice of Ruling filed 2/22/24.) The
hearing was later continued on the Court’s own motion to June 27, 2024, with
the briefing schedule based on the June 20, 2024 hearing date. (6/5/24 Minute
Order.)
 
            On
April 19, 2024, petitioner timely filed an opening brief. On June 20, 2024,
respondent served and filed an untimely opposition and lodged the administrative
record. No reply brief has been received. 
 
III.     Analysis
 
A.          
Untimely
Opposition
 
As
recounted above, on June 20, 2024, respondent filed and served an opposition
brief. The opposition was due on May 21, 2024, thirty days before the June 20,
2024 hearing date. Respondent was present at the hearing when the briefing
schedule was set. (2/13/24 Minute Order.) Respondent also provided notice of
the briefing schedule to petitioner. (Notice of Ruling filed 2/22/24.) Though the Court continued the
hearing to June 27, 2024, the briefing schedule remained pursuant to the June
20, 2024 hearing date. (6/5/24 Minute Order.) 
 
“A trial court has broad discretion
under rule 3.1300(d) of the Rules of Court to refuse to consider papers served
and filed beyond the deadline without a prior court order finding
good cause for late submission.” (Bozzi v. Nordstrom, Inc. (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 755, 765, emphasis added; see also CRC 3.1300(d) [“If the court, in
its discretion, refuses to consider a late filed paper, the minutes or order
must so indicate”].) 
 
Prior
to the filing of the opposition, respondent did not attempt to obtain leave,
such as through an ex parte application or otherwise, to file a late
opposition. In the opposition, respondent does not attempt to provide any
justification for the blatantly and unquestionably late filing. Respondent seemingly
expects this Court to countenance the filing of the opposition nearly one-month
late and only one week prior to the hearing. Considering the Court’s already
full schedule and the absence of any good cause, the Court declines to accommodate
respondent’s lack of professionalism or respect for the schedule ordered by
this Court through any continuance. Rather, the Court exercises its discretion
to refuse to consider respondent’s opposition. Respondent’s opposition filed on
June 20, 2024 is accordingly STRICKEN.
 
B.          
Merits
 
The
petition for writ of mandate is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) § 1094.5. (Pet. at 1:14-15.) Under CCP § 1094.5, “the party challenging
the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the
administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.” (Fukuda
v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817; see also Bixby v. Pierno (1971)
4 Cal.3d 130, 139.) “In a section 1094.5 proceeding…the burden falls on the
petitioner attacking the administrative decision to demonstrate to the trial
court where the administrative proceedings were unfair, were in excess of
jurisdiction, or showed “‘prejudicial abuse of discretion.’” (Elizabeth D.
v. Zolin (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 347, 354.)
 
Petitioner
argues in the opening brief that, during a November 2, 2022 administrative
hearing concerning the revocation of his occupational license, the
Administrative Law Judge decided to revoke the license based on petitioner
having been convicted of a felony. However, petitioner asserts that, on October
24, 2022, his conviction was reduced to a misdemeanor. Petitioner contends that
he was unable to obtain a copy of the court docket reflecting the reduction to
a misdemeanor prior to the administrative hearing.  
 
With
respect to the administrative record relating to the instant petition, during
the February 13, 2024 hearing before this Court, petitioner stated that the
administrative record had been completed. (2/13/24 Minute Order.) “[A] person
challenging in the trial court the orders of a licensing board in a
disciplinary proceeding cannot simply present the court with the administrative
record and assert, without analysis or specific citations to the record, that
the board’s orders were against the weight of the evidence. Instead, the
challenger must identify (with citations to the record) the factual findings
made by the board that he or she is challenging and demonstrate (with citations
to the record) why those factual findings were against the weight of the
evidence.” (Shenouda v. Veterinary Medical Bd. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th
500, 513.) Here, in neither the opening brief nor the petition does petitioner
provide any citation or reference to the administrative record. The Court will
not engage in a search of the record and attempt to meet petitioner’s initial
burden for him.  
 
Further,
petitioner’s “memorandum [of points and authorities] must contain a statement
of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and
a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the
position advanced.” (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(b); see also
Local Rule 3.231(i)(2) [opening brief must cite to administrative record].)
Rule of Court 3.1113 “rests on a policy-based allocation of resources,
preventing the trial court from being cast as a tacit advocate for the moving
party’s theories”. (Quantum Cooking Concepts, Inc. v. LV Associates, Inc.
(2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 927, 934.) A reviewing court “will not act as counsel
for either party to an appeal and will not assume the task of initiating and
prosecuting a search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not
pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740,
742.) The Court cannot evaluate arguments that are not made in the briefs and
cannot make the parties’ arguments for them. (Nelson v. Avondale HOA
(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 857, 862-63 [argument waived if not raised]; Pfeifer
v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1250, 1282 [same].) 
 
Neither
petitioner’s opening brief nor the petition contain any citation to authority supporting
issuance of a writ of mandate. Petitioner generally references the Department
of Motor Vehicle’s Disciplinary Guidelines, but he does not explain how, in
light of the purported reduction of his conviction from a felony to a
misdemeanor, the Guidelines would have allowed the Administrative Law Judge to
consider imposing less severe discipline other than revocation of his license.
The Court cannot develop petitioner’s arguments for him.
  
Further,
with respect to petitioner’s contention that evidence demonstrating that his
conviction was reduced to a misdemeanor was not available for the
administrative hearing, “[t]he general rule is that a hearing on a writ of
administrative mandamus is conducted solely on the record of the proceeding
before the administrative agency.” (Toyota of Visalia, Inc. v. New Motor
Vehicle Bd. (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 872, 881.) Petitioner has not moved to
augment the administrative record under CCP § 1094.5(e). “Augmentation of the administrative record is
permitted only within the strict limits set forth in section 1094.5,
subdivision (e)….” (Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center v. Superior Court
(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 93, 101.) “In the absence of a proper preliminary
foundation showing that one of the exceptions noted in section 1094.5,
subdivision (e) applies, it is error for the court to permit the record to be
augmented.” (Ibid.) Insofar as petitioner’s conviction was reduced from
a felony to a misdemeanor, because petitioner failed to demonstrate in any
motion why the administrative record should be augmented, the Court cannot
consider evidence to this effect. 
 
For
the foregoing reasons, petitioner has not met his burden of proof under CCP §
1094.5 to show a prejudicial abuse of discretion or a denial of a fair trial,
or that respondent proceeded without or in excess of jurisdiction.
 
IV.     Conclusion
 
            The
petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule 3.231(n), respondent Director, Department of Motor
Vehicles shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed judgment.
