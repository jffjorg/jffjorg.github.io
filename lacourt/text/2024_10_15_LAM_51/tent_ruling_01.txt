STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On November 22, 2019, Plaintiff RM Glass, Inc. (Plaintiff)
filed a Complaint against Defendants Bede USA, Inc. dba Bede Windows &
Doors, LA Plaza Village, LLC, Benchmark Contractors, Inc., Hudson Insurance
Company, Suretec Indemnity Company, Business Alliance Insurance Company, and
Ronald John Tesmer with eleven causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract;
(2) Foreclosure on Mechanic’s Lien – Leasehold Interest; (3) Enforcement of
Stop Payment Notice; (4) Enforcement of Payment Bond; (5) Quantum Meruit; (6)
Common Count for Goods and Services Rendered; (7) Breach of Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing; (8) Violation of Prompt Payment Statutes; (9)
Foreclosure of Mechanic’s Lien; (10) Contractor’s License Bond; and (11)
Declaratory Relief.
 
Plaintiff alleges that Bede submitted a Benchmark Purchase
Order for windows and sliding glass doors. Bede then invited Plaintiff to
submit a bid; Bede and Plaintiff then entered a subcontract. Plaintiff alleges
that it discovered Bede had misrepresented the prevailing wage rate. The final
invoice was significantly more than the original contract price due to
additional hours for assembling, fabricating, and glazing the windows.
Defendant delayed payment.
 
On May 27, 2020, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal as
to Defendant LA Plaza Village, LLC only.
 
On June 16, 2020, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal as
to Defendant Benchmark Contractors, Inc. only.
 
On June 29, 2020, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint
(FAC) with ten causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Enforcement of
Mechanic’s Lien Release Bond; (3) Enforcement of Stop Notice Release Bond; (4)
Enforcement of Payment Bond; (5) Quantum Meruit; (6) Common Count for Goods and
Services Rendered; (7) Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (8)
Violation of Prompt Payment Statutes; (9) Contractor’s License Bond; and (10)
Declaratory Relief.
 
On April 3, 2024, the Bede Defendants filed a motion for
terminating sanctions which the court GRANTED.
 
On April 23, 2024, the Bede Defendants filed a motion for
reconsideration of the court’s previous ruling on their motion for summary
judgment which the court GRANTED.
 
On June 4, 2024, the court entered judgment in favor of
Defendants and dismissed the FAC.
 
On June 21, 2024, the Bede Defendants filed a Memorandum of
Costs.
 
On June 27, 2024, the Bede Defendants filed the instant
motion for attorneys’ fees. Oppositions were due on or before October 2, 2024.
As of October 10, 2024, the court has not received an opposition from
Plaintiff.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“It is well established that the determination of what
constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the
trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of
discretion.¿ [Citations.]¿ The value of legal services performed in a case is a
matter in which the trial court has its own expertise. . . . The trial court
makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors, including
the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill
required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success
or failure, and other circumstances in the case.¿ [Citations.]”¿ (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d
618, 623624.) 
 
Under Public Contract Code §7107, in any action for the
collection of funds wrongfully withheld, the prevailing party shall be entitled
to attorney’s fees and costs. (Public Contract Code §7107(f).) Similarly, Cal.
Civ. Code Proc. Article two, which includes §8812, provides “in an action for
collection of the amount wrongfully withheld, the prevailing party is entitled
to costs and reasonable attorney's fees.” (Cal. Civ. Code §8818(b).) 
 
Under Brawly v. J.C.
Interiors Inc., courts
have the discretion to determine that there is no prevailing party, even if a
statute does not expressly say so. (James
L. Harris Painting & Decorating, Inc. v. West Bay Builders, Inc. (2015)
239 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1220 [citing Brawley
v. J.C. Interiors, Inc. (2008), 161 Cal. App. 4th 1126].) Case law holds
that this applies to prompt payment statutes as well. (Id.) 
 
The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins
with the “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. A computation of time spent on a case
and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an
appropriate attorneys’ fee award. The lodestar figure may then be adjusted,
based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services provided. (Serrano v. Priest¿(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)¿ Such an approach
anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value
of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary.
(Id. at 48, n.23.) 
¿ 
The factors considered in determining the modification of
the lodestar include the nature and difficulty of the litigation, the amount of
money involved, the skill required and employed to handle the case, the
attention given, the success or failure,¿and
other circumstances in the case. (EnPalm,
LLC v.¿Teitler¿Family Trust¿(2008) 162 Cal. App. 4th 770, 774 (emphasis in
original).) A negative modifier was appropriate when duplicative work had been
performed. (Thayer v. Wells Fargo
Bank,¿N.A.¿(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.)
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Moving Parties request the following fees pursuant to this
breakdown:
 



Dawson & Ozanne – 
Attorneys for defendants Bede USA, Inc., Business Alliance
  Insurance Company, and Ronald Tesmer


$529,980.00




Levin Sitcoff Waneka – 
Attorneys for defendants Bede USA, Inc., Business Alliance
  Insurance Company, and Ronald Tesmer


$282,800.00




Chen Horwitz & Franklin – 
Attorneys for defendant Benchmark Contractors, Inc.


$12,737.50




Booth Mitchel & Strange LLP – 
Attorneys for defendant Hudson Insurance Company


$39,888.50




Total:


$865,406.00



 
There is no opposition.
 
Prevailing Party
 
Statutorily,
“prevailing party” includes: “the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant
in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor
defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who
do not recover any relief against that defendant.” (Cal. Civ. Code
§1032(a)(4).)
 
Here, Defendants are clearly the prevailing parties.
Notably, the Bede Defendants brought a motion for summary judgment (MSJ) which,
after the court imposed evidentiary sanctions against Plaintiff, the court
granted. Indeed, the Bede Defendants moved the court to reconsider its prior
ruling denying the MSJ because of this. Because the court dismissed the FAC in
their favor because of these motions, the Bede Defendants are prevailing
parties under Civ. Code §1032(a)(4).

 
However, Defendants Benchmark and Hudson were not parties to
the MSJ. Indeed, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed Benchmark on June 16, 2020 –
well before the Bede Defendants filed the MSJ. Defendant Hudson did not file a
joinder to Bede’s MSJ, did not file a joinder to the motion for
reconsideration, and did not file a joinder to the instant motion for
attorneys’ fees. It is serendipitous that Defendant Hudson benefits from the Bede
Defendants’ motion practice. Nonetheless, they are a prevailing party because the
court dismissed the entire FAC. (Order Granting Motion for Reconsideration, May
21, 2024.)
 
Accordingly, Defendants are the prevailing party.
 
Attorneys’ Fees At
Issue
 
As a threshold matter, the court addresses which Defendants’
attorneys’ fees are at issue. First, the Bede Defendants’ fees are clearly at
issue since they brought the instant motion. Second, Defendant Benchmark is not
a moving party to this motion and did not timely move for its attorneys’ fees
when Plaintiff dismissed it back in 2020. (CRC 3.1702(b)(1); Sanabria v. Embrey (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th
422, 427 [noting that a voluntary dismissal is effectively a judgment under
this rule.) The court therefore declines to award Benchmark’s fees or analyze their
reasonableness. Third, Defendant Hudson also did not move for attorneys’ fees.
Rather, the Bede Defendants appear to move on Hudson’s behalf because they are supposedly
paying Hudson’s attorneys’ fees. (Mot. 3:19-27.) While the Bede Defendants
refer to a contractual relationship with Defendant Hudson, they did not provide
authority to the court indicating this is a valid substitute for Defendant
Hudson to bring its own motion or joinder to the instant motion. Additionally,
the court is inclined not to consider Defendant Hudson’s attorneys’ fees
because the notice of motion does not indicate that the Bede Defendants are
seeking them.
 
Accordingly, the court will consider the Bede Defendants’
attorneys’ fees only.
 
Reasonableness of
Fees Requested
 
i.                   
Time Spent
The court applies the lodestar method when determining
reasonableness of fees. Here, the average rate of an attorney in Los Angeles
County varies depending on several factors including the nature and difficulty
of the litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill required and
employed to handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure,¿and other circumstances in the case. (EnPalm, LLC v.¿Teitler¿Family Trust¿(2008)
162 Cal. App. 4th 770, 774 (emphasis in original).)
 
A verified fee bill is “prima facie evidence the costs,
expenses and services listed were necessarily incurred, and when they are
properly challenged the burden of proof shifts to the party claiming them as
costs.” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167
Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) Still, the court is the ultimate arbiter in deciding
whether expenses are reasonable.¿¿ 
 
The Bede Defendants request 963.6
hours billed by Mr. Dawson and 565.6 hours billed by Mr. Friesen. (Dawson
Decl., Exhibit A; Friesen Decl. ¶ 7.) Both requests are problematic. First, Mr.
Dawson’s bill includes unreasonable entries such as time for a motion never
filed, time for ex parte applications that were not warranted, and time for
conferring with Mr. Friesen (co-counsel for the same client), and performing
administrative tasks (such as trouble shooting exhibit software). (See
generally, Dawson Decl., Exhibit A.) Second, Mr. Friesen’s billing descriptions
are woefully vague and excessive for an attorney with 40 years’ experience.
(See generally, Friesen Decl., Exhibit 1.) To be sure, “trial courts are not required to identify each charge they
find to be reasonable or unreasonable, necessary or unnecessary. . . . A reduced award
might be fully justified by a general observation that an attorney over litigated a case.” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp.
(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 101.)
Moreover, “trial courts need not, and indeed
should not, become green-eyeshade accountants. The essential goal in shifting
fees (to either party) is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing
perfection. So trial courts may take into account their overall sense of a
suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an attorney’s time. (Fox v. Vice (2011 563 U.S. 826, 838.) As such, the court finds based upon its experience and knowledge of
this type of litigation and the professed specialization of counsel, the
court will apply a 10% negative multiplier to reduce the total hours expended
in the billing records provided. Otherwise, the court notes that the Bede
Defendants vigorously defended Plaintiff’s claim and obtained a favorable
result.
 
Accordingly, 867.24 of Mr. Dawson’s hours and 509.04 of
Mr. Friesen’s hours are reasonable.
 
ii.                 
Hourly Rate
The Bede Defendants provide evidence supporting the hourly
rates requested for Mr. Dawson and for Mr. Friesen. (Dawson Decl. ¶¶ 13-14, 21;
Friesen Decl. ¶¶ 2, 4, 7.) Counsels’ experience warrants the requested hourly
rates of $550 and $500 per hour, respectively.
 
Accordingly, the hourly rates requested are reasonable.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Award of Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED;
2.      The
court awards $731,502.00 in attorneys’ fees to the Bede Defendants payable
within 30 days notice of this order.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
