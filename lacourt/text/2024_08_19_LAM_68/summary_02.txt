Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents. The motion was filed in response to the defendant's alleged failure to adequately respond to the plaintiff's request for production of documents related to the subject vehicle, a 2020 Mercedes-Benz GT63C4S. The judge has limited the discovery to the make, model, year, and types of defects of the subject vehicle, and has declined to allow open-ended, broad-based discovery.

The judge has also imposed sanctions of $1,000 on the defendant and its counsel for their alleged obstreperous conduct and failure to comply with the discovery requests. The judge has given the parties 30 days to produce the requested documents and to provide a privilege log for any withheld information.

The judge has also indicated that continued discovery may lead to increasing sanctions, or escalate to issue and evidentiary sanctions, especially for intentionally obstreperous conduct necessitating burdensome demands from the plaintiff and the court.
