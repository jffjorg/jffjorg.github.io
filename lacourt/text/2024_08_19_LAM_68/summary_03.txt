And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Austin Collins to the cross-complaint filed by William S. Hart Union High School District against Collins, T.C., and L.S. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the cross-complaint, which alleges claims for Total Equitable Indemnity, Partial Equitable Indemnity, and Declaratory Relief.

The Judge finds that the cross-complaint properly states a claim against Collins, despite the lack of pleading the roles of the parties by name. The Judge also declines to consider unmade arguments regarding California Government Code 53069.5, which sets a cap on liability.

The Judge grants the motion to strike the claim for attorney fees, finding that there is no basis for the claim under Education Code section 48904 and Civil Code section 1714.1. The Judge also overrules the demurrer, finding that it does not present a valid challenge to the cross-complaint.

The Judge orders that the demurrer be overruled and the motion to strike granted without prejudice with 30 days leave to amend. The Judge also orders that if William S. Hart Union High School District elects to forego filing a first amended cross-complaint, Collins is ordered to answer the operative cross-complaint within 10 days of the lapsed amendment deadline.
