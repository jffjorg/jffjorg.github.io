  Case Number:  21STCV27139    Hearing Date:   July 3, 2024    Dept:  72 Kincaid v. County
of Los Angeles 21STCV27139
(Tentative Rulings-July
3, 2024)
 
Plaintiff’s Motion In Limine #1:  The Court denies the motion as it relates to
the write-up of Plaintiff for insubordination. 
Such evidence appears relevant at least to Plaintiff’s claim of
emotional distress based on the conduct at issue in this case.  The Court is inclined to exclude evidence
about Plaintiff’s Covid vaccination suspension and her welfare overpayment but
will entertain argument as to why Defendants assert that such evidence is
relevant and not unduly prejudicial.
Plaintiff’s Motion In Limine #2:  Denied. 
Under the circumstances of this case, including Plaintiff’s use of her
employer’s email to communicate with an attorney, the communications were not
confidential.  (See Holmes v.
Petrovich Co., LLC (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 1407.)  Moreover, Plaintiff waived any privilege by her
conduct in this litigation.
Plaintiff’s Motion In Limine #3:  Denied. 
Defendant County of Los Angeles has demonstrated that Plaintiff received
actual notice of certain of the documents (Exhibits 101, 105, 111, 114, 115,
117) or that the documents were recently created or located (Exhibit 120 and
121).  As to Exhibit 201, Plaintiff has
not identified a discovery request to Defendant Tobin that would call for this
document.
Tobin’s Motion In Limine to Exclude Testimony of Madelyn
Jones:  Denied as to Tobin’s alleged
statements relating to African Americans. 
This evidence appears to be proper “me too” evidence that is admissible
to prove intent, motive, and the like with respect to plaintiff’s own protected
class.  (Pinter-Brown v. Regents of
the University of California (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 55, 96.)  Granted as to Tobin’s alleged statements
relating to Armenians as being too far afield to constitute proper me too
evidence.
Tobin’s Motion In Limine To Exclude The Video Recording
of the Deposition of Tobin: 
Denied.  Plaintiff has provided a
copy of the video recording to Tobin.
