And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on several motions in limine filed by the plaintiff and defendant in the case. The plaintiff's motion to exclude evidence of being written up for insubordination was denied, as it is relevant to the claim of emotional distress. However, the court is inclined to exclude evidence of the plaintiff's Covid vaccination suspension and welfare overpayment, but will entertain argument as to why this evidence is relevant and not unduly prejudicial.

The plaintiff's motion to exclude evidence of using their employer's email to communicate with an attorney was denied, as the communications were not confidential and the plaintiff waived any privilege by their conduct in the litigation. The court also denied the plaintiff's motion to exclude a video recording of a deposition, as the plaintiff had provided a copy of the recording to the defendant.

The defendant's motion to exclude testimony of Madelyn Jones was denied as to statements relating to African Americans, as this evidence is proper "me too" evidence. However, the motion was granted as to statements relating to Armenians, as this evidence is too far afield to constitute proper "me too" evidence.
