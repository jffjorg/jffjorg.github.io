And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants a motion to set aside a default entered against LA Dorm, LLC. The default was entered because the defendant failed to appear at a hearing on November 3, 2023. The defendant argues that it was due to a mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The court grants the motion because the defendant states it was unable to retain counsel and the reasonable inference is that the defendant did not appear at the hearing because it was without counsel. The court also finds that the motion was filed within six months of the entry of default, there is no showing of prejudice to the plaintiff, and the policy is that cases be resolved on their merits. The defendant is now represented and is ordered to file its answer within 30 days. A case management conference is scheduled for August 6, 2024.
