And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court granted the motion to compel in part, ordering General Motors to provide further responses and documents related to the alleged transmission defect in the plaintiff's 2019 Chevrolet Silverado. The court denied the motion to compel with respect to certain requests, finding that they were overbroad and sought documents that were irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The court also denied the motion to compel with respect to requests for emails and confidential documents.
