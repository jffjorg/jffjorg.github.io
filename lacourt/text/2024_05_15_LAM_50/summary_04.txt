And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge, Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet, discloses her personal experience with a pickup truck and her husband's use of it. The truck developed electrical problems, and the manufacturer and dealer agreed to take it back and refund the purchase price. The Judge does not believe that this experience will cause her to be biased for or against either party. However, if either party believes otherwise, they may file and serve a verified statement of disqualification by May 29, 2024. The Case Management Conference will be continued to July 10, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement.
