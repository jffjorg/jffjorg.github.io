And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Defendant, Sarah Beaumont Green, has moved the Court for an order compelling the Plaintiff, Roxana Cortez, to attend an Orthopedic Independent Medical Examination (IME) with Dr. Richard Nussbaum. The Defendant claims that the Plaintiff failed to appear for a properly noticed IME while seeking recovery for personal injuries. However, the Defendant has failed to provide a sufficient description of the manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the IME, including the specific tests to be conducted. Therefore, the Court denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice.
