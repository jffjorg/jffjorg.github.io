And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions filed by the parties in the case. The defendant, Yuan Shi aka Henry Shi, has moved to bifurcate the trial and reconsider a prior order. The plaintiff, David Carter, has moved for terminating sanctions against the defendants for failure to comply with court orders and for monetary sanctions in the amount of $11,120.00.

The judge denied the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial, finding that it is premature. The judge also denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration and/or to bifurcate liability and damages, finding that the newly discovered facts do not justify a change in the prior ruling.

The judge also denied the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions, finding that the defendants' failure to comply with court orders is not willful. The judge did, however, order the defendants to produce any relevant documents, unredacted, within 10 days of the entry of the order or face further sanctions.

The judge's ruling is based on the parties' arguments and evidence presented in the case. The judge notes that the defendants have failed to comply with court orders and have not produced all relevant documents. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a substantial probability of success on his claim for punitive damages.
