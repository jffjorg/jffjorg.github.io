Surisaday Menchaca Lopez v. FCA US LLC
Plaintiff Katrina Surisaday Menchaca
Lopez’s Motions to Compel Initial Discovery.
 
BACKGROUND 
            Plaintiff
Katrina Surisady Menchaca Lopez (Plaintiff) filed a complaint on March 22, 2024
against FCA US LLC (Defendant) and Does 1-100 for product liability. Plaintiff
alleges (1) violation of Civil Code § 193.2(d); (2) violation of Civil Code §
193.2(b); (3) violation of Civil Code § 193.2(a)(3); (4) Breach of Express
Written Warranty; (5) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability; and (6)
Violation of the Tanner Consumer Protection Act. 
            On
May 20, 2024, Plaintiff propounded Requests for Admission, Set One; Special
Interrogatories, Set One; Form Interrogatories, Set One; and, Requests for
Document Production, Set One. On July 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed four motions to
compel. Defendant provided responses on August 1, 2024. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or inspection demands were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b).) Failure to timely serve responses waives objections
to the requests.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290(a), 2031.300(a).) The court may relieve a party from waiver of
objections if the party served a response that is substantially code compliant
and the failure to serve was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.290(a), 2031.300(a).)
            If
a party to whom requests for admissions were directed fails to serve a timely
response, the propounding party may move for an order that the requests for
admission are deemed admitted.  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(a).) The court may relieve a party from the requests
being deemed admitted if the party has served a response to the requests that
is in substantial compliance.  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2033.280(a).)  The Court may also
relieve a party from waiver of objections if the party served a response that
is in substantial compliance and the failure to serve was the result of
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(a).)  
 
DISCUSSION  
            Plaintiff
propounded the discovery requests on May 20, 2024. The discovery responses were
due on June 19, 2024.  Defendant failed
to provide timely discovery responses, but did provide responses on August 1,
2024.  Defendant claims the failure to
provide responses was due to Defendant’s counsel’s mistake, inadvertence and excusable
neglect.  The Court will relieve
Defendant from the waiver of objections. Because Defendant provided code
compliant responses to the requests for admission the Court does not deem
admitted the Requests for Admission.
            Plaintiff
did not request monetary sanctions in her moving papers or the proposed order. 
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Plaintiff’s motions to compel but relieves Defendant from waiver
of objections and does not deem admitted the requests for admission. 
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
