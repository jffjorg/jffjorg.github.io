 Case Number:  BC673421    Hearing Date:   October 18, 2024    Dept:  74 Chen v.
Global IP Cayman et al. 
Plaintiff Chris Chen’s Motion to Compel
Further Production to First Set of Inspection Demands.
 
BACKGROUND 
On
August 23, 2017, Plaintiff Chris Chen (Plaintiff) filed his initial complaint
against Defendants Global IP USA, Inc. (GIP USA), its parent entity GIP Cayman
(Defendant) and other parties seeking redress for alleged workplace retaliation
by his former employer, Defendant. 
On
October 26, 2017, Defendant filed its answer. 
On
March 26, 2019, Defendant moved to stay all proceedings pending resolution of a
confidential arbitration agreement between Defendants and several
non-parties. 
On
April 19, 2019, the court granted Defendant’s motion to stay and issued a stay
pending binding arbitration as to the entire action, which remained in place
until November 2022 when the court lifted the stay on proceedings.  
            On
August 8, 2023, Plaintiff served the First Set of Demands for Inspection
(Demands).  Defendant was granted
multiple extensions. 
            On
October 23, 2023, Defendants served their discovery responses.  
            On
December 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Motion to compel further responses. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
Motion to
Compel Further Responses
¿¿            The
propounding party may bring motions to compel inspection or further responses
to interrogatories or requests for production if it believes (1) the responses
received are evasive, or (2) incomplete, or (3) if the objections raised are
meritless or too general. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a).) A
respondent has the burden to justify objections in response to a motion filed
to compel further responses. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000)
22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)   
            California
Rules of Court rule 3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving
further discovery, including motions to compel further responses to a demand
for inspection of documents, contain a separate statement with the text of each
request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for
compelling further responses.  (CRC, rule
3.1345(a).) 
The
court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(d).)
Meet and
Confer
            This
motion must be accompanied by a good-faith meet-and-confer declaration.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(b).)  “A determination of whether an attempt at
informal resolution is adequate… involves the exercise of discretion.”  (Stewart v. Colonial W. Agency (2001)
87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016.)  “The history
of the litigation, the nature of the interaction between counsel, the nature of
the issues, the type and scope of discovery requested, the prospects for
success and other similar factors can be relevant.  Judges have broad powers and responsibility
to determine what measure and procedures are appropriate in varying
circumstances.”  (Ibid.) 
 
DISCUSSION  
As
an initial matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff has complied with all
procedural requirements.  Here, it is
undisputed that Defendant’s responses served on October 23, 2023, were
unverified, and so the 45-day window does not apply.  Nevertheless, Plaintiff filed the motion on
December 11, 2023, meeting the 45-day requirement.  (Kelly-Kilgore Decl., ¶ 32.)  The motion to compel is timely.  Plaintiff also made good-faith efforts to
meet and confer prior to the instant motion beginning on December 5, 2023, and
reaching out to Defendant’s counsel multiple times seeking informal resolution
over the alleged deficient responses; however, the parties could not reach an
agreement.  (Kelly-Kilgore Decl., ¶¶
29-35.)
 
Demand for Inspection Nos. 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 and 6
            Demand
for Inspection Nos. 1-6 concern Defendant’s internal and external
communications relating to Bronzelink, Dong Yin Development Limited and Amore
Resources Ltd.
            Defendant
objected to DFI Nos. 1-6 on the same grounds, including that the requests are
vague, ambiguous, overbroad, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
            Defendant’s
objection fails.  First, the request is
sufficiently clear and narrow in terms of the types of documents sought in
relation to the internal and external communications regarding Bronzelink, Dong
Yin Development Limited and Amore Resources Ltd.  (See Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 783 [“A party may not deliberately misconstrue a question for
the purpose of supplying an evasive answer. 
[Citations.]  Indeed, where the
question is somewhat ambiguous, but the nature of the information sought is
apparent, the proper solution is to provide an appropriate response.”  [Citations.].)  Second, the court agrees with Plaintiff that
the requests are not overbroad because they address the very subject matter
directly relevant to Plaintiff’s case, namely if Defendant interfered with
Plaintiff’s employment and if persons subject to the International Traffic in
Arms Regulation (ITAR) exercised control over Defendants.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010 [scope of
discovery encompasses not just specific claims and defenses but “any matter,
not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter”].)  Third, Defendant has not shown that the
production would be unduly burdensome. 
Defendant has thus failed to show that the requested documents are
vague, ambiguous, overbroad, unduly burdensome or not reasonably calculated to
the discovery of admissible evidence. 
            Defendant
also objected to DFI Nos. 1-6 as protected from disclosure by attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product doctrine, the right to privacy, the trade
secret privilege and any other applicable privilege.  Defendant’s assertion is unavailing.  Defendant has failed to provide “sufficient
factual information… to evaluate the merits of any claimed privilege” because
it provides no information establishing the attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product privilege, right to privacy, or trade secret privilege as it
relates to the requested documents. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c)(1); Williams v. Superior Court
(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 557 [rejecting “the de facto starting assumption that
such an egregious invasion [of privacy] is involved in every request for
discovery of private information” and holding that “[c]ourts must instead place
the burden on the party asserting a privacy interest to establish its extent
and the seriousness of the prospective invasion, and against that showing must
weigh the countervailing interests the opposing party identifies”].)  In Williams, the Supreme Court noted
that the following test should be used to weigh an asserted privacy objection:
The party asserting a privacy right must establish a legally
protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in
the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion that is serious.  [Citation.] 
The party seeking information may raise in response whatever legitimate
and important countervailing interests disclosure serves, while the party
seeking protection may identify feasible alternatives that serve the same
interests or protective measures that would diminish the loss of privacy.  A court must then balance these competing
considerations.
(Id. at 552.)
Given Defendant has failed to file
an opposition addressing this objection, Defendant has failed to meet its
burden of establishing a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively
reasonable expectation of privacy, and a threatened intrusion that is sufficiently
serious to justify its privacy objection. 

            Defendant
further objected to DFI Nos. 1-6 as duplicative and harassing.  The fact that some information may be
available to Plaintiff from prior discovery responses provided by other
defendants is not a valid ground for refusing to provide discovery.  (Irvington-Moore, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 733, 738-39 [a party may use multiple methods to obtain
discovery and the fact that information was disclosed under one method is not,
by itself, a proper basis to refuse to provide discovery under another
method].)  Defendant thus fails to show
that the DFIs are duplicative or harassing. 
            Therefore,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses is granted as to DFI Nos. 1-6. 
 
Demand for Inspection Nos. 10, 11
and 12
            DFI
Nos. 10, 11 and 12 concerns documents filed in connection with Bronzelink
Holdings Limited v. STM Atlantic n.v. et al., Arbitration.
            Defendant
objected to DFI Nos. 10, 11 and 12 on the same grounds, including that the
requests are vague, ambiguous, overbroad, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
            Defendant’s
objection fails again. First, the request is sufficiently clear and narrow in
terms of the types of documents sought and the time period for which the
documents are sought.  (See Kilbourne,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at 783.) 
Second, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that the requests are not
overbroad or irrelevant because they address the subject matter directly
relevant to the Plaintiff’s case, namely whether Defendants complied with the
applicable U.S. export regulations or impeded investigation into its
compliance.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §
2017.010.)  Third, given that the
requested documents are limited to the documents filed in connection with the
Arbitration, it does not appear production would be unduly burdensome.  Defendant has failed to offer support showing
otherwise.  Defendant has thus failed to
show that the requested documents are vague, ambiguous, overbroad, unduly
burdensome or not reasonably calculated to the discovery of admissible
evidence. 
            Defendant
also objected to DFI Nos. 10, 11 and 12 as protected from disclosure by
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product doctrine, the right to
privacy, the trade secret privilege and any other applicable privilege.  Defendant’s assertion is unavailing.  Defendant has failed to provide “sufficient
factual information… to evaluate the merits of any claimed privilege” because
it provides no information establishing the attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product privilege, right to privacy, or trade secret privilege as it
relates to the requested documents. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c)(1); Williams, supra, 3
Cal.5th at 557.) Defendant has failed to file an opposition addressing this
objection.  Defendant has failed to meet
its burden as set forth in Williams of establishing a legally protected
privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy, and a
threatened intrusion that is sufficiently serious to justify its privacy
objection.  (Williams, supra,
3 Cal.5th at 552.)
            Defendant
further objected to DFI Nos. 10, 11 and 12 as duplicative and harassing.  The fact that some information may be
available to Plaintiff from prior discovery responses provide by other
defendants is not a valid ground for refusing to provide discovery.  (Irvington-Moore, supra, 14
Cal.App.4th at 738-39.)  
            Therefore,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses is granted as to DFI Nos. 10, 11
and 12.  
Demand for Inspection Nos. 13, 14,
15 and 16
DFI
Nos. 13-16 concerns documents submitted to government committees in response to
Congressional investigations of Defendants and their compliance with ITAR and
U.S. Exports Regulations. 
            Defendant
objected to DFI Nos. 13-16 on the same grounds, including that the requests are
vague, ambiguous, overbroad, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
            Defendant’s
objection fails again. First, the request is sufficiently clear and narrow in
terms of the types of documents sought and the time period for which the
documents are sought.  (See Kilbourne,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at 783.) 
Second, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that the requests are not
overbroad or irrelevant because they address the subject matter directly
relevant to the Plaintiff’s case, namely whether Defendant complied with the
applicable U.S. export relations or impeded investigation into its compliance and
the requested documents are limited to the documents filed in connection with
the documents submitted to the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)  Defendant
has failed to offer support showing otherwise. 
Defendant has thus failed to show that the requests are vague,
ambiguous, overbroad, unduly burdensome or not reasonably calculated to the
discovery of admissible evidence. 
            Defendant
also objected to DFI Nos. 13-16 as protected from disclosure by attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product doctrine, the right to privacy, the trade
secret privilege and any other applicable privilege.  Defendant’s assertion is unavailing.  Defendant has failed to provide “sufficient
factual information… to evaluate the merits of any claimed privilege” because
it provides no information establishing the attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product privilege, right to privacy, or trade secret privilege as it
relates to the requested documents. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c)(1); Williams, supra, 3
Cal.5th at 557.)  Defendant has failed to
file an opposition addressing this objection. 
Defendant has failed to meet its burden as set forth in Williams
of establishing a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable
expectation of privacy, and a threatened intrusion that is sufficiently serious
to justify its privacy objection.  (Williams,
supra, 3 Cal.5th at 552.)
            Defendant
further objected to DFI Nos. 13-16 as duplicative and harassing.  The fact that some information may be
available to Plaintiff from prior discovery responses provided by other
defendants is not a valid ground for refusing to provide discovery.  (Irvington-Moore, supra, 14
Cal.App.4th at 738-39.)  
            Therefore,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses is granted as to DFI Nos. 13,
14, 15 and 16.
 
Demand for Inspection 17 and 18
DFI
Nos. 17 and 18 concern documents relating to Mr. Chen’s findings and
recommendations regarding U.S. Export Regulations and compliance with the
regulations.
            Defendant
objected to DFI Nos. 17 and 18 on the grounds that the requests are vague,
ambiguous, overbroad, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence.
            Defendant’s
objection fails again. First, the request is sufficiently clear and narrow in
terms of the types of documents sought and the time period for which the
documents are sought.  (See Kilbourne,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at 783.) 
Second, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that the requests are not
overbroad or irrelevant because they address the subject matter directly
relevant to the Plaintiff’s case, namely Plaintiff’s findings that may have led
to retaliation.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §
2017.010.)  Third, given that the
requested documents are limited to the documents filed in connection with
Plaintiff’s findings and recommendations to Defendant, it does not appear
production would be unduly burdensome. 
Defendant has failed to offer support showing otherwise.  Defendant has thus failed to show that the
requests are vague, ambiguous, overbroad, unduly burdensome or not reasonably
calculated to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
            Defendant
also objected to DFI Nos. 17 and 18 as protected from disclosure by
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product doctrine, the right to
privacy, the trade secret privilege and any other applicable privilege.  Defendant’s assertion is unavailing.  Defendant has failed to provide “sufficient
factual information… to evaluate the merits of any claimed privilege” because
it provides no information establishing the attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product privilege, right to privacy, or trade secret privilege as it
relates to the requested documents. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c)(1); Williams, supra, 3
Cal.5th at 557.) Defendant has failed to file an opposition addressing this
objection.  Defendant has failed to meet
its burden as set forth in Williams of establishing a legally protected
privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy, and a
threatened intrusion that is sufficiently serious to justify its privacy
objection.  (Williams, supra,
3 Cal.5th at 552.)
            Defendant
further objected to DFI Nos. 17 and 18 as duplicative and harassing.  The fact that some information may be
available to Plaintiff from prior discovery responses provided by other
defendants is not a valid ground for refusing to provide discovery.  (Irvington-Moore, supra, 14
Cal.App.4th at 738-39.)  
            Therefore,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses is granted as to DFI Nos. 17 and
18. 
 
Demand for Inspection 19, 20 and 21
DFI
Nos. 19, 20 and 21 concern internal communications related to Defendant’s
purchase, acquisition, or sale of satellites with The Boeing Company or Space
Exploration Technologies Corp.
            Defendant
objected to DFI Nos. 19, 20 and 21 on the grounds that the requests are vague,
ambiguous, overbroad, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence.
            Defendant’s
objection fails again. First, the request is sufficiently clear and narrow in
terms of the types of documents sought and the time period for which the
documents are sought.  (See Kilbourne,
supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at 783.) 
Second, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that the requests are not
overbroad or irrelevant because they address the subject matter directly
relevant to the Plaintiff’s case, namely Defendant’s operations in connection
to U.S. Export Regulations and the requested documents are limited to the
documents filed in connection with Defendant’s regular course of business. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) Defendant has failed to offer support showing
otherwise.  Defendant has thus failed to
show that the requested documents are vague, ambiguous, overbroad, unduly
burdensome or not reasonably calculated to the discovery of admissible
evidence. 
            Defendant
also objected to DFI Nos. 19, 20 and 21 as protected from disclosure by
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product doctrine, the right to
privacy, the trade secret privilege and any other applicable privilege.  Defendant’s assertion is unavailing.  Defendant has failed to provide “sufficient
factual information… to evaluate the merits of any claimed privilege” because
it provides no information establishing the attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product privilege, right to privacy, or trade secret privilege as it
relates to the requested documents. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c)(1); Williams, supra, 3
Cal.5th at 557.) Defendant has failed to file an opposition addressing this
objection.  Defendant has failed to meet
its burden as set forth in Williams of establishing a legally protected
privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy, and a
threatened intrusion that is sufficiently serious to justify its privacy
objection.  (Williams, supra,
3 Cal.5th at 552.)
            Defendant
further objected to DFI Nos. 19, 20 and 21 as duplicative and harassing.  The fact that some information may be
available to Plaintiff from prior discovery responses provided by other
defendants is not a valid ground for refusing to provide discovery.  (Irvington-Moore, supra, 14
Cal.App.4th at 738-39.)  
            Therefore,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses is granted as to DFI Nos. 19, 20
and 21.  
 
Sanctions
Plaintiff’s
counsel requests $5,000 per motion for Plaintiff’s six pending motions to
compel.  Plaintiff’s counsel states in counsel’s
declaration that attorney Hwang billed 7.8 hours for this motion at $565 per
hour totaling $4,407.  Plaintiff requests
additional time to review opposition and prepare relies, but no opposition was
filed in response to this motion. 
Plaintiff’s Counsel S. Kelly-Kilgore also spent 2 hours at $935
reviewing all six motions.  The Court
awards an additional $293 for attorney Kelly-Kilgore’s time reviewing this
particular motion for a total of $4,700 in sanctions. 
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Plaintiff’s motion to Compel Further Responses to the First Set of
Inspection Demands.  The Court grants
Plaintiff’s requests for sanctions in the amount of $4,700.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
