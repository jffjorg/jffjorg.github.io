And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Keith Fox and Arielle Fox, who are defendants in a lawsuit brought by the Mikulec parties. The Mikulecs filed a complaint against several defendants, including Equity Residential Properties LLC, alleging various causes of action including negligence, premises liability, and breach of warranty of habitability.

The Foxes argued that the Mikulecs' complaint was untimely and uncertain, and that the relation-back doctrine did not apply. The judge agreed, finding that the Mikulecs knew or should have known about the fire that damaged the apartment complex and therefore were not ignorant of the Foxes' identity and the facts giving rise to liability.

As a result, the judge sustained the demurrer without leave to amend to all causes of action except the third cause of action for breach of warranty of habitability. The judge granted leave to amend for this cause of action, which has a four-year statute of limitations. The motion to strike is moot.
