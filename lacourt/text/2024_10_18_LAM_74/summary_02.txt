And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Kenneth McBride's Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint. The motion arises from a professional malpractice complaint filed on July 26, 2021, against Cohen Pagano Accountancy, Inc., Stanley M. Ingel, Laurand Management Co., Inc., Andrea M. Link, and Does 1-25. The Plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to timely prepare financial statements for tax planning, failed to provide tax planning consistent with applicable tax laws, and failed to provide proper advice concerning anticipated tax liability.

The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has met the procedural requirements for the motion, including providing a copy of the proposed amended complaint and a supporting declaration. The Plaintiff discovered the facts giving rise to the amendment in August 2022, but did not file the motion until July 30, 2024, nearly two years later.

The Defendant opposes the motion, alleging that the Plaintiff's delay is inexcusable and will result in prejudice to the Defendant. However, the Judge finds that the Defendant fails to show any prejudice that may arise from the Amendment, and therefore grants the Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
