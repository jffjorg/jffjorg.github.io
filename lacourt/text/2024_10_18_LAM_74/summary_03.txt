And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motions to compel discovery responses from the defendant. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant for product liability and propounded discovery requests on May 20, 2024. The defendant failed to provide timely responses, but later provided responses on August 1, 2024. The defendant claimed that the failure was due to a mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect by their counsel. The judge has decided to relieve the defendant from the waiver of objections and has not deemed admitted the requests for admission. The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel, but has not ordered monetary sanctions. The plaintiff will be notified of the ruling.
