And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Zanay Herrera, in a premises liability action against Starbucks Corporation and others. The defendant, Vons, filed the motion after three failed attempts to depose the plaintiff, and argued that the plaintiff's refusal to submit to deposition justifies an order compelling attendance. The judge disagrees, finding that Vons did not meet and confer with the plaintiff before filing the motion, and that the plaintiff offered alternative dates for deposition. The judge notes that the plaintiff's actions do not necessarily give Vons grounds for an order compelling attendance. The judge denies the motion to compel and the corresponding request for monetary sanctions, but expects the parties to cooperate in future scheduling. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
