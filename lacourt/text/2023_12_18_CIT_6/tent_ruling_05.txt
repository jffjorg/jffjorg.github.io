The Court ORDERS the person(s) most qualified for Defendant  Sumbale Trucks LLC to appear for deposition no later than 30 days from the date  of this order, to answer questions at said deposition until completed, and to  produce documents at said deposition per the Notice of Deposition served on October  13, 2023.  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions only  as to Defendant Sumbale Trucks LLC in the reduced amount of $2,386.05,  comprised of 3.0 hours preparing the motion, 1.5 hours for reviewing the  opposition and preparing the reply, and 1.0 hour for appearing at the hearing  on the motion, for a total of 5.5 hours, multiplied by the hourly rate of  $250.00 for a total of $1,375.00, plus $1,011.05 for the certificates of nonappearance  incurred due to Defendant Sumbale’s failure to appear for deposition.                Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND This is an auto accident case. On April 14, 2023, plaintiff Feng  Ning (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Juan Hernandez, Armando  Sanchez, Sumbale Trucks LLC (Sumbale) (collectively,  Defendants) and Does 1 to 50, alleging causes of action for motor vehicle and  general negligence.  On November 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel the  deposition of Sumbale. On December 5, 2023, Sumbale filed its opposition.[1] On December 11, 2023, Plaintiff replied.  LEGAL  STANDARD If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to  the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or  a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230,  without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear  for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any  document, electronically stored information, or  tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice  may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and  the production for inspection of any document,  electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the  deposition notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,  subd. (a).)  If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the  court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the  deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court  finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification  or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,  subd. (g)(1).)  PRELIMINARY  ISSUE             Plaintiff  argues in reply that Sumbale’s opposition is untimely because it was not served  until December 6, 2023. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) The Court agrees  that Sumbale’s opposition is untimely, but the  Court exercises its discretion to still consider the opposition. (See Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d); Juarez v. Wash Depot Holdings, Inc. (2018)  24 Cal.App.5th 1197, 1202.) The Court nevertheless admonishes Sumbale to comply  with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure going forward.  DISCUSSION             Plaintiff seeks an order compelling the  deposition of Defendant Sumbale. Plaintiff contends it expended significant  effort in attempting to depose Sumbale and the other Defendants, such that Plaintiff  had duly noticed their depositions seven different times. (Anguiano Decl., ¶¶ 3-16,  Exs. 1-13.) Following an Informal Discovery Conference on September 29, 2023, the  parties agreed upon dates for Defendants’ depositions. (Anguiano Decl., Ex. 8.)  Plaintiff states that after the Informal Discovery Conference, the parties  agreed to have all Defendants’ depositions conducted on the same day, i.e.,  November 2, 2023. (Anguiano Decl., ¶ 15, Ex. 12.) Plaintiff then formally  noticed the depositions for the persons most qualified for Sumbale on October  13, 2023. (Anguiano Decl., ¶ 16, Ex. 13.) Nevertheless, Plaintiff contends that  despite the mutually agreed upon date, and without any objection, the persons  most qualified for Sumbale failed to appear for depositions[2] on November 2, 2023, for which Plaintiff obtained certificates of nonappearance.  (Anguiano Decl., Ex. 14.) Plaintiff subsequently inquired about the  nonappearance. (Anguiano Decl., Ex. 15.)              In opposition, Defendants contend  there is no evidence of bad faith, as counsel for Defendants has had trouble  locating and communicating with Defendants. Defendants further contend there is  no abuse of the discovery process, and that Plaintiff has not suffered any  prejudice.              The Court finds Plaintiff is  entitled to an order compelling Sumbale’s deposition. Defendants do not dispute  that Sumbale failed to appear for its deposition. While the Court understands  counsel for Defendants’ challenge in locating and communicating with  Defendants, they are parties to this action who have appeared and must comply  with their discovery obligations. Therefore, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s  motion to compel.              With respect to monetary sanctions,  the Court finds that counsel for Defendants does not appear to be at fault for  Sumbale’s failure to appear at the November 2, 2023 depositions, and thus  declines to award monetary sanctions against counsel for Defendants. The Court GRANTS  monetary sanctions against Defendant Sumbale Trucks LLC only in the reduced  amount of $2,386.05, comprised of 3.0 hours preparing the motion, 1.5 hour for  reviewing the opposition and preparing the reply, and 1.0 hours for appearing  at the hearing on the motion, for a total of 5.5 hours, multiplied by the  hourly rate of $250.00 for a total of $1,375.00, plus $1,011.05 for the certificates  of nonappearance incurred due to Defendant Sumbale’s failure to appear for  deposition.  CONCLUSION The Court GRANTS the motion to compel the deposition of Defendant  Sumbale Trucks LLC. The Court ORDERS the person(s) most qualified for Defendant  Sumbale Trucks LLC to appear for deposition no later than 30 days from the date  of this order, to answer questions at said deposition until completed, and to  produce documents at said deposition per the Notice of Deposition served on  October 13, 2023.  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions only  as to Defendant Sumbale Trucks LLC in the reduced amount of $2,386.05,  comprised of 3.0 hours preparing the motion, 1.5 hours for reviewing the  opposition and preparing the reply, and 1.0 hour for appearing at the hearing  on the motion, for a total of 5.5 hours, multiplied by the hourly rate of  $250.00 for a total of $1,375.00, plus $1,011.05 for the certificates of nonappearance  incurred due to Defendant Sumbale’s failure to appear for deposition.                Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
