The judge has denied Fervino, Inc. dba Slater's 50-50's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The motion was defective because it failed to state the specific causes of action or issues to be adjudicated, as required by California Rule of Court 3.1350. Additionally, the judge found that Fervino had not met its burden of showing that there were no triable issues of material fact related to the breach of contract, open book account, account stated, reasonable value of labor and materials furnished, violations of prompt payment statutes, and foreclosure of mechanic's lien. The judge concluded that there were triable issues of material fact related to the scope of the agreement and the services provided by the plaintiff, Archtic, LLC. As a result, the motion was denied.
