MOTION
FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS

 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants PACE Funding Group d/b/a Home Run Financing
and California Statewide Communities Development Authority
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff Ledle
Arreola Garcia
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a fraud action that was filed on August 4, 2021. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants are engaged in a scheme to defraud homeowners,
including Plaintiff, by inducing them to agree to predatory loans funded by
California’s PACE program and falsely promising that the loans could be used
for home renovations and additions. 
 
Defendants move for judgment on the
pleadings. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Defendants’
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
            Defendants
move for judgment on the pleadings.
 
Legal Standard
 
A motion for judgment on the
pleadings is the functional equivalent to a general demurrer.  (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic
Indemnity Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198).  Like demurrers, motions for judgment on the
pleadings challenge the legal sufficiency of the allegations, not their
veracity.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994). Any defects must either appear on the
face of the pleading, or else be taken by judicial notice.  (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th
316, 321-22).  The parties’ ability to
prove their respective claims is of no concern. 
(Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995,
99.)  Though the Court must accept the
allegations of the complaint and answer as true (Gerawan Farming, Inc. v.
Lyons (2000) 24 Cal.4th 468, 515), it will not do so for “conclusions of
law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to law or
[judicially noticed] facts…” (Stevenson Real Estate Servs., Inc. v. CB
Richard Ellis Real Estate Servs., Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1219-20).
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a motion for judgment
on the pleadings, the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who has filed the pleading subject to the motion for
judgment on the pleadings and file a declaration detailing their meet and
confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 439(a).) However, an insufficient
meet and confer process is not grounds to grant or deny a motion for
judgment on the pleadings. (Code Civ. Proc., § 439(a)(4).)
 
The Declaration of Jeffrey Zuidema
in support of the Motion states that Defendants’ counsel met and conferred with
Plaintiff’s counsel on March 25, 2024, via email regarding the issues on this
motion, then via telephone on April 1, 2024, with follow up emails on April 3
and April 12, 2024. (Declaration of Jefrey Zuidema ISO Mot. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) The
parties were not able to come to an agreement regarding these issues. (See Id.)
Defendants have therefore demonstrated compliance with their statutory meet-and-confer
obligations. 
 
Requests for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendants
request that the Court take judicial notice of (1) the Complaint in the action
entitled Garcia v. Elite Energy Home Improvement Inc., et al. LASC Case
No. 19STCV12188; (2) the Trial Brief in Support of Default Judgment in that
action; and (3) the November 4, 2019 Default Judgment entered in that action.
Defendants’ requests are GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d)
(court records).
 
            Plaintiff
requests that the Court take judicial notice of the (1) 2018; (2) 2019; (3)
2020; and (4) 2021 California Secretary of State Rosters for Registered Public
Entities; (5) Defendants’ Answer to the Complaint in this Action; and (6)
Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment filed on October 20, 2023. Plaintiffs’
Requests Nos. 1-4 are GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(c)
(official acts). Plaintiff’s Requests Nos. 5 and 6 are DENIED as irrelevant to
this ruling. (Gbur v. Cohen
(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 296, 301 [“[J]udicial notice . . . is always confined to those
matters which are relevant to the issue at hand.”].)

//
Claim and Issue Preclusion
 
            Defendants
move for judgment on the pleadings on the basis that Plaintiff’s entire
Complaint is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
 
            Defendants
do not specify whether they seek judgment on the pleadings based on a theory of
claim preclusion or issue preclusion, as they rely on authorities
which apply the term “res judicata” to both theories. (See Mycogen Corp. v.
Monsanto Co. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 904.) Defendants also state that the
elements for application of claim preclusion and issue preclusion are
identical. (Boeken v. Philip Morris USA, Inc. (2010) 48 Cal.4th 788,
797.) Neither statement is an accurate recitation of current law. In DKN Holdings
LLC v. Faerber (2015) 61 Cal.4th 813, the California Supreme Court
clarified the distinctions between “claim preclusion” and “issue preclusion” thus:
 
We have frequently
used “res judicata” as an umbrella term encompassing both claim preclusion and
issue preclusion, which we described as two separate “aspects” of an
overarching doctrine. (E.g., Boeken, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 797, 108
Cal.Rptr.3d 806, 230 P.3d 342; Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. v. Dominion (1962)
58 Cal.2d 601, 604, 25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439 (Teitelbaum Furs).) Claim preclusion,
the “‘“primary aspect”’” of res judicata, acts to bar claims that were, or
should have been, advanced in a previous suit involving the same parties. (Boeken, at
p. 797, 108 Cal.Rptr.3d 806, 230 P.3d 342.) Issue preclusion, the “‘“secondary
aspect”’” historically called collateral estoppel, describes the bar on
relitigating issues that were argued and decided in the first suit. (Ibid.)
 
We have sometimes
described “res judicata” as synonymous with claim preclusion, while reserving
the term “collateral estoppel” for issue preclusion. (See Mycogen Corp. v.
Monsanto Co. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 896, 123 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 51 P.3d 297 (Mycogen).)
On occasion, however, we have used the term “res judicata” more broadly, even
in a case involving only issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel. (See Bernhard
v. Bank of America (1942) 19 Cal.2d 807, 813, 122 P.2d 892.) We are not the
only court to sometimes use the term “res judicata” with imprecision. (See,
e.g., Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed. (1984) 465 U.S.
75, 77, fn. 1, 104 S.Ct. 892, 79 L.Ed.2d 56.) To avoid future confusion, we
will follow the example of other courts and use the terms “claim preclusion” to
describe the primary aspect of the res judicata doctrine and “issue preclusion”
to encompass the notion of collateral estoppel. (See ibid.) It
is important to distinguish these two types of preclusion because they have
different requirements.
 
Claim preclusion
“prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between
the same parties or parties in privity with them.” (Mycogen, supra, 28
Cal.4th at p. 896, 123 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 51 P.3d 297.) Claim preclusion arises
if a second suit involves: (1) the same cause of action (2) between the same
parties (3) after a final judgment on the merits in the first suit. (Ibid.,
In re Crow (1971) 4 Cal.3d 613, 622, 94 Cal.Rptr. 254, 483 P.2d 1206; Teitelbaum
Furs, supra, 58 Cal.2d at p. 604, 25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439.) If claim preclusion
is established, it operates to bar relitigation of the claim altogether.
 
Issue preclusion prohibits
the relitigation of issues argued and decided in a previous case, even if the
second suit raises different causes of action. (Mycogen, supra, 28
Cal.4th at p. 896, 123 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 51 P.3d 297.) Under issue preclusion,
the prior judgment conclusively resolves an issue actually litigated and
determined in the first action. (Boeken, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 797,
108 Cal.Rptr.3d 806, 230 P.3d 342.) There is a limit to the reach of issue
preclusion, however. In accordance with due process, it can be asserted only
against a party to the first lawsuit, or one in privity with a party. (Bernhard
v. Bank of America, supra, 19 Cal.2d at p. 812, 122 P.2d 892.)
 
Issue preclusion
differs from claim preclusion in two ways. First, issue preclusion does not bar
entire causes of action. Instead, it prevents relitigation of previously
decided issues. Second, unlike claim preclusion, issue preclusion can be raised
by one who was not a party or privy in the first suit. (Vandenberg v.
Superior Court (1999) 21 Cal.4th 815, 828, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 366,
982 P.2d 229.) “Only the party against whom the doctrine is invoked must
be bound by the prior proceeding. [Citations.]” (Ibid.) In summary, issue
preclusion applies: (1) after final adjudication (2) of an identical issue (3)
actually litigated and necessarily decided in the first suit and (4) asserted
against one who was a party in the first suit or one in privity with
that party. (Lucido v. Superior Court (1990) 51 Cal.3d 335, 341, 272
Cal.Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223; Vandenberg, at p. 828, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 366,
982 P.2d 229; Teitelbaum Furs, supra, 58 Cal.2d at p. 604, 25 Cal.Rptr.
559, 375 P.2d 439.)
 
(DKN Holdings, LLC v. Faerber (2015) 61 Cal.4th 813,
823-25 [bold emphasis added, italics in original].) Applying this precedent,
the Court addresses Defendants’ position first with respect to claim
preclusion, and then as to issue preclusion. 
 
1.     
Claim Preclusion
 
To prevail on a theory of claim
preclusion, Defendants must demonstrate the existence of a prior suit which (1)
involved the same cause of action; (2) between the same parties or parties in
privity with those parties, and (3) resulted in a final judgment on the merits.
(DKN Holdings, LLC, supra, 61 Cal.4th at 824.) 
 
Plaintiff argues in opposition that
Defendants have waived the right to assert a theory of claim preclusion by
failing to specifically plead that theory in their answer. (See Answer.) Plaintiff
is correct that claim preclusion must be pled as a defense or else it is
waived, while issue preclusion need only be raised in some form. (Rodgers v.
Sargent Controls & Aerospace (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 82, 88-89.)
However, none of Plaintiff’s authorities address whether the failure to plead
an affirmative defense in the answer precludes a motion for judgment on the
pleadings on the same basis. (See, e.g., JSJ Limited Partnership v. Mehrban (2012)
205 Cal.App.4th 1512, 1526 [Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16 special motion
to strike]; Hulsey v. Koehler (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1150, 1156 [motion
to amend at trial].) Moreover, on a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, the
Court only looks to the face of the pleading under attack. (Hughes v.
Western MacArthur Co. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 951, 954-55.) The Court
therefore rejects Plaintiff’s argument that Defendants cannot assert a theory
of claim preclusion in the context of this motion. 
 
            Turning now
to the merits of the argument, Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s claims
against PACE Funding Group and the California Statewide Communities Development
Authority are precluded by a judgment on the merits in the action Ledle
Garcia v. Elite Home Energy Improvement, Inc. et al. LASC Case No.
19STCV12188 (the “Prior Action.”) (See Defendants’ RJN Exh. C.) In the Prior
Action, filed on April 9, 2019, Plaintiff sued Elite Home Energy Improvement,
Inc., and its owner, Lawrence Smith, for breach of contract, fraud, negligent
misrepresentation, unfair competition, and conversion, arising from those
parties’ false representations that Plaintiff could obtain funding for additions
to her home through the California PACE funding program. (Defendants’ RJN Exh.
A. ¶¶ 20-52.) Plaintiff obtained a default judgment against those defendants on
November 4, 2019. (Defendants’ RJN Exh. C.) 
 
Defendants assert that the
Complaint in the Prior Action asserts the same causes of action in that it
sought to vindicate the same primary right. As our Supreme Court has explained:
 
The primary right
theory is a theory of code pleading that has long been followed in California.
It provides that a “cause of action” is comprised of a “primary right” of the
plaintiff, a corresponding “primary duty” of the defendant, and a wrongful act by
the defendant constituting a breach of that duty. [Citation] The most salient
characteristic of a primary right is that it is indivisible: the violation of a
single primary right gives rise to but a single cause of action. [Citation] A
pleading that states the violation of one primary right in two causes of action
contravenes the rule against “splitting” a cause of action. [Citation] . . . 
 
[T]he primary right
is simply the plaintiff’s right to be free from the particular injury suffered.
[Citation] It must therefore be distinguished from the legal theory on which
liability for that injury is premised: “Even where there are multiple legal theories
upon which recovery might be predicated, one injury gives rise to only one
claim for relief.” . . . The primary right theory . . . is invoked most often
when a plaintiff attempts to divide a primary right and enforce it in two
suits. The theory prevents this result by either of two means: (1) if the first
suit is still pending when the second is filed, the defendant in the second
suit may plead that fact in abatement [citations]; or (2) if the first suit has
terminated in a judgment on the merits adverse to the plaintiff, the defendant
in the second suit may set up that judgment as a bar under the principles of
res judicata.
 
(Crowley v. Katleman (1994) 8 Cal.4th 666, 681-82.)
If a single primary right is invaded, only one cause of action arises, even if
the defendant allegedly breached that right in multiple ways, or under
different legal theories. (Bay Cities Paving & Grading, Inc. v. Lawyers'
Mut. Ins. Co. (1993) 5 Cal.4th 854, 860-61.) Here, Defendants argue that
both this action and the Prior Action seek to redress the same injury: the
recordation of a PACE assessment in the amount of $105,485.04 recorded against
her property when a second-story additional dwelling unit and energy efficiency
upgrades were not installed. (Compare Complaint ¶¶ 118, 135, Prayer ¶ 1 [restitution
of monies paid on PACE loan], ¶ 60, Prayer ¶ 6 [rental income], ¶ 5, 78, 81,
Prayer ¶ 7 [pain and suffering resulting from emotional distress], Prayer ¶ 12 [interest],
¶ 117, 135, Prayer ¶¶ 2, 10 [injunctive relief] with Defendants’ RJN Exh. B.
pp. 5-10.) Plaintiff does not dispute Defendants’ characterization of the
Complaint in this action as seeking relief for the same injury as the Prior
Action. Instead, Plaintiff argues that these Defendants are not in privity with
the defendants in the Prior Action for the purpose of claim preclusion. 
 
            Defendants
contend that claim preclusion applies to this action because it is a second
action between an identical Plaintiff, Ledle Garcia, and Defendants who are in
privity with the prior defendants under the express allegations in the
operative Complaint. As the parties asserting preclusion, Defendants bear the
burden of establishing that they were in privity with the prior Defendants in
that they shared “an identity or community of interest, with adequate
representation of that interest in the first suit, and circumstances such that
the nonparty ‘should reasonably have expected to be bound’ by the first suit. (Grande
v. Eisenhower Med. Ctr. (2022) 13 Cal.5th 313, 326 [internal quotations
omitted].) Defendants make no effort to satisfy these requirements. Instead,
Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s allegation that Smith and Elite acted as
agents for Defendants renders her claims purely derivative. (See Complaint ¶
82.) Defendants rely on Sartor v. Superior Court, where the Court of
Appeal held that claims against corporate employees were precluded by a prior
judgment against the corporation itself. (Sartor v. Superior Court (1982)
136 Cal.App.3d 322, 328.) In particular, Defendants point to Sartor’s
recitation of the California Supreme Court’s holding in Bernhard v. Bank of
America, which described, in dicta the relationship between principal and
agent as an example of derivative liability. (Bernhard v. Bank of America (1942)
19 Cal.2d 807, 812-13; Sartor, supra, 136 Cal.App.3d 326.) The Court is not
persuaded that this authority sufficiently supports a finding that the parties
are in privity based on a single allegation of an agency theory of liability. 
 
Moreover, as Plaintiff states in
opposition, the Complaint asserts that these Defendants engaged in other
conduct, separate from the acts of their alleged agents, which gives rise to
liability. Plaintiff alleges, for example, that Defendants failed to comply with
statutory underwriting and administrative obligations, (Complaint ¶¶ 22-30), failed
to conduct due diligence regarding the conduct of their contractor (¶¶ 33,
47-53), failed to establish and enforce practices to provide “heightened
protections and oversight around the solicitation of homeowners for PACE loans,
the criteria for determining lending eligibility based on the homeowner’s
income and home equity, and procedures for validating the project is PACE
eligible and a homeowner’s ability to repay those loans,” (¶¶ 111-112) and
misrepresented their program and the oversight of their contractors. (¶ 132.) The
Court is persuaded that these allegations constitute more than a pure agency
theory of liability, and therefore bring Plaintiff’s claims outside the scope
of “entirely deriv[ative]” liability. (See Grande, supra, 13 Cal.5th at 331
[mere factual overlap between claims does not suffice to establish that
liability of one party is entirely derivative of another’s].) “When a
defendant's liability is entirely derivative from that of a party
in an earlier action, claim preclusion bars the second action because the
second defendant stands in privity with the earlier one.”  (DKN Holdings LLC v. Faerber (2015) 61
Cal. 4th 813, 827-828 [Citations omitted; emphasis added].) Because this is not
the case here, Defendants have failed to demonstrate that they stand in privity
with the defendants in the Prior Action. 
 
As Defendants have failed to
demonstrate privity for the purposes of claim preclusion, Defendants have not
demonstrated that the doctrine of claim preclusion bars Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
 
2.     
Issue Preclusion
 
Defendants also argue that
Plaintiff’s Complaint is barred by the doctrine of issue preclusion. Under DKN
Holdings, this argument is without merit insofar as the doctrine of issue
preclusion does not and cannot bar a plaintiff from seeking redress from a
different obligor for prevailing against another party in the first
action. (DKN Holdings, supra, 61 Cal.4th at 827.) 
 
The Court therefore finds
Defendants’ challenges to the Complaint based on either issue or claim
preclusion to be without merit. 
 
Government Tort Claims Act
 
            Defendant
California Statewide Communities Development Authority also moves for judgment
on the pleadings on the basis that Plaintiff did not properly present her claim
pursuant to Government Code section 911.2. Although Defendants characterize
this provision as a statute of limitations, Defendants’ argument is more
properly construed as asserting a violation of the Government Tort Claims Act.
In any event, Government Code section 911.2 requires that any claim other than
one for death or injury to person or personal property must be presented to the
public entity within one year of the accrual of the cause of action. (Gov. Code
§ 911.2(a).) However, a public entity may not assert that defense unless it is
in substantial compliance with the filing requirements of Government Code
section 53051 no later than 70 days after accrual of the claims. (Gov. Code §
946.4.) To comply with these requirements, a governing body
of the public agency must file, with the Secretary of State and the county
clerk of each county in which the agency maintains an office, a statement of
(1) the full legal name of the agency; (2) the official mailing address of the
agency’s governing body; (3) the name and residence or business address of each
member of that body; and (4) the name, title, and residence or business address
of the chairperson, president or other presiding officer, and clerk or
secretary of the governing body. (Gov. Code § 53051(a).) 
 
Plaintiff argues, in opposition,
that Defendants were not in compliance with the filing requirements between
2018 and 2021. Plaintiff presents the public rosters of agencies for 2018 (when
the earliest events alleged in the Complaint occurred) through 2021 (when the
Complaint was filed), none of which list CSCDA as a registered entity.
(Plaintiffs’ RJN Exh. 1-4.) Plaintiff has therefore demonstrated that Defendant
CSCDA was not in compliance with the filing requirements. Defendant’s failure
unconditionally excuses Plaintiff from the claim presentation requirement. (See
Spencer v. Merced Cnty Off. Of Educ. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1429, 1439.)  
 
Defendant has failed to demonstrate
that Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the Government Tort Claims Act. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
