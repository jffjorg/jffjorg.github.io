And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Verizon's motion to consolidate its civil action against the Church with the Church's unlawful detainer action against Verizon. The judge rules that unlawful detainer actions, which seek possession of the leased premises, should not be consolidated with civil actions brought by the tenant against the landlord. The factual and legal issues in the two actions do not overlap to a sufficient extent to warrant consolidation.
