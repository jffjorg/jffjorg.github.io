  Case Number:  21STCV31578    Hearing Date:   October 13, 2023    Dept:  57 Verizon's motion to consolidate its civil action against the Church with the Church's unlawful detainer action against Verizon is denied.As a general matter, unlawful detainer actions brought by a landlord against a tenant should not be consolidated with civil actions brought by the tenant against the landlord.  That is because unlawful detainer actions seek possession of the leased premises.  Verizon has not demonstrated why that general rule should give way here.   The Church's litigation goal in the unlawful detainer action is to gain possession of the roof space that Verizon leases following expiration of the lease.  The factual and legal issues related to that goal do not overlap with the factual and legal issues in Verizon's civil action, which seeks damages arising from the Church's conduct towards Verizon during the lease term, to such an extent that consolidation is warranted.
