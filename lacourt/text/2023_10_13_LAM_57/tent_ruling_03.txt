 Case Number:  23IWUD01567    Hearing Date:   October 13, 2023    Dept:  57 The Court's tentative ruling is to grant the Church's motion for summary judgment and deny Verizon's.  But the Court would like to hear from Verizon's counsel on the following question:Does the rule that a landlord's acceptance of rent from the tenant following expiration of the lease creates a periodic, month-to-month tenancy apply when, as here in Paragraph 11 of the lease between the Church and Verizon, the lease expressly provides for payment of rent for a specific period of time in which the tenant remains in possession of the leased premises following the expiration of the lease?
