```

And here is the summary in English text:

Judge Joel L. Lofton's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's ex parte application to seal court records. The plaintiff, Johnny Trang, seeks to seal documents containing his medical condition and employment history. The court finds that the plaintiff has not shown an overriding interest that supports sealing, as the documents do not contain private or personal information. The plaintiff's request is overly broad and does not meet the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 2.550, subd. (d). The court also notes that the plaintiff's reliance on the case Oiye v. Fox (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1036 is not persuasive, as the documents at issue in that case were personal treatment journals, whereas the documents at issue here are public court records. As a result, the plaintiff's application to seal is denied.
