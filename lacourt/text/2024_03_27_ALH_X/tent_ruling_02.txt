RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Defendant moves for an order
compelling Plaintiff to provide further responses to his requests for the
production of documents, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff KZ
International, LLC’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Defendant Armen E. Babayan sold
Plaintiff unlawfully obtained products. Plaintiff filed a complaint on March
23, 2023, alleging three causes of action for (1) breach of the implied
warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, (2) negligent interference with
prospective economic relations, and (3) unjust enrichment.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
             Defendant’s motions to compel further responses are GRANTED.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses within 20 days of the date of
this order. 
 
            Defendant’s
requests for sanctions are denied. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
On receipt of a response to discovery requests, the party requesting may
move for an order compelling further responses for interrogatories (Code Civ.
Proc. 2030.300), requests for admission (Cod. Civ. Proc. section 2033.290), and
request for production (Code Civ. Proc. section 2031.310). “Unless notice of
this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or
any supplemental verified response, or any specific later date to which the
requesting party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
requesting party waives any right to compel further response to the requests
for admission.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2033.290, subd. (c).
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant moves for an order compelling Plaintiff to provide further
responses to his discovery requests. Defendant served his form interrogatories,
special interrogatories, and requests for the production of documents on April
28, 2023. (Cunningham Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant provides Plaintiff served deficient responses on
June 22, 2023. (Id. ¶ 4.) The parties met and conferred and agreed to a
protective order. (Id. ¶¶ 5-9.) The parties agreed to extend the
deadline for the present motions until December 19, 2024. (Id. ¶ 10,
Exhibit G at p. 2.) 
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiff provides that Defendant’s motion violates its due process
because it violates California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subdivision (d),
which provides that “[a] motion concerning interrogatories, inspection demands, or
admission requests must identify the interrogatories, demands, or requests by
set and number.” However Plaintiff argues that 
Defendant’s motions are deficient because Defendant’s notices
fail to contain the required information. However, the applicable rule does not
require Defendant to place the specific information solely in the notice of
motion. Defendant includes the applicable information in its motions and
separate statements. 
 
            Plaintiff
also argues that the motions should be denied because it served supplemental
responses. However, Plaintiff does not support that statement with a
declaration or provide which discovery requests or type of requests it served
supplemental responses to. Thus, the court now turns to the specific discovery
requests at issue.
