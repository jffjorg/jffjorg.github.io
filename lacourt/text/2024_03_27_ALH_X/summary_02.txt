Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant's motions to compel further responses to discovery requests, ordering Plaintiff to provide additional responses within 20 days. The judge has also denied Defendant's requests for sanctions. The dispute arose when Defendant served discovery requests on April 28, 2023, and Plaintiff served deficient responses on June 22, 2023. The parties agreed to a protective order, but Defendant claimed that Plaintiff failed to comply with the order. The judge has reviewed the parties' filings and has determined that Defendant's motions to compel further responses are justified.
