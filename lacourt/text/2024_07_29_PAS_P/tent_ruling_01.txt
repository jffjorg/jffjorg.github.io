  Case Number:  23AHCV01660    Hearing Date:   July 29, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER ON PLAINTIFF’S MOTIONS TO COMPEL INITIAL RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES AND
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTSI.        BACKGROUND
          Plaintiff Jennifer Audette filed her complaint against
defendants Michael and Linda Tang, as Trustees of the Tang Michael & L
Family Trust; the City of San Marino; and the County of Los Angeles on July 21,
2023, alleging causes of action for negligence and dangerous condition of
public property.
          The facts governing these motions are undisputed.
          On March 25, 2024, Plaintiff served defendant the City of
San Marino (“Defendant”) with special interrogatories and requests for
production of documents. (Saylor Decls., ¶ 3.)
          On April 22, 2024, Defendant responded with objections only.
(Id., ¶ 4.) Defendant promised substantive responses to follow. (Barber
Decl., ¶ 3 [“precautionary objections” served 4/22/24, promising “[r]esponses
will follow in due course”].)
          Counsel met and conferred throughout April and May 2024
about the timing of Defendant’s substantive responses. (Ibid.) Defendant’s
counsel struggled to obtain necessary information from City staff, and kept
Plaintiff’s counsel apprised. (Ibid.)
          On May 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motions to
compel responses and for sanctions.
          On July 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Non-Opposition, noting that Defendant had not filed or served an opposition,
nor had they responded to discovery. (Suppl. Saylor Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.)
          On July 23, 2024, Defendant filed an untimely opposition
indicating it had provided responses – albeit unverified ones – on July 18,
2024. (Barber Decl., ¶ 3 [“7/18/24 – Defendant’s unverified responses were
served with verifications to follow shortly.”].)
          Plaintiff filed no reply.
 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
          “If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response . . . [t]he party
propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to
the interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)-(b).)  Equivalently, “[i]f a party to whom a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve
a timely response [t]he party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand.  (Id., § 2031.300(a)-(b).) 
          For either method of discovery, the
responding party has thirty (30) days to serve responses from the date the
discovery requests are propounded. (Id., §§ 2030.260, 2031.260.) A Code-compliant
response contains an answer, an objection, or some combination. (Id., §§
2030.210-240, 2031.210-240.)
 
          III. ANALYSIS
          1. The Motion is Procedurally Improper
          Plaintiff filed the wrong kind of motion, so the motions
must be denied. 
It
is undisputed that Defendant did respond to discovery. Defendant
concedes its initial objection-only responses were insufficient and has
supplemented them accordingly. But Plaintiff should have brought a motion to
compel further responses, given that Defendant had already served
responses by the time Plaintiff filed her motion.
          Defendant also contends, and Plaintiff filed no reply
denying, that Defendant has now provided substantive responses, and the motion
is moot.
          The motion is denied.
          2. The Court Imposes No Sanctions
          Ordinarily, a party unsuccessfully moving to compel
discovery responses – here, Plaintiff – is subject to sanctions. (Id., §§
2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).) But not if the motion was substantially justified. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff’s motion was substantially justified, albeit procedurally misplaced.
The Court imposes no sanctions (and Defendant asked for none).
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          The motion is denied. The Court imposes no sanctions.
