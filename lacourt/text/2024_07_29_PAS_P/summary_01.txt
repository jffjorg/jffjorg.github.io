And here is the summary in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by plaintiff Jennifer Audette to compel responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff had served the defendants with special interrogatories and requests for production of documents, but the defendants only responded with objections and promised substantive responses to follow. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel responses, which the defendants opposed. The judge denied the motion, finding that it was procedurally improper. The judge also declined to impose sanctions on the plaintiff, finding that the motion was substantially justified.
