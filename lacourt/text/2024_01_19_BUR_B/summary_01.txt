And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the City's motions to compel Mirzaian's initial discovery responses. The City had demanded production of discovery requests without objections, despite previously agreeing to preserve Mirzaian's fifth amendment objections. The judge found that the City's conduct was unreasonable and without substantial justification. The judge also denied the City's motion for monetary sanctions, stating that the City failed to provide sufficient evidence to assess the amount of sanctions.
