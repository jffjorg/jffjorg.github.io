And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiffs' motion to partially lift the stay and allow discovery to proceed during the appeal of the Anti-SLAPP motion. The motion was filed by the Plaintiffs, Susana Madrid and Daniel Villa, who are seeking to take PMQ depositions of Defendant O.L. Development and the City of Los Angeles. The Defendants, including O.L. Development, Helio Group, Simon Lazar, and Venue Residences LLC, oppose the motion, arguing that the discovery stay should remain in place until the appeal is resolved. The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated good cause to lift the stay and that judicial economy will be best served by postponing discovery until all litigants can participate.
