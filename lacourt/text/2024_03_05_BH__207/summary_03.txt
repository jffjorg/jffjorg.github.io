  - Defendant: Subaru of America, Inc.

Significant Statements:
  - The phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer’s new car warranty” appears to apply to “any car sold with a manufacturer’s warranty still in force.”
  - Existing case law holds that a used motor vehicle sold or leased with a balance of the manufacturer’s original warranty is a ‘new motor vehicle’ for purposes of California’s Lemon Law.
  - The legislature was expressly aware of Jensen and understood Jensen to mean that Song-Beverly’s “new motor vehicle” provisions apply to used cars sold “with a balance of the manufacturer’s original warranty[.]”
```

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment or adjudication, finding that the Song-Beverly Act does apply to the sale of used vehicles with a balance remaining on the original new vehicle warranty, and that the defendant provided an express warranty in connection with the sale of the vehicle.
