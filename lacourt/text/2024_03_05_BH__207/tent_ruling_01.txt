MOTION
 
Cross-Complainants Ofer Shapira and
Surveying & Drafting Services (“Surveying”) move to enforce the settlement
agreement entered into between Surveying and Cross-Defendant Showtime
Construction Engineering, PC (“Showtime”). 
Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6 provides that “[i]f parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
664.6.) In ruling on a motion to enter judgment, the court acts as a trier of
fact. The court must determine whether the parties entered into a valid and
binding settlement. To do so, the court may receive oral testimony in addition
to declarations. (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530,
1533.)
 
The issue on a motion to enforce
settlement agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 is whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement agreement. (See Viejo v.
Bancorp. (1989) 217 Cal.App.3d 200, 209, fn. 4 [“a court's power to make
factual determinations under section 664.6 is generally limited to whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement agreement”].)  In other words, the only issue before a court
is whether an agreement exists; not whether the agreement has been breached.
 
Surveying originally filed the motion
on May 18, 2023.  Attached to the motion
and authenticated by the May 17, 2023 declaration of Edward F. Morrison, Jr. is
a fully executed settlement agreement requiring Showtime to pay Surveying
$15,000.00 “no later than twenty (20) days after this Settlement Agreement has
been fully executed by the PARTIES.”  The
agreement was fully executed on December 1, 2022.
 
At the May 30, 2023 hearing, the
parties requested the hearing be continued to give Showtime additional time to
pay the settlement amount.  (May 30, 2023
Minute Order.)  The Court continued the
hearing to June 22, 2023.  (Ibid.)  
 
On June 20, 2023, Surveying filed the
June 20, 2023 Declaration of Edward F. Morrison, Jr., requesting another
continuance to January 2024.  Attached to
the June 20, 2023 Morrison Declaration is a document titled “First Amendment to
Settlement Agreement” which indicates Showtime shall pay Surveying $16,425 as
follows: (1) $5,000 within ten days after the Amendment has been executed by
the parties, (2) a minimum monthly payment of $476 on or before the 5th
day of July 2023, August 2023, September 2023, October 2023, November 2023 and
December 2023, and (3) any portion of the balance remaining as of December 5,
2023 shall be paid on or before December 15, 2023.  The First Amendment to Settlement Agreement
is only partially executed by Showtime on June 19, 2023.
 
On January 30, 2024, Surveying voluntarily
continued the hearing again to March 5.
 
While it is clear the parties have a
settlement agreement, as evidenced by the fully executed settlement agreement
attached to the original motion, it appears there may be subsequent amendments
affecting the terms of that agreement. 
Because the precise terms of the parties’ current agreement are unclear
from the record, the Court cannot enter judgment at this time.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Therefore,
the Court denies Surveying’s motion to enforce settlement. 
 
Surveying shall provide notice and
file a proof of service regarding the same.
