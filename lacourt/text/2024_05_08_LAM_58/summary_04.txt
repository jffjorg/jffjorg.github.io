And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the Complaint is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action. The Court sustains the demurrer as to the first cause of action for breach of contract, the second cause of action for negligence, and the other causes of action for lost wages, battery, assault, and wrongful termination. The Court finds that the Complaint lacks specific allegations of a contract, a meeting of the minds, and sufficient facts to state a cause of action. The Court also finds that the allegations of physical and verbal abuse, loss of wages, and commissions are vague and unintelligible. The Court grants leave to amend the Complaint, and the amended Complaint must be served and filed by May 17, 2024.
