And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff sued the defendant under the Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Disabled Persons Act, and Americans with Disabilities Act, alleging that the defendant's restaurant failed to comply with disability access laws during a visit in May 2023. The plaintiff submitted evidence, including photographs and witness statements, to support his claim. However, the judge found that the evidence presented was insufficient to justify a default judgment. The judge noted that the evidence did not clearly show which table at the restaurant presented a problem for the plaintiff, and the investigator's qualifications and methods were not clearly set forth. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment.
