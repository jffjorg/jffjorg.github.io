[1] The
causes of action, as listed here, appear this way on pages 16-24 on the
Complaint.  However, the causes of action
are described in confusing and contradictory ways throughout the Complaint. (pp
1-4; pp 40-46.) 
 


[2] Plaintiff’s Opposition was titled as
“Plaintiff’s Answer to Quility-Asurea Agency Insurance Services, LLC Notice of
Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint and Motion to Strike. Defendants are wrong
and liable to Plaintiff for damages in the amount of $165,700.”  This caption/title was handwritten and
challenging to read. Plaintiff’s Answer/Opposition was also untimely. The Court
considers it nevertheless.
