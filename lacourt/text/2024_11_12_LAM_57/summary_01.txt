And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions in limine. Defendant's motion in limine number 17 is granted to the extent that it seeks to exclude expert testimony that the defendant's handling of the claim was malicious, oppressive, or fraudulent. However, the expert, David Easton, may still testify about the defendant's handling of the claim and offer opinions about it, just not opinions on malicious, oppressive, or fraudulent handling. The judge believes that this type of testimony would invade the province of the jury.

On the other hand, the defendant's motion in limine number 17 is denied to the extent that it seeks to exclude expert testimony that the defendant's denial of the claim was done in bad faith. The judge believes that this type of testimony is appropriate and is not barred by Evidence Code Section 805.

Finally, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion in limine number 7, which seeks to exclude the use of civil fraud judgments entered against certain of the plaintiff's witnesses for impeachment purposes. The judge believes that the defendant failed to adequately address and apply the standards for using a civil fraud judgment to impeach the credibility of a witness.
