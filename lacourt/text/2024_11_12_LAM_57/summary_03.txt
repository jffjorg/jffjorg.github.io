And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Apeel's motion to quash a deposition subpoena for the production of business records that Akasha Farber issued to Culture Amp, Inc. (CAI). The subpoena sought the results of surveys that CAI conducted for Apeel of its employees. The judge found that the surveys are relevant to Farber's claims of retaliation, wrongful termination, and unfair business practices, as they may reveal whether other Apeel employees believed they were misclassified and not receiving wages and benefits owed. The judge also found that Apeel's concerns for employee privacy are overstated, as the surveys are anonymous and Apeel has not shown how Farber will be able to ascertain the identities of any employees from the anonymized surveys. Finally, the judge found that the subpoena is not overbroad, as it seeks only the results of surveys conducted for a 12-month period in 2022, and Farber has agreed to modify the subpoena to seek only anonymized employee survey results.
