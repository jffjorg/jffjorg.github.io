And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash revised subpoenas issued by the defendants to four of the plaintiff's former employers. The revised subpoenas are narrower in scope than the initial subpoenas, which were previously quashed by the court at the plaintiff's request. The court has denied the plaintiff's motions to quash the revised subpoenas, finding that they adequately address the concerns that led to the quashing of the initial subpoenas. The court has also denied the defendants' request to impose monetary sanctions on the plaintiff for seeking to quash the revised subpoenas, finding that the plaintiff had substantial justification for doing so.
