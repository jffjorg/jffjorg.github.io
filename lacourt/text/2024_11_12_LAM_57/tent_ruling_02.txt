 Case Number:  21STCV41652    Hearing Date:   November 12, 2024    Dept:  57 Plaintiff's motions to quash revised subpoenas that Defendants issued to four of Plaintiff's former employers seeking Plaintiff's employment records are denied.  The revised subpoenas are narrower than the initial subpoenas that Defendants issued to the former employers.  The revised subpoenas address the concerns that the Court had about the prior subpoenas that led the Court to grant Plaintiff's motions to quash those subpoenas.   The Court is denying Defendants' request to impose monetary sanctions on Plaintiff for seeking to quash the revised subpoenas.   In the Court's view, Plaintiff had substantial justification for doing so.
