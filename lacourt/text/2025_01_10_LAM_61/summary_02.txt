And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by James F. Drake IV, an attorney representing Traon Call, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was incomplete, lacking proof of service on the client and other parties, and the proposed order form was not completed with upcoming hearing dates, as required by court rules. The judge found that the lack of notice and undue prejudice to the client justified denying the motion, which is set to be heard on January 10, 2025. The upcoming trial is scheduled to begin on February 11, 2025.
