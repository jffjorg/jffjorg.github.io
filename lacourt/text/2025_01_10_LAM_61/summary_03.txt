And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering a motion by Shaun J. Bauman, counsel for Plaintiff Kemani Lynel Foster, to be relieved as counsel in this case. Bauman is seeking to be relieved of his duties as counsel due to a breakdown in communication with Foster, who has failed to respond to requests to sign a substitution form. The judge is requiring that Bauman provide additional information and documentation to support his motion, including a declaration stating why he is bringing the motion instead of filing a consent, proof of service of the motion, and all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding. The judge is also requiring that Bauman prepare a proposed order relieving him as counsel on the appropriate court form and lodge it with the court with the moving papers. The judge is granting the motion, subject to Bauman providing the required information and documentation, and is ordering Bauman to give notice to the parties involved.
