The judge is granting the motion to relieve counsel for Defendant Mary Corey, filed by Corine Zygelman, Todd G. Lezon, and Diana R. Torres-Brito of the firm Murchison & Cumming, LLC. The motion was brought due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The judge notes that there is no prejudice likely to result from the order sought and that the requirements for the motion, as set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure section 284 and California Rule of Court 3.1362, have been met. The order will be effective once moving counsel files proof of service of the signed order on the client.
