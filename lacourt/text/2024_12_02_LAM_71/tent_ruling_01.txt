Judgment
Debtors Sina Akhtarzad’s, Amey Enterprise, Inc.’s, Kourosh Akhtarzad’s, Yousef
Akhtarzad’s, Shirin Akhtarzad’s, and Shahpar Akhtarzad’s motion to tax costs is continued
to February 25, 2024, at 8:30 AM, pending the final resolution of the
non-dischargeability action in In re Ramesh Akhtarzad and Sina Akhtarzad,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court C.D. Cal. Case No. 2:11-BK-61640.

 
Judgment Debtors Sina Akhtarzad
(“Sina”), Amey Enterprise, Inc. (“Amey Enterprise”), Kourosh Akhtarzad
(“Kourosh”), Yousef Akhtarzad (“Yousef”), Shirin Akhtarzad (“Shirin”), and
Shahpar Akhtarzad (“Shahpar”) (collectively, “Judgment Debtors”) move to strike
Judgment Creditors 8451 Melrose Property, LLC’s (“8451 Melrose”) and Jack
Simantob’s (“Simantob”) (collectively, “Judgment Creditors”) Memorandum of
Costs After
Judgment, Acknowledgement of Credit, and Declaration of Accrued Interest (“Memorandum
of Costs”).  (Notice Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P.
§685.070.)  
Judgment Debtors move on the grounds
that the numbers and calculations set forth in the Memorandum of Costs are in
direct violation of the orders entered by the bankruptcy court in Sina’s
Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, and the Memorandum of Costs improperly seeks to
impose the interest accrued on the original judgment against Judgment Debtors
when they were complete strangers to said judgment.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §916 provides that, “[e]xcept as
provided in Sections 917.1 . . . the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings
in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters
embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or
order.”  (C.C.P. §916(a).)  Where a money judgment is at issue, the
perfecting of appeal requires posting of an undertaking on appeal.  (C.C.P. §917.1.) 
“The purpose of the automatic stay
provision of section 916, subdivision (a), is to protect the appellate court’s
jurisdiction by preserving the status quo until the appeal is decided.”  (Cunningham v. Magidow (2013) 219
Cal.App.4th 298, 304.)  “In determining
whether a matter is embraced in or affected by the appeal, [the trial court]
must consider the appeal and its possible outcomes in relation to the
proceeding and its possible results.”  (Varian
Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 189; see also In
re Marriage of Horowitz (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 377, 381 [“[W]hether a matter
is ‘embraced’ in or ‘affected’ by a judgment [or order] within the meaning of
[section 916] depends on whether post-judgment [or post-order] proceedings on
the matter would have any effect on the ‘effectiveness’ of the appeal.”].)
 
Discussion
Judgment Debtor’s motion is continued
to February 25, 2024, at 8:30 AM to be heard on the same day as Judgment
Creditors’ motion for attorneys’ fees.  
Judgment Debtors have perfected their
appeal by posting the corrected undertaking on appeal in the amount ordered by
the Court.  Judgment Debtors’ Notice of
Appeal states that their appeal involves both the Court’s June 11, 2024, order
granting Judgment Creditors’ motion to add Judgment Debtors to the Judgment and
the July 17, 2024, Amendment of Judgment.
The instant motion to tax costs requires
this Court to rule on issues embraced by the appeal.  “[W]hile an appeal from a judgment is pending,
[the trial court] has no power to amend or correct its judgment.”  (Shay v. Chicago Clock Co. (1896) 111
Cal. 549, 552.)  Any “proceedings taken
after the notice of appeal was filed are a nullity.”  (Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d
892, 912.)  “This is true even if the
subsequent proceedings cure any purported defect in the judgment or order
appealed from.”  (Varian Medical
Systems, Inc., 35 Cal.4th at pg. 197.) 
Therefore, this Court is without jurisdiction to rule on the instant
motion at this juncture.
Accordingly, Judgment Debtor’s motion
is continued to February 25, 2024, at 8:30 AM to be heard on the same day as
Judgment Creditors’ motion for attorneys’ fees. 

 
Conclusion
Judgment Debtors’ motion to tax Judgment
Creditors’ Memorandum of Costs is continued to February 25, 2024, at 8:30 AM to
be heard on the same day as Judgment Creditors’ motion for attorneys’ fees, pending the final resolution of the
non-dischargeability action in In re Ramesh Akhtarzad and Sina Akhtarzad,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court C.D. Cal. Case No. 2:11-BK-61640.
