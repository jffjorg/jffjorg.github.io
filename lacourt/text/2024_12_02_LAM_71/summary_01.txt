As for the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a future court hearing. The hearing is scheduled for December 2, 2024, and the judge is continuing a motion by the judgment debtors (Sina Akhtarzad, et al.) to tax costs until February 25, 2024, at 8:30 AM. The motion is pending the final resolution of a non-dischargeability action in a related bankruptcy case. The judge is also considering a motion by the judgment creditors (8451 Melrose Property, LLC and Jack Simantob) for attorneys' fees. The judge is staying proceedings on the motion to tax costs because the appeal is pending and the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the issue until the appeal is resolved.
