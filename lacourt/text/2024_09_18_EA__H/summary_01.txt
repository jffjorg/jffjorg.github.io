Here is the YAML summary of the tentative ruling:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 22PSCV00253
* Hearing Date: September 18, 2024
* Department: H
* Parties:
	+ Plaintiff: City of El Monte
	+ Defendant: Paul Pui Wu, et al.

**Background**

* Plaintiff alleges that defendants have been using a property to cultivate, manufacture, store, and/or sell marijuana in violation of municipal and state law.

**Legal Standard**

* A demurrer may be made if the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or is uncertain.
* Courts read allegations liberally and in context, and defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.

**Discussion**

* Wu demurs to the first through fifth causes of action in Plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the complaint is unmeritorious and unsupported by allegations.
* Wu's demurrer is overruled due to improper combining of demurrer and motion to strike, failure to identify specific parts of the complaint, and extrinsic facts not subject to judicial notice.

**Statute of Limitations**

* Wu asserts that the complaint is time-barred by the one-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, but fails to provide analysis on how each cause of action constitutes an "action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture".
* The Court determines that Wu's argument fails at this juncture.

**Other Issues**

* Wu argues that the complaint is barred by the three-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (b), but the Court determines that this applies to private nuisance causes of action, not public nuisance causes of action.
* Wu also argues that the complaint is barred by administrative exhaustion, but fails to provide legal authority and the Court determines that exhaustion is not required.
* Wu asserts that certain causes of action are moot, but the Court declines to consider extrinsic facts not subject to judicial notice.

**Conclusion**

* For the foregoing reasons, Wu's demurrer is overruled.

Here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling overrules Defendant Paul Pui Wu's demurrer to the Plaintiff's complaint. The Plaintiff, City of El Monte, alleges that the defendants have been using a property to cultivate, manufacture, store, and/or sell marijuana in violation of municipal and state law. Wu demurred to the first through fifth causes of action, arguing that the complaint is unmeritorious and unsupported by allegations. However, the Court determined that Wu's demurrer was improper due to combining it with a motion to strike, failing to identify specific parts of the complaint, and presenting extrinsic facts not subject to judicial notice. Additionally, Wu's arguments regarding statute of limitations and administrative exhaustion were found to be without merit. The Court concludes that Wu's demurrer is overruled.
