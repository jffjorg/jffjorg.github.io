Monte v. Wu, et al. (22PSCV00253) 
ORDER

Defendant Paul Pui Wu’s Demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint is OVERRULED.
Background  

Plaintiff City of El Monte
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that Defendants Paul Pui Wu (“Wu”) and Le Hong
Rong (“Rong”) (together, “Defendants”) have been using the property located at
12342 Ferris Road, El Monte, CA 91732 to cultivate, manufacture, store, and/or
sell marijuana in violation of municipal and state law.On
March 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against
Defendants and Does 1-100 for: 1. Narcotics Abatement (Health & Safety Code §§ 11570 et seq.); 2. Public
Nuisance (Civil Code §§ 3479 et seq.);3. Violation
of El Monte Municipal Code (EMMC Chapters 5.18 and Ch. 1.19);4. Violation
of Unfair Competition Law (Business & Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq.); and5. Violation
of the Medical and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (Business &
Professions Code §§ 26000 et seq.)On
December 18, 2023, the Court dismissed the complaint without prejudice as
against Rong.On April 9, 2024, a “Stipulation to
Set Aside Default and Order” was entered as to Wu.Pending before the Court is Wu’s
demurrer to the complaint. For the reasons stated herein, the Court overrules
Wu’s demurrer. 
Legal Standard A demurrer
may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or is uncertain. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and (f).) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In
a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d
902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis
for the claim against him. (Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer does not,
however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in
the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded therein, or
facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may
take judicial knowledge.” (S. Shore Land
Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations omitted].) Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 436, “the court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court.” The grounds for a motion to strike must “appear on the face of the
challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take
judicial notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)  
Discussion Wu demurs to the first through fifth causes of
action in Plaintiff’s complaint; in the alternative, Wu moves to strike “those
portions of the COMPLAINT that the court finds unmeritorious of unsupported by
allegations.” (Notice, 1:21-22.) At the outset, the Court notes that Wu has
improperly combined a demurrer and motion to strike into one responsive
pleading. Further, Wu has failed to identify, in the notice of motion, what specific
part of Plaintiff’s complaint constitutes “irrelevant, false, or improper
matter” or matter “not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 436). “It
is improper for a court to strike a whole cause of action of a pleading under
Code of Civil Procedure section 436. . . Where a whole cause of action is the
proper subject of a pleading challenge, the court should sustain a demurrer to
the cause of action rather than grant a motion to strike.” (Quiroz v.
Seventh Ave. Center (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1281). The Court construes
the instant filing as a demurrer only.Additionally, the Court notes that Wu has proffered
facts that are extrinsic to the face of Plaintiff’s complaint and not the
subject of judicial notice. The Court declines to consider any such information
as beyond the scope of demurrer.  
California Rules of Court rule 3.1110Wu first asserts that the Court should strike
Plaintiff’s complaint on the basis that Plaintiff failed to serve same in
compliance with California Rules of Court rule 3.110(b) (i.e., “[t]he complaint must be served on all named defendants and proofs of
service on those defendants must be filed with the court within 60 days after
the filing of the complaint.”). (Demurrer, 2:21-26, 12:5-8 and 12:25-27.)
Wu, however, fails to provide the Court with any legal authority that a
plaintiff is barred from proceeding with its lawsuit in the event of
noncompliance with California Rules of Court rule 3.110(b).As Plaintiff points out, subdivision (f) provides
that “[i]f
a party fails to serve and file pleadings as required under this rule, and has
not obtained an order extending time to serve its pleadings, the court may
issue an order to show cause why sanctions shall not be imposed.” The Court,
then, has authority to sanction a plaintiff if a proof of service of the
complaint is not filed within 60 days after the complaint is filed, not to strike
the complaint.
Statute of Limitations 
Next, Wu asserts that Plaintiff’s entire complaint
is time-barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in Code of Civil Procedure § 340 (i.e., “[w]ithin one
year: (a) An action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture, if the action
is given to an individual, or to an individual and the state, except if the
statute imposing it prescribes a different limitation. (b) An action upon a statute
for a forfeiture or penalty to the people of this state. . .”). (Demurrer,
3:26-4-12 and 13:6-8.)“A general demurrer
based on the statute of limitations is only permissible where the dates alleged
in the complaint show that the action is barred by the statute of limitations.”
(Roman v. County of Los Angeles (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 316, 324 [citation
omitted].) “The running of the statute must appear ‘clearly and affirmatively’
from the dates alleged. It is not sufficient that the complaint might be barred.” (Id. [citation omitted]; CrossTalk
Productions, Inc. v. Jacobson (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 631, 635 [“A demurrer
based on an affirmative defense cannot properly be sustained where the action might
be barred by the defense, but is not necessarily barred].) The Court determines that Wu’s Code of Civil
Procedure § 340 statute of limitations argument fails at this juncture, as he
fails to provide the Court with any analysis as to how each of Plaintiff’s five
causes of action constitute “actions upon a statute for a penalty or
forfeiture” such that section 340 applies. Wu elsewhere asserts that Plaintiff’s “nuisance
abatement” causes of action are barred by the three year-statute of limitations
in Code of Civil Procedure § 338, subdivision (b) (i.e., “[w]ithin three years:. . . (b) An action for trespass upon or injury to
real property. . .”).
(Demurrer, 13:24-26.) Not so. Plaintiff’s first and second causes of action are
for narcotics abatement pursuant to Health and Safety Code Sections 11570[FN1] et seq. and public nuisance, respectively. Code of Civil Procedure § 338
pertains to private nuisance causes of action. By way of contrast, Civil
Code § 3490 provides that “[n]o lapse of time can legalize a public nuisance,
amounting to an actual obstruction of public right.”[FN2] “[T]here is no statute of limitations in an action brought by a public entity
to abate a public nuisance.” (Beck Development Co. v. Southern Pacific
Transportation Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1160, 1216; Mangini v.
Aerojet-General Corp. (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1125, 1142 [“Section 3490 has
been construed to mean that the statute of limitations is no defense to an
action brought by a public entity to abate a public nuisance”].) Wu’s demurrer
is overruled on this basis.
Second
Cause of Action (i.e., for Public
Nuisance (Civil Code §§ 3479 et seq.) 
Wu next asserts that the second cause of action “in
fact is not a cause of action but rather merely provides
a definition of a public nuisance and provides no remedy and is therefore not a
valid cause of action.” (Demurrer, 3:12-14.) Wu’s argument is not supported by
any legal authority and ignores the prayer of Plaintiff’s complaint. The Court thus overrules Wu’s demurrer on this ground. 

Administrative Exhaustion Wu contends that “Plaintiff
is barred from bringing forward its current action for recovery of penalties
and costs because Plaintiff failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, and
that failure is an absolute bar to the current litigation.” (Demurrer, 5:21-23.)Wu fails to provide the Court with any legal
authority in support of his position, aside from El Monte Municipal Code
(“Code”) 1.19.031, entitled “Administrative procedure for recovering abatement
costs.” This code section does not require that Plaintiff exhaust
administrative proceedings before filing a civil lawsuit. Indeed, while not
cited by either party, Code 1.18.010(D) provides that “[u]se of this chapter shall be at the sole discretion of
the city and is one remedy that the city has to address violations of
the El Monte Municipal Code or other applicable provisions of state law. By
adopting this chapter, the city does not intend to limit its discretion or
ability to utilize any administrative, civil, criminal, or other remedy
available at law or equity, or any combination thereof, to address violations
of the city’s laws.” (Emphasis added). The Court thus overrules Wu’s demurrer as to administrative exhaustion. 
Mootness Wu
asserts that Plaintiff’s first, fourth, and fifth causes of action are moot. The
Court declines to consider Wu’s proffered facts offered in support of his
argument (i.e., including that he “moved back into the Subject Property in late
2019 to repair it, and has continuously resided there since then).” (Demurrer,
3:3-4, 7:2-5, 7:6-9, 8:14-16, 9:18-19, 10:9-10 and 15:2-4.) After
all, these proffered facts are extrinsic to the face of Plaintiff’s complaint
and are not the subject of judicial notice.  
Conclusion For
the foregoing reasons, Wu’s demurrer is overruled.
