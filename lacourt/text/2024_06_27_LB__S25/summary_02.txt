The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint by Defendant Berro Property Management. The cross-complaint seeks indemnification and declaratory relief against Defendant Halj Apartments, LLC based on a 2016 management contract, testimony by Jonathan Hove, and a letter from Defendant Halj's insurance company confirming Defendant Berro as an additional insured. The judge grants leave to file the cross-complaint, finding that the causes of action arise out of the same occurrence as the underlying action, a fire that occurred at a property owned by Jonathan Hove and managed by Defendant Berro. The judge notes that the proposed cross-complaint is permissive and may be granted "in the interest of justice" at any time during the course of the action. The judge grants leave to file the cross-complaint within 10 days of the order.
