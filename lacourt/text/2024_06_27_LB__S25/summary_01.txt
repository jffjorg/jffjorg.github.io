And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Victor Morales v. Ford Motor Company. The case is a lemon law action filed by Morales against Ford Motor Company, alleging that a 2020 Ford F-150 purchased by Morales was defective and could not be repaired by Ford's authorized repair facility. The judge has denied Morales' motion to compel Ford's PMK (a material witness) for deposition, finding that the motion was untimely and that Morales failed to respond to Ford's multiple attempts over several months to comply with the deposition request. The judge notes that the discovery window closed on February 5, 2024, and that Morales did not seek an extension of the discovery deadline.
