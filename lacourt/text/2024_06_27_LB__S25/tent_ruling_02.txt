 Case Number:  23LBCV01324    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn July 14, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants Berro Property Management, Jonathan Hove and Does 1 to 25. In the complaint, Plaintiffs allege five causes of action: (1) Negligence; (2) Constructive Eviction; (3) Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability; (4) Trespass; and (5) Negligent Hiring and Supervision. Plaintiffs allege that on November 25, 2022 a fire occurred at Plaintiff’s residence, a complex on 403 W. 4th Street, Long Beach, CA 90802 (“property”) and that the property was owned by Defendant Jonathan Hove and managed by Defendant Berro Property Management (“Defendant Berro”). (Compl., ¶¶ 1-3, 8, 11.) Plaintiffs allege that the day before, on November 24, 2022, Defendant Berro had hired Doe 1 to make repairs in plumbing in one of the lower unit bathrooms and that an investigation by the Long Beach Fire Department determined the fire was caused by an open flame from a propane torch Doe 1 was using to perform plumbing repairs. (Compl., ¶¶ 10, 11.) Plaintiffs also assert that the property lacked working smoke detectors and they were displaced from their home due to the fire. (Compl., ¶¶ 12, 14.)On August 22, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Doe amendment to the complaint, amending Defendant Jonathan Hove to Defendant Halj Apartments, LLC. (“Defendant Halj”). On October 24, 2023, Defendant Berro filed an answer. On January 12, 2024, Defendant Halj filed an answer. On March 29, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Doe amendment to the complaint, amending Doe 1 to CCL Handyman Corporation.On May 24, 2024, Defendant Berro filed the instant motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. As of June 21, 2024, no opposition has been filed. No reply has been filed either.Legal StandardCode of Civil Procedure section 428.10, subdivision (b), states that a party may file a cross-complaint setting forth “[a]ny cause of action he [or she] has against a person alleged to be liable thereon, whether or not such a person is already a party to the action, if the cause of action in his [or her] cross-complaint, arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as the cause brought against him [or her].” “Cross-complaints for comparative equitable indemnity would appear virtually always transactionally related to the main action.” (Time for Living, Inc. v. Guy Hatfield Homes/All American Development Co. (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 30, 38.) If the proposed cross-complaint is permissive, leave of court may be granted “in the interest of justice” at any time during the course of the action. (Code Civ. Proc. § 428.50, subd. (c).)RulingDefendant Berro seeks indemnification and declaratory relief claims in the proposed cross-complaint against Defendant Halj based upon (1) a 2016 management contract between Defendant Halj and Defendant Berro; (2) Mr. Hove’s testimony on April 15, 2024; and (3) Defendant Halj’s insurance company’s letter confirming Defendant Berro as an additional insured. (Holloway Decl. ¶¶ 3-5, Exh. 1-3.). As these causes of action arise out of the same occurrence as the underlying action, the Court grants leave to file the cross-complaint within 10 days of this order.
