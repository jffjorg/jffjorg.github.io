 Case Number:  23LBCV02441    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundOn December 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for contract damages and enforcement of security interest against Defendants IK Holdings, Inc., Instakush Holdings, LLC., Case Farms, LLC., Waleed Mona and Does 1 to 25. On January 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) against the same Defendants. Plaintiff alleges that it entered into a note purchase agreement with Defendant IK Holdings, Inc. (“Defendant IK”). (Compl., ¶ 10; FAC ¶ 13.) Plaintiff alleges Defendant Waleed Mona (“Defendant Mona”) personally guaranteed repayment of a $1,000,000 promissory note issued by a company that Defendant Mona solely owns and operates. (Compl., ¶¶ 11, 12; FAC ¶¶ 14-16.) On February 28, 2024, Defendant Waleed Mona (“Defendant Mona”) filed an answer.On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed for entry of default judgment as to Defendant IK. On April 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed for entry of default judgment separately as to each of Defendants IK, Instakush Holdings, LLC. and Case Farms, LLC. Following the default prove-up hearing, this Court entered judgment on against Defendants IK, Instakush Holdings, LLC., Case Farms, LLC. (April 23, 2024 Minute Order; May 13, 2024 Judgment.)On June 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel Defendant Mona to appear and testify at deposition and for sanctions. On June 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of Defendant’s non-opposition. No reply has been filed.Legal Standard“The service of a deposition notice…is effective to require any deponent who is a party to the action…to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and copying.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).)“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce forinspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) “The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).)Monetary sanctions are mandatory against an unsuccessful moving or opposing party unless they acted with substantial justification or imposition of sanctions would be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) The court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust." (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)Meet and ConferOn April 22, 2024, Plaintiff served a deposition notice on Defendant Mona by way of his then-counsel of record, Nicholas Kritikos. (Fauver Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. 1.) After meeting and conferring with Defendant Mona’s counsel as to the deposition’s time and location, an amended deposition notice was served, calling Defendant Mona to appear remotely and testify at 10:00 am on May 15, 2024. (Fauver Decl. ¶ 5, Exhs. 1-2.) Defendant Mona did not appear for the May 15, 2024 deposition and a record of non-appearance was taken. (Fauver Decl., ¶ 5, Exhs. 1-2.) A second amended notice was served by Plaintiff on May 15, 2024 calling for a remote deposition of Defendant Mona at May 21, 2024 and Defendant Mona’s counsel confirmed in writing availability of both counsel and client; however, Defendant Mona appeared late on May 21, 2024 and excused himself with a “work emergency” and did not reappear. (Fauver Decl., ¶ 6-8.) Defendant Mona’s then-counsel of record, Mr. Kritikos, filed a substitution of attorney on May 24, 2024 and served Plaintiff’s counsel via email on May 28, 2024. (Fauver Decl., ¶ 10.) Plaintiff’s counsel asserts despite multiple voicemails and emails to Defendant Mona requesting to reschedule the deposition, Defendant Mona has failed to respond, necessitating Plaintiff’s counsel filing the instant motion. (Fauver Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.) Plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and confer requirements.RulingThe Court finds Plaintiff has demonstrated that Defendant Mona has refused to comply with the deposition notice and that Plaintiff has made good faith attempts to secure Defendant Mona’s compliance. Specifically, Defendant Mona failed to appear on May 15, 2024 despite earlier agreement by all parties. (Fauver Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. 2.) When the deposition was rescheduled for May 21, 2024, Defendant Mona arrived late to the deposition and left only 90 minutes into the proceeding despite Defendant Mona’s counsel’s written confirmation of Defendant Mona’s attendance. (Fauver Dec., ¶¶ 6-8.) On May 21, May 22, May 24, May 28, and May 30, Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to secure a date and time to resume Defendant Mona’s deposition but was unable to do so. (Fauver Decl., ¶¶ 9-11, Exhs. 4-5.) Despite Plaintiff’s counsel attempts to secure a date and time to resume Defendant Mona’s deposition, it appears Defendant Mona refuses to cooperate. (Fauver Decl., ¶¶ 9-11, Exhs. 4-5.) Accordingly, Defendant Mona is ordered to appear for deposition on July 9, 2024 as requested by Plaintiff.Monetary sanctions are mandatory against an unsuccessful moving or opposing party unless they acted with substantial justification or imposition of sanctions would be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) Here, Defendant Mona provides no justification for his actions as he has even failed to provide an opposition to this motion. Thus, the Court finds the imposition of monetary sanctions justified. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) The Court imposes $5,000 in sanctions (for attorney’s fees and court reporter costs incurred as a result of Defendant’s failure to attend and to remain for deposition) against Defendant Mona in favor of New Alpha Limited to be paid within 45 days of this order.
