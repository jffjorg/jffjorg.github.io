And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the motion by Emahn Counts, counsel for Fortia Enterprises, Inc., to be relieved as counsel. The Judge's decision is based on several reasons. First, the Notice of Continuance filed on February 29, 2024, references "Fortia Enterprises, LLC," while all other papers refer to Fortia as Fortia Enterprises, Inc. However, the Court will not reject the motion on this ground. Second, the Court notes that there is no proof of service of the original motion, declaration, and/or proposed order on Fortia or any other party who has appeared in the action. The Court will not grant a motion without proof of service. Additionally, the declaration in support of the motion is unclear and conflicts with the proposed order. The Judge has ordered Counsel to re-file the motion with proof of service and to clarify the address of the client.
