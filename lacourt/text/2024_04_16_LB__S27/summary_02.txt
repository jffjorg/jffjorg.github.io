And here is the English summary:

The plaintiff, Beach Front Properties, LLC, filed a complaint against the defendants, Waterford Property Company, LLC, Sean Rawson, and John Crachman, alleging breach of oral contract and related claims. The defendants demurred to the entire complaint, contending that the fraud-based claims fail because judicially noticeable facts show that the plaintiff was on notice of the alleged oral agreement by February 2021. The court held that the demurrer was overruled in its entirety, finding that the plaintiff did not have knowledge or should have known about the newspaper articles that were published between February and August 2021. The court also rejected the defendants' contention that the fraud-based claims fail because the plaintiff cannot plead concealment with an intent to defraud.
