The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration and stay litigation filed by Defendant First Citizens Bank. The plaintiff, John Jung Han, alleges claims of sex/gender harassment, discrimination, and retaliation against First Citizens Bank and individual defendants. The court finds that no agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties, and that even if an arbitration agreement existed, it would be unenforceable due to procedural and substantive unconscionability. The court rejects the motion to compel arbitration and stay litigation, finding that the arbitration agreement is unclear and contains provisions that are unconscionable.
