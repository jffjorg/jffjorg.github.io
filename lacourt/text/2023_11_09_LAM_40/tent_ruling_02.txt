 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Pedro
  Cristia’s Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint.



 
Background
On July 6, 2023, after the Court
issued an order sustaining a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint on June
22, 2023, Plaintiff Jane Doe filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) suing Defendants
Los Angeles Southwest College (LASC), Los Angeles Community College District
(the LACCD), Pedro Cristia, and Does 1 to 100 pursuant to claims of: (1) Sexual
Assault/Battery, (2) False Imprisonment, and (3) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress (IIED) against Defendant Cristia; (4) Negligence and (5)
Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention of Employee against LASC, the
LACCD, and Does 11 through 100; and (6) Negligence against Does 31-60 as
entities or businesses who had control of Defendant Cristia.
The claims arise from allegations
that on January 2, 2019, Plaintiff visited the LASC Student Health Center for a
routine physical examination and that during that visit, Defendant Cristia—a
nurse working for the LASC, a community college within the LACCD system—informed
that Plaintiff needed to return for additional vaccinations on January 8, 2019.
Plaintiff is alleged to have returned to the Student Health Center on January
8, 2019—which was closed for operations at the time—at which time Defendant
Cristia admitted Plaintiff to the Center, informing her that he wanted to complete
her vaccinations before the Clinic got busy. Plaintiff alleges that after Defendant
Cristia administered the vaccinations, he informed Plaintiff that she needed to
undergo a further physical evaluation. Under this pretext, Defendant Cristia is
alleged to have sexually abused Plaintiff, including by touching Plaintiff’s
breasts, massaging her legs, and inserting two fingers inside of Plaintiff,
insisting that these actions were requirements of the physical evaluation when
Plaintiff pushed Defendant Cristia’s hand away and told him to stop what he was
doing. After paying in cash for the visit at Defendant Cristia’s insistence,
Plaintiff requested copies of the reports for her examination, which Defendant
Cristia said he could not provide at that time based on the need to write up
the reports, and which Defendant Cristia did not provide to Plaintiff the next
day because he did not have them and had “submitted [them] to the office.” After
discussing the visit with a classmate, Plaintiff filed a police report and made
a written claim with LASC and the LACCD.
On August 7, 2023, Defendant
Cristia demurred to the SAC’s second to sixth causes of action. The SAC’s first
cause of action is not challenged by the demurrer.
On September 8, 2023, the Court
held a case management conference (CMC), at which time the Court noted that
Defendant Cristia’s demurrer and a different demurrer to the SAC by LASC and
the LACCD were coming up. The Court also continued the CMC to November 13,
2023, the same date set for the hearing on LASC and the LACCD’s demurrer.
On October 27, 2023, Plaintiff Doe
dismissed the SAC as to Defendants LASC and the LACCD, with prejudice.
Later that day, Plaintiff Doe
opposed the August 7, 2023 demurrer by Defendant Cristia.
The record fails to reflect a reply
by Defendant Cristia.
Defendant Cristia’s demurrer is now
before the Court.
 
Demurrer
Preliminary
Note
To
the extent that the demurrer requests that the Court strike damages (e.g.,
attorney’s fees) or other matters from the SAC, the Court notes that such
relief is not appropriate pursuant to a demurrer. (Demurrer, p. 4, ¶ 4.) A
motion to strike to be heard concurrently with this demurrer should have been
filed.
Demurrer
Sufficiency Standard
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).) This device can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.) To sufficiently allege a cause of action,
a complaint must allege all the ultimate
facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of
action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.)
Thus, “[t]o survive a [general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually
form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S.
Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In testing the
sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all
material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept.
of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other
grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th
1158, 1162.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the
complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86
Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in White
v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
Uncertainty
Legal Standard 
A
demurrer to a pleading lies where the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or
unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10, subd. (f).) “A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616, disapproved on other grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title
Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business
practices need not be pled specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].)
As a result, a special demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach
failure to incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at
uncertainty existing in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro
(1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v.
J.E. French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations
question].) Where complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and to
apprise defendant of issues he is to meet, it is not properly subject to a
special demurrer for uncertainty. (See ibid.; see also Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A special demurrer [for
uncertainty] should be overruled where the allegations of the complaint are
sufficiently clear to apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to
meet”].)
I.
SAC,
Second Cause of Action [False Imprisonment]: OVERRULED.
Defendant
Cristia demurs to the Complaint’s second cause of action on five grounds: (1) sufficiency
of pleading; (2) uncertainty in pleading; (3) claim duplicative of first cause
of action; (4) statute of limitations based on Code of Civil Procedure section
340, subdivision (c); and (5) statute of limitations based on Penal Code
section 801. (Mot., pp. 1-2, 5-7.)
After
review, the Court overrules the demurrer as to the second cause of action, as
alleged against Defendant Cristia.
A. Sufficiency and Uncertainty
The
California Penal Code defines false imprisonment as “the unlawful violation of
the personal liberty of another.” (Pen. Code, § 236.) The tort of false
imprisonment requires (1) the nonconsensual, intentional confinement of a
person, (2) without lawful privilege, and (3) for an appreciable period of
time, however brief. (Easton v. Sutter Coast Hosp.¿(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th
485, 496 (Easton); see also Scofield v. Critical Air Medicine, Inc.
(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 990, 1001, fn. 11 (Scofield) [“‘The essential
elements of a claim for false imprisonment … are: [¶] 1. The defendant
intentionally and unlawfully exercised force or the express or implied
threat of force to restrain, detain or confine the plaintiff; [¶] 2. The
restraint, detention or confinement compelled the plaintiff to stay or go
somewhere for some appreciable time, however short; [¶] 3. The plaintiff did
not consent to such restraint, detention or confinement …[;] [and] [¶] 4. The
restraint, detention or confinement ... caused plaintiff to suffer injury,
damage, loss or harm.’ (Italics added.)” Quoting jury instructions at FN12
BAJI No. 7.60.].)
Here,
the Court finds that the SAC is clear as to the grounds for false imprisonment:
the confinement of Plaintiff Doe for the purpose of a supposed physical evaluation
by Defendant Cristia, with Defendant Cristia wrongfully insisting that the
physical contact with Plaintiff was necessary for the evaluation, forcing
Plaintiff Doe to suffer Defendant Cristia to touch her breasts and legs and
insert his fingers inside of her, under circumstances where Plaintiff Doe
appeared to be unsure about whether she could leave. (SAC, ¶¶ 10-17, 40-44.)
The
Court also notes that the demurrer only elaborates on its statute of
limitations and duplicativeness grounds without elaborating on sufficiency of pleading
and uncertainty in pleading generally. (Demurrer, pp. 5-7.)
Defendant
Cristia’s demurrer therefore cannot be sustained on these grounds.
B. Duplicativeness
A
general demurrer for sufficiency may be sustained against duplicative claims. (Palm
Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th
268, 290 [“a cause of action for breach of governing documents [that]
appear[ed] to be duplicative of [a] cause of action for breach of fiduciary
duty” is “recognized … as a basis for sustaining a demurrer”]; Rodrigues v.
Campbell Industries (1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 494, 501 [finding demurrer was
properly sustained without leave to amend as to cause of action that contained
allegations of other causes and “thus add[ed] nothing to the complaint by way
of fact or theory of recovery”]; see also Award Metals, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1128, 1135 [demurrer should have been sustained
as to duplicative causes of action].) 
Defendant
Cristia argues that “the gravamen of Plaintiff’s [second cause of action] is
the first cause of action’s … [allegations of] sexual assault allegedly
occurring [on] January 8, 2019[,]” such that the SAC’s “false imprisonment,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence [claims] … do[]
not add any new theory of recovery [and] … [do not arise from] facts unrelated
to the sexual assault. (See FAC, 38, 45, 68.)” (Demurrer, p. 7.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that the false imprisonment, IIED, and negligence
claims are not duplicative of the first cause of action for sexual
assault/battery because all six claims involve different legal elements and
because “Plaintiff’s claims are based on different facts and provide separate
theories of recovery,” as confirmed by jury instructions. (Opp’n, p. 6.)
The
Court determines that the second cause of action for false imprisonment—as well
as the third cause of action for IIED, with no comment on the negligence
claims—are not duplicative of the sexual assault/battery claim. False
imprisonment focuses on the unlawful and nonconsensual restraint of one
individual by another through force or threat of force (Easton, supra,
80 Cal.App.4th at p. 496; Scofield, supra, 45 Cal.App.4th at p.
1001, fn. 11), and IIED focuses on the intentional infliction of emotional distress
through extreme and outrageous conduct (Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th
1035, 1050-1051), whereas assault and battery arise from an individual touching
or putting another individual in apprehension of harmful or offensive contact (So
v. Shin (2013) 121 Cal.App.4th 652, 668-669, as modified on denial of reh’g
(Jan. 28, 2013)). These torts connote different wrongs based on the state of
mind necessary and the conduct upon which liability turns.
Defendant
Cristia’s demurrer therefore cannot be sustained on this ground.
C. Statute of Limitations
Unless
a complaint affirmatively discloses on its face that the statute of limitations
has run, the general demurrer on these grounds must be overruled. (See Lockley
v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 875, 881 (Lockley) [“It must appear clearly and
affirmatively that, upon the face of the complaint, the right of action is
necessarily barred”].) Instead, “[t]he proper remedy ‘is to ascertain the
factual basis of the contention through discovery and, if necessary, file a
motion for summary judgment ….’ [Citation.]” (Roman v. County of Los Angeles
(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 316, 325.) Generally, a “statute of limitations begins to
run when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that her injury was caused by
wrongdoing, that someone has done something wrong to her” (the “discovery
rule”). (Bernson v. Browning–Ferris Industries (1994) 7 Cal.4th 926,
932.) “[A] cause of action accrues at ‘the time when the cause of action is
complete with all of its elements.’” (Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 806-807.) However, if the complaint alleges wrongful
conduct commencing at a time now barred by the statute of limitations, but
continuing until a date not barred, the last over act supporting the tort
controls the trigger date for the statute of limitations. (See Wyatt v.
Union Mortg. Co. (1979) 24 Cal.3d 773, 786 [holding that the statute of
limitations on continuing tort cause of action does not begin to run until
commission of last overt act].)
Defendant
Cristia demurs to the second cause of action on the ground that false
imprisonment is subject to a one-year statute of limitations and that the
limitations period has run on the second cause of action because the alleged
conduct giving rise to false imprisonment occurred on January 8, 2019, well
more than a year before this action was filed on December 19, 2022. Defendant
Cristia also preemptively argues that Code of Civil Procedure section 340.16
does not revive and extend the limitations period on false imprisonment claims
because “sexual assault” as defined in that statute does not include false
imprisonment. (Demurrer, pp. 5-6.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff Doe relies on Jane Doe #21 (S.H.) v. CFR Enterprises,
Inc. (Jun. 29, 2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1199 for the purpose of arguing that
section 340.16 should include revival and extension of the limitations period
for claims of false imprisonment arising from sexual assault, as alleged in the
SAC. (Opp’n, pp. 3-5.)
After
review, the Court overrules the demurrer as to the second cause of action, as
alleged against Defendant Cristia on Cristia’s statute of limitations argument.
Code
of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (c) imposes a one-year statute of
limitations on civil claims for false imprisonment. (Cf. Pen. Code, § 801
[statute of limitations for criminal false imprisonment charge is three years
after offense].) Here, the SAC alleges that the false imprisonment occurred on
January 8, 2019. (SAC, ¶¶ 10-17, 40-44.) However, this action was not brought
until December 19, 2022, almost four years later. Thus, the SAC affirmatively
shows on its face that the second cause of action is beyond its statute of
limitations, thus supporting the demurrer. (Lockley, supra, 91
Cal.App.4th at p. 881 [“It must appear clearly and affirmatively that, upon the
face of the complaint, the right of action is necessarily barred” to sustain a
statute of limitations demurrer]; see Demurrer, pp. 5-6 [statute of limitations
argument based on Code Civ. Proc., § 340, subd. (c).)
However,
the Court agrees with Plaintiff that in this case, Code of Civil Procedure
section 340.16 revives and extends the statute of limitations on Plaintiff’s false
imprisonment claim arising from sexual assault. (See Opp’n, pp. 3-5.) Code of
Civil Procedure section 340.16, subdivision (a) provides that “[i]n any civil
action for recovery of damages suffered as a result of sexual assault, where
the assault occurred on or after the plaintiff’s 18th birthday, the time for
commencement of the action shall be the later of the following: (1) Within 10
years from the date of the last act, attempted act, or assault with the intent
to commit an act, of sexual assault against the plaintiff[] [or] (2) [w]ithin
three years from the date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have
discovered that an injury or illness resulted from an act, attempted act, or
assault with the intent to commit an act, of sexual assault against the
plaintiff.” 
In
Jane Doe #21 (S.H.) v. CFR Enterprises, Inc. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1199 the
court of appeal remanded the question of whether certain claims—including IIED
claims—could benefit from the revival and statute of limitations extension in
Code of Civil Procedure section 340.16. (Jane Doe #21 (S.H.) v. CFR
Enterprises, Inc. (Jun. 29, 2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1199, 1205, 1210.) The
court of appeal noted that section 340.16 did not limit itself to sexual
assault and battery alone, but also “applies to ‘any civil action for recovery
of damages suffered as a result of sexual assault.’” (Id. at p. 1209.) The
court notes that plaintiff’s other claims, from negligence to fraud, had
admittedly “sought damages as a result of sexual assault.” (Id. at p.
1209.) The court remanded the case back to the trial court to determine which
of those claims arose from sexual assault within the meaning of the statute,
because the parties’ briefs did not address the application of the recently amended
to these claims. (Id. at p. 1210.) 
Here,
Plaintiff’s second cause of action clearly seeks damages under the claim for
false imprisonment based on the sexual assault. (Complaint at ¶¶ 29-30.) Thus,
the Court finds, with the guidance of Jane Doe #21, supra, that
the statute of limitations extension applies to this claim.
Defendant
Cristia’s demurrer is thus OVERRULED as to the second cause of action.
II.
SAC,
Third Cause of Action [IIED]: OVERRULED.
“A
cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress exists when
there is ‘(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the
intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing,
emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional
distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by
the defendant’s outrageous conduct.’ A defendant’s conduct is ‘outrageous’ when
it is so ‘extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a
civilized community.’ And the defendant’s conduct must be ‘intended to inflict
injury or engaged in with the realization that injury will result.’” (Hughes
v. Pair, supra, 46 Cal.4th at pp. 1050-1051.)
Defendant
Cristia demurs to the Complaint’s third cause of action on four grounds: (1)
sufficiency of pleading; (2) uncertainty in pleading; (3) claim duplicative of
first cause of action; and (4) statute of limitations based on Code of Civil
Procedure section 335.1. (Mot., pp. 2, 5-7.)
After
review, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer as to the third cause of action, as
alleged against Defendant Cristia.
A. Sufficiency and Uncertainty
The
Court briefly notes that the sufficiency and uncertainty arguments raised
against the third cause of action are not availing because the SAC sufficiently
pleads factual grounds for an IIED claim. (SAC, ¶¶ 10-17, 45-49.)
B. Duplicativeness
The
Court also briefly notes that the Court has already determined that the IIED
claim is not duplicative of the SAC’s first cause of action for sexual
assault/battery. (See Section I.B. discussion supra.)
C. Statute of Limitations
The
demurrer is overruled as to the third cause of action based on a statute of
limitations argument as well.
Code
of Civil Procedure section 335.1 imposes a two-year statute of limitations on
civil claims involving assault, battery, or an injury to an individual caused
by the wrongful act or neglect of another, which includes IIED. As with the
false imprisonment claim, the IIED claim was not brought within its proper
statute of limitations. The factual grounds for IIED are alleged to have taken place
on January 8, 2019 (SAC, ¶¶ 10-17, 45-49), but this action was not brought
until December 19, 2022, more than two years later. As such, it “appear[s]
clearly and affirmatively that, upon the face of the [SAC], the right of action
is necessarily barred” for the third cause of action. (Lockley, supra,
91 Cal.App.4th at p. 881.)
However,
the opposition’s argument that Code of Civil Procedure section 340.16 extends
the statute of limitations on an IIED claim arising from damages sustained as a
result of sexual assault is persuasive for the same reason as discussed above
in Section I.C. (See Opp’n, pp. 3-5.) Here, the third cause of action for IIED
also seeks damages for sexual assault. (Complaint at ¶¶ 36-37.)
Defendant
Cristia’s demurrer is thus OVERRULED as to the third cause of action.
III.
SAC,
Fourth to Sixth Causes of Action [Negligence, Negligent Hiring, Supervision,
and Retention of Employee, and Negligence]: IMPROPER.
The
Court finds that the demurrer is IMPROPER insofar as it challenges the fourth
to sixth causes of action because the demurrer challenges claims that are not
alleged against Defendant Cristia. (See Opp’n, p. 6.) The fourth and fifth
causes of action are only alleged against the now-dismissed LASC and the LACCD,
and against Does 11-100. (See SAC, ¶¶ 50-54, 55-64.) The sixth cause of action
is alleged against Does 31-60 alone. (SAC, ¶¶ 65-71.) 

Conclusion
Defendant Pedro Cristia’s Demurrer
to Second Amended Complaint is OVERRULED, in Part, and IMPROPER, in Part, as
follows:
(1) OVERRULED as to the SAC’s
second and third causes of action; and
(2) IMPROPER as to the SAC’s fourth
to sixth causes of action.
