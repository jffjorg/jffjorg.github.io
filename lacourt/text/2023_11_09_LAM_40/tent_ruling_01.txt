 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff American Ironworks Manufacturing, Inc.’s Motion
  for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication.



 
Background
Pleadings Framing Motion
Plaintiff American Ironworks Manufacturing,
Inc. sues Defendants Fassberg Contracting Corporation (Fassberg), 1400 Fig LLC
(1400 Fig), and Does 1 through 150 pursuant to a February 25, 2022 Complaint
alleging claims of (1) Breach of Contract against Fassberg and Does 1-50, (2)
Enforcement of Mechanics Lien against 1400 Fig and Does 51-100, (3) Common
Counts against Fassberg and Does 1-50, and (4) Lien Release Bond against
Fassberg, Does 1-50, and Does 101-150.
The claims arise from allegations
that Plaintiff, as a subcontractor to Defendant Fassberg, agreed to and did in
fact furnish certain labor, services, equipment, and materials for structural
and miscellaneous ironworks improvement projects at 1400 S. Figueroa Street,
Los Angeles, CA 90015 (the 1400 Figueroa project)—i.e., on real property owned
by Defendant 1400 Fig—with an agreed-on subcontractor fee of $642,150, later
modified to include extra work for the total price of $892,060, with Defendant Fassberg
ultimately failing to pay Plaintiff $140,836.58 of the balance on the parties’
agreement.
Motion Before the Court
On August 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed
an affirmative motion for summary judgment or adjudication of the Complaint’s
four causes of action as against Fassberg and 1400 Fig.
On September 13, 2023, the Court
held a status conference regarding alternative dispute resolution, at which
time counsel represented that the case was near settlement.
On October 25, 2023, Fassberg
opposed the motion for summary judgment or adjudication.
On November 3, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a stipulation and proposed order noting a partial settlement of this case
as between Plaintiff and 1400 Fig.
On November 6, 2023, the Court
signed the November 3rd stipulation and proposed order.
The record fails to reflect that
Plaintiff replied to Fassberg’s October 25th opposition.
Plaintiff’s August 23rd motion is
now before the Court.
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
Per Plaintiff’s request, the Court
takes judicial notice of (1) the November 30, 2021 Claim of Mechanic’s Lien
recorded by Plaintiff with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office, (2) the
June 8, 2015 Grant Deed for 1400 S. Figueroa St., Los Angeles, California
90015, and (3) the Complaint in this action. (Mot., RJN, Exs. A-C; see Evid.
Code, §§ 452, subds. (c), (d), 453; Julian Volunteer Fire Co. Assn. v.
Julian-Cuyamaca Fire Protection Dist. (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 583, 600
[judicial notice may be taken as to existence of document and legal effects
deriving therefrom].)
 
Motion for Summary Judgment or Adjudication
Legal
Standard
A
motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show
that there is no triable issue as to any material fact for trial or that the
moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (c).) A party may also seek summary adjudication of select causes
of action, affirmative defenses, claims for damages, or issues of duty, which
may be made by a standalone motion or as an alternative to a motion for summary
judgment and proceeds in all procedural respects like a motion for summary
judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (f)(1)-(2), (t); see Lilienthal
& Fowler v. Superior Court (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1848, 1854-1855,
questioned by dictum in Bagley v. TRW, Inc. (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1092,
1094, fn. 2 [finding that summary adjudication may be granted as to separate
factual grounds supporting a claim stated as a single count because the
separate grounds state a separate cause of action].) The moving party bears the
initial burden of production to make prima facie showing no triable material
fact issues. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826,
850.) This burden on summary judgment or adjudication “is more properly one of
persuasion rather than proof, since he must persuade the court that there is no
material fact for a reasonable trier of fact to find, and not to prove any such
fact to the satisfaction of the court itself as though it were sitting as the
trier of fact.” (Id. at p. 850, fn. 11.) If the moving party meets this
burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to make a rebuttal prima facie
showing that a triable issue of material fact exists. (Id. at p. 849.)
“[I]n ruling on motions for summary judgment courts are to ‘“liberally construe
the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve
doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”’ [Citations].” (Cheal
v. El Camino Hospital (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 736, 760.)
I.
Summary
Judgment, Complaint: DENIED.
The
Court notes that summary judgment of the entire Complaint cannot be granted
because, aside from the fact that triable issues of material fact remain as to
the Complaint’s first and third causes of action (see discussions at Sections
II and IV infra), a disposition as to the Complaint second and fourth causes of
action has been mooted (see discussions at Sections III and V infra). Otherwise
stated, summary judgment cannot be granted because the papers submitted do not
show that there are no triable issues of material fact for trial as to all the
Complaint’s causes of action. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
II.
Summary
Adjudication, Complaint, First Cause of Action, Breach of Contract: DENIED.

“A
contract is a voluntary and lawful agreement, by competent parties, for a good
consideration, to do or not to do a specified thing.” (Robinson v. Magee
(1858) 9 Cal. 81, 83.) “To prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract,
the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of
the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4)
the resulting damage to the plaintiff.” (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) Implicit in the element of
damage is that the defendant’s breach caused the plaintiff’s damage.” (Troyk
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1352, italics omitted.)
The
first cause of action alleges that Plaintiff and Defendant Fassberg entered a
written contract (the Subcontract), that Plaintiff performed its obligations
pursuant to that Subcontract, that Fassberg breached the Subcontract by failing
to pay a balance of $140,836.58, together with interest at the legal rate, and
that Plaintiff was harmed in the amount of $140,836.58, plus interest, and
attorney’s fees. (Complaint, ¶¶ 7-10, 11-13.)
Plaintiff’s
motion for summary judgment or adjudication argues that the Plaintiff has made
an evidentiary showing of a contract between the parties (the Subcontract),
Plaintif’s satisfaction of its contractual duties, Fassberg’s failure to pay a
balance of $140,836.58 on the Subcontract, and harm to Plaintiff in the amount
of $140,836.58, plus interest and attorney’s fees. (Mot., p. 7, citing Mot.,
Separate Statement (Sep. St.), Undisputed Material Fact (UMF Nos.) 1-7.)
The
Court’s review of Plaintiff’s evidence shows that it carries its burden on
summary adjudication of the Complaint’s first cause of action.
Plaintiff
shows that it entered the Subcontract with Fassberg on May 3, 2016. (Mot.,
Asiss Decl., Ex. 2, Subcontract Agreement, cited in Mot., Sep. St., UMF No. 1.)
Plaintiff also shows evidence that it performed its obligations under the
Subcontract, that Defendant Fassberg breached its obligations by failing to pay
Plaintiff $140,836.58, and that Plaintiff has been damaged. Plaintiff provides
a ‘summary of accounts’ for the 1400 Figueroa project, which shows an original
contract amount of $642,150, twenty-three change orders to the Subcontract
increasing the total contract amount in Plaintiff’s favor to $892,060, and a
summary of outstanding invoices totaling $140,836.57. This evidence is also
accompanied by copies of the outstanding invoices, numbered 10580 to 10582 and
10677, and copies of a stop payment on a check by Fassberg in favor of
Plaintiff for the 10580 to 10582 invoices. Last, Plaintiff attaches a
declaration from its Chief Executive Officer and Responsible Managing Officer
(RMO) indicating that these invoices are connected to services performed and
material provided to the 1400 Figueroa project. (Mot., Asiss Decl., ¶¶ 6-7, Exs.
C [summary of account and outstanding invoices], D [stop payment], cited in
Mot., Sep. St., UMF Nos. 3-7.)
In
opposition, Defendant Fassberg argues that summary judgment or adjudication is
improper as to the Complaint’s first cause of action because triable issues of
material fact remain as to whether Plaintiff’s damages should be offset based
on four distinct grounds. These include: (1) delays by Plaintiff relating to
steel columns for the third floor in the 1400 Figuroa project; (2) duplicative
charges by Plaintiff; (3) Plaintiff requesting meritless change orders that
Fassberg was forced to accept to keep the 1400 Figueroa project moving forward
but for which Plaintiff should not be compensated based on the terms of the
Subcontract; and (4) based on Plaintiff’s failure to complete certain work
related to window washing tiebacks and the trellis on the 1400 Figueroa
project. (Opp’n, pp. 5-10, citing Opp’n, Sep. St., Additional Material Fact
(AMF) Nos. 10, 13-14, 16-17, 19-26.) Fassberg also argues that the Subcontract
provided a condition precedent to filing suit—mediation—which was not satisfied
here because Plaintiff did not mediate this action before filing it. (Opp’n,
pp. 10-11, citing Opp’n, Sep. St., AMF Nos. 18, 27.)
No
reply by Plaintiff appears in the record.
The
Court’s review of Fassberg’s evidence shows that it carries its burden on
summary adjudication of the Complaint’s first cause of action, specifically, by
showing triable issues as to the amount of damages to which Plaintiff claims to
be entitled and as to Plaintiff’s actual performance under the Subcontract.
Fassberg
provides evidence that appears to show that Plaintiff twice charged for work
relating to fabricating and installing elevator divider posts, first on April
18, 2016, and again on July 31, 2017, undercutting the amount of damages sought
by Plaintiff (duplicate costs). (Opp’n, Fassberg Decl., ¶¶ 11-15 & Opp’n,
Evidentiary Appendix, Exs. 11-14, cited in Opp’n, Sep. St., AMF Nos. 19-21.) Fassberg
also shows evidence of Plaintiff’s failure to complete two distinct
tasks—installing tieback supports for the window washing equipment and
steelwork related to the front trellis on the 1400 Figueroa project—which
undercuts damages, as well as the position that Plaintiff performed all its
obligations pursuant to the Subcontract. (See Opp’n, Fassberg Decl., ¶¶ 19-20
[Fassberg’s President’s declaration as to tieback work] & Opp’n,
Evidentiary Appendix, Exs. 17 [change orders related to tieback work], 20 [new
contract with subcontractor to complete tieback and other work not completed by
Plaintiff], cited in Opp’n, Sep. St., AMF Nos. 24-25; see also Opp’n, Fassberg
Decl., ¶ 21 [Fassberg’s President’s declaration as to steel work on trellis]
& Opp’n, Evidentiary Appendix, Exs. 15 [change order showing credit for
work to be performed by Plaintiff on front trellis], referenced in Opp’n, Sep.
St., AMF No. 26; see also Opp’n, Evidentiary Appendix, Ex. 24 [change order for
third-party company to complete trellis work].) Without reaching the
sufficiency and merit of the remaining arguments opposing summary adjudication,
the Court determines that this evidence alone raises triable issues as to
damages and Plaintiff’s performance of obligations pursuant to the parties’ agreement
(the Subcontract), as reflected in change orders on which Plaintiff relies for
damages. 
Summary
adjudication is thus DENIED as to the Complaint’s first cause of action.
III.
Summary
Adjudication, Complaint, Second Cause of Action, Enforcement of Mechanic’s
Lien]: MOOT.
Plaintiff’s
motion is MOOT as to the Complaint’s second cause of action based on the
November 3, 2023 stipulation between Plaintiff and 1400 Fig, which the Court
signed on November 6, 2023. The claim is not pleaded against Fassberg.
IV.
Summary
Adjudication, Complaint, Third Cause of Action, Common Counts: DENIED.
“‘As
Witkin states in his text, “[a] common count is proper whenever the plaintiff
claims a sum of money due, either as an indebtedness in a sum certain [Account
Stated], or for the reasonable value of services, goods, etc., furnished [Goods
and Service Rendered]. It makes no difference in such a case that the proof
shows the original transaction to be an express contract, a contract implied in
fact, or a quasi-contract.”’” (Utility Audit Co., Inc. v. City of Los
Angeles (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 950, 958, internal citations omitted.)
Otherwise stated, the essential elements of any common count are: (1) that
defendant is indebted to plaintiff in a certain sum; (2) for some consideration
from plaintiff (i.e., goods sold, work done, money paid); and (3) defendant’s
nonpayment. (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445,
460.)
The
Court adopts its discussion in Section II to find that because triable issues
of material fact remain as to Plaintiff’s performance and damages under the
Subcontract, triable issues of material fact remain as to whether and in what
amount Fassberg is indebted to Plaintiff and as to whether and the amount that
Fassberg failed to pay Plaintiff under the Subcontract and the change orders.
V.
Summary
Adjudication, Complaint, Fourth Cause of Action, Lien Release Bond: MOOT.
Plaintiff’s
motion is MOOT as to the Complaint’s fourth cause of action based on
Plaintiff’s request for dismissal of this claim, without prejudice. (Mot., p.
9.)
The
Court DISMISSES Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action, without prejudice. 

Conclusion
Plaintiff American Ironworks
Manufacturing, Inc.’s Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative,
Summary Adjudication is DENIED, in Part, and MOOT, in Part, as follows:
(1) DENIED as to summary judgment;
(2) DENIED as to summary
adjudication of the Complaint’s first and third causes of action; and
(3) MOOT as to summary adjudication
of the Complaint’s second and fourth causes of action.
