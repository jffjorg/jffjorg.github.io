And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the plaintiffs' motion to file a supplemental complaint, which alleges new facts that occurred after the original complaint was filed. The plaintiffs' property was allegedly trespassed upon by the defendant's landscaping company, and the defendant's corporate officers and directors allegedly ratified and approved the wrongful conduct. The judge found that the supplemental pleading is necessary and proper because the misconduct at issue in the supplemental complaint could not have been alleged at the time the original complaint was filed, and that the proposed second amended complaint is consistent with California Code of Civil Procedure section 464, subdivision (a). The judge also noted that the plaintiffs' delay in filing the motion was not abusive, and that the supplemental pleading does not state any new causes of action.
