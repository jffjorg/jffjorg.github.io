Summary:
The tentative ruling is issued in a case where the demurring defendant seeks to strike the plaintiff's complaint (FAC) and argues that certain causes of action fail to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action against them. The court rules that the demurrer is sustained in its entirety, but grants the plaintiff twenty days' leave to amend. The motion to strike is deemed moot as it relates to the causes of action sustained on demurrer. The FAC is uncertain and lacks adequate allegations regarding property managers' duties. The court finds that the property managers did not owe a duty to the tenant, and the FAC does not adequately allege that they stepped into the role of landlord.
