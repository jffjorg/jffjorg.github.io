Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant's motion to strike portions of Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, specifically the allegations related to punitive damages. The court finds that Plaintiff's FAC fails to adequately allege malice, oppression, or fraud for punitive damages, as required by Civil Code section 3294. The court also notes that Plaintiff's FAC does not specifically allege that any managing agent, officer, or director of Defendant authorized or ratified any act of oppression, fraud, or malice. The court grants leave to amend the complaint, giving Plaintiff 20 days to re-plead the allegations.
