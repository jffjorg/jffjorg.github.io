```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the demurrer is sustained in its entirety, with 20 days' leave to amend. The motion to strike is also granted in its entirety, with leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action for general negligence, violation of Vehicle Code section 20001(a), and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court concludes that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support these claims and that the demurrer is sustained. The court also grants the motion to strike, finding that the prayer for punitive damages and the allegations of intentional infliction of emotional distress are irrelevant and improper. The court allows the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.
