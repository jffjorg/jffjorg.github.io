 Case Number:  21VECV01686    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  T ENGEL V MERCEDES  21VECV01686             [TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Plaintiff Debora Engel’s Motion to Vacate the  Order Compelling Arbitration and to Lift the Stay of the Litigation is DENIED.   Introduction               Plaintiff Debora Engel  (Plaintiff) moved to vacate the May 18, 2022 Order compelling arbitration and  to lift the stay of the action.   Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (Defendant) opposed the motion and  Plaintiff filed her reply.              Discussion             Plaintiff argued that the Court’s  May 18, 2022 order compelling arbitration and staying the action should be  vacated.  Plaintiff asserted that the  Court has authority to vacate because Defendant failed/refused to pay the  arbitration fees that would have initiated and/or continued the  arbitration.  (Code Civ. Proc., secs.  1281.97 and 1291.98.)  On the same  grounds, Plaintiff asserted that Defendant waived their right to compel  arbitration and the Court Order should be vacated.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec, 1281.2.)  However, Plaintiff failed to present  facts/evidence to show that Defendant failed to pay the arbitration fees.  It is noted that Plaintiff’s Counsel, Jeffrey  Moses (Moses), attested, in conclusory fashion, that Defendant “has not paid  the JAMS arbitration fees.”  (Moses Decl.  par. 8.)  However, the conclusory  testimony failed recognize the underlying dispute.  Mr. Moses testified that the parties were  actually in dispute over the arbitration administrator.  Plaintiff proffered the use of JAMS and  Defendant objected.  Defendant requested  American Arbitration Association (AAA) as provided in the arbitration  provision.  (Moses Decl. pars. 4-7.)  The arbitration provision expressly provided  that Plaintiff could choose AAA and another arbitrator could be chosen “subject  to our [Defendant’s] approval.”  (Moses  Decl. par. 6, Exh. D.)  Defendant did not  approve.  Because the actual dispute  between the parties is not that Defendant is refusing/failing to pay  arbitration fees but the selection of the arbitration administrator, Plaintiff  failed to present sufficient facts to show that the Court has authority to  vacate the arbitration and stay order pursuant Code of Civil Procedure,  sections 1281.97 or 1281.98.   For this  defect, Plaintiff also failed to meet her burden to show waiver under Code of  Civil Procedure, section 1281.2.  Because  Plaintiff failed to meet her initial burden as the moving party, the motion to  vacate per Code of Civil Procedure, sections 1281.2, 1281.97 or 1281.98 is  unpersuasive.             Plaintiff then argued that the Court  Order should be reconsidered, as a Court’s Motion for Reconsideration.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1008(c).)  To the extent the request is Plaintiff’s own  motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure, section 1008(a), the  motion is untimely per the 10 day rule.   Because Plaintiff’s motion to reconsider is untimely per Code of Civil  Procedure, section 1008(a), there is grounds to deny Plaintiff’s motion for  reconsideration. To  the extent Plaintiff’s noticed motion is asking the Court to file its own  motion, the request is improper.  The  Court need not rule on any noticed motion suggesting that it should reconsider  a previous ruling.  Without more, another  party need not respond to such a suggestion.   (Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1108.)  While a party has the right to informally  “communicat[e] the view to a court that it should reconsider a prior ruling”,  the party should not “file a written motion to reconsider” if it cannot satisfy  the procedural requirements of Code of Civil Procedure, section 1008.”  (Ibid; See also Farmers Insurance  Exchange v. Superior Court (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 102, 159.)  The Court did not consider Plaintiff’s Noticed  Motion requesting the Court to reconsider its prior ruling.   The  motion to vacate is DENIED.   Note: As proffered by Defendant, the actual motion  Plaintiff could have filed was a motion for appointment of an arbitrator.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1281.6.)             IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE  NOTICE.
