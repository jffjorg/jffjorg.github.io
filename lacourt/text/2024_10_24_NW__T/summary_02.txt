And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Debora Engel's motion to vacate the May 18, 2022 order compelling arbitration and to lift the stay of the litigation. The judge found that Plaintiff failed to present evidence to show that Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC failed to pay arbitration fees, and that the dispute between the parties is actually over the selection of the arbitration administrator. The judge also noted that Plaintiff's conclusory testimony regarding Defendant's failure to pay arbitration fees was insufficient to demonstrate waiver of the right to compel arbitration. Finally, the judge ruled that Plaintiff's motion to reconsider the order compelling arbitration and staying the action was untimely and improper.
