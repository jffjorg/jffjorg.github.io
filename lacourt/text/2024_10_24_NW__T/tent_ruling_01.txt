Khatibi: Grant conditioned on filing proof of service of the conformed order on EACH client (separately) by mail and email.The court requests an explanation why there are two addresses on the order as the usual practice is for a party to have a single address.  Also, the orders do not have phone numbers or email addresses on them. The orders should be redone with a single address, an email, and a phone number for each client.Finally, as Mr. Kwasigroch was associated counsel with Mr. Farivar, will he no longer be working on this case?
