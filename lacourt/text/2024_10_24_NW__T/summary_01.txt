Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling regarding the motions to withdraw filed by Fahim Farivar as counsel for Richard Khatibi, Faezeh Afchehe, and Melica S. Khatibi. The judge grants the motions, but only if proof of service of the conforming order is filed separately for each client by mail and email. The judge requests an explanation for the two addresses listed on the order, as it is usual for a party to have only one address. The judge also notes that the orders do not include phone numbers or email addresses and recommends that they be revised to include this information. Finally, the judge asks if Mr. Kwasigroch, who was associated with Mr. Farivar, will continue to work on the case.
