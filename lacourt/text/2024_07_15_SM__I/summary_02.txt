And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has reviewed the objections to the orders of assignment and restraint. Mr. Hirsh, the opposing counsel for Jona Rechnitz, claims that he did not receive adequate notice of the court's ruling. However, Mr. Goldflam, the counsel for Jona Rechnitz, states that he served a courtesy copy of the papers and that notice was given to all parties. The Judge finds that adequate notice was given, despite Mr. Hirsh's claims of non-receipt. Mr. Hirsh makes no objection as to form or substance, and the Judge will therefore sign the order and overrule the objections. There will be no hearing as there is no noticed motion.
