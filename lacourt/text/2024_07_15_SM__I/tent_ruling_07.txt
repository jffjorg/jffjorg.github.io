 Case Number:  SC125609    Hearing Date:   July 15, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for an FSC.  The case has been set for trial and continued
many times.  The court, frankly, is not
positive as to what FSC papers are current and what FSC papers need to be
filed.  No recent FSC papers were filed
other than in limine motions, but that may not be a problem if the prior
FSC materials were filed and were adequate. 
 
The court on Thursday, July 11, 2024, confirmed the
referee’s jurisdiction to hear a discovery motion on an expedited basis.  The court will see if there is progress on
that matter, which may or may not affect the trial in this case.  The court also notes that the trial was
continued to July 29, 2024.
 
The court will CONTINUE the FSC to July 22, 2024, at 8:30
am.  The parties are, by noon tomorrow,
to file a joint statement identifying by filing date the FSC materials that are
operative.  This ought to be in the form
of a list; the court does not anticipate actual briefing.  If there are any missing materials, they are
to be filed no later than Wednesday, July 25, 2024, at noon.  
 
If the case is deemed ready for trial on June 22, the court
will consider ruling on the in limine motions at that time.  Whether the court does so might depend on the
referee’s recommendation on the current discovery motion.
