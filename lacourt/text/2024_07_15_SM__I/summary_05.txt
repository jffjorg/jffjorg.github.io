And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the statute of limitations for Berry Gordy's liability as an aider and abettor in a case involving alleged abuse and sexual assault by his son, Kennedy. Gordy argues that his liability ends when the last act of aiding and abetting occurred, while the plaintiff argues that the statute of limitations for Gordy is the same as the statute of limitations for the underlying tort. The judge has reviewed the pleadings and has not found any precedential case on point, so it is a matter of first impression. The judge believes that the better rule is to presume that the statute for aiding and abetting is co-extensive with the statute for the main tortfeasor, but notes that this may not always be the case. The judge has overruled the demurrer and has given Gordy 30 days to answer.
