 Case Number:  21SMCV01794    Hearing Date:   July 15, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a jury trial, but the court does not
know if the individual defendant intends to appear (the others are in
default).  If so, the court may need to
trail the trial because the court is currently in trial.  If not, the court will inquire as to the
length of the anticipated trial and whether plaintiff will waive jury.  If the trial is short enough, the court might
be able to go forward today at 3.  More
likely, though, the court will start trial tomorrow.
