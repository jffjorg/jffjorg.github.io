English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to continue several matters to a later date. The Defendant's Demurrer to the Plaintiff's Complaint is continued to August 15, 2024, as is the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Request for Admissions and Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Form Interrogatories. The Judge also continues the trial from August 2, 2024 to a date on or around August 26, 2024, pending a new trial date. The Judge finds that a brief trial continuance is warranted due to the unrelated interpleader action and the Court's system shut-down caused by ransomware.
