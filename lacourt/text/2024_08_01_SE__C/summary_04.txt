And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the personal injury action. The plaintiff had moved ex parte to set aside the dismissal, which was previously entered due to lack of prosecution. The judge had previously ordered a hearing on the motion and granted an alternative request for an order shortening time. However, the plaintiff failed to file a proposed first amended complaint as ordered. The judge has taken into account the recent cyberattack on the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, which may have prevented the plaintiff from complying with the order. Despite this, the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal is still denied.
