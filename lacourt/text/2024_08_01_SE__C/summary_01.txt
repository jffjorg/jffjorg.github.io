And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's Motion for Issue, or in the alternative, Evidentiary Sanctions against the Plaintiff. The Judge found that the Plaintiff complied with the Court's February 22, 2024 Order, and that the Defendant failed to meet and confer before filing the Motion. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff produced Amended Responses and Second Amended Responses, and that the Defendant maintained possession of a substantial amount of the Plaintiff's records until March 2024. The Judge concluded that the Defendant did not demonstrate that continued, good faith meet and confer efforts would have been ineffective in obtaining responses from the Plaintiff.
