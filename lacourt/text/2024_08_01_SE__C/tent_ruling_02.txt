V.       
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Request for Admission
(set one) to FCA US, LLC Admitted is CONTINUED to Thursday, August
15, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C to be heard in conjunction with the
aforementioned motions. 

 
 
Opposing Party to give notice. 
 
In their Reply briefs, Plaintiff states: “despite Cerritos
claiming in its Opposition that it served responses on July 16, 204, Plaintiff
has still not been served with Cerritos’ responses.” (See generally Replies
1:7-8.) 

There are apparently two law firms which represent Plaintiff. One of the firms
has apparently been served with responses and the Opposition papers. The other
firm—Wirtz Law APC has not. 
 
Importantly, the Oppositions argue that the Motions should
be denied because delayed, untimely responses that are in compliance with the
discovery act were ultimately served, and that CERRITOS DODGE CHYRSLER JEEP’s
failure to timely respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. 
 
These matters are CONTINUED as indicated above. Defendant
CERRITOS DODGE CHRYSLER JEEP is ORDERED to electronically re-serve responses
and Opposition papers onto both of Plaintiff’s representative law firms by the
close of business on August 2, 2024. 
 
The Court will then address the merits of the Motions on the
continued hearing date. The parties are encouraged to utilize informal efforts
to resolve their outstanding discovery disputes prior to the continued hearing
date on these motions.
