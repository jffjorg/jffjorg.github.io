This action for unlawful detainer was filed by Plaintiff
M.J. GLOBAL ENTERPRISE, INC. (“Plaintiff”) against Defendant EVERYTABLE, PBC
(“Defendant”) on March 14, 2024. Trial is scheduled for August 2, 2024. 
 
According to the parties, there is an unrelated
earlier-filed interpleader action involving the same parties as this action (LASC
Case No. 24STCV02343) pending in Dept. 19 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse
(“interpleader action”). A Demurrer was scheduled to be heard in the
interpleader action on July 24, 2024, but was continued to August 13, 2024 due
to the Court’s ransomware-caused system shut-down. 
 
These matters are CONTINUED as indicated above to be heard
after Dept. 19 rules on the Demurrer set for hearing on August 13, 2024.
 
The Court finds that a brief trial continuance is warranted
and exercises its inherent authority to control its calendar and docket. Trial
is CONTINUED from August 2, 2024 to a date on or around August 26, 2024,
depending on the Court and parties’ availabilities. The Court will confer with
the parties and Dept. SE-F to secure a new trial date.
