And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the matter of RAYMOND COLON vs. AMY T. LEUNG, case number 23NWCV03207. The court has sustained the Plaintiff's unopposed Demurrer to the Defendant's Answer without leave to amend. This means that the Defendant's Answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense. The court has also rendered the Plaintiff's Motion to Strike the Defendant's Answer moot, as the Answer will be stricken due to the court's ruling on the Demurrer. The Defendant did not file an opposition to the Demurrer, and therefore, the court has no basis to grant leave to amend.
