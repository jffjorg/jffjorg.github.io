And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Ford Motor Company, has filed a motion for a protective order to ensure the confidentiality of documents and information in a lemon law action brought by plaintiff Daniel Decker. The parties have agreed to use the Los Angeles Superior Court Model Order as a template for the protective order. The defendant seeks to modify the order to define affiliated attorneys, require all personnel at plaintiff's counsel's office to sign the order, and limit disclosure to mock jurors. The court finds that the defendant's request to define affiliated attorneys as attorneys of the same firm is granted, but only if they sign the proposed order prior to being given access to the confidential material. The request to require all personnel to sign the order is denied, as it would be an undue burden. The court also denies the defendant's request to remove subsection (g) of the proposed order, which allows disclosure to mock jurors, as it is necessary for plaintiff's counsel to prepare for trial. The defendant's other requests, including modifying paragraphs 7, 8, and 21 of the proposed order, are granted.
