And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion for summary judgment and motion in the alternative for summary adjudication. The Defendant, The Woman's Club of Hollywood, California, had argued that there were no material facts in dispute and therefore the case should be decided in their favor. However, the Judge found that the Defendant's separate statement, which is required to support their motion, was in violation of California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1350(d) and California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) §437c. Specifically, the statement failed to separately set out each cause of action and did not cite to the evidence in support of each material fact. The Judge emphasized that courts are entitled to assistance from counsel and that an invitation to search without guidance is not useful. As a result, the Judge denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment and motion in the alternative for summary adjudication.
