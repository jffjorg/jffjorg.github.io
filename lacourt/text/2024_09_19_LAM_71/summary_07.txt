And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining Defendant Kia Motors America's demurrer to Plaintiffs Denise Navarette and Maria Sandoval's entire complaint. The demurrer was filed on June 18, 2024, and the Court will give Defendant 20 days to amend the complaint. The Plaintiffs' complaint alleges five causes of action, including violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, breach of express written warranty, and breach of implied warranty of merchantability. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs' allegations are conclusory and do not provide sufficient notice to Defendant regarding the circumstances giving rise to Plaintiffs' particular claim for the Subject Vehicle, a 2017 Kia Optima. As a result, the Court will sustain the demurrer and give Defendant an opportunity to amend the complaint.
