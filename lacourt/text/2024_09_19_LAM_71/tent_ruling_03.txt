 Case No.: 
  23STCV16166 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 19, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Saloumeh Rahimi’s motion for attorneys’
fees is granted in the amount of $25,273.50.00.
Plaintiff’s
request for costs is granted in the amount of $1,111.51.

 
Plaintiff Saloumeh Rahimi (“Rahimi”)
(“Plaintiff”) moves for an order awarding her a total of $25,273.50 in attorneys’
fees against Defendants
Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (“PCNA”) and Beverly Hills Porsche (“BH
Porsche”) (collectively, “Defendants”).  (Notice of Motion, pgs. i-ii;
Civ.
Code §§1794(d).)  Plaintiff
also requests costs in the amount of $1,111.51. 
(Notice of Motion, pg. ii.) 
Plaintiff moves for an award of her reasonable fees, costs, and expenses
as the prevailing party pursuant to the accepted Release and Settlement
Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) accepted and signed by Plaintiff on May 22,
2024.  (Notice of Motion, pg. ii.)   
 
Background
This is a lemon law action
brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”).  On May 22, 2024, Plaintiff accepted a
Settlement made by Defendants in the amount of $49,000.00 plus attorney’s fees,
costs, and expenses by motion.  (Decl. of
Saeedian ¶25.)  
On
June 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for attorneys’ fees and a memorandum
of costs.  On September 6, 2024,
Defendants filed their opposition.  On
September 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed her reply.
 
Discussion
Civil Code §1794(d) provides that a
buyer who prevails in an action under that section, “shall be allowed by the
court to recover as a part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount
of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and the prosecution of such action.” 
Here, Plaintiff is the prevailing party
and is entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement.  (See Decl. of Saeedian
¶25.)  Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion is
proper.
 
Civil Code §1794(d)
Civil Code §1794(d) provides, “[i]f the
buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by
the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.”
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by the Plaintiff’s counsel. The Supreme Court of California
has concluded that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for
private attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Plaintiff’s
Counsel declares the following hourly rates: (1) Michael Saeedian at $695.00
per hour; (2) Christopher Urner at $525.00 per hour; and (3) Jorge Acosta at $350.00
per hour and $250.00 per hour for his work as a law clerk.  (Decl. of Saeedian ¶¶2-5, 9, 11, Exh. A.)  Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated her
counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable in their community of practice in their
specialized area of law.  (Decl. of Saeedian
¶12.)  
Defendants’
opposition objects to the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rates.  (Opposition, pgs. 11-14.)  Defendants’ objection is unavailing, as is
their citation to Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America,
LLC for the premise that the simplicity of this case warrants a reduction
of Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rates.  The
relative complexity or simplicity of a case typically is not a factor in
establishing a reasonable hourly rate. Rather, that factor is used to evaluate
the reasonableness of the number of billable hours claimed by counsel.  (Blum v. Stensen (1984) 465
U.S. 886, 898 [“The novelty and complexity of the issues [is] . . . fully
reflected in the number of billable hours recorded by counsel and thus do not
warrant an . . . adjustment in a fee based on the number of billable hours
times reasonable hourly rates”]; see also Perdue v. Kenny A. (2010) 559
U.S. 542, 552 [rejecting use of novelty or complexity of a case as grounds for
enhancement because those factors are “‘presumably . . . fully reflected in the
number of billable hours recorded by counsel’”].)  The lodestar method yields a fee that is
presumptively sufficient to achieve the objective of being adequate enough to
attract competent counsel but not to produce a windfall.  (Id.) 
Further, Defendants do not provide a basis for their suggested hourly
rates of $350 and $150 per hour.
The Court
finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s rates to be reasonable and do not warrant a
reduction.  
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
In this
case, the declarations and billing records provided by Plaintiff’s counsel are
sufficient to meet the burden of proving the reasonableness of the claimed fees
in terms of amounts and tasks. To satisfy this burden, evidence and
descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling
the court to evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys
spent on specific claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended.  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
Plaintiff’s
fee recovery is based on 54.3 hours Plaintiff’s counsel spent litigating this
case through the instant motion, and includes estimated time for reviewing
Defendants’ opposition, preparing a reply, and attending the hearing on the
instant motion.  (See Decl. of Saeedian
¶28, Exh. A at pg. 7 of 7.)  The fees
incurred are reasonable, as captured in the billing records submitted to this
Court.  (Decl. of Saeedian ¶28, Exh. A.)  Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing records reflect
the actual time and clear descriptions of services performed in connection with
litigating this case.  Although the
submission of such detailed time records is not necessary under California law,
if submitted, such records “are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear
indication the records are erroneous.”  (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 396.)
Defendants
object to several of Plaintiff’s requested fees on the basis they were not
reasonably incurred.
First,
Defendants object to “half of the [billing] entries . . . for some form of
broad communications/correspondences with Plaintiff and numerous duplicate
entries related to reviewing the file, document production, calendaring, saving
documents to the file, and accessing the court docket regarding case status and
update file regarding same.” 
(Opposition, pg. 7.)  Defendants’
objection is not well taken; general arguments that fees claimed are excessive,
duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.  (Premier Medical Management Systems,
Inc. v. California Insurance Guarantee Association (2008) 163
Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)  Therefore,
Defendants fail to meet its burden to challenge these unspecified fees.
Second,
Defendants object to billing entries for Jorge L. Acosta because they are “rife
with administrative tasks and broad block billing of duplicative entries for
‘settlement discussions.’”  (Opposition,
pg. 7.)  Defendants’ objection is not
well taken; Defendants again fail to cite to specific block-billed entries.  Defendants’ list of entries that are “block-billed”
do not meet courts’ definitions of block-billing.  The phrase “block billing” refers to billing
for “a block of time” expended on multiple tasks “rather than itemizing the
time spent on each task.”  (Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1010.)  Here, the billing entries cited are for singular
tasks billed for 0.1-0.2 of an hour. 
These tasks appear itemized and are not for blocks of time.  Therefore, Defendants fail to meet its burden
to challenge these fees.
Accordingly,
the Court grants Plaintiff’s requested attorneys’ fees in the total amount of $25,273.50.
 
Costs
Plaintiff
requests a total of $1,111.51 in costs in the instant motion.  Defendants do not challenge Plaintiff’s
request for costs, nor did Defendants file a motion to tax costs.  (See Opposition.)
Accordingly,
the Court grants Plaintiff’s request for costs in the total amount of $1,111.51.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for
attorneys’ fees is granted in the total amount of $25,273.50.
Plaintiff’s request for costs is
granted in the total amount of $1,111.51.
Moving Party to give notice.
