Significant Statements:

But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction."
  - "Evidentiary sanctions may be imposed only after a motion to compel is made and granted and the party to be sanctioned has failed to comply with that order."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's unopposed motion for terminating sanctions against the defendant. The plaintiff had requested that the defendant's operative answer be struck and that she be defaulted. The judge found that the defendant had not acted willfully and that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for evidentiary sanctions, prohibiting the defendant from introducing any documents responsive to the plaintiff's request for production as evidence at trial. The judge has also prohibited the defendant from entering into evidence at trial or any motion or other court proceeding any document that would be responsive to the request for production.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for issue sanctions.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,650.00. The sanctions are payable within 20 days.
