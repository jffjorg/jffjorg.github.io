CASEY
  RYAN SPENCER, 
  
         vs.
 
GEMMA
  RACHELLE RODRIGUEZ BUSONI.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV02430
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 19, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Casey Ryan Spencer’s unopposed motion for terminating sanctions against pro
per Defendant Gemma Rachelle Rodriguez Busoni is denied.
Plaintiff’s motion in the alternative for evidentiary sanctions is
granted.  Plaintiff is precluded from
admitting any documents responsive to Plaintiff’s Request for Production (Set
One) as evidence at trial.  Further, and
because the most recent deposition notice included a document request,
Defendant is precluded from entering into evidence at trial or any motion or
other court proceeding any document that would be responsive to Request for Production
(Set One).  
Plaintiff’s request in the alternative for issue sanctions is
denied.
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against pro per
Defendant Gemma Rachelle Rodriguez Busoni is granted in the reduced amount of $1,650.00.  Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
 
          Plaintiff Casey
Ryan Spencer (“Spencer”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed for terminating
sanctions against pro per Defendant Gemma Rachelle Rodriguez Busoni (“Busoni”)
(“Defendant”) by striking the operative answer of Defendant and entering her
default.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P.
§§177.5, 1005, 2023.010, 2023.030, 2025.010, et seq.)  Alternatively, Plaintiff requests the
following evidentiary sanctions: that Defendant be precluded from entering into
evidence at trial and any motion or court proceeding any and all documents that
would be
responsive to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One (“RFP”).  (Notice Motion, pg.
2.)  Plaintiff moves on the grounds this
Court previously ordered that Defendant provide responses without objections to
the RFPs by June 6, 2024.  (Notice of
Motion, pg. 2; 5/17/24 Minute Order.)
 
Background
On February 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed his initial Complaint against
Defendant alleging two causes of action: (1) breach of lease No.1; and (2) breach
of lease No. 2.  (See Complaint.)  Defendant filed an answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint
on December 6, 2023.  
On February 14, 2024, Plaintiff propounded Form Interrogatories
(Set One) (“FROG”), Request for Production of Documents (Set One) (“RFP”),
Requests for Admission (Set One) (“RFA”), and Special Interrogatories (Set One)
(“SROG”) on Defendant.  (Decl. of Dreblow
¶7, Exh. D.)  On May 17, 2024, this Court
granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to the FROG and RFP and ordered
Code-compliant responses without objections within 20 days and granted
discovery sanctions in the total amount of $655.00 against Defendant.  (5/17/24 Minute Order.)
On June 4, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant reminding
her of the upcoming deadline, and providing her an extension through June 7,
2024, to comply.  (Decl. of Dreblow ¶11,
Exh. H.)  Defendant failed to provide
responses to the RFA or RFP by the extended June 7, 2024, deadline.  (Decl. of Dreblow ¶11.)  On June 9, 2024, Defendant provided RFA
responses but failed to provide responses to the RFP.  (Decl. of Dreblow ¶11.)  On June 13, 2024, after Plaintiff sent two
(2) follow up emails, Defendant responded by indicating that her failure to
respond to the RFP was due to a file size issue.  (Decl. of Dreblow ¶11.)  Plaintiff promptly provided Defendant with a
Dropbox link for the responses that same day.  (Decl. of Dreblow ¶11.)  After receiving no response, Plaintiff
followed up with Defendant again on June 18, 2024, and requested a response to
avoid the need for additional motion practice related to this discovery.  (Decl. of Dreblow ¶11.)
As of the date of this hearing Defendant has not provided
responses to Plaintiff’s RFP or produced responsive documents.  (Decl. of Dreblow ¶8, Exh. F.)
On June 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. As of the
date of this hearing Defendant has not filed an opposition.
 
 Terminating Sanctions
The Court, “after notice to any affected party . . . and after
opportunity for hearing,” may impose terminating and/or monetary sanctions for
misuses of the discovery process. 
(C.C.P. §2023.030(a) and (d).) 
Misuses of the discovery process include failing to respond or to submit
to an authorized method of discovery and disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.  (C.C.P. §§2023.010(d),
(g).)  
“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made
lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.”  (Mileikowsky v. Tenet
Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)  When deciding whether to impose terminating sanctions,
courts generally weigh three factors: (1) whether the party subject to the
sanction acted willfully, (2) the detriment to the party seeking discovery, and
(3) the number of formal and informal unsuccessful attempts to obtain
discovery.  (Creed-21 v. City of
Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  Nonmonetary
sanctions require evidence of willful violations of discovery orders or a history
of egregious abuses of discovery.  (R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486.)  A prerequisite to the imposition of
nonmonetary sanctions is willful disobedience of a court order.  (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403.)  By
requiring a violation of a discovery order before imposing nonmonetary
sanctions, California courts can be sure that the offending party does not
intend to comply with the discovery request.  (Ruvalcaba v. Government Employees Insurance
Co. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1579, 1581.) 
“[A] terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a
monetary discovery sanction is never justified.”  (Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 608, 615.)
          Plaintiff moves for
terminating sanctions on the grounds Defendant has willfully disobeyed this
Court’s 5/17/24 Order.  (Motion, pg. 5.)  Here, terminating sanctions are not appropriate
because there is no evidence before the Court that less severe sanctions would
not produce compliance with the discovery rules.  First, although Plaintiff needed to remind
Defendant to provide verifications and responses to the RFAs and SROGS before
the deadline, Defendant requested an extension, which was granted by Defendant,
and served by Plaintiff two days late.  (See
Decl. of Dreblow ¶11, Exh. H at pgs. 4-5.) 
Second, Plaintiff’s motion does not indicate Defendant failed to provide
code-Compliant FROG responses in compliance with this Court’s 5/17/24
Order.  (See Decl. of
Dreblow.)  Third, Plaintiff’s motion
indicates that Defendant attempted to comply with this Court’s 5/17/24 Order
with regard to the RFP, was but unable to respond due to a file size
issue.  (See Decl. of Dreblow ¶11,
Exh. H at pgs. 1-4.)  
The Court acknowledges Defendant has been delinquent in her
discovery responses; however, terminating sanctions is an extreme remedy, and
the Court is not inclined to grant the ultimate sanction at this juncture.
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for terminating
sanctions is denied.        
 
Evidentiary Sanctions
When a party violates a
discovery order, a trial court may prohibit the violating party from
introducing evidence at trial that contradicts the opponent’s claims or
supports the violating party’s defenses. 
(Juarez v. Boy Scouts of America (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 377, 387.)
Evidentiary sanctions may
be imposed only after a motion to compel is made and granted and the party to
be sanctioned has failed to comply with that order.  (Karlsson v. Ford Motor Co. (2006) 140
Cal.App.4th 1202, 1214.)  However,
violation of a discovery order is not a prerequisite to evidentiary sanctions
when the offending party has engaged in a pattern of willful discovery abuse
that causes the unavailability of evidence.  (Id. at pg. 1215.)
In Young v. Rosenthal
(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, a party was precluded from testifying after refusing
to cooperate with the taking of his deposition.  As a result of having failed to comply with
the trial court’s discovery order only once, the trial court granted a motion
for issue an evidence sanctions ordering that certain facts be deemed
established according to Plaintiff’s claims and that severe evidentiary
limitations be placed on the defendant at trial.  (Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212
Cal.App.3d 96, 104-108.) 
In Valbona v. Springer
(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, the trial court granted evidentiary and issue
sanctions where the plaintiff failed to produce documents in response to
discovery requests and instead withheld production of the documents until trial
began.  As part of the evidence sanction,
the trial court precluded introduction of the documents at trial and an issue sanction
that required the plaintiff’s counsel to reduce to a writing judicial
admissions of various facts, which was later used in a special jury
instruction.  (Valbona, 43
Cal.App.4th at pgs. 1544-1545; Waicis v. Superior Court (1990) 226
Cal.App.3d 283 [granting sanction of preclusion of testimony of noncooperative deponent
is authorized by the Civil Discovery Act].)
Here, Plaintiff’s request
in the alternative for evidentiary sanctions against Defendant is appropriate
because Defendant refuses to provide documents responsive to Plaintiff’s RFP.  Therefore, Plaintiff is precluded from
admitting any documents responsive to the RFP as evidence at trial.  Further, and because the most recent
deposition notice included a document request, Defendant is precluded from
entering into evidence at trial or any motion or other court proceeding any document
that would be responsive to the RFP.  Such a sanction is necessary to remedy
Defendant’s actions and level the playing field for trial.
 
Issue Sanctions
In light of this Court’s
ruling on Plaintiff’s request for evidentiary sanctions, Plaintiff’s additional
request in the alternative for issue sanctions is denied.
 
Monetary Sanctions
In addition to or in lieu
of any other sanction, the court may order the disobedient party or counsel
responsible or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney fees,
incurred as a result of the failure to obey (including fees on the sanctions
motion).  (C.C.P. §2023.030(a).)
Plaintiff requests
monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,270.00 against Defendant for attorneys’ fees in connection with the
preparation, filing, and service of the instant motion.  Plaintiff’s counsel declares his hourly rate
is $535.00/hour, and that counsel spent 3 hours in preparation of this motion
and anticipates an additional two hours analyzing an opposition and preparing a
reply and one hour attending a hearing on the motion.  (Decl. of Dreblow ¶15.)  The Court determines Plaintiff’s counsel’s
hourly rate is reasonable based on the experience of the Court.  However, the instant motion is unopposed and
anticipated fees are not fees reasonably incurred on this motion.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of $1,650.00, calculated as follows:
($530.00/hour x 3 hours) + $60 filing fee = $1,650.00
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for monetary sanctions
against Defendant is granted in the reduced amount of $1,650.00.  Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for terminating sanctions
against Defendant is denied.  
Plaintiff’s motion in the alternative for evidentiary sanctions is
granted.  Plaintiff is precluded
from admitting any documents responsive to the RFP as evidence at trial.  Further, and because the most recent
deposition notice included a document request, Defendant is precluded from
entering into evidence at trial or any motion or other court proceeding any document
that would be responsive to the RFP.  
Plaintiff’s request in
the alternative for issue sanctions is denied.
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Defendant is
granted in the reduced amount of $1,650.00. 
Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
Moving Party to give notice.
