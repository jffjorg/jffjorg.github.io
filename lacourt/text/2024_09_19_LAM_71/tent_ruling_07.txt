DENISE
  NAVARRETE, et al.,  
  
         vs.
 
KIA MOTORS
  AMERICA.


 Case No.: 
  24STCV05552
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 19, 2024



 
Defendant Kia
America, Inc.’s demurrer to Plaintiffs Denise Navarette’s and Maria Sandoval’s entire
complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
          Defendant Kia
America, Inc. (“KA”) (“Defendant”) demurs to Plaintiffs Denise Navarette’s (“Navarette”)
and Maria Sandoval’s (“Sandoval”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) complaint (“Complaint”)
on the grounds Plaintiffs’ Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to
constitute causes of action against Defendant, and portions of the Complaint
are uncertain.  (Notice of Demurrer, pgs.
1-2.)
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the
moving party must meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video
conference with the party who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an
agreement that would resolve the objections to the pleading and obviate the
need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P.
§430.41, emphasis added.) 
Defendant’s counsel declares that
on June 6, 2024, counsel for Defendant met and conferred telephonically with
Plaintiffs’ counsel, and the parties were unable to reach an agreement.  (Decl. of Sniderman ¶¶3-4.)  Defendant’s counsel’s declaration is
sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41. 
Accordingly, the Court will consider Defendant’s demurrer.
 
          Background
          Plaintiffs
filed their operative Complaint on March 5, 2024, against Defendant.  Plaintiff filed the operative FAC against
Defendant alleging five causes of action: (1) violation of Civil Code
§1793.2(D); (2) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(B); (3) violation of Civil Code
§1793.2(A)(3); (4) breach of express written warranty (Civ. Code §§1791.2(A),
1794); and (5) breach of implied warranty of merchantability (Civ. Code §§1791.1,
1794).  Plaintiffs’ causes of action
arise from the purchase of a 2017 Kia Optima (“Subject Vehicle”).  (See Complaint.)
          Defendant
filed the instant demurrer on June 18, 2024. 
Plaintiffs filed their opposition on September 6, 2024.  Defendant filed its reply on September 12,
2024.
 
Summary of
Demurrer
Defendant demurs
to each cause of action on the basis each fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action against Defendant. 
(Demurrer, pg. 1; C.C.P. §430.10(e).) 
Defendant demurs to the 4th cause of action on the ground that it is
uncertain and unintelligible.  (Demurrer,
pg. 1; C.C.P. §430.10(f).)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State
a Claim
Entire Complaint
For the purpose
of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the
truth of all material facts properly pleaded (i.e., all ultimate facts alleged,
but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law). (Serrano v.
Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)
Plaintiffs’ conclusory
allegations that the Subject Vehicle contained or developed defects, including
but not limited to “a. Defective body system; b. Defective powertrain system; c.
Defective safety system; d. Defective electrical system; e. Defective braking system;
f. Defective noise system; and g. Any additional complaints made by Plaintiffs,
whether or not they are contained in the records or on any repair orders” and
the allegation that “Plaintiffs provided Defendant KA sufficient opportunity to
service or repair the Vehicle” is not sufficient to state causes of action
against Defendant under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
(“Song-Beverly”).  (See Complaint
¶¶11, 13.)  Plaintiffs’ allegations
merely restate the Song-Beverly Act without providing Defendant sufficient
notice regarding the circumstances giving rise to Plaintiffs’ particular claim
for the Subject Vehicle.
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s entire Complaint is sustained with
20 days leave to amend.
 
          Conclusion
Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiffs’ entire Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.
Moving Party to
