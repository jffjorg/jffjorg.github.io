And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant Eisenberg & Associates' motion for attorney fees in the amount of $63,441.00. The motion was filed in response to the dismissal of Plaintiff Norms Restaurant, LLC's claims against Eisenberg. The Judge finds that Eisenberg is not a prevailing party under the anti-SLAPP statute because its counsel, Bryan W. Edgar, is an "of counsel" attorney and not an independent entity. The Judge cites several cases, including Sands & Associates v. Juknavorian, which hold that a law firm and its "of counsel" attorney constitute a single entity and cannot recover attorney fees as a prevailing party. The Judge also finds that Eisenberg presents no evidence of an obligation to pay Edgar or of the form any compensation for his services might have taken. Therefore, the motion is denied.
