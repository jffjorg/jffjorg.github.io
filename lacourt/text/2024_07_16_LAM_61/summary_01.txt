And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of defendant David Bogner. The plaintiff served the deposition notice on April 4, 2024, and Bogner failed to appear for the deposition on May 10, 2024. Although Bogner served objections to the notice, the judge finds that the plaintiff's efforts to meet and confer before filing the motion were sufficient. The judge also finds that Bogner has not shown good cause for his failure to appear and that the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that the deposition is necessary to resolve the case.

As a result, the judge awards sanctions against Bogner in the amount of $2,660.00, payable to the plaintiff within 30 days.
