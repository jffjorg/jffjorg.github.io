 Case Number:  23STCV31075    Hearing Date:   July 16, 2024    Dept:  61 NORMS RESTAURANTS, LLC, A DELAWARE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY vs BRANDON TYERMAN, AN INDIVIDUAL, et al.TENTATIVEDefendant Eisenberg & Associates’ Motion for Attorney Fees is DENIED.Plaintiff to provide notice.DISCUSSIONI. ATTORNEY FEESDefendant Eisenberg & Associate (Eisenberg) seeks $63,441.00 in attorney fees associated with Eisenberg’s anti-SLAPP motion, during the pendency of which Plaintiff Norms Restaurant, LLC’s (Plaintiff) claims against it were dismissed. Eisenberg’s counsel, Bryan W. Edgar of the Edgar Legal Group, offers a declaration attesting to 39.9 hours of attorney work at a rate of $795 per hour, yielding a total of $31,720, or $63,441 with a requested 200% multiplier. (Edgar Decl. ¶¶ 4–6.)Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16, subd. (c)(1) states that “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney's fees and costs.” “The party prevailing on a special motion to strike may seek an attorney fee award through three different avenues: simultaneously with litigating the special motion to strike; by a subsequent noticed motion, . . . or as part of a cost memorandum.” (Carpenter v. Jack In The Box Corp. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 454, 461.)Eisenberg is arguably a prevailing defendant under the anti-SLAPP statue, even though the court denied its motion as moot. Even upon voluntary dismissal of a claim under a pending anti-SLAPP challenge, “the trial court continued to have jurisdiction over the case only for the limited purpose of ruling on the defendants' motion for attorney fees and costs.” (Law Offices of Andrew L. Ellis v. Yang (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 869, 879.) A court may thus award attorney fees under the anti-SLAPP statute on a dismissed claim and a denied motion if it determines that “a defendant would have prevailed on its motion to strike.” (Tourgeman v. Nelson & Kennard (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1447, 1457.)Eisenberg argues that it would have prevailed on its anti-SLAPP motion because the conduct alleged against it was litigation-related activity protected by both the anti-SLAPP statute and the litigation privilege of Civil Code § 47. (Motion at pp. 6–7.) Specifically, Eisenberg argues that Plaintiff sued it for assisting its client in the breach of confidentiality, non-disparagement and non-cooperation clauses in an employment settlement agreement by encouraging other employees to file suit against Plaintiff. (Ibid.)Plaintiff and its former counsel, in separate oppositions, object to Eisenberg’s assumed status as a prevailing party (Norms Opposition at pp. 14–15; Fisher Opposition at pp. 8–12.) Both opposition parties argue that the fees sought are unreasonable and excessive. (Norms Opposition at pp. 16–18; Fisher Opposition at pp. 12–14.) And Plaintiff’s former attorneys argue that they are not permissible targets for an anti-SLAPP attorney fees motion. (Fisher Opposition at pp. 7–8.)However, it is unnecessary to address these arguments, as Eisenberg’s request for fees is squarely barred by authority preventing an award of fees to a self-represented party. “[S]elf-represented attorneys” are not eligible to have their fees compensated even when prevailing on an anti-SLAPP motion. (Ellis Law Group, LLP v. Nevada City Sugar Loaf Properties, LLC (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 244, 253.) A firm defending itself through its own “partners, members, or associates” would not be entitled to attorney fees, as this would enable a “double” recovery of fees on services already presumptively performed for the attorneys’ own benefit, and create an imbalance of privilege in favor of attorneys over non-attorneys, who cannot recover fees for their own . (See Sands & Associates v. Juknavorian (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1297.)This authority applies here because it is undisputed that Eisenberg’s counsel, Bryan W. Edgar, though appearing nominally as part of Edgar Legal Group, is “of counsel” to Defendant Eisenberg, the client he is representing. Edgar maintains a profile on the LinkedIn website indicating that he has been “Of Counsel” for Eisenberg since 2016. (Goldstein Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. 3.) Although Edgar used an Edgar Law Group email address through most of this litigation, in April 2024 he began using an email address associated with Eisenberg to receive emails from an Eisenberg legal assistant, which were forwarded to opposing counsel. (Goldstein Decl. ¶ 10, Exh. 2, 4–7.) Plaintiff presents complaints, dating from 2019 to December 2023, brought by Eisenberg, listing Edgar as among the attorneys in the caption. (RJN Exhs. 1–5.) Edgar Law Group’s address listed on the California State Bar website is the same as the address of Eisenberg. (Goldstein Decl. ¶ 15.)Applicable case authority squarely bars the recovery of prevailing-party fees nominally incurred by its “of counsel” attorney. The court in Sands & Associates, supra, 209 Cal.app.4th at pp. 1272–1273, held as follows:The question on appeal is whether a law firm can recover attorney fees under a “prevailing party” clause when the firm is a successful litigant represented by “of counsel.” Our analysis is based on two well-settled principles. First, when a law firm is the prevailing party in a lawsuit and is represented by one of its partners, members, or associates, it cannot recover attorney fees even though the litigation is based on a contract with a prevailing party clause. (See Carpenter & Zuckerman, LLP v. Cohen (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 373, 375, 385, 124 Cal.Rptr.3d 598 (Carpenter ); see also Trope v. Katz (1995) 11 Cal.4th 274, 277, 292, 45 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 902 P.2d 259 (Trope ).)Second, the relationship between a law firm and “of counsel” is “ ‘close, personal, continuous, and regular.’ ” (People ex rel. Dept. of Corporations v. SpeeDee Oil Change Systems, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1135, 1153, 86 Cal.Rptr.2d 816, 980 P.2d 371 (SpeeDee Oil ), italics omitted.) “ ‘[T]o the extent the relationship between [an attorney] or law firm and another [attorney] or law firm is sufficiently “close, personal, regular and continuous,” such that one is held out to the public as “of counsel” for the other, the ... relationship must be considered a single, de facto firm for purposes of [avoiding the representation of adverse interests].’ ” (Id. at p. 1154, 86 Cal.Rptr.2d 816, 980 P.2d 371, italics added, citing State Bar Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 3–310.)Similarly, because the relationship between a law firm and “of counsel” is close, personal, regular, and continuous, we conclude that a law firm and “of counsel” constitute a single, de facto firm, and thus a law firm cannot recover attorney fees under a prevailing party clause when, as a successful litigant, it is represented by “of counsel.”(Sands, supra, 209 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1272–1273.)Edgar here is “of counsel” to Eisenberg, a fact not contested here. (Reply at p. 2.) He is held out to the public as such, and this relationship is close, personal, continuous, and regular, as evidenced by the sharing of staff, office space, and continuing appearance of Edgar as an “Eisenberg” attorney in various cases. Per the “bright-line rule” of the Sands court — to the effect that “attorneys of counsel to a law firm are sufficiently integral to a law firm as to disallow fees for defense of the firm” (Ellis Law Group, LLP v. Nevada City Sugar Loaf Properties, LLC(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 244, 255) — Eisenberg is barred from recovering the fees sought here by these facts alone.Eisenberg’s attempt to distinguish this case is unavailing. It attempts to argue, not that the closeness of the of-counsel relationship is not present here, but that the independent existence of the Edgar Law Group somehow compels a different conclusion. (Reply at pp. 2–5.) Yet the existence of an “of counsel” attorney’s separate practice is immaterial: “[I]t does not matter that they may have represented clients obtained through their own efforts, that they had what they call a ‘separate’ practice, or that they were not on the firm's payroll.” (Ellis Law Group, LLP v. Nevada City Sugar Loaf Properties, LLC (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 244, 256.)The evidence that Eisenberg presents is in accord with that presented in Sands. There, the court noted as follows:[N]o evidence supports the conclusion that the firm “incurred” an obligation to pay $25,235—what the trial court awarded—or any other amount to Of Counsel, whether determined by the hours spent on the case or as a percentage of the recovery. Of Counsel did not offer any evidence indicating how they would be or were compensated by the firm. In moving for attorney fees, Of Counsel did not submit any billing statements or time records—documents that would suggest the Sands firm had “incurred” attorney fees; nor did Of Counsel provide a breakdown or description of their services. For all we know, the firm paid Of Counsel in accordance with “a permanent status in between those of partner and associate.” (ABA Com. on Prof. Ethics, formal opn. No. 90-357, supra, p. 3.) And Of Counsel had offices at the same address as the Sands firm, were assisted by the firm's associates and support staff, and had the same telephone and telefacsimile numbers as the firm.(Sands, supra, 209 Cal.App.4th at p. 1297, internal citations omitted.) Eisenberg here presents no evidence that it incurred an obligation to pay Edgar, or of the form any compensation for his services might have taken. It presents no invoices, and presents instead a one-page chart of hours incurred over multiple months of work, evidently prepared for this motion. (Edgar Decl. Exh. C.) Edgar in reply declares that Eisenberg retained Edgar Law Group with a “fee agreement,” of an unspecified nature and at an unspecified time. (Supp. Edgar Decl. ¶ 6.) The evidence supports the same of counsel relationship that existed in Sands, and which foreclosed the award of fees there.The motion is therefore DENIED.
