And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is that the Plaintiff's demurrer to the Cross-Complainant's first amended cross-complaint is sustained, without leave to amend. The Cross-Complainant failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for abuse of process, breach of contract, and recission. The Judge reviewed the legal standards for a demurrer and applied them to the Cross-Complainant's allegations, finding that they did not meet the requirements for a valid claim. The Judge will consider the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. The Cross-Complainant bears the burden of demonstrating that the defect can be cured by amendment.
