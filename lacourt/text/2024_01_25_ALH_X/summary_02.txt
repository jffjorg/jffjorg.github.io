**Significant Statements**

"The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute." (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.)
"A party may move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding if it is contented that the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the action or proceeding." (Code of Civil Procedure section 473c subd. (a)(1))
"A defendant moving for summary judgment must show that one or more elements of the plaintiff's cause of action cannot be established or that there is a complete defense." (Veera v. Banana Republic, LLC)
"In order to testify as an expert in a medical malpractice case, a person must have enough knowledge, learning and skill with the relevant subject to speak with authority... In those cases where a medical specialist is alleged to have acted negligently, the 'specialist must possess and use the learning, care and skill normally possessed and exercised by practitioners of that specialty under the same or similar circumstances.'" (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center)
