And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer with motion to strike filed by the defendants. The demurrer was filed by the defendants against the plaintiff's second amended complaint, which alleges breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, unjust enrichment, and conversion.

The judge has overruled the demurrer in its entirety, meaning that the plaintiff's claims will proceed to trial. The judge has also granted the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for attorney's fees, but denied the motion to strike the plaintiff's claims for punitive damages, restitution, and unjust enrichment.

The judge has also ordered that the defendants provide notice of the tentative ruling to the parties.
