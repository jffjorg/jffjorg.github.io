And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Volt Information Sciences, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration in the case of Omar Guerra v. Volt Information Sciences, Inc., et al. The court finds that Volt has met its burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement and that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies. The court also finds that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable and that the Clary Defendants, including the Clary Corporation, John P. Clary, Hugh L. Clary, and Donald G Ash, are third-party beneficiaries to the agreement.

The court notes that the arbitration agreement was signed by Omar Guerra and provides that disputes arising out of or related to his employment with Volt will be settled by final and binding arbitration. The agreement also provides that the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) will apply.

The court finds that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the agreement is procedurally or substantively unconscionable. The court also finds that the Clary Defendants would benefit from the contract and that the contract designates them as third-party beneficiaries.

The court orders that the motion to compel arbitration is granted and that the case will be stayed pending arbitration. The court sets a status conference regarding arbitration on December 11, 2024.
