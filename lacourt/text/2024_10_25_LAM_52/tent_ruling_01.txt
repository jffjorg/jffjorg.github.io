  Case Number:  20STCV13190    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff American Honda Finance
Corporation’s Motion Objecting to Amended Undertaking Filed by Judgment Debtors
Plaintiff/judgment creditor American
Honda Finance Corporation objects under Code of Civil Procedure 995.930 to the amended
undertaking filed by defendants/judgment debtors Hooman Nissani and Babak
Sarraf.  Two days before this hearing,
defendants filed a notice of withdrawal of the undertaking.  Defendants similarly withdrew their initial
undertaking three days before the hearing on plaintiff’s objection to it.
            Since
defendants withdrew the amended undertaking, plaintiff’s objection to it is
moot.  The court, however, finds judgment
debtors have submitted two facially insufficient undertakings in bad faith and
for the purpose of delay.  The first
undertaking was insufficient for several reasons as the court stated in its
order dated October 7, 2024.  The amended
undertaking is insufficient because neither personal surety is a resident of
the State of California.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 995.510, subd. (a)(2), 995.520, subd. (b)(2).)  Both are Delaware limited liability
companies.
The court admonishes
judgment debtors Hooman Nissani and Babak Sarraf and their counsel, Jeffrey
Lewis and Kyla Dayton, not to submit another undertaking with insufficient
personal sureties.
