And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 21STCV02330, which involves a motion to compel depositions and document requests. The plaintiff, Jimmy Guzman, is seeking to compel the depositions of 10 witnesses, including Dorian Racey, Diana Dobbs, and Michael Widlund. The defendants, Lockheed Martin Corporation and Mark Marino, are opposing the motion and seeking to compel the depositions of the plaintiff and other witnesses.

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff failed to show good cause for compelling the depositions of certain witnesses, including Michael Widlund, who was not served with a subpoena. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff failed to provide timely notice of depositions, which is a requirement under California law.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the depositions of Diana Dobbs, Penny Meeden, Dorian Racey, and Ruben Ruiz, but has denied the motion as to certain other witnesses. The judge has also granted the defendants' motion to compel the depositions of the plaintiff and Elvira Guzman.

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial into separate phases for liability and damages, but has granted the motion as to punitive damages. The judge has ordered the trial to be bifurcated into two phases: a first phase to determine liability, compensatory damages, and liability for punitive damages, and a second phase to determine the amount of punitive damages.

The judge has also precluded the admission of evidence of defendants' profits or financial condition until the second phase of trial, as required by California law.
