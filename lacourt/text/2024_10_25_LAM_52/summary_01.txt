And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of American Honda Finance Corporation vs. Hooman Nissani and Babak Sarraf. The plaintiff, American Honda Finance Corporation, had objected to two undertakings filed by the defendants, Hooman Nissani and Babak Sarraf. The defendants withdrew the amended undertaking just two days before the hearing, and they had also withdrawn their initial undertaking three days before the hearing on the plaintiff's objection to it. The court finds that the defendants have submitted two facially insufficient undertakings in bad faith and for the purpose of delay. The court also finds that the amended undertaking was insufficient because the personal sureties are not residents of the State of California. The court admonishes the defendants and their counsel not to submit another undertaking with insufficient personal sureties.
