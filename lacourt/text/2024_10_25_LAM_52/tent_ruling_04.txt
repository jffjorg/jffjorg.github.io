 Case Number:  23STCV19072    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment 
Plaintiff PlumbingAndFire, Inc. dba Allied Plumbing &
Fire Supply requests court judgment by default against defendants Nehorai Construction Inc.
and Ilan Kenig.  Plaintiff’s
application has two defects.
First, plaintiff requests excessive interest at the annual rate of
18%.  The California Constitution, Article XV, Section 1 limits interest to 10%
unless an exemption applies.  Los Angeles
Superior Court Local Rule, rule 3.206 provides, “If interest is requested in
excess of the usury limitations of California Constitution Article XV, Section
1, proof must be presented of plaintiff’s exemption from the usury limitations
unless an exemption has been pleaded in the complaint and admitted by the entry
of default.”  The complaint does not
plead an exemption from the usury limitations. 
Plaintiff did not submit proof of exemption.  Plaintiff must either present proof of
exemption or request interest no greater than 10%.
Second, plaintiff seeks excessive
attorney fees of $38,794.85.  Attorney
fees for a default judgment are generally limited to a specified schedule based
on the amount of damages.  (Local Rules
3.207(a), 3.214(a).)  A plaintiff may
recover “a fee greater than listed in
the [default] schedule because of extraordinary services.”  (3.214(d).) 
Plaintiff fails to show extraordinary services justifying a fee greater
than the schedule.  The court notes
plaintiff did, as an alternative to its lodestar, calculate the amount of
attorney fees pursuant to Local Rule 3.214 at $2,025.95.  (Oh Decl., ¶ 20.) 
Plaintiff also submitted a proposed judgment on
pleading paper.  Though doing so is
permitted, the court will exercise its discretion to require plaintiff to
submit a proposed judgment on Judicial Council form JUD-100.
Plaintiff’s
request for court judgment by default is denied without prejudice.  The
court hereby continues the order to show cause re: entry of default
judgment to December 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
