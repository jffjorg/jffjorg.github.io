And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendants, Nehorai Construction Inc. and Ilan Kenig. The plaintiff, PlumbingAndFire, Inc. dba Allied Plumbing & Fire Supply, has requested a default judgment with excessive interest at 18% per annum and attorney fees of $38,794.85. However, the judge has found that the plaintiff's request is defective for two reasons. Firstly, the plaintiff has not pleaded an exemption from the usury limitations of the California Constitution, Article XV, Section 1, and has not submitted proof of exemption. Secondly, the plaintiff has not shown extraordinary services justifying the requested attorney fees. The judge has therefore denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment without prejudice and has continued the order to show cause re: entry of default judgment to December 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The plaintiff is required to submit a revised proposed judgment on Judicial Council form JUD-100.
