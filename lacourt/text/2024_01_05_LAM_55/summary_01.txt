And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling grants the Motion of Major League Trucking, Inc. to strike the answer and cross-complaint of Defendant Marvin Flores, and also grants monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,535.00. The motion was unopposed. Major League Trucking, Inc. alleges that Flores wrongfully took their trailer chassis and shipping container, and wrote a check with insufficient funds. Flores' cross-complaint alleges that Major League and other cross-defendants failed to pay rent owed for storing items at Flores' property.

The Judge finds that Flores willfully disobeyed discovery orders and failed to provide initial responses to discovery, and has not participated in the case in a meaningful way. As a result, the Judge concludes that the appropriate sanction is to preclude Flores from introducing evidence at trial related to the information called for in the discovery requests. Additionally, the Judge imposes monetary sanctions against Flores in the amount of $2,535.00.
