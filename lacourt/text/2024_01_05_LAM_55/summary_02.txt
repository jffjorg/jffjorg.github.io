And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants SIOF 1 Properties, LLC's motion to amend their complaint. The proposed Third Amended Complaint may be filed and served as a separate document within 20 days. The complaint seeks to include recently learned facts in support of the First Cause of Action for Breach of Lease and Fourth Cause of Action for Unjust Enrichment, as well as include ROBERT ANCILL and THELMA ANCILL as defendants. The judge agrees with SIOF that they have sufficiently demonstrated evidence of recently learned facts and that the proposed amendments do not constitute a waiver. The judge also finds that Phood Farmacy's opposition to the motion is unreasonable and unconvincing. As a result, Phood Farmacy's demurrer and motion to strike with regards to the Second Amended Complaint are ordered off calendar, as moot.
