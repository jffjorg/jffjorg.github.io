And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the default entered against him on July 17, 2024. The default was entered due to the defendant's failure to respond to the lawsuit, which he attributes to his limited English proficiency and reliance on his insurance company, State Farm, to handle the legal proceedings. The defendant also claims that he was not served with a Statement of Damages, which he argues is a critical procedural requirement for entering a default. The judge finds that the failure to serve a Statement of Damages voids the default as a matter of law and that the defendant's circumstances support his argument that his failure to respond was excusable neglect. The judge sets aside the default and advances the Order to Show Cause re: Default Judgment to October 31, 2024, discharging the December 23, 2024 OSC hearing.
