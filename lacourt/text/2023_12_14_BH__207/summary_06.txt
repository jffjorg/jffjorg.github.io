And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings and is focused on determining the admissibility of evidence. The judge explains that ultimate facts are those that constitute the cause of action or liability, and distinguishes them from evidentiary facts and legal conclusions. The judge also notes that the standard for a motion for judgment on the pleadings does not permit the court to examine extrinsic evidence outside the four corners of the complaint. As a result, the judge disregards the evidence that the plaintiff has proffered in opposition to the motion.
