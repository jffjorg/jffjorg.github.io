MOTION
 
            Specially
appearing Defendants Michael C. Thompson (“Thompson”) and Gregory R. Holmes
(“Holmes”) (collectively, “Defendants”) move to quash service of the summons
and complaint on the basis of lack of personal jurisdiction.  Plaintiff Todd Michael Schultz, appearing in
pro per (“Plaintiff”) opposes the motion and Defendants reply.
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
 
            Plaintiff’s
Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Quash is styled as a declaration and sworn
under penalty of perjury.  Defendants
have therefore submitted evidentiary objections to various portions of
Plaintiff’s Opposition.  To the extent
Plaintiff intends the Opposition to serve as evidence, the Court rules as
follows with regard to Defendants’ Evidentiary Objections to Plaintiff’s Opposition:
 
1.     
Sustained
2.

3.

The

as arguments only.
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or
within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and
file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes:  (1) To quash service of summons on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd.
(a)(1).)  
 
“[W]hen jurisdiction is challenged by a nonresident defendant, the
burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to demonstrate that ‘minimum contacts’
exist between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of
personal jurisdiction.” (Mihlon v. Superior Court (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d
703, 710.) It is thus upon the plaintiff to demonstrate by a preponderance of
the evidence that all jurisdictional criteria are met. (Ziller Electronics
Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222, 1232.)   
Moreover, “on a challenge to personal jurisdiction by a motion to
quash, the plaintiff has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the
evidence, the factual bases justifying the exercise of jurisdiction.”  (ViaView, Inc. v. Retzlaff (2016) 1
Cal.App.5th 198, 209–210 (hereafter ViaView).)  “The plaintiff must come forward with
affidavits and other competent evidence to carry this burden and cannot simply
rely on allegations in an unverified complaint.”  (Id. at p. 210.)  If plaintiff meets this burden, “it becomes
the defendant’s burden to demonstrate that the existence of jurisdiction would
be unreasonable.” (Buchanan v. Soto (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1362.)
 
California’s long-arm statute grants its courts the power to assert
personal jurisdiction over out-of-state parties to the maximum extent that the
state and federal constitutions allow. (Code Civ. Proc., § 410.10.) Under the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
Constitution, state courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents
who have “minimum contacts” with the forum state. (International Shoe Co. v.
Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316.) Minimum contacts exist when the
relationship between the nonresident and the forum state is such that the
exercise of jurisdiction does not offend “traditional notions of fair play and
substantial justice.” (Id. at p. 316.) The primary focus of the personal
jurisdiction inquiry is the relationship of the defendant to the forum state. (Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of California, San Francisco County (2017)
582 U.S. 255 (hereafter Bristol-Myers).) 
 
“Minimum contacts exist where the defendant’s conduct in the forum
state is such that he should reasonably anticipate being subject to suit there,
and it is reasonable and fair to force him to do so.” (F. Hoffman-La Roche,
Ltd. v. Superior Court (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 782, 795, citing World–Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson (1980) 444 U.S. 286, 297; Kulko v.
California Superior Court (1978) 436 U.S. 84, 92; Pavlovich v. Superior
Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 262, 269.) 
 
Personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific. General (also
called all-purpose) jurisdiction means that a defendant's contacts with a state
are sufficiently extensive that the “defendant is ‘essentially at home,’ ” and
the court may exercise jurisdiction over the defendant regardless of whether
the claims relate to the forum state.  (Ford
Motor Company v. Montana Eighth Judicial District Court (2021) 141
S.Ct. 1017, 1024; Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown
(2011) 564 U.S. 915, 919.) 
 

Specific personal jurisdiction hinges on the “ ‘relationship among the
defendant, the forum, and the litigation.’ ” (Daimler AG v. Bauman (2014)
571 U.S.117, 133; accord Walden v. Fiore (2014) 571 U.S. 277, 284.)  Such jurisdiction requires “ ‘an affiliation
between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or
an occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore subject to
the State’s regulation.’ ” (Bristol-Myers, supra, 582 U.S. at p. 262.)
Consistent with the constraints of due process, “the defendant’s suit-related
conduct must create a substantial connection with the forum State.” (Walden
v. Fiore, supra, 571 U.S. at p. 284.) 
 
Further, “a nonresident defendant may be subject to the court's
specific jurisdiction if three requirements are met: (1) the defendant has
purposefully availed itself of forum benefits with respect to the matter in
controversy; (2) the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant's
contacts with the forum; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction would be
reasonable and comports with fair play and substantial justice.”  (ViaView, supra, 1 Cal.App.5th at p. 216.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendants contend that California lacks personal jurisdiction over
them.  In support of their contention,
Defendants advance their own declarations stating that they are residents of
Kentucky, and have never visited California, owned or rented any real property
in California, filed legal proceedings in California, held a California bank
account, owned or operated a business in California.  (See generally Declarations of Michael C.
Thompson and Gregory R. Holmes.)  Thus,
Defendants lack the extensive contacts to be “essentially at home” in
California to establish general jurisdiction.
 
Plaintiff has submitted an Opposition brief, signed under penalty of
perjury, as well as a Declaration, also signed under penalty of perjury.  The Opposition brief indicates, in relevant
portion, that Defendants created a YouTube Channel called “Hollywood
Laughingstock Channel” or (“HLC”) to target Plaintiff, whom Defendants know
lives in Hollywood, California.  Further,
the unverified complaint alleges that Defendants, both of whom reside in
Kentucky (Compl. ¶ 1), harassed Plaintiff, who “they knew to be in California”
(Compl. ¶ 3) through the livechat feature on YouTube, (Compl. ¶ 14).  Plaintiff also alleges Defendants republished
Plaintiff’s livestream content to defame Plaintiff (Compl. ¶ 15) and threatened
Plaintiff (Compl. ¶ 37.)
 
However, “posting defamatory statements about a person [online], while
knowing that person resides in the forum state, is insufficient in itself to
create the minimum contacts necessary to support specific personal jurisdiction
in a lawsuit arising out of that posting. Instead, it is necessary that the
nonresident defendant not only intentionally post the statements [online], but
that the defendant expressly aim or specifically direct his or her intentional
conduct at the forum, rather than at a plaintiff who lives there.”  (Burdick v. Superior Court (2015) 233
Cal.App.4th 8, 13.)  But evidence that
social media messages were aimed at a California audience can suffice to
establish personal jurisdiction.  (Zehia
v. Superior Court (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 543, 557.)
 
But Plaintiff has not proffered any evidence that Defendants’ online
content was specifically aimed at a California audience.  Moreover, the allegations of the Complaint
belie any such inference: “For the first 6 weeks, I was naive to the events
being coordinated and executed against me. I was being harassed, provoked, and
manipulated by professional cyberstalkers.” 
(Compl. ¶ 14.)  In short, the
Court finds that there is no evidence suggesting that Defendants’ conduct was
aimed at a California audience
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            The Court finds that Plaintiff has
failed to meet his burden of proof to establish minimum contacts exist between Defendants
and the forum state of California to justify imposition of personal
jurisdiction on Defendants.  Accordingly,
the Court grants Specially Appearing Defendants’ Motion to Quash quashing the
service of the summons and complaint, and orders the action dismissed as to
Defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction. 
  
 
            The
Clerk of the Court shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling.
