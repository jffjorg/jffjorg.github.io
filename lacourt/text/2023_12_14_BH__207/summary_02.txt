And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for summary adjudication. The defendant's notice of motion and separate statement of undisputed material facts did not specify the cause of action, issue of duty, affirmative defense, or claim for damages that the defendant is seeking to have adjudicated. The California Rules of Court require that the notice of motion and separate statement specify which causes of action or defenses are being sought. The judge notes that the defendant's brief and declaration contain a typo, but this does not affect the court's decision. The motion is denied due to the procedural defects.
