[1] “If summary adjudication is sought, whether separately
or as an alternative to the motion for summary judgment, the specific cause of
action, affirmative defense, claims for damages, or issues of duty must
be stated specifically in the notice of motion and be repeated,
verbatim, in the separate statement of undisputed material facts.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(b),
emphasis added; see also Cal. Rules of 
Court, rule 3.1350(d) [“The Separate Statement of Undisputed Material
Facts in support of a motion must separately identify: (A) Each cause of
action, claim for damages, issue of duty or affirmative defense that is the
subject of the motion”].)  In short, “the
notice must identify the causes of action or defenses to which the motion is
directed.”  (Weil & Brown, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 10:87, p.
10-36 (citing Sequoia Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th
1472); accord Schmidlin v. City of Palo Alto (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 728,
743–744 [“A motion for summary adjudication tenders only those issues or causes
of action specified in the notice of motion, and may only be granted as to the
matters thus specified”.)  
 
Here, neither Defendant’s notice of motion nor Defendant’s
Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts complies with the California
Rules of Court regarding Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication.  The cause of action, issue of duty,
affirmative defense or claim for damages for which Defendant seeks summary
adjudication are not specifically denoted in the notice of motion or separate
statement.   
 
Consequently, due to the procedural defects, the Court
denies the summary adjudication motion filed by Plaintiff. 


[2] The Court notes an apparent typo in Defendant’s
briefing and the DeArcus declaration. 
Exhibit B indicates that Plaintiff paid her bill at 3:58 p.m. not 3:48
p.m.
