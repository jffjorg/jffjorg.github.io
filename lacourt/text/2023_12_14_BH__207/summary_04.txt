And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer. The court finds that the plaintiff did not adequately meet and confer with the defendant before filing the motion, and that the motion is untimely. Additionally, the court finds that the plaintiff's motion exceeds the page limitation and that the relief requested is not properly sought through a motion to strike. The court also notes that the issues raised by the plaintiff are substantive and go beyond the scope of a motion to strike.
