Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to strike in part, striking certain portions of the complaint. The judge has denied the motion to strike in part, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleges facts that could imply the defendant's conscious disregard of the plaintiffs' rights and safety.

The judge has granted leave to amend the complaint to plead attorney's fees, finding that the current pleading does not sufficiently allege the basis for recovering attorney's fees.

The judge has concluded that the defendant's conduct, including its alleged bad faith handling of the insurance claim, constitutes a breach of contract and a violation of the California Insurance Code.

The judge has found that the complaint sufficiently alleges facts that could imply the defendant's conscious disregard of the plaintiffs' rights and safety, and therefore denies the motion to strike as to punitive damages.

The judge has granted the motion to strike as to attorney's fees, finding that the current pleading does not sufficiently allege the basis for recovering attorney's fees.
