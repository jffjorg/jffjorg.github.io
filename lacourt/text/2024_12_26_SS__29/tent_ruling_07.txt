 Case Number:  23STCV30214    Hearing Date:   December 26, 2024    Dept:  29 Insurance Company of the West v. Bistagne
Brother’s Body Shop
23STCV30214
Defendant’s Demurrer
Tentative
The demurrer is overruled in part and sustained
in part with leave to amend.
Background
On December 11, 2023, Insurance Company of
the West (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Bistagne Brother’s Body Shop and
Does 1 through 50.  
On December 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Thomas P. Otis (“Otis”); Bistagne Brother’s
Body Shop, Inc. (“Bistagne”); and Does 1 through 50.  In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges (among other
things) that it was the workers’ compensation carrier for the Petersen
Automotive Museum, the employer of Marquise Lewis (“Lewis”); that on December
11, 2021, Otis shot Lewis while he was working as a security guard at the
museum; that Plaintiff paid workers’ compensation benefits to Lewis; that Otis
(among others) was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the
shooting; and that both Otis and Bistagne are responsible for the injury to
Lewis. (FAC, ¶¶ 2, 4, 8, 9, 11.) 
Plaintiff asserts causes of action in the FAC for negligence and
premises liability. 
On November 22,
2024, Bistagne filed this demurrer. Plaintiff filed an opposition on December
11, and Bistagne filed a reply on December 18.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 provides:
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been
filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the
pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.
(c) There is another action pending between the same
parties on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,
“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.”
A
general demurrer under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e),
tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747; see also 1 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial [2024], ¶ 7:40.)
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.  We also consider matters which may
be judicially noticed.”  (Centinela
Freeman Emergency Medical Associates v. Health Net of California (2016) 1
Cal.5th 994, 1010; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; accord Yvanova
v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th
96, 104.)  All reasonable inferences must
be drawn in favor of the pleading.  (Schifando
v. City of Los Angeles (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 104.)  Even “improbable” facts alleged in the
pleading must be accepted as true.  (Marina
Pacific Hotel and Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at pp. 104-105.)
Courts must “liberally construe the pleading” and “give the
complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in
context.”  (Id. at p. 105.)
A complaint must contain a “statement of facts constituting
the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10, subd. (a)(1); see
also C.A. v. William S. Hart High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861,
872 [“the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of
action”].)  Ordinarily, a complaint “is
sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than evidentiary facts.”  (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42
Cal.4th 531, 550.)  Ultimate facts are
those upon which “the right to recover depends” and are “essential” to the
cause of action.  (Estes v. Eaton
Corp. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 636, 643 fn. 2; see also 1 Weil & Brown, supra,
¶ 6:124.)
A plaintiff is required to plead only “the essential facts of [its]
case” that are sufficient “to acquaint a defendant with the nature, source and
extent of [the] cause of action.”  (Doe,
supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 550.)  Mere
boilerplate or pleading of legal conclusions is not sufficient.  (Id. at p. 551 fn. 5.)  But a plaintiff need not allege “each
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of plaintiff’s proof” at
trial.  (C.A., supra, 53 Cal.4th at
p. 872.)
A demurrer can be sustained only when it
disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
Leave to amend should be granted when “there is a
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.”  (Centinela Freeman, supra, 1 Cal.5th
at p. 1010; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Shaeffer v. Califia
Farms (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 1125, 1145.)
Meet and Confer Requirement
Before filing a demurrer, the parties
must meet and confer.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).)  That
requirement is satisfied here.  (Attal Decl.,
¶ 2.)
 Discussion
In the FAC, Plaintiff asserts causes of action for negligence
and premises liability.  The basic elements of a cause of action for
negligence and for premises liability are the same: (1) the existence of a
legal duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages.
(Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v.
Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)
 
Defendant demurs to both causes of action.  The Court considers each in turn.
 
Negligence
 
The Court has reviewed the allegations in the FAC and concludes
that the Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded a cause of action for
negligence.  Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant Otis committed a tort, that Plaintiff was injured as a result, and
that Defendant Otis committed the tort while acting within the course and scope
of his employment with Defendant Bistagne. 
(FAC, ¶¶ 4, 8, 11.)
 
The FAC contains a sufficient pleading of the ultimate
facts, which of course the Court must accept as true on demurrer.  
 
The Court understands that Defendant Bistagne may well
contest Plaintiff’s allegations. 
Bistagne may contend, for example, that the tort occurred as a result of
a personal dispute between Lewis and Otis; that Otis was not an employee of
Bistagne; or that Otis was not acting within the course and scope of the employment
relationship when he committed the tort. 
None of that, however, can properly adjudicated on demurrer.
 
Bistagne argues that the pleading of course and scope in
the FAC is impermissible boilerplate, citing Moore v. Regents of University
of California (1990) 51 Cal.3d 120, 134 fn. 12.  But this case, unlike Moore, involves
a simple tort: Otis either was or was not acting within the scope of his
employment at the time that Otis (allegedly) committed the tort, and that can
be resolved only on the facts, not on the pleadings.  In Moore, in contrast, plaintiff alleged that
cells from his body had been used for potentially lucrative medical research
without his permission, and the boilerplate allegations that every defendant
acted within the course and scope of an employment or agency relationship with
every other defendant was deemed to be insufficient. 
 
In the alternative, Bistagne demurs on the
ground of uncertainty.  Demurrers for uncertainty are “disfavored” and will be
sustained “only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot
reasonably respond.”  (A.J. Fistes
Corp. v. GDL Best Contractors (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695.)  A complaint need not be “a model of clarity”
and must only contain sufficient allegations to put the defendants on notice of
the claims against them.  (Id.)  As the Court of Appeal has observed, “where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, … ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury
v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; see also 1 Weil
& Brown, supra, ¶¶7:85-7:86.)
 
Here,
the FAC is not incomprehensible; Bistagne can reasonably respond.  That is particularly true given that Bistagne
presumably has access to the critical facts, including whether Bistagne ever
employed Otis, when the employment relationship (if any) began and ended, and
what was the nature and scope of the employment relationship (if any).  
Bistagne’s
demurrer to the First Cause of Action in the FAC (for negligence) is overruled.
Premises
Liability
As noted above, the basis elements of a cause of action
for premises liability are the same as for negligence.  But that does not mean that the causes of
action are identical or duplicative.  In
a negligence cause of action, the relevant duty is (in general) the duty under
Civil Code section 1714 of every person “to exercise, in his or
her activities, reasonable care for the safety of others.” (Brown, supra, 11
Cal.5th at p. 214.)  In a premises
liability cause of action, however, the duty is more specific: it is the duty, for
those who own, possess, or
control property, to exercise ordinary care in managing the property to avoid
exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm. (Ortega v. Kmart Corp.
(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1205; Alcaraz v. Vece (1997) 14 Cal.4th 1149,
1159-1163, 1170-1171; Annocki v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC (2014) 232
Cal.App.4th 32, 37.)
 
Here, the FAC is silent as to what relationship (if any) Defendant
Bistagne had to the premises on which Lewis was injured.  If the tort occurred on property that
Bistagne owned, operated, or controlled, then there could be a potential for a
premises liability cause of action.  But
if Bistagne did not own, operate, or control the property, then there does not
appear to be a basis for Plaintiff’s premises liability cause of action.
 
One of the ultimate facts that must be alleged in a premises
liability cause of action is the element of ownership, operation, or
control.  Plaintiff has not alleged this
ultimate fact.  Indeed, Plaintiff does
not allege in the FAC any relationship of any kind between Bistagne and the premises
on which the tort occurred.  
 
Accordingly, Bistagne’s demurrer to the Second Cause of Action
(for premises liability) is sustained.
 
As this is the first time that the pleading has been challenged,
and as the pleading defect is one that may reasonably be cured by greater
specificity as to the relationship between Defendant Bistagne and the premises,
leave to amend is granted.
