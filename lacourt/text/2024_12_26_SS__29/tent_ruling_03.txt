 Case Number:  22STCV21562    Hearing Date:   December 26, 2024    Dept:  29 Privado v. Aultman
22STCV21562
Motion to Quash filed by Cross-Defendant
Michael W. Chu, M.D.
Tentative
The Court will call this matter.
Background
On July 1, 2022, Plaintiff Kem Privado (“Plaintiff”) filed the
complaint in this action against Defendants Eric Daniel Aultman (“Defendant”)
and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence
and general negligence arising out of an alleged accident on July 8, 2020, at
or near 9020 South Aviation Boulevard in Inglewood, California.
On December 9, 2022, Defendant filed an answer.
On filing, the case was assigned a trial date of December 29,
2023.
In November 2023, the Court, on the stipulation of the
parties, continued the trial date to February 21, 2024; discovery, however,
remained closed.
On December 1, 2023, Defendant filed a cross-complaint against
Michael W. Chu (“Chu”) and Roes 1 through 20. 
In the cross-complaint, Defendant alleges (among other things) that
Chu’s negligence in providing medical treatment to Plaintiff caused,
contributed to, and/or exacerbated Plaintiff’s injuries.
On February 2, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for leave to
file the (already filed) cross-complaint. 
The hearing on the motion was set for May 7, 2024.
On February 6, 2024, Defendant filed a notice of stay of
proceedings based on Defendant’s filing of a bankruptcy petition in the
Northern District of Texas.  The Court in
this action stayed the action, vacated all hearing dates, and set a status
conference for August 5, 2024.
On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice that Defendant’s
bankruptcy case was closed and Defendant had received a discharge.
On August 5, 2024, the Court held a status conference and set
the matter for trial on December 4, 2024.
On the same day, August 5, 2024, Defendant filed a declaration
stating that Cross-Defendant Chu was served, by substituted service, on
February 2, 2024.
On September 6, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for leave to
file the (already filed) cross-complaint. 
The hearing was set October 3, 2024. 
The motion was withdrawn by the moving party on September 30.
On October 9, 2024, Defendant filed another motion for leave
to file the (already filed) cross-complaint. 
The hearing was set for November 6.
On November 6, 2024, the Court denied the motion for
leave.  As set forth in the Minute Order,
the Court noted that the complaint had already been filed, had not been
stricken, and was not subject to any pending motion to strike.
On November 20, 2024, the Court held a Final Status
Conference.  Counsel for Plaintiff and
Defendant attended, as did counsel for specially appearing Cross-Defendant
Chu.  The Court continued the Status
Conference to December 2 and advised counsel that the case remained on calendar
for trial on December 4.
Also on November 20, Cross-Defendant Chu filed an ex parte
application to quash service of the summons of the cross-complaint.  On November 22, the Court denied the
application without prejudice to Cross-Defendant filing a noticed motion.  
The Court also, on its own motion set an Order to Show Cause
Why the Court Should Not Bifurcate or Sever the Cross-Complaint for a Separate
Trial.  The Court set a briefing schedule
and set the OSC for hearing on December 3, 2024.
After receiving briefing, the Court, at a hearing on December
3, bifurcated this action and set the cross-complaint for a separate
trial.  
On December 4, Plaintiff and Defendant appeared for
trial.  No trial courtroom was
available.  Trial was continued to
January 7, 2025.
As it relates to the matter on calendar for
December 26, 2024, Cross-Defendant Chu filed a motion to quash service of the
summons or, in the alternative, continue trial on November 25, 2024.
No opposition was filed.
Discussion
The Court will hear from counsel.  
It is unclear to the Court whether Defendant
opposes the motion to quash. 
It is unclear to the Court whether a motion
to quash is the correct vehicle to obtain relief (as opposed to a motion to
strike).  A motion to quash service of
the summons is used to challenge the jurisdiction of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a).)  Here, Cross-Defendant Chu is not arguing that
the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over him or that the service of the summons
was not properly effected.  Instead, he
is arguing that there was a procedural defect in that Defendant should have
sought, but failed to seek, leave to file the cross-complaint.
Furthermore, given that the Court has already
(essentially) granted the alternative relief requested by Chu – a continuance
of the trial, or at least the portion of the trial relating to the causes of
action asserted against him in the cross-complaint – it is unclear to the Court
whether the motion is, for practical purposes, moot.
Conclusion
The Court will hear from counsel.
