Significant Statements:

  - Given that the Court has already granted the alternative relief requested by Chu – a continuance of the trial, or at least the portion of the trial relating to the causes of action asserted against him in the cross-complaint – it is unclear to the Court whether the motion is, for practical purposes, moot.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to quash service of summons filed by Cross-Defendant Michael W. Chu, M.D. The motion was filed on November 20, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The judge is unclear whether Defendant Eric Daniel Aultman opposes the motion. The judge also notes that it is unclear whether a motion to quash is the correct vehicle to obtain relief, as Cross-Defendant Chu is not arguing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him or that the service of the summons was not properly effected. Instead, he is arguing that there was a procedural defect in that Defendant should have sought, but failed to seek, leave to file the cross-complaint. The judge has already granted the alternative relief requested by Chu – a continuance of the trial, or at least the portion of the trial relating to the causes of action asserted against him in the cross-complaint. Therefore, it is unclear to the judge whether the motion is, for practical purposes, moot. The judge will hear from counsel before making a decision.
