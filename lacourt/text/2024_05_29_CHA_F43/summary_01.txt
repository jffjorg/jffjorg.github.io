  - "If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse." (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992)
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 262, 279-280)

The court finds that the plaintiff has no intention of further litigating the case and that terminating sanctions are appropriate. The judge notes that the plaintiff has failed to respond to discovery requests, failed to oppose defendant's motions to compel, and disobeyed court orders. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010(d) and 2023.030(d) in support of its decision.
