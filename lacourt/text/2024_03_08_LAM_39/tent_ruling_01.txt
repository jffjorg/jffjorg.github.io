filed a motion for summary judgment, which is set for hearing on March 28,
2024.  Plaintiff filed a motion for leave
to file an amended complaint, which is set for hearing on June 10, 2024.  The parties’ trial is set for July 9, 2024.

orders as follows:
 
1.         The
ex parte application is granted in part and denied in part.  
 
2.         The
Court advances and continues the hearing on Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment from March 28, 2024, to June 10, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 

3.         The
ex parte application is denied in all other respects.
 
4.         Plaintiff’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
