 Case Number:  21STCV29330    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  30 MAJORLIE HURTADO, et al. vs WU CHUNHUA, et al.TENTATIVE Defendant’s motion for sanctions pursuant to CCP section 128.7 is DENIED. Plaintiff to give notice.Legal StandardCCP section 128.7 states that a court may impose sanctions on a party or attorney that presents a pleading, petition, motion, or other similar papers in the following circumstances:1) the document is presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.3) the allegations and other factual contentions have no evidentiary support;4) the denials of factual contentions are not warranted on the evidence.CCP section 128.7 permits the Court to impose monetary sanctions on an attorney or an unrepresented party that violates any one of these requirements. (Eichenbaum v. Alon (2003) 106 Cal App 4th 967, 976.) In addition, section 128.7 does not require a finding of subjective bad faith; instead it requires only that the Court find that the conduct be objectively unreasonable. (In re Marriage of Reese & Guy (1999) 73 Cal. App. 4th 1214, 1221.)Under section 128.7, a court may impose sanctions if it concludes a pleading was filed for an improper purpose or was indisputably without merit, either legally or factually. (Bucur v. Ahmad (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 175, 189–190.) A claim is factually frivolous if it is “not well grounded in fact” and is legally frivolous if it is “not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.” (Ibid.) In either case, to obtain sanctions, the moving party must show the party's conduct in asserting the claim was objectively unreasonable. (Ibid.) A claim is objectively unreasonable if “any reasonable attorney would agree that [it] is totally and completely without merit.” (Ibid.) However, “section 128.7 sanctions should be ‘made with restraint’ [Citation], and are not mandatory even if a claim is frivolous.” (Peake v. Underwood (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 428. at 448.)After notice and a hearing, a court may impose sanctions on an attorney, law firm, or party that violates Code Civ. Proc., section 128.7(b), subject to the “safe harbor” conditions specified in Code Civ. Proc., section 128.7(c). (Id.; Optimal Markets, Inc. v. Salant (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 912, 920.) A motion for sanctions under Code Civ. Proc., section 128.7 must be made separately from other motions and “shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate subdivision (b).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7(c)(1).) A party seeking sanctions under Code Civ. Proc., section 128.7, follows a two-step procedure. (Optimal, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th at p. 920.)First, the moving party serves notice of the motion for sanctions on the offending party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7(c)(1).) Service of the motion starts a safe harbor period during which the motion cannot be filed with the court. (Id.) If the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation or denial is not withdrawn or corrected within 21 days, the second step is to file or present the motion for sanctions to the court (i.e., presentment). (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7(c)(2).)“This permits a party to withdraw a questionable pleading without penalty, thus saving the court and the parties time and money litigating the pleading as well as the sanctions request. [Citations.]” (Optimal, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th at p. 920.) “While section 128.7 does allow for reimbursement of expenses, including attorney fees, its primary purpose is to deter filing abuses, not to compensate those affected by them. It requires the court to limit sanctions ‘to what is sufficient to deter repetition of [the sanctionable] conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.’ [Citations.]” (Id. at pp. 920–921.)DiscussionDefendant moves for sanctions under CCP section 128.7 arguing that Plaintiff’s counsel filed the complaint against it without evidentiary support.Defendant has complied with the 21-day safe harbor provisions under CCP sections 128.5 and 128.7. (Minor Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. C.)However, the motion is denied. First, sanctions under CCP section 128.7 are not mandatory. “[S]ection 128.7 sanctions should be ‘made with restraint’ [Citation], and are not mandatory even if a claim is frivolous.” (Peake v. Underwood (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 428. at 448.)Second, the Court finds that the record does not reflect an adequate basis for a finding that the complaint is frivolous to warrant sanctions of any kind under Section 128.7.Counsel for Plaintiffs argues that it believed that the home was rented through Airbnb based on information from attendees at the party held at the subject property as well as online news publications. While Defendant has produced a declaration by one of its employees that attests that the property was not reserved on the date of Decedent’s death, Plaintiff has not had an opportunity to conduct discovery. Plaintiff’s counsel specifically suggested that the parties enter into a stipulation wherein Plaintiffs would voluntarily dismiss Defendant without prejudice, but would have the right to bring Defendant back into the action, without leave of Court, in the event that discovery revealed that Defendant did in fact rent the subject property on the date of Decedent’s death and/or had it on its rental platform. This proposal was met with a refusal and an all-or-nothing dismissal of Defendant.Lastly, Defendant has not given adequate notice as to its request for monetary sanctions in the notice of motion. Code of Civil Procedure Section 2023.040 states: “A request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought.” The notice of motion fails to do so.
