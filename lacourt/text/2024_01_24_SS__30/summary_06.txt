The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to compel responses to discovery requests and a request for sanctions. The defendants, including the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Francisco Javier Martinez, served discovery requests on the plaintiff, Jose Quintanilla, on November 8, 2022. Despite proper service, Quintanilla has failed to provide any responses. As a result, the judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel responses to the discovery requests, ordering Quintanilla to provide verified responses without objections within 20 days. The judge has also denied the defendants' request for sanctions, as the motion was not opposed by Quintanilla.
