  - "The statute of limitations on a cause of action for negligence is two years."
  - "Viewing the allegations of the FAC liberally and in context, Plaintiff’s allegations regarding when she found out about her injuries are sufficient, at this stage of the proceedings, to constitute facts regarding the time and manner of discovery and her inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer is overruled and the plaintiff is entitled to proceed with their complaint. The court found that the plaintiff's allegations regarding the discovery of their injuries were sufficient to constitute facts regarding the time and manner of discovery and their inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence. The court also found that the plaintiff's cause of action for negligence was not time-barred, as the statute of limitations was tolled under Emergency Rule 9. The court noted that the plaintiff will be required to prove that their claims are not barred by the statute of limitations at a later point in the proceedings with evidence, but for now, the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action.
