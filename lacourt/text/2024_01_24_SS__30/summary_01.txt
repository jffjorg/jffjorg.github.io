And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the parties. The motion to challenge the good faith settlement determination is partly denied and partly granted. The application for good faith settlement is granted, except as to the cause of action for statutory indemnity. The motion for summary judgment is continued.

The judge found that Pinnacle Investment Management, LLC and Pinnacle Redondo LLC (Pinnacle) had met their burden to prove that there had been a settlement, and therefore the burden shifted to Pacific Bell to show that the settlement was not made in good faith. Pacific Bell argued that the settlement was not made in good faith because it was not personally served, but the judge found that Pinnacle had provided proof of personal service, and Pacific Bell had not argued further on this point.

Pacific Bell also argued that the settlement was not made in good faith because the Pinnacle Defendants are the owner and property manager of the apartment complex adjacent to the location where the alleged trip and fall occurred, and therefore they are the primary tortfeasors. However, the judge disagreed, finding that the Pinnacle Defendants may not have had any liability because the sidewalk was not their property, and there was no evidence presented to show that they created the alleged dangerous condition or exercised control over it.

The judge also found that Pacific Bell failed to meet its burden to establish that the settlement was not made in good faith because the settlement amount is reasonable and not "out of the ballpark" in relation to Pacific Bell's proportionate share of Plaintiff's known damages.

Finally, the judge continued the motion for summary judgment, finding that Plaintiff had established that obtaining a person most qualified (PMQ) regarding the subject vault may show whether or not the City of Inglewood controlled the vault, and that additional time is needed to obtain this information.
