And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to undergo an additional independent medical examination (IME) with Dr. Ludwig. The plaintiff had previously undergone an IME with an orthopedist, but the defendant argues that a neurologist is needed to examine the plaintiff's complaints of concussion, post concussive syndrome, and vision issues. The court finds that there is good cause to compel the plaintiff to submit to the additional IME, despite the plaintiff's concerns about her pregnancy and due date. The court encourages the parties to meet and confer to accommodate the plaintiff's medical condition before serving notice of the IME. The plaintiff is ordered to submit to the additional IME upon a duly served notice.
