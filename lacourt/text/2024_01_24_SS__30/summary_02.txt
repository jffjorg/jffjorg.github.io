The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for sanctions filed by the Defendant, WU CHUNHUA, et al. The Defendant argues that the complaint filed by the Plaintiff, MAJORLIE HURTADO, et al. is frivolous and lacks evidentiary support. The judge denies the motion, finding that sanctions under CCP section 128.7 are not mandatory and that the record does not reflect an adequate basis for a finding that the complaint is frivolous. The judge notes that the Defendant has not given adequate notice of its request for monetary sanctions and that the motion is denied. The case will proceed, with the Plaintiff's counsel having suggested a stipulation that would allow the parties to resolve the matter without prejudice.
