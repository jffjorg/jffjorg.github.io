Pinnacle’s burden in moving for good faith determination is to prove there has been a settlement. (See Franklin Mint Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1558; see also Mattco Forge, Inc. v.Arthur Young & Company (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1350 n.6; and City of Grand View Terrace, supra, 192 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1260-1261.) Pinnacle provides it reached a settlement with Plaintiff for $35,000. (Kramer Decl., Exh. A.) Because Pinnacle met this moving burden, the burden shifts to Pacific Bell to show the settlement was not in good faith. (Mattco, 38 Cal.App.4th at 1350 n.6; CCP 877.6. [“The party asserting lack of good faith shall have the burden of proof on that issue.”].)Pacific Bell filed a motion to challenge the application. First it argues that the application was not personally served.The notice, application, and proposed order shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service. Proof of service shall be filed with the court. Within 25 days of the mailing of the notice, application, and proposed order, or within 20 days of personal service, a nonsettling party may file a notice of motion to contest the good faith of the settlement. If none of the nonsettling parties files a motion within 25 days of mailing of the notice, application, and proposed order, or within 20 days of personal service, the court may approve the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(2).)However, the Court notes that Pinnacle has filed proof of service showing the application was personally served after Pacific Bell filed its motion to contest the settlement. Pacific Bell has not argued anything further regarding being personally served. Thus, the Court finds that Pacific Bell has been personally served with the application.Next, Pacific Bell argues that the Pinnacle Defendants are the owner and property manager of the apartment complex adjacent to the location where the alleged trip and fall occurred. As such, Pacific Bell argues the trier of fact will likely find that the Pinnacle Defendants are the primary tortfeasors. The Court disagrees. While abutting property owners have a duty to maintain and repair defects in the sidewalk, pursuant to the Sidewalk Accident Decisions Doctrine, abutting property owners are only liable to the public where the property owner created the defect or exercised dominion or control over the abutting sidewalk. (Jordan, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 1490-91 (“[Section 5610] imposes a duty of repair on the abutting property owners for defects in sidewalks, regardless of who created the defects, but does not of itself create tort liability to injured pedestrians or a duty to indemnify municipalities, except where a property owner created the defect or exercised dominion or control over the abutting sidewalk.” (emphasis in original)); see also Jones, supra, 152 Cal.App.3d at 802-03.) Because the sidewalk was not Pinnacle’s property, and there is no evidence presented to show that Pinnacle created the alleged dangerous condition or exercised control over it, a trier of fact may find that Pinnacle had no liability. Further, it was Pacific Bell’s utility vault that Plaintiff alleges caused her to fall.Pacific Bell argues that a rough approximation of Plaintiff’s total recovery can be made from the $2.5 million global demand that Plaintiff’s attorney made to all defendants on September 8, 2023. (McGreevy Decl., ¶ 6 & Ex. E.) The Court disagrees. There may be strategic reasons for making a demand to settle, and Pacific Bell cites to no authority for the contention that the settlement demand may be used in order to determine Plaintiff’s approximate recovery.Pacific Bell provides evidence that states Plaintiff’s total medical specials are not less than $228,188.76, and that her treatment is ongoing. (Id., Ex. A 9:19 – 12:19, Form Interrogatory No. 6.4.) Plaintiff also states that she will likely need a future knee surgery, future physical therapy, and that she may lose future income as a result of the Subject Incident. (Id., Ex. A 13:23 – 14:16, Form Interrogatory No. 6.7, & 16:4-21, Form Interrogatory No. 8.8.) However, the amount of such future medical expenses is not listed. Further, the claims that Plaintiff may lose future income or may need surgery shows that these damages are merely speculative at this time.The Court finds that Pacific Bell has not shown that Pinnacle’s settlement agreement with Plaintiff for $35,000 is so far out of the ballpark in relation to its proportionate share of Plaintiff’s known damages at the time of settlement, i.e., $228,188.76, because the proposed settlement represents approximately 12% of Plaintiff’s known medical specials. Settlements have been upheld as being in good faith in cases with a $25,000 settlement in a $5 million case, a $30,000 settlement in a $1 million case, a $65,000 settlement in a $7 million case, and a $50,000 settlement in a $1.425 million case. (See Cahill v. San Diego Gas & Elec. Co. (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 939, 968 [citing Bay Development, Ltd. v. Superior Court (1990) 50 Cal.3d 1012; Wysong & Miles Co. v. Western Industrial Movers (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 278; Wilshire Ins. Co. v. Tuff Boy Holding, Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 627].)Pacific Bell further argues Pinnacle failed to provide evidence of its financial condition and insurance policy limits. However, recent authority provides no such evidence is required. (Cahill v. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 939, 968 (“As SDGE notes, in support of their section 877.6 motion, Owners did not present any evidence of their financial condition or liability insurance policy limits. However, that omission did not preclude the trial court from finding the April 2009 settlement was made in good faith. Tech–Bilt does not require settling defendants to present such evidence.” (citation omitted)).) Additionally, in light of Pinnacle’s potential liability, the settlement amount is reasonable “without ‘discounting’ that amount based on any purported financial insolvency or insurance limitations.” (Ibid.)The Court finds Pacific Bell failed to meet its burden to establish the settlement was not made in good faith. Thus, the motion is denied with an important exception.Pacific Bell’s third cause of action is a statutory claim. Regardless of its merit, the third cause of action is not subject to dismissal even if the settlement is deemed in good faith. CCP §877.6(c) only applies to claims against the settling tortfeasor or co-obligor for “equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.”  As such, the third cause of action remains.MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENTDiscussionDefendant City of Inglewood moves for summary judgment, on the grounds that it did not own, possess, or control the vault and metal plate which caused Plaintiff to fall.Plaintiff requests a continuance to allow Plaintiff to take the deposition of Pacific Bell’s person most qualified (PMQ) to discover who controls the vault.CCP section 437c(h) provides that: “If it appears from the affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, or both, that facts essential to justify opposition may exist but cannot, for reasons stated, be presented, the court shall deny the motion, order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be had, or make any other order as may be just. The application to continue the motion to obtain necessary discovery may also be made by ex parte motion at any time on or before the date the opposition response to the motion is due.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(h).) A summary judgment is a drastic measure which deprives the losing party of trial on the merits. (Bahl v. Bank of America (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 389, 395.) To mitigate this harshness, the drafters of CCP section 437c included a provision making continuances virtually mandated. (Id.)“The nonmoving party seeking a continuance must show: (1) the facts to be obtained are essential to opposing the motion; (2) there is reason to believe such facts may exist; and (3) the reasons why additional time is needed to obtain these facts. [Citations.]” (Wachs v. Curry (1993)13 Cal.App.4th 616, 623.) Where the opposing party submits an adequate affidavit showing that essential facts may exist but cannot be presented in a timely manner, the Court must either deny summary judgment or grant a continuance. (Dee v. Vintage Petroleum, Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 30, 34-35.)Here, the City has brought forth competent evidence that it did not own the metal plate nor the cement vault. Plaintiff’s counsel states in attempt to uncover who controls the subject utility vault, Plaintiff has requested the deposition of Pacific Bell’s PMQ. Pacific Bell has refused, despite multiple requests, to provide a deposition date. Hence, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel the deposition of PBTC's PMQ, but the soonest available hearing date was December 29, 2023—3 days after Plaintiff's Opposition is to be filed and served, i.e., December 26, 2023. (Pennel Decl., ¶ 3.) According to City of Inglewood’s Public Works Department’s Bureau of Engineering Employee, Raul Fernandez, the professional relationship between Pacific Bell Telephone Company and City of Inglewood would have been reflected in a franchise agreement that was entered into at some point. Most certainly, there are terms within that agreement that dictate which entity is responsible for construction, inspection, maintenance, repair, and removal of a utility vault such as the one in our case – that is, which entity has control over the vault.The Court finds that Plaintiff has established that obtaining a PMQ regarding the subject vault may show whether or not the City controlled the vault. Further, as Fernandez stated there should be a franchise agreement, it appears these facts may exist. Lastly, Plaintiff has established that additional time is needed because Pacific Bell had refused to produce a PMQ. The Court is unsure regarding the events that transpired subsequent to the Court granting the motion to compel.Moreover, even where an application fails to establish a mandatory right to a continuance pursuant to CCP § 437c, the court exercises its discretion to determine whether a continuance is nonetheless warranted by a showing of good cause. (Cooksey v. Alexakis (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 246, 254); Hamilton v. Orange County Sheriff’s Dept. (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 759; 765; Lerma v. County of Orange (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 709, 711-712; Chavez v. 24 Hour Fitness USA, Inc. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 632, 643-644.) Given the drastic nature of a motion for summary judgment, the Court additionally finds there is good cause to continue the motion for summary judgment here in order to allow Plaintiff to obtain a PMQ regarding the vault.Such continuance will necessitate a continuance of the trial date which can be addressed at this hearing with the agreement of the parties.
