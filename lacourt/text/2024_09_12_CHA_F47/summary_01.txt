The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The judge granted the joinder filed by Golden State Health Centers, Inc. and denied the demurrer and motion to strike. The plaintiff's complaint is sufficient to state the claims, and the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike are denied.

The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations of elder abuse and neglect, including fraudulent charting, failure to monitor the decedent's hydration, and withholding of necessary care and treatment, are sufficient to state the claims. The judge also found that the defendants' alleged ongoing pattern of failing to provide necessary care and treatment contributed to the decedent's death.

The judge also denied the defendants' motion to strike, finding that the plaintiff's claims for punitive damages and attorneys' fees are sufficient to state the claims.

The judge ordered the defendants to file their answers within 30 days.
