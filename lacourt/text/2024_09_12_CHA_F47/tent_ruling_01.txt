SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of the care and treatment provided
to Enriqueta Raymond (Decedent) at Defendant Sylmar Health & Rehabilitation
Center, Inc. dba Sylmar Health & Rehabilitation Center, erroneously served
as Sylmar Health & Rehabilitation Center, Inc. and as Sylmar Health &
Rehabilitation Center, (Sylmar Health/the Facility), a skilled nursing
facility.  Plaintiff Melvin Rosales,
individually and as heir and successor-in-interest to Enriqueta Raymond,
deceased  (Plaintiff) alleges that
Decedent was “admitted to the Facility for physical therapy, mental
rehabilitation, and other limiting conditions.”  (FAC ¶30).  Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that  Decedent arrived at Sylmar Health “with
critical needs arising from mental health irregularities and physical
limitations.”  (FAC ¶33).  Defendant David Slavin (Slavin) is alleged to
have worked for and served as an administrator for Sylmar Health and/or had
custodial obligations with respect to Decedent. 
(FAC ¶¶7-8).  Defendant Daniel Hrenciuc (Hrenciuc) is alleged to have worked for and
served as the director of nursing at Sylmar Health and/or had custodial
obligations with respect to Decedent.  (FAC
¶¶9-10).  
 
On 5/11/22, Plaintiff Melvin Rosales, Decedent’s son and
successor-in-interest (Plaintiff), filed this action against Sylmar Health,
Slavin, Hrenciuc, Golden State Health Centers, Inc. (Golden State) (collectively,
Defendants) and nominal defendant Gail Swalley (Decedent’s daughter) alleging
causes of action for: (1) Wrongful Death (Elder Abuse – Welfare &
Institutions Code 15600, et seq.); (2) Violations of Elder Abuse Act (Welfare
& Institutions Code 15600, et seq. – Survival Claim); (3) Violations of Health
& Safety Code 1430(b) (Survival Claim) and (4) Wrongful Death (Negligence).  After Plaintiff’s counsel failed to respond
to Defendants’ meet and confer efforts regarding issues Defendants’ had with
the complaint, on 11/3/23, Sylmar Health, Slavin and Hrenciuc filed and served a
demurrer to the entire complaint and motion to strike which sought to strike
portions of the complaint regarding attorneys’ fees and punitive damages.  Golden State joined in the demurrer and
motion to strike.  On 5/14/24, this Court
granted the joinder, sustained the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend and
placed the motion to strike off calendar as moot.  (See 5/14/24 Minute Order).  
 
On 6/17/24, Plaintiff filed the subject First Amended
Complaint alleging the same four causes of action as alleged in the original
complaint.  Again, after Plaintiff’s
counsel failed to respond to Defendant’s meet and confer efforts, on 7/24/24,
Sylmar Health, Slavin and Hrenciuc filed and served the instant demurrer to the
entire First Amended Complaint on the grounds that the pleading fails to allege
sufficient facts to state each cause of action and is uncertain.  (See Lee Decl.).  On the same date, Plaintiffs filed and served
the instant motion to strike which seeks to strike portions of the First
Amended Complaint regarding attorneys’ fees and punitive damages.  On 8/28/24, Golden State, represented by the
same counsel as the other Defendants, filed and served a joinder in the demurrer
and motion to strike.  No explanation is
provided as to why the joinder was filed and served more than a month after the
demurrer and motion to strike and less than 16 court days before the hearing
date.  See CCP 1005(b).  On 8/29/24, Plaintiff filed and served
oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike.  On 9/6/24, Defendants filed and served
untimely (by 1 court day) replies to the oppositions.  See CCP 1005(b).  Defendants provide no explanation or excuse
for the untimely filing and service of the replies.  Despite the untimely service and filing, the joinder
and replies were considered by the Court in ruling on the  demurrer and motion to strike.  See CRC 3.1300(d). 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is
granted.  
 
Immunity
 
CCP 430.41(b) provides: 
 
“A party demurring to a pleading
that has been amended after a demurrer to an earlier version of the pleading
was sustained shall not demur to any portion of the amended complaint,
cross-complaint, or answer on grounds that could have been raised by demurrer
to the earlier version of the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer.”
 
Defendants did not demur to the original complaint (which
alleged the same causes of action based on the same underlying facts) on the
ground they are immune from liability under the Federal Readiness and Emergency
Preparedness Act (PREP Act) 42 U.S.C. 247d-6d, 247d-63 and California
Government Code 8659.  (See
Demurrer to original complaint filed 11/3/23, generally).  As such, Defendants may not raise the issue
in this demurrer to the First Amended Complaint.  See CCP 430.41(b).
 
Even if the issue was properly raised at this time,
Defendants have failed to establish that as a matter of law the PREP Act
immunizes them from Plaintiff’s claims in this action.  
  
1st cause of action – Wrongful Death (Elder
Abuse – Welfare & Institutions Code 15600, et seq.) & 2nd
cause of action – Violations of Elder Abuse Act (Welfare & Institutions
Code 15600, et seq. – Survival Claim)
 
An elder abuse claim is a statutory cause of action and,
therefore, must be specifically pleaded. 
See Carter (2011) 198 CA4th 396, 406-407, 410; Covenant
Care, Inc. (2004) 32 C4th 771, 790.
 
To state a claim for elder abuse/neglect, under the Act, a
plaintiff must allege facts establishing that the defendant: (1) had
responsibility for meeting the basic needs of the elder or dependent adult,
such as nutrition, hydration, hygiene or medical care; (2) knew of conditions
that made the elder or dependent adult unable to provide for his or her own
basic needs; (3) denied or withheld goods or services necessary to meet the
elder or dependent adult’s basic needs, either with knowledge that injury was
substantially certain to befall the elder or dependent adult (if the plaintiff
alleges oppression, fraud or malice) or with conscious disregard of the high
probability of such injury (if recklessness is alleged); (4) the neglect caused
the elder or dependent adult to suffer physical harm, pain or mental suffering;
and (5) facts constituting neglect and establishing the causal link between the
neglect and the injury.  See Carter,
supra at 406-407.   More recently, it has been held that “neglect”
under the Act includes the “[f]ailure to protect from health and safety hazards”
as set forth in the language of the statute. 
Samantha B. (2002) 77 CA5th 85, 99; See also Fenimore
(2016) 245 CA4th 1339, 1347-1348.
 
In the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges sufficient
facts to support each of the elements enumerated in Carter against Sylmar
Health, a skilled nursing facility; Golden State, its licensee/owner/operator;
Slavin, its administrator; and Hrenciuc, its director of nursing (i.e.,
managing agents).  See Welfare
& Institutions Code 15657(c); Civil Code 3294(b).  For example, Plaintiff alleges: 
 
• Defendants engaged in fraudulent charting. (FAC
¶¶88(c), 104(c)). 
 
• Defendants were required to monitor Decedent for
dehydration and provide reminders and encouragement to Decedent when hydration
was required. Defendants were aware that failing to do so or withholding
reminders and/or encouragement placed Decedent at increased risk of
dehydration. Despite this notice, Defendants disregarded Decedent’s dehydration
risk, failed to monitor Decedent for signs and symptoms of dehydration,
withheld fluids, and caused Decedent to become dehydrated for a prolonged
period of time. Dehydration caused Decedent to become weak and compromised,
exacerbating Decedent’s susceptibility to further illnesses and infections and
eventually causing and contributing to Decedent’s death. (FAC ¶¶88(i)-(k),
104(i)-(k)). 
 
• Defendants were required to provide Decedent with, at
the very least, supervision with personal hygiene, bathing, and showers.
Defendants repeatedly failed to provide hygienic care, including showers. When
coupled with Decedent’s dehydration, Decedent developed a urinary tract
infection that contributed to her death. (FAC ¶¶88(l)-(n), 104(l)- (n)). 
 
• Defendants were required to assist with medications and
supplements according to physicians’ orders. Defendants repeatedly failed to
follow those orders and provide all prescribed medications and supplements.
Withholding those medications and supplements further compromised Decedent’s
health and caused Decedent to become vulnerable to complications, contributing
to and causing Decedent’s death. (FAC ¶¶88(o)-(q), 104(o)-(q)). 
 
• Defendants were required to protect Decedent from
health and safety hazards, which included infection prevention control.
Defendants failed to provide and withheld safe living conditions, causing
Decedent to contract COVID-19 and contributing to Decedent’s death. (FAC
¶¶88(r)-(s), 104(r)-(s)). 
 
• Defendants were ordered by Decedent’s physician to
transport Decedent to the emergency room if Decedent’s oxygen saturation fell
below a certain percentile. On more than one occasion, Defendants failed to
transport Decedent to the emergency room when her oxygen saturation fell below
the requisite percentile and withheld emergency treatment Decedent required.
(FAC ¶¶88(v)-(cc), 104(v)-(cc)).
 
Similarly, Plaintiff alleges sufficient facts to support causation
and the damage claims in the First Amended Complaint.  The First Amended Complaint includes facts
regarding instances where Defendants’ alleged ongoing pattern of failing to
provide Decedent with necessary care, monitoring and assistance led to physical
conditions that left Decedent a weakened and immunocompromised state.  (See FAC ¶¶39, 42, 88(k), 88(n),
88(q), 104(k), 104(n), 104(q)). 
Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants’ conduct, actions and/or omissions
contributed to, caused and/or were a substantial factor in causing specific
injuries alleged in the First Amended Complaint, and ultimately led to
Decedent’s death.  (See (FAC ¶¶39,
41-42, 61, 62, 64, 88(c), 88(k), 88(m)-(n), 88(q), 88(jj), 90, 92, 104(c), 104(k),
104(m)-(n), 104(q), 104(jj), 106, 108). 
 
3rd cause of action – Violations of Health
& Safety Code 1430(b) (Survival Claim)/Violation of Residents’ Bill of
Rights
 
Health & Safety Code 1430(b) provides for a civil
remedy for patients and residents of a skilled nursing facility or intermediate
care facility for violation of Patient Rights in Section 72527 of Title 22 of
the Code of Regulations, or any other right provided for by federal or state
law or regulation.  Section 72527
provides a list of 26 specific rights. 
 
The facts alleged regarding elder abuse/neglect claims,
which are incorporated into the 3rd cause of action, are also
sufficient to support a claim for violation of Health & Safety Code 1430(b).  (See FAC ¶¶109, 122-123, 126).
 
4th cause of action – Wrongful
Death/Negligence
 
The elements of a wrongful death cause of action are: (1)
a wrongful act or neglect on the part of one or more persons that (2) causes
(3) the death of another person.  Civil
Code 377.60; Barrett (1990) 222 CA3d 1176, 1185-1186.   The elements of a negligence cause of action
are: duty, breach, causation and damages. 
County of Santa Clara (2006) 137 CA4th 292, 318.  
 
The facts alleged in the general allegations and the
preceding causes of action, which are incorporated into the 4th
cause of action, along with the specific allegations contained within the
wrongful death/negligence claim are sufficient to state the claim.  (See FAC, generally, ¶¶131-137).
 
Motion to Strike
 
The same facts which sufficiently support the first three
causes of action are sufficient to support the claims for punitive damages and
attorney’s fees.   
 
CONCLUSION
 
The joinder is granted. 
The demurrer is overruled and the motion to strike is denied.  Answer(s) is/are due within 30 days.
