And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the defendants' motion to compel further responses to discovery. The defendants had served the discovery requests on September 25, 2023, and the plaintiff served objections on October 10, 2023. The discovery requests seek basic information and evidence supporting the plaintiff's claims. The court finds that the plaintiff's objections based on standing to serve discovery are meritless, as the defendant's proof of service shows service at the correct address. The court orders the plaintiff to serve further responses to the discovery requests without objection within 30 days of the ruling. The defendants' request for sanctions is denied.
