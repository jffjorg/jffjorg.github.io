Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Discovery
Moving Party: Defendants Masoud Koshki, Shlomo
Harari and P&J LaBrea, LLC
Responding Party: Plaintiff Arthur Edward Ezor
 
T/R:     DEFENDANTS’
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY IS GRANTED.
PLAINTIFF TO SERVE FURTHER RESPONSES TO THE SUBJECT DISCOVERY, WITHOUT
OBJECTION, WITHIN 30 DAYS OF NOTICE OF RULING.
DEFENDANTS TO
NOTICE.  
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers
and opposition. 
 
On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that an objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general. (CCP 2030.300(a)(3).) The
responding party has the burden of justifying the objections to the form
interrogatories (“FIs”) and special interrogatories (“SIs”).  (Coy v. Sup.Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210,
220-221.) 
 
The moving party on a motion to compel
further responses to requests for production of documents (“RPDs”) must submit
“specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
inspection demand.”  (CCP §
2031.310(b)(1).)  If the moving party has
shown good cause for the RPDs, the burden is on the objecting party to justify
the objections.  (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.)
 
Defendants move to compel further
responses to SIs, set two, and RPDs, set one, from Plaintiff. Defendants served
the discovery on September 25, 2023. Plaintiff served objections on October 10,
2023. The discovery seeks basic information and evidence supporting Plaintiff’s
claims. In opposition, Plaintiff represents that he did not receive service of
this motion. Plaintiff also argues that Defendants did not properly meet and
confer before filing this motion.
 
The information sought by the subject
requests is relevant and discoverable. Plaintiff’s objections based on standing
to serve discovery are meritless. Defendants’ proof of service shows service at
the correct address. The motion is GRANTED.
 
Defendants request monetary, evidence
and issue sanctions. Defendants do not provide a dollar amount of monetary
sanctions nor do they identify any specific evidence or issue sanctions.
Defendants’ request for sanctions is DENIED.
