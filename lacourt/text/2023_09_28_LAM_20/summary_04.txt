And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is granted, without leave to amend. The Plaintiffs, Milagro Anaya, Felipe Rosales Picaz, Jessica Pina, and Esperanza Torres, filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against the Defendants, Ygrene Energy Fund California, LLC, Energy Efficient Equity, Inc, and Does 1-100, FortiFi Financial, Inc, and California Municipal Finance Authority. The Plaintiffs allege a conspiracy amongst the Defendants to sign up persons for the PACE program, but failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before filing suit.

The Judge agrees with the Defendants that seeking the amounts associated with the tax liens or seeking cancellation of the liens relates to taxes, and that the Plaintiffs did not specifically allege that they submitted applications for a refund/cancellation before the auditor. The Plaintiffs' claims at issue either seek a tax refund or seek the cancellation of unpaid taxes, thus requiring that they have exhausted their administrative remedies.

The Judge's ruling is based on the PACE-authorizing statute, the Revenue and Taxation Code, and various court cases, including Templo v. State, Hanjin Int’l Corp. v. L.A. Cty. Metro. Transp. Auth., Morgan v. Ygrene Energy Fund, Inc., Williams & Fickett v. Cty. of Fresno, and Timothy Burke v. Renew Fin. Grp., Inc. The Judge notes that even if various liens have been released, that doesn’t change the fact that exhaustion is required for the recovery of taxes that have already been paid.
