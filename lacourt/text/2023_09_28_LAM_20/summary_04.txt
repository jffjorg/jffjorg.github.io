And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is granted, without leave to amend. The Plaintiffs, Milagro Anaya, Felipe Rosales Picaz, Jessica Pina, and Esperanza Torres, filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against the Defendants, Ygrene Energy Fund California, LLC, Energy Efficient Equity, Inc, and Does 1-100, FortiFi Financial, Inc, and California Municipal Finance Authority. The Plaintiffs allege a conspiracy amongst the Defendants to sign up persons for the PACE program, but failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before filing suit.

The Judge agrees with the Defendants that seeking the amounts associated with the tax liens or seeking cancellation of the liens relates to taxes, and that the Plaintiffs did not specifically allege that they submitted applications for a refund/cancellation before the auditor. The Plaintiffs' claims at issue either seek a tax refund or seek the cancellation of unpaid taxes, thus requiring that they have exhausted their administrative remedies.

The Judge's ruling is based on the PACE-authorizing statute, the Revenue and Taxation Code, and various court cases, including Templo v. State, Hanjin Int’l Corp. v. L.A. Cty. Metro. Transp. Auth., Morgan v. Ygrene Energy Fund, Inc., Williams & Fickett v. Cty. of Fresno, and Timothy Burke v. Renew Fin. Grp., Inc. The Judge notes that even if various liens have been released, that doesn’t change the fact that exhaustion is required for the recovery of taxes that have already been paid.

## English Summary:

The judge is considering a motion by Defendants FortiFi Financial, Inc. and California Municipal Finance Authority to dismiss the lawsuit filed by Plaintiffs Milagro Anaya, Felipe Rosales Picaz, Jessica Pina, and Esperanza Torres. The Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs did not properly exhaust their administrative remedies before filing suit.

The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants engaged in fraudulent practices to enroll them in a PACE program, resulting in special assessments on their properties. However, the judge notes that California law requires taxpayers to seek a refund or cancellation of taxes from the auditor before filing a lawsuit.

Although the Plaintiffs claim they have been "given the run-around" by government agencies regarding the cancellation of these assessments, they have not alleged that they specifically applied for a refund or cancellation before the auditor.

Therefore, based on the lack of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the judge is granting the Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissing the Plaintiffs' case without leave to amend.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the plaintiffs' claims without leave to amend. The judge found that the plaintiffs' claims, which seek a refund or cancellation of taxes, require exhaustion of administrative remedies, but the plaintiffs have not alleged that they have done so. The judge also noted that even if the liens have been released, the plaintiffs still need to exhaust their administrative remedies to recover the taxes that have already been paid. The judge granted the request for judicial notice and ordered the moving parties to give notice.
