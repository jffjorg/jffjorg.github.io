And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The plaintiff, Marvin Vivas, alleged that the defendant's Dental Center was negligent in performing a tooth extraction, resulting in nerve damage. However, the defendant presented evidence that all care and treatment rendered to Vivas was appropriate and within the standard of care. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to submit a separate statement of undisputed facts and did not provide any declarations to support his claims. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion. The judge instructed the parties to give notice of the tentative ruling and encouraged counsel to appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
