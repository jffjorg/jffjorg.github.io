And here is the summary in English text:

The hearing is scheduled for November 21, 2024, in the case of 23VECV00991, where the City of Los Angeles (Cross-Complainant) moved to tax the costs requested in the Memorandum of Costs filed by Michael Alan Jack and Kimberly Gordon (Cross-Defendants) on August 26, 2024. However, the court record shows that no such Cost Memo was filed on August 26, 2024 or at any other time. The court is prohibited from issuing advisory opinions on matters that are not ripe for review. Since no Cost Memo is filed, the issues presented in the motion are not ripe and no actual dispute is presented. Therefore, the motion to tax costs is denied as premature.
