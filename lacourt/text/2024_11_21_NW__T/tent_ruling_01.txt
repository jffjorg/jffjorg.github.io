  Case Number:  21VECV01101    Hearing Date:   November 21, 2024    Dept:  T 21VECV01101
Maclaughlin v Tasooji
Motion for
sanctions:  The court is considering
preventing Mr. May from testifying and prohibiting any evidence of his
involvement in this case, and prohibiting discussion or evidence concerning any
alteration to the Assessor’s map, along with monetary sanctions of $5,000.  The court does find that there was deception by
counsel and Mr. May, and an effort to cover up this interaction between Mr. May
and the County. 
Motion to limit testimony of Mr. Pallamary: The court considers the motion
as a motion in limine.  The court is considering
barring Mr. Pallamary from testifying about anything other than the issues
which were raised in the four County surveyor’s depositions and nothing else,
as specified by the court at the hearing on 9/25/2024.  Concerning the “opinions” on Exh. 14, pages
183-184, the court is unclear what his opinions are as to Nos. 1-13 because
they are not specifically stated.
