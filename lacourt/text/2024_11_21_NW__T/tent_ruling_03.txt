 Case Number:  23VECV00991    Hearing Date:   November 21, 2024    Dept:  T KAZEMI V CITY OF LA
23VECV00991
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Cross-Complainant City of Los Angeles’ Motion
to Tax Costs is DENIED because it is premature; no cost bill has been filed.
Introduction 
Cross-Complainant City of Los
Angeles (Cross-Complainant) moved to tax the costs requested in
Cross-Defendants Michael Alan Jack and Kimberly Gordon’s (Cross-Defendants)
Memorandum of Costs (Cost Memo) filed on August 26, 2024.
Procedure 
Despite both parties contention
that a Cost Memo was filed on August 26, 2024, the Court record reflects that
no such Cost Memo was filed on August 26, 2024 or any time before or after
August 26, 2024.  Courts are prohibited
from issuing advisory opinions on matters that are not ripe for review.  (Pacific Legal Found. v. Cal. Coastal
Commission (1982) 33 Cal.3d 158, 170; Denny’s, Inc. v. City of Agoura Hills
(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1312, 1329 n. 10; Hunt v. Superior Court (1999) 21
Cal.4th 984, 998; State Bd. of Educ. v. Honig (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 720,
743.)  “A controversy is not deemed ripe
for adjudication unless it arises from a genuine present clash of interests and
the operative facts are sufficiently definite to permit a particularistic
determination rather than a broad pronouncement rooted in abstractions.”  (O'Grady v. Superior Court (2006) 139
Cal.App.4th 1423, 1451.)  Because no Cost
Memo is filed, the issues presented in the motion are not ripe and no actual
dispute is presented.  
The motion to tax costs is DENIED
as not being premature.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
