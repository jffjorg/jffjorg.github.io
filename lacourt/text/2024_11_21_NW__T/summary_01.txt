And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering several motions ahead of the upcoming hearing on November 21, 2024. With regards to the motion for sanctions, the court is considering preventing Mr. May from testifying and prohibiting any evidence of his involvement in the case, as well as prohibiting discussion or evidence concerning any alteration to the Assessor's map, and imposing monetary sanctions of $5,000. This is due to the court's finding that there was deception by counsel and Mr. May, and an effort to cover up their interaction with the County. The court is also considering the motion to limit testimony of Mr. Pallamary, which it views as a motion in limine. The court is considering barring Mr. Pallamary from testifying about anything other than the issues raised in the four County surveyor's depositions and nothing else, as specified by the court at the hearing on September 25, 2024. Additionally, the court is unclear about Mr. Pallamary's opinions on Exhibit 14, pages 183-184, as they are not specifically stated.
