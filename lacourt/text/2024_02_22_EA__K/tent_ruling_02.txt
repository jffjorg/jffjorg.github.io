Section 458 provides as follows: “In pleading the Statute of Limitations it is not necessary to
state the facts showing the defense, but it may be stated generally that the
cause of action is barred by the provisions of Section ____ (giving the number
of the section and subdivision thereof, if it is so divided, relied upon) of
the Code of Civil Procedure; and if such allegation be controverted, the party
pleading must establish, on the trial, the facts showing that the cause of
action is so barred.”
