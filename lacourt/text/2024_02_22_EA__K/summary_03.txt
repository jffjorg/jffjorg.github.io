And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying James Rutherford's application for default judgment against 1600 Azusa SB One, LLC, without prejudice. The ruling notes several defects in the plaintiff's application, including the need to resubmit the application using the current version of Judicial Council form CIV-100, the lack of adequate evidence of the property's ownership, and the incomplete proposed judgment. The ruling requires the plaintiff to specifically set forth the accessibility barriers described in his complaint. The judge has set an Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment for February 22, 2024, and the matter will proceed accordingly.
