 Case Number:  23PSCV00653    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff
James Rutherford’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff James Rutherford
(“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Plaintiff is disabled
and uses a wheelchair for mobility. On December 14, 2022, Plaintiff went to
Five Guys (“Business”) located at 1552 S Azusa Ave., City of Industry, CA 91748
(“Property”) but there were no designated parking spaces available for persons
with disabilities that complied with the 1991 ADA Standards for Accessible
Design and/or the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (“ADASAD”). The
Property is owned by Defendant 1600 Azusa SB One, LLC (“Defendant”).
On March 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a complaint, asserting a cause of action against Defendant and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Violation of The Unruh Civil Rights Act
On May 4, 2023, Defendant’s
default was entered.
An Order to Show Cause Re: Default
Judgment is set for February 22, 2024.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff is instructed to resubmit his default
prove-up application utilizing the current version of Judicial Council form
CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023].
2.                 
Plaintiff has not provided the court with adequate
evidence of the Property’s ownership. The Property is described as “1552 S
Azusa Ave, City of Industry, CA 91748” in ¶ 2 of Plaintiff’s complaint.
Plaintiff’s counsel Joseph R. Manning, Jr. (“Manning, Jr.”) has attached a copy
of a grant deed recorded July 11, 2019, was made by TF City of Industry CA LLC
in favor of Defendant “as to an undivided 10/22nds interest,” 1552 Azusa One
LLC “as to an undivided 2/22nds interest, 1552 Azusa Two LLC “as to an
undivided 4/22nds interest” and 1552 Azusa Three LLC “as to an undivided
6/22nds interest.” The legal description attached thereto does not include any
street address. It is unclear whether or not Defendant’s “undivided 10/22nds
interest” includes Property. Manning has also attached a “Property Profile”
which lists Defendant under “Ownership & Mailing Address;” however, this
“Property Profile” is as to “1548 S. Azusa Ave., City of Industry, CA 91748,”
not as to Property. The “APN” on the “Property Profile” is partially illegible.
3.                 
The proposed judgment is not full and complete. (See
Paragraph 1 therein). Plaintiff must specifically set forth “the accessibility
barriers described in [his] Complaint.”
