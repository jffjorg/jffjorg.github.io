  Case Number:  20PSCV00862    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  K Defendant/Cross-Complainant Honghua Shang’s
Motion for Leave to Amend Answer is GRANTED. 
Background   
Plaintiff Weiqing Xu (“Xu”) alleges as follows:
On September 2, 2015, Honghua Shang (erroneously
sued as Hongshua Shang) (“Shang”) and EChain, Inc. dba E-Chain Realty (“Echain”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) induced Xu to sign two separate Power of Attorney
documents. Xu also loaned Defendants $75,000.00 (i.e., $30,000.00 on or around
June 1, 2015 and $45,000.00 on or around September 6, 2015). Although
Defendants issued Xu a check for $5,000.00 on or around October 1, 2017, no
further payments have been made.
On December 14, 2020, Xu filed a complaint, asserting causes
of action against Defendants and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
2.                 
Open Book Account
3.                 
Fraud—Intentional Misrepresentation
4.                 
Fraud—Promise without Intent to Perform
5.                 
Conversion 
On February 18, 2021, Shang filed a cross-complaint,
asserting a cause of action against Xu and Roes 1-50 for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
On June 23, 2023, Echain’s default was entered.
A Status Conference Re: Trial Setting is set for April 2,
2024.
Legal Standard
“The court
may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a
party to amend any pleading…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); and see §
576 [“Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the
furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the
amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order”].)
“[T]he trial
court has wide discretion in allowing the amendment of any pleading.” (Bedolla v. Logan & Frazer (1975) 52
Cal.App.3d 118, 135.) “[I]t is irrelevant that new legal theories are
introduced as long as the proposed amendments relate to the same general set of
facts.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [quotation marks and citation
omitted].) “[E]ven if the proposed legal theory is a novel one, the preferable
practice would be to permit the amendment and allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on the
pleadings or other appropriate proceedings.” (Id. [quotation marks and citation omitted].) With that said, “the
failure of a proposed amendment to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action or defense may support an order denying a motion to amend.” (California
Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280,
disapproved of on other grounds in Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines
Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390)
Courts must apply a policy of great liberality in permitting
amendments to pleadings at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including
trial, when no prejudice is shown to the adverse party. (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.)
However, “even if a good amendment is proposed in proper form, unwarranted
delay in presenting it may—of itself—be a valid reason for denial. . . denial
may rest upon the element of lack of diligence in offering the amendment after
knowledge of the facts, or the effect of the delay on the adverse party.” (Roemer v. Retail Credit Co. (1975) 44
Cal.App.3d 926, 940.)
Also, “[a] motion to amend a pleading before trial must: (1)
Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be
serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments;
(2) State what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted,
if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations
are located; and (3) State what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.” (Cal. Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule 3.1324,
subd. (a).)
Additionally, “[a] separate declaration must accompany the
motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment
is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and (4) The reasons why the request for amendment
was not made earlier.” (CRC Rule 3.1324, subd. (b).)
Discussion
Shang moves the court
for leave to amend his answer; more specifically, Shang wishes to amend his second
affirmative defense (i.e., statute of limitations) to confirm with the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure § 458[1].
Shang’s motion reflects compliance
with CRC Rule 3.1324, subdivisions (a) and (b); accordingly, the motion is
granted.
