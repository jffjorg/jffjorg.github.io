And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is granting Defendant Honghua Shang's motion for leave to amend his answer. The motion is compliant with the California Rules of Court, and the proposed amendment relates to the same general set of facts. The court has wide discretion in allowing the amendment of any pleading, and the proposed amendment is necessary and proper. The court also notes that the failure of a proposed amendment to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action or defense may support an order denying a motion to amend. However, in this case, the court finds that the proposed amendment is proper and will grant the motion.
