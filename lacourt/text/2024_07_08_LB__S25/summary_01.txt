And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion of Plaintiff's counsel to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. The court finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and Plaintiff's failure to participate in discovery hinder the ability of his counsel to adequately prepare his claims against the defendant. The court grants the motion, despite the fact that trial is approaching, as the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship outweighs any potential prejudice to the Plaintiff. The court orders that moving party give notice of the ruling.
