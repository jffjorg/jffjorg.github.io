 Case Number:  23LBCV01696    Hearing Date:   July 8, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn September 7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants Hyundai Motor America and Does 1 to 10, alleging violations of the Song-Beverely Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”) and the breach of the implied warranty of habitability. Plaintiffs allege that on or about October 21, 2021, a warranty contract was entered into with Defendant regarding a 2021 Hyundai Sonata. (Compl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiffs assert that despite this warranty, Defendant did not offer to repurchase or replace the Subject Vehicle when the defects and nonconformities manifested during the warranty window for the Subject Vehicle. (Compl., ¶¶ 11, 12, 14, 15.) On October 16, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. On March 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel further responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production of Documents, Set One. On June 24, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition. As of July 2, 2024, no reply has been filed.Legal Standard“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete. (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., 2031.310, subd. (a).)The court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).) A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771.)Meet and ConferPlaintiffs assert Defendant did not respond to a meet and confer letter dated December 22, 2023 discussing electronically stored information (ESI), creation of search protocol and institution of a litigation hold and that Defendant did not agreed to sign a protective order. (Stoliker Decl., ¶¶ 24, 26, Exhs. 7, 9.) Defendant asserts Plaintiffs electronically served written discovery including Plaintiffs’ Request for Production of Documents on December 22, 2023 and that Defendant served responses on January 23, 2024. (Knighton Decl., ¶ 4, 5.) On February 15, 2024, Plaintiffs served a 36-page meet and confer letter regarding Defendant’s responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production of Documents; on February 28, 2024, Defendant responded to this letter, standing by its objections and asking Plaintiffs to postpone discovery due to Defendant’s plan to file a motion to compel arbitration. (Stoliker Decl., ¶¶ 25, 27, Exhs. 8, 10; Knighton Decl., ¶ 6.) On March 11, 2024, Plaintiffs sent an email correspondence to Defendant regarding Defendant’s failure to respond to discovery, demanding Defendant to agree to provide supplemental responses by close of business on March 12, 2024 or it would proceed with the instant motion. (Stoliker Decl., ¶ 28, Exh. 11; Knighton Decl., ¶ 7.) Defendant states it served supplemental response on June 24, 2024 along with its Opposition. (Knighton Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. A.) On June 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed it Reply as well as evidentiary objections to Jared Blackman’s Declaration. Although attempts to resolve this matter informally were unproductive, the Court finds that the meet and confer requirements have been met.Parties’ ArgumentsPlaintiffs move to compel further responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests forProduction of Documents to Defendant, Set One Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 18, 20, 22, 24, 30, 35, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 49, 54, 56, 57, 66, 74, 76, 77, 78, 86 and 87.In response, Defendant insists it provided supplemental responses on June 24, 2024 to the following requests: 1, 2, 3, 7, 30, 35, 40, 54, 56, 66 and 87, thereby rendering them moot. (Knighton Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. A.)RulingPlaintiffs’ Evidentiary Objections No. 1 – 8 to the Declaration of Jared Blackburn are OVERRULED.The Court finds Defendant’s June 24, 2024 supplemental responses to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 30, 35, 40, 54, 56, 66 and 87 render Plaintiffs’ request for additional responses moot.Request Nos. 18, 20, 22, 24, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 49 are DENIED. First, the requests are overly broad as they ask for documents related to ENGINE DEFECT(S), HYUNDAI VEHICLES and/or the 2.5-liter engine. To elaborate, Plaintiffs’ definition in their Requestsfor Production of Document, Set One, for ENGINE DEFECT(S) as five symptoms is broad and vaguely characterized. ENGINE DEFECT(S) is also unduly burdensome given the different repair issues that may result from any of the five symptoms Plaintiffs have described in the ENGINE DEFECT(S) definition. Plaintiffs should specifically list the symptoms experienced by them with regard to the SUBJECT VEHICLE. Moreover, “HYUNDAI VEHICLES” is overly broad, unduly burdensome and irrelevant as it goes beyond the SUBJECT VEHICLE. Discovery should be limited to vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make and model of the SUBJECT VEHICLE. Also, the 2.5-liter engine, which is included in the definition of ENGINE DEFECT(S), is overly broad and is not described in reasonable particularity.Request No. 57 asks for warranty policy and procedure manuals published by Defendant and provided to authorized repair facility(s) within California since 2021. This request is DENIED as irrelevant and overboard.Request No. 74 seeks all documents communicated with government agencies and Defendant regarding ENGINE DEFECT(S) in HYUNDAI VEHICLES. This request is DENIED because it is overly broad, unduly burdensome, as well as vague and ambiguous. To elaborate, the definitions of HYUNDAI VEHICLES and ENGINE DEFECT(S) are overly broad, unduly burdensome and vague and ambiguous.Request No. 76 asks for all early warning reports Defendant submitted to NHTSA concerning HYUNDAI VEHICLES. This request is DENIED because it is overly broad, unduly burdensome and vague and ambiguous due to the inclusion of HYUNDAI VEHICLES rather than just the SUBJECT VEHICLE and vehicles with the same year, make and model.Request No. 77 asks for all transportation recall enhancement, accountability and documentation reports Defendant submitted concerning HYUNDAI VEHICLES. This request is DENIED because it is overly broad, unduly burdensome and vague and ambiguous due to the inclusion of HYUNDAI VEHICLES rather than just the SUBJECT VEHICLE and vehicles with the same year, make and model.Request No. 78 asks for all NHTSA complaints in Defendant’s possession, custody, or control that relate to ENGINE DEFECT(S) in HYUNDAI VEHICLES. This request is DENIED because it is overly broad, unduly burdensome and vague and ambiguous as to the terms ENGINE DEFECT(S) and HYUNDAI VEHICLES.Request No. 86 asks for all documents concerning performance standards relating to the 2.5-liter engine in HYUNDAI VEHICLES. This request is DENIED as it is overly broad, unduly burdensome and vague and ambiguous as to 2.5-liter engine and HYUNDAI VEHICLES.Plaintiffs seeks sanctions in the amount of $3,160.00 (Stoliker Decl., ¶ 38.). In opposition, Defendant asserts that the amount Plaintiffs’ request is unwarranted because the instant motion is entirely copy-paste, Plaintiffs failed to properly meet and confer with Defendant and Defendant has provided supplemental responses. (See Knighton Decl., ¶ 10, Exh. B [referencing a near identical Motion to Compel Further Responses filed in another case on December 19, 2023].) Although delayed, Defendant provided supplemental responses to several of the Request for Production of Documents and acted with justification in objecting to other documentary discovery requests. The Court will not award monetary sanctions at this time.
