And here is a brief summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case involving a dispute between plaintiffs and defendant Hyundai Motor America. The plaintiffs alleged that Hyundai failed to offer to repurchase or replace a 2021 Hyundai Sonata when defects manifested during the warranty period. The plaintiffs sought to compel further responses to their requests for production of documents, while Hyundai sought to limit discovery and avoid providing additional responses. The court found that the meet and confer requirements had been met, but denied the plaintiffs' requests for additional responses to certain requests for production of documents, finding them to be overly broad and unduly burdensome. The court also denied Hyundai's objections to certain discovery requests. The court did not award monetary sanctions to the plaintiffs, finding that Hyundai had acted with justification in objecting to the discovery requests.
