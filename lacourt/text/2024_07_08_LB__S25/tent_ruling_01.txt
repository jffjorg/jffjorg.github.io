(May 6, 2024 Order to Continue Trial.)On June 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. Defendants are not opposed to counsel’s withdrawal from the case but oppose any request for a trial continuance. On July 1, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte application to shorten time for motion to be relieve as counsel, continuing the instant motion to July 8, 2024. (July 1, 2024 Minute Order.)Legal StandardAn attorney in an action may be changed at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon the order of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney,after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. (2)). California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires:1. Notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-051));2. A declaration stating in general terms, and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney client relationship, why a motion under CCP §284(2), is brought instead of filing a consent under CCP §284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-052));3. Service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and4. The proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-053)).The motion should be denied if withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule 3-700(A)(2); Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial, 9:385.2 (2008); 1 Witkin Cal. Pro., Attorneys §72 (2008).) The motion should be denied if it will cause undue delay in the proceeding or cause injustice. (Mandell v. Superior Court, (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.) The determination whether to grant or deny an attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case. (Lempert v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.) A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship (or personality clash) is grounds for withdrawal. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) An attorney is not limited to withdrawing from a case for cause and may withdraw when withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)DiscussionPlaintiff counsel’s notice of motion and motion to be relieved as counsel is made on the proper Judicial Council of California form MC-051. The notice of motion and motion complies with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a).Plaintiff’s counsel provided a declaration pointing to a breakdown in the attorney client relationship and that granting the motion will not prejudice Plaintiff. (Hamideh Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff’s counsel also states willingness to provide further details under seal if the Court so desires. (Ibid.) Further, the declaration is on the proper Judicial Council of California form MC-052. The declaration complies with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c).As for service, Plaintiff’s counsel has provided proper proof of service for the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and the proposed order. Service complies with Cal.Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d). The proposed order has been prepared on the correct Judicial Council of California form MC-053 and has been lodged with the court with the moving paper. The proposed order complies with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).The Final Status Conference remains set for August 23, 2024 and Jury Trial for August 26, 2024. Although trial is fast approaching, the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship as well as Plaintiff’s failure to appear for his Independent Medical Examination and participate in discovery, hinders any opportunity for his counsel to adequately prepare Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant. Accordingly, the court grants the motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. Moving party to give notice.
