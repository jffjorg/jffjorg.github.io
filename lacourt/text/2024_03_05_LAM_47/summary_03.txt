Summary: The tentative ruling denies defendants' motion to specially set the hearing on their demurrer and motion to strike as to the second amended complaint. The court finds that the defendants' arguments for an earlier hearing date are not persuasive, and that the ordinary risks of pending litigation do not outweigh the need to follow the regular processes for managing the court's calendar.
