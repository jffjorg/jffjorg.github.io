And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has granted the motion of attorneys Pavel Ekmechyan and Sara Stratton to be relieved as counsel for defendants Y.S. Media Agency Inc. and Yuki Seki. The motion was filed due to irreconcilable conflicts between the defendants and the attorneys. The judge found that the risk of prejudice to the defendants' interests was low, given that the trial is set for December 2, 2024, and the attorneys have served the defendants with written notice of their intent to withdraw. The judge noted that the attorneys have been unable to confirm the last-known address of the defendants and have been in regular email contact with them instead. The judge's decision is conditional on the attorneys serving written notice of the court's order on all parties and filing proof of service with the court.
