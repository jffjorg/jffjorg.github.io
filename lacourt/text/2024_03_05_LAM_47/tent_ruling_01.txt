STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for breach of contract that was filed on July 16, 2020.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants borrowed $100,000 from him and failed to
repay the loan by the date of maturity on the promissory note. 
 
Attorneys Pavel Ekmechyan and Sara
Stratton, counsel for Defendants, move to be relieved as counsel. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorneys Pavel Ekmechyan and Sara
Stratton, counsel for Defendants, move to be relieved as counsel. 
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) separately as to both Defendants and included a proof of
service as required by California Rules of Court rule 3.1362(d).  Moving counsel’s declaration states that they served Defendants
by mail at their last known address. (MC-052 ¶ 3.) Moving counsel has been
unable to confirm that the last-known address is current, but state that they
have been in regular e-mail contact with Defendants, and are serving the papers
at the address reflected by the California Secretary of State Business Search
as the address for Y.S. Media Agency, Inc., of which Defendant Seki is the CEO.
(Id.) Moving counsel states that Defendants were informed of Moving
Counsel’s intent to withdraw in several email exchanges between December 12,
2023 and January 31, 2024, and were provided drafts of these motions. (¶ 3(c).)
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause as long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
Here, trial in this matter is set for
December 2, 2024. ( MC-052 ¶ 4.) The risk of prejudice to Defendants is
therefore low. Moving Counsel’s declaration states that irreconcilable conflicts
exist between the Defendants and counsel, such that representation should be
terminated. (MC-052 ¶ 2.) Considering the evidence of the breakdown in the
relationship and the low risk of prejudice, the Court finds that these
circumstances warrant withdrawal.
 
Accordingly, Attorneys Pavel Ekmechyan and
Sara Stratton’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant Y.S. Media
Agency, Inc. is GRANTED. 
 
Accordingly, Attorneys Pavel Ekmechyan and
Sara Stratton’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant Yuki Sek. is
GRANTED. 
 
            This
ruling is conditioned on Moving Counsel serving written notice of the Court’s
order on all parties and filing proof of service with the Court. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
