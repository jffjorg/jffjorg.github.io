STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a medical malpractice action arising from an allegedly botched
cardiac procedure performed on the decedent, Plaintiff’s grandmother. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants permitted a medical fellow to perform surgery on the
decedent over the decedent’s express wishes. 
 
Defendants move to specially set
the hearing on their demurrer and motion to strike as to the Second Amended
Complaint. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendants move to specially set
the hearing on their demurrer and motion to strike as to the Second Amended
Complaint under the Court’s inherent power to control its own calendar pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 128. 
 
On December 13, 2023, the Court sustained
Defendants’ demurrer to the First Amended Complaint without leave to amend as
to the first cause of action, and with leave to amend as to the remaining
causes of action, and denied the motion to strike as moot. (December 13, 2023
Minute Order.) Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint on January 2, 2024.
(See SAC.) Defendants state that the earliest available hearing date for a
demurrer and motion to strike to the Second Amended Complaint was May 13, 2024,
which they reserved. Defendants’ Demurrer and Motion to Strike were served and
filed concurrently with this motion. (See Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint
filed February 1, 2024.) 
 
Defendants argue that the demurrer
and motion to strike should be specially set for an earlier date because, they
contend, these motions will be dispositive of the entire action. Defendants
claim that if relief is not granted, they will unjustly be forced to incur fees
and costs in pursuing discovery, hiring experts, and preparing this matter for
trial. These are not exigencies that require the Court to disregard its regular
processes for managing its calendar; these are the ordinary risks inherent in
any pending litigation. The Court is not persuaded that the circumstances
described by Defendants require special relief. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to
Specially Set the Hearing on the Demurrer and Motion to Strike is DENIED.
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
