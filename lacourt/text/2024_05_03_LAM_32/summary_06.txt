And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains Defendant Brian Delahaut's demurrer to the complaint with leave to amend. The court finds that the current allegations fail to establish that Delahaut is personally liable for breach of contract or for the remaining causes of action based on tortious conduct. The court held that the complaint lacks sufficient allegations to support a claim for breach of contract or tortious conduct against Delahaut in his individual capacity. The court also held that the complaint is uncertain because it asserts causes of action against "Defendants" without specifying which actions Delahaut conducted in his personal capacity. The court ruled that Delahaut's demurrer is sustained because the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to support a claim for personal liability against Delahaut.
