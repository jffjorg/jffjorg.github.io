                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  22STCV29783
  Hearing Date:  May 3, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to appoint guardian
  ad litem 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On September 13, 2022, Plaintiff
Francisca Villalpando filed this action against Defendant Serafin H.
Villalpando and Does 1 through 10. The complaint asserts (1) quiet title, (2)
slander of title, (3) financial elder abuse, (4) deceit, (5) and cancellation
of written instrument. 
            On January 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a motion to appoint her niece and caretaker, Claudia Desales, as guardian ad
litem. Ms. Desales’ Application and Order for Guardian Ad Litem was
rejected on January 25, 2024. Ms. Desales filed a second application, and
Plaintiff filed the accompanying motion, on March 27, 2024. The application was
rejected again for numerous reasons as stated in the Notice of Rejection. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“When a minor, a person who lacks legal
capacity to make decisions, or a person for whom a conservator has been
appointed is a party, that person shall appear either by a guardian or
conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in
which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 372(a)(1).) 
DISCUSSION 
            Ms. Desales must file a correct
application with the necessary information in order for the Court to grant her
request to be appointed guardian ad litem. Ms. Desales has been informed
of the defects in her application through the Notice of Rejection filed on
March 27, 2024. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to appoint
guardian ad litem is DENIED.
