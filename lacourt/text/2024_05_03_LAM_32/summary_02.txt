And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Francisca Villalpando's motion to appoint her niece and caretaker, Claudia Desales, as guardian ad litem. The motion was denied due to defects in the application, which were informed to Ms. Desales through a Notice of Rejection. The plaintiff filed the initial complaint against Defendant Serafin H. Villalpando in September 2022, and subsequently filed a motion to appoint a guardian ad litem in January 2024. The court has scheduled a hearing for May 3, 2024, to consider the motion. The judge relies on California Code of Civil Procedure Section 372(a)(1), which requires that a representative be appointed to represent the interests of individuals who lack legal capacity to make decisions.
