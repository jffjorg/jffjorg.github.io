     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
Plaintiff’s motion to amend judgment 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff
22nd/Indian School Development LLC filed an application for entry of judgment
on sister-state judgment. The case arises from an underlying judgment in
Arizona in favor of Plaintiff against Defendant CMS Equity, Inc. Plaintiff’s
application was granted on October 3, 2023. Therefore, Plaintiff now has a
judgment against Defendant in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
            On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to amend the judgment to add judgment debtors based on alter
ego. Plaintiff seeks to add Christopher Smith, sole owner and member of CMS
Equity, as well as ten other corporate entities of which Smith or CMS is the
sole owner or member. There is no opposition to the motion.  
LEGAL STANDARD
            “When jurisdiction is, by the
Constitution or this Code, or by any other statute, conferred on a Court or
judicial officer, all the means necessary to carry it into effect are also
given; and in the exercise of this jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be
not specifically pointed out by this Code or the statute, any suitable process
or mode of proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the
spirit of this Code.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 187.) 
“Pursuant to section 187, a trial court
has jurisdiction to modify a judgment to add additional judgment debtors.” (McClellan
v. Northridge Park Townhome Owners Ass'n (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 746, 752.) “Judgments
are often amended to add additional judgment debtors on the grounds that a
person or entity is the alter ego of the original judgment debtor.” (NEC
Electronics Inc. v. Hurt (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 772, 778.) “This is an
equitable procedure based on the theory that the court is not amending the
judgment to add a new defendant but is merely inserting the correct name of the
real defendant.” (Ibid.) “Such a procedure is an appropriate and
complete method by which to bind new . . . defendants where it can be
demonstrated that in their capacity as alter ego of the [judgment debtor] they
in fact had control of the previous litigation, and thus were virtually
represented in the lawsuit.” (Ibid.) 
DISCUSSION
“The alter ego doctrine arises when a
plaintiff comes into court claiming that an opposing party is using the
corporate form unjustly and in derogation of the plaintiff's interests . . . In
certain circumstances the court will disregard the corporate entity and will
hold the individual shareholders liable for the actions of the corporation.” (Greenspan
v. LADT LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486, 510.) Establishing alter ego “generally
requires the proponent to demonstrate two elements: (1) a unity of interest and
ownership such that the separate personalities of the corporation and the
individual do not exist; and (2) an inequitable result if the corporate
identity is not disregarded.” (JPV I L.P. v. Koetting (2023) 88
Cal.App.5th 172, 189.) “In addition, even if all the formal elements necessary
to establish alter ego liability are not present, an unnamed party may be
included as a judgment debtor if ‘the equities overwhelmingly favor’ the amendment
and it is necessary to prevent an injustice.” (Carolina Casualty Ins. Co. v.
L.M. Ross Law Group, LLP (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1188-1189.) 
                        1.
Unity of Interest
Courts have found the following factors
determinative in applying alter ego: that the individual defendant dominated
and controlled the entity defendant; that a unity of interest and ownership
existed between the individual defendant and entity defendant; that the entity
defendant was a mere shell and conduit for the individual defendant’s affairs;
that the entity defendant was inadequately capitalized; that the entity
defendant failed to abide by corporate formalities; and that the individual
defendant used the entity defendant’s assets as her own. (See Rutherford
Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 235-36.) 
Here, the undisputed evidence shows that
Smith wholly owns CMS Equity (Plntf.’s RJN, Ex. E) and has used CMS Equity’s
funds for personal expenses (Kintzele Decl., Ex. B.) The evidence further shows
that either Smith or CMS solely owns or manages the other entities. (Plntf.’s
RJN, Ex. F-M.) Smith freely transfers assets between CMS and his other entities
without any of the associated formalities. (See Kintzele Decl., Ex. B.) This
evidence sufficiently shows a unity of interest between Smith, CMS, and the other
entities. 
            2.
Inequitable Result
The undisputed inference from the above
evidence is that “Smith has shifted and spread his assets among the Proposed
Entities which do not have judgments entered against them in an attempt to
prevent Plaintiff from collecting on its own judgment against CMS Equity, Inc.”
(Mtn. 16:23-25.) CMS’s insolvency renders direct collection against CMS
unlikely. Therefore, the Court finds that not treating Smith and the other
entities as alter egos would result in injustice by allowing wrongdoers to
escape liability. Accordingly, Smith and the other proposed entities should be
added as judgment debtors. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to amend judgment
is GRANTED. The following individuals or entities are added as judgment debtors
to the judgment of October 3, 2023: Christopher Smith; MRC AZ Rehab
Orangewood, LLC; Clarendon 1311, LLC; La Junta Troon LLC; Red Gravity, LLC;
McDonald 4141, LLC; M&CS Holdings AZ, LLC; Christopher Smith &
Associates LLC; MS Square Construction, LLC; Grace Monroe Legacy Rentals, LLC;
and 23rd 4020, LLC.
