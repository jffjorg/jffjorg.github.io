And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Alexander Khazai, and against the defendant, McKesson Corporation. The plaintiff alleges that McKesson breached a contract by failing to pay him commissions for his services in arranging business relationships between McKesson and other defendants. The court finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded breach of contract and accounting, as required by California law. The court also rejects McKesson's demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has stated a cause of action for breach of contract and accounting.
