MOTION TO COMPEL
  RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE, AND REQUEST FOR
  SANCTIONS; 
 
MOTION TO COMPEL

Plaintiff Immigrant
Rights Defense Council, LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order “deeming
each request for admission admitted by Defendant Angelica Cendejas
(‘Defendant’)
in
response to Request for Admissions, Set One, served on August 28, 2023.”
Plaintiff also moves for orders compelling Defendant “to respond to the Request
for Production of Documents, Set One, served on August 28, 2023” and “to
respond to the Form Interrogatories, Set One, served on August 28, 2023.”
Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions in connection with the motions. 
Plaintiff’s motions will be continued to a new
date as set forth below. NO HEARINGS WILL TAKE PLACE ON DECEMBER 6, 2023.  
Pursuant to the
Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128(a)(8)), the Court orders
the parties in this case to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference
(“IDC”). (Note:¿The Court’s policy regarding IDCs appears in the Courtroom
Information available in Dept. 50 and on the Court’s website.)¿Lead or
other designated counsel for the parties with full authority are ordered to
participate in person in an IDC. After consulting with opposing counsel
regarding available dates, Plaintiff must make a prompt reservation for
the IDC using the Court’s online reservation system. Plaintiff must
file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC form in the department seven days prior to the
IDC, and the responding parties may file the same form in the department
setting forth a response three days prior to the IDC.   
Once Plaintiff has confirmed an IDC date, Plaintiff must
use the Court’s online reservation system to continue the motions to a post-IDC
discovery hearing date. The parties are ordered to have with them whatever
materials are needed to make the IDC session productive and successful. Prior
to the IDC date, lead or other designated counsel for the parties, with full
authority, are to meet and confer, in person or via telephone
in a further attempt to resolve as many of the issues as possible before
the IDC. (See CRC Rule 3.670(f)(2).) If the parties resolve their
discovery disputes before the IDC date, Plaintiff is ordered to take both the
IDC and the motions off calendar as soon as possible. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
