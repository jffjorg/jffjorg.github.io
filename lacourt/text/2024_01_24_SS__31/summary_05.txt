The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to consolidate Case No. 21STCV33832 with Case No. 22STCP01177 without prejudice. The plaintiff, Michael Libitzky, argues that the two cases arise from the same automobile accident, but the court finds that the cases have not yet been deemed related. Pursuant to Local Rule 3.3(g)(1), the court requires cases to be related before being consolidated. The court orders the moving party to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If the parties do not submit to the tentative ruling, they should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
