The judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to continue the trial in the case of Reprudentia Sonkey (Plaintiff) vs. Myran Thomas, ET AL. (Defendants). The motion was filed on October 26, 2023, requesting a six-month continuance of the trial date from December 4, 2023, due to the Plaintiff undergoing surgery in November 2023 and another surgery six weeks thereafter. The parties stipulated to continue the trial to April 25, 2024, and the Final Status Conference was continued to April 11, 2024. Since the trial date has already been continued, the motion to continue trial is now MOOT and taken off-calendar.
