And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, to enforce a settlement agreement under CCP § 664.6. The Court found that Defendant has not met its burden of showing that a valid and enforceable contract was formed between the parties. Even if Defendant had met its burden, the Court would have found that there are issues of material fact as to whether Plaintiffs authorized their counsel to settle when tender of the same policy limit by Exchange was previously rejected. The Court also found that there is no evidence of a writing signed by the parties to enforce a settlement agreement under CCP § 664.6.
