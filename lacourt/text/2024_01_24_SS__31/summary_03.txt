And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of minor Abigail Bostadjian, who is 9 years old. The settlement was reached with cross-defendant Hamazasb Aghajaniani for $100,000 and with defendants Tanner and Alan Haynes for $250,000, for a total of $350,000. If approved, the settlement funds will be distributed as follows: $1,284.06 for medical expenses, $8,838.07 for expenses other than medical, $87,500 for attorney's fees, and the remaining $252,377.87 will be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity. The Court finds the settlement fair and reasonable. However, the petitioner's request for 25% of the settlement for attorney's fees is denied due to the lack of an attorney declaration meeting the requirements. The petition is conditionally approved and granted upon counsel filing a declaration meeting the requirements.
