This is a tentative ruling from the judge regarding a request for default judgment against Amaya Muhammed AKA Amayah Muhammed. The request was submitted by Plaintiffs Syiyona Ricks and Zaniya Walker, but was denied due to several defects. The judge noted that the Plaintiffs failed to use the proper forms (CIV-100 and JUD-100) and that the request was inconsistent and unclear. Additionally, the judge pointed out that dismissal was entered as to only Kayla Traniya Bull, and not Does 1-25, which were yet to be properly dismissed. The judge ordered the Plaintiffs to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects by a certain date, or risk facing sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
