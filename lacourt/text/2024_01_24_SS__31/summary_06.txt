And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant due to several defects in the request. The plaintiff used an outdated form, CIV-100 (Rev. January 1, 2018), and failed to submit a copy of the Statement of Damages served on the defendant. Additionally, the plaintiff sought $450,000 in punitive damages without providing evidence of the defendant's net worth and ability to pay. As a result, the plaintiff must correct these defects and submit a new default judgment package. If the plaintiff fails to do so, the court may impose sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
