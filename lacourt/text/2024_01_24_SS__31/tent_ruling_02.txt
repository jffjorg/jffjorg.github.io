 Case Number:  20STCV48134    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  01/24/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  20STCV48134; Syiyona Ricks, A Minor, By Shanteal Evans as her Guardian Ad Litem, and Zaniya Walker REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  Amaya Muhammed AKA Amayah Muhammed RECOMMENDATION:    DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  This is the second request for default judgment from Plaintiff Syiyona Ricks (“Ricks”) and Plaintiff Zaniya Walker (“Walker”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).  The request for default judgment submitted on December 7, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  First, Plaintiffs submit a request for default judgment on pleading paper, with a memorandum of points and authorities. Plaintiffs are required to submit a request for court judgment on CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023]. The use of CIV-100 is mandatory (CRC 3.1800(a).)  Second, it appears that both Plaintiffs are seeking default judgment. However, the proposed judgment on JUD-100 names only Ricks. There is no JUD-100 for Walker filed. The Court requests Plaintiffs to be consistent and clear on the next default package, in addition to using the proper forms, namely CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023] and the newly updated JUD-100 [Rev. January 1, 2024].   Lastly, Plaintiffs filed a request for dismissal of Defendants Kayla Traniya Bull and Does 1 to 25 on September 8, 2023. However, dismissal was entered as to only Kayla Traniya Bull, and Plaintiffs were notified on the same date. Because dismissal was not entered as to Does 1-25, the unnamed Doe defendants have yet to be properly dismissed.  No later than ________________, Plaintiffs are to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects.  Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to __________________________.
