And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant, ZLS Trans Inc., to respond to outstanding discovery requests. The plaintiff propounded the requests on March 31, 2023, and ZLS failed to respond despite extensions granted until July 31, 2023. The judge found that ZLS was properly served with the requests and failed to respond, which waived any objections to the requests. The judge ordered ZLS to serve verified responses to the requests without objections within 15 days. Additionally, the judge denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $560, as the supporting declaration was unsigned. The judge encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement and noted that the parties should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.
