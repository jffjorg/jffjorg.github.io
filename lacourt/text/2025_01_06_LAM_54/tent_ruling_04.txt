Hearing Date: January 6, 2025
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
(5) Petitions for Minor’s Compromise
Moving Party: Minor Plaintiffs
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:     THE PETITIONS ARE DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.
 
PLAINTIFFS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
                
Plaintiffs move for approval of settlement
for five minor Plaintiffs. Under the settlement, each minor will receive
$10,000.00 out of a total settlement of $1,350,000.00. No attorney’s fees or
costs are to be deducted from the minor’s settlements. The Court finds that the
settlements are reasonable, but the minor’s compromise forms have not been
filled out correctly. Section 10 requests the amount being offered to each
minor ($10,000.00). Plaintiffs have filled out section 10 to show the amount
offered to every Plaintiff total ($1,350,000.00.) Plaintiff must follow the
form’s structure to ensure that the settlement is properly documented and
understood. 
The petitions are DENIED without prejudice.
