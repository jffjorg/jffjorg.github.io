Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit brought by Mario Cardona against the City of Los Angeles. The lawsuit alleges whistleblower retaliation, discrimination, and retaliation in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The City of Los Angeles has moved for summary judgment and summary adjudication on the grounds that Cardona failed to exhaust administrative remedies and that there was no causal link between his alleged protected activity and the City's adverse employment action.

The Judge has denied the City's motion for summary judgment on the whistleblower retaliation claim, finding that Cardona presented sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact. The Judge has also denied the City's motion for summary adjudication on the FEHA retaliation claim, finding that Cardona presented evidence showing that he reported sexual harassment concerns and believed that his supervisor made personnel decisions based on race.

The Judge has granted the City's motion for summary adjudication on the race discrimination claim, finding that Cardona failed to establish a triable issue of fact.

The case will proceed to trial on the whistleblower retaliation and FEHA retaliation claims, but the Judge has not yet ruled on the merits of the claims.
