And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate and vacate the trial date in two related cases. The defendant, Main Street Vistas, moves to consolidate the cases of Teresa Washington, et al. v. 5950 MAIN LP, et al. (Case Number 23STCV09893) and Carlos Serrano, et al. v. 5950 MAIN LP (Case Number 23STCV21254). The defendant argues that the cases involve common issues of law and fact, including habitability conditions in the same building, and that consolidation would avoid unnecessary costs and delay. The plaintiffs do not oppose the motion.

The judge grants the motion to consolidate the cases, finding that there are common issues of fact and law. The judge also grants the motion to vacate the trial date, finding that a brief continuance is necessary due to the consolidation of the related cases. The trial date will be set at the hearing.
