Ramos v. Wells
Fargo LLC et al., Case No. 23SMCV04217
Hearing Date March
7, 2024
Defendant Wells
Fargo Bank’s Demurrer to Complaint 
 
Plaintiff Ramos,
administrator of the estate of decedent Birgitta Sjostrand, alleges decedent
suffered from advanced Alzheimer’s and defendant Hamid, a Wells Fargo banker, facilitated
a fraudulent wire transfer from decedent to third-party Mitra. Plaintiff sues
Hamid and Wells Fargo for fraud, elder abuse, intentional infliction of
emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Defendant Wells
Fargo demurs. 
 
Common Law Claims/UCC

Division 11 of the
California Uniform Commercial Code displaces common law claims where provisions
of the article cover the “circumstances giving rise to the common law
claims[.]” Zengen v. Comercia Bank (2007) 241 Cal.4th 239,
251-253. Successive sections of Division 11 address the liabilities of
consumers and banks when an unauthorized wire transfer is made. Cal. Com. Code
§§11202-11204.
 
Wells Fargo argues
the UCC displaces Ramos’ common law claims. Since all the causes of action are
based on alleged unauthorized wire transfers, they all fall within the scope of
Division 11 and are therefore displaced. Ramos presents no substantive
opposition. SUSTAINED without leave to amend, unless plaintiff can allege
claims not covered by UCC Division 11.  
 
Elder Abuse 
A claim for
financial elder abuse lies when a person “[t]akes, secretes, appropriates,
obtains, or retains real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult
for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud,” assists in doing so, or “takes,
secrets, appropriates, or retains” property through undue influence. Cal. Welf.
&. Inst. Code §15610.30(a). A cause of action based on “assisting” in a
third party’s wrongful taking must allege defendant actually knew the
transaction or transfer was wrongful. E.g., Das v. Bank of America, N.A. (2010)
186 Cal.App.4th 727, 745. 
 
Wells Fargo argues
the complaint does not allege Wells Fargo directly took any funds or knowingly
assisted any third party’s wrongful conduct. The complaint alleges defendant
Hamid and Wells Fargo “transferred $19,000 from Birgitta’s account to Garbita
Mitra on 6/19/19 without the consent of Birgitta,” and “[d]efendants prepared a
false outgoing wire transfer request to perform and report the transfer[.]”
Complaint at ¶¶7, 9. The complaint does not allege Wells Fargo took funds, nor
that it knew the transfer to Mitra was improper. SUSTAINED with ten days leave
to amend.
