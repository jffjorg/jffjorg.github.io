And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ramos v. Wells Fargo LLC et al. The plaintiff, Ramos, is the administrator of the estate of decedent Birgitta Sjostrand, who suffered from advanced Alzheimer's. The plaintiff alleges that the decedent's funds were fraudulently transferred by Wells Fargo and Hamid, a Wells Fargo banker, to a third-party, Mitra. The plaintiff brings claims for fraud, elder abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

The judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the complaint, stating that the common law claims are displaced by the California Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The UCC displaces common law claims where the provisions of the article cover the circumstances giving rise to the common law claims. The judge has given the plaintiff ten days to amend the complaint to allege claims not covered by the UCC.

The judge has also sustained the defendant's demurrer to the elder abuse claim, stating that the complaint does not allege that Wells Fargo directly took any funds or knowingly assisted any third party's wrongful conduct. The complaint alleges that Wells Fargo prepared a false outgoing wire transfer request, but does not allege that the bank took funds or knew the transfer to Mitra was improper. The judge has given the plaintiff ten days to amend the complaint to allege that Wells Fargo knew the transfer was improper.
