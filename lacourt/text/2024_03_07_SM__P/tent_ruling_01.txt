Rudy R. Perrino’s
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Stuart Rubin (UNOPPOSED)
 
Attorney Rudy R.
Perrino moves to be relieved as counsel for defendant Stuart Rubin. The motion
is unopposed. This follows the granting of motions to be relieved as counsel
for Stuart Rubin by Adam P. Handfinger (granted 2/6/24), Simran S. Tiwana
(granted 4/21/23), both of the firm Peckar & Abramson, P.C. and by Laurence
Berman (granted 9/30/21). 
 
Perrino states the
parties have been unable to agree upon a retainer agreement, and his declaration
states there has been “a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship
impairing our ability to competently represent them going forward.” Perrino
decl. ¶3. The proof of service indicates opposing counsel and Stuart Rubin were
served. Relief is proper. 
 
Motion GRANTED.
However, the proposed order—form MC-053 – has not yet been filed, as required
under local rule 3.1362. Counsel to file the proposed order.
