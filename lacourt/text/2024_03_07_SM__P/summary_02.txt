And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ammari v. Martinez et al. regarding the defendants' special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP motion) the first amended complaint (FAC). The defendants argue that the posts were protected speech, while the plaintiff alleges that the defendants falsely accused him of human trafficking, child molestation, and fraud.

To resolve the anti-SLAPP motion, the Court will follow a two-step process. In the first step, the Court will determine whether the conduct underlying the plaintiff's cause of action arises from the defendant's constitutional rights of free speech or petition. In this case, the Court will look at the allegations in the complaint to determine whether the action arises from protected activity.

The Court has reviewed the evidence presented and finds that the videos and oral statements made by the defendants were made in public forums, specifically on Youtube and TikTok, and on a public street. However, the Court also finds that there is no defined connection between the alleged false accusations of criminal conduct and the public discussion of street vendors' rights and safety.

Therefore, the Court denies the defendants' anti-SLAPP motion, as it fails to meet the first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis. The motion is denied, and the case will proceed to the next stage.
