 Hearing
  Date:  November 2, 2023



 
Specially Appearing Defendants
Jason Rubin’s, as trustee of the Cira Ross Qualified Domestic Trust, and Thomas
K. Bourke’s motion to quash service of summons is granted. 
 
Specially
Appearing Defendants Jason Rubin, as trustee of the Cira Ross Qualified
Domestic Trust [erroneously sued in his individual capacity] (“Rubin”) and
Thomas K. Bourke (“Bourke”) (collectively, “Defendants”) move for an order
quashing service of the summons on the grounds Plaintiff Michael Tusken
(“Tusken”) (“Plaintiff”) has failed to obtain jurisdiction over Defendants in
that the purported service upon Defendants was defective.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §418.10(a)(1).)
 
Background
On
March 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative complaint against
Defendants.  Defendants are judgment
creditors of Plaintiff’s client and have each filed notices of judgment lien in
a separate lawsuit currently on appeal.  (See
Decl. of Yost ¶3.)  In this action,
Plaintiff alleges a single cause of action seeking a declaration that his
purported contractual attorney lien on settlement proceeds secured in that
separate lawsuit is valid and has priority over Defendants’ judgment liens.  (See Decl. of Yost ¶4.)  
On
June 15, 2023, Defendants made a special appearance to file the instant
motion.  On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff
filed his opposition.  On October 26,
2023, Defendants filed their reply. 
 
Motion
to Quash
“A defendant, on or before
the day of his or her time to plead . . . may serve and file a notice of motion
. . . [t]o quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of
the court over him or her.”  (C.C.P.
§418.10(a)(1).)  By filing such motion,
“a defendant makes a special appearance for the narrow purpose of contesting
personal jurisdiction where the summons is defective.”  (Stancil v. Superior Court (2021) 11
Cal.5th 381, 393.)
“In the absence of a
voluntary submission to the authority of the court, compliance with the
statutes governing service of process is essential to establish that court’s
personal jurisdiction over a defendant.”  (Floveyer International, Ltd. v. Superior
Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 793; see also Calvert v. Al Binali
(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 954, 961 [“To establish personal jurisdiction, it is essential
to comply with the statutory procedures for service of process.”].) “When a
defendant challenges that jurisdiction by bringing a motion to quash, the
burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving,
inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.”  (Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th
1154, 1160, internal quotations omitted.)
“A summons may be served by personal
delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be
served.”  (C.C.P. §415.10.)  “‘[P]ersonal service,’ generally speaking,
means the actual delivery of the process to the defendant in person . . . .”  (Wilson v. Eddy (1969) 2 Cal.App.3d
613, 617.)  Personal delivery is the
“preferred way to serve a defendant” because it “is the most likely to ensure
actual notice to the defendant.”  (Board
of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University v. Ham (2013) 216
Cal.App.4th 330, 336.)
Here, neither Defendant has
been personally served.  Defendants
submitted three separate declarations “undermining” the proofs of service filed
by the Plaintiff and demonstrating that the Plaintiff’s process server did not
serve them personally as falsely claimed in the proofs of service.  (See Decl. of Rubin; Decl. of Bourke;
Decl. of Ajar.)  Accordingly, the
presumption of proper service is disregarded, and the factual question of valid
service decided without regard to that presumption with the burden of ultimate
proof falling on Plaintiff.  (See Farr
v. County of Nevada (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 669, 680-681; Pellerin v.
Kern County Employees’ Retirement Assn. (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1106.)  In his opposition, Plaintiff fails to meet
his burden.
Accordingly, Specially
Appearing Defendants’ motion to quash is granted.
 
Conclusion
Specially Appearing
Defendants’ motion to quash service of summons is granted.
Plaintiff to give
notice.
