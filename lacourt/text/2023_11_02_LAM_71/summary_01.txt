And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to quash service of summons filed by Specially Appearing Defendants Jason Rubin and Thomas K. Bourke. The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff has failed to obtain jurisdiction over them because the purported service upon them was defective. The Judge agrees, citing California Code of Civil Procedure sections 418.10(a)(1) and 415.10, which require personal service of process. The Judge finds that neither Defendant was personally served and that the Plaintiff's process server did not deliver the summons and complaint to them in person. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to prove valid service and grants the motion to quash.
