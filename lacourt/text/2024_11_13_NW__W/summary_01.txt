And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession, allowing Alliant Credit Union to take possession of the 2014 Audi RS7-V8 from defendant Batool Hasan. The plaintiff had filed a complaint seeking claim and delivery of personal property and money on contract, alleging that Hasan had failed to make payments due and owing under the contract. The court found that the plaintiff had demonstrated an entitlement to possession of the vehicle due to Hasan's default under the agreement and that Hasan had no interest in the vehicle. The court waived the requirement for the plaintiff to file an undertaking for Hasan's interest, as Hasan's debt exceeded the market value of the vehicle.
