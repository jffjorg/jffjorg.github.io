And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents in a case involving a plaintiff who alleges he was sexually assaulted by Robert Felder, a former employee of the defendant, Young Mens Christian Association of Greater Long Beach, in the 1970s. The plaintiff is seeking to review documents related to the termination of another employee, Brian Bost, who allegedly confronted Felder about the abuse and was subsequently terminated. The defendant is opposing the motion, arguing that the documents are not relevant to the case and that they are protected by privilege and work product protection.

The judge is inclined to grant the motion, finding that the documents are potentially relevant to the case and that the burden is on the defendant to justify its objections to the requests. The judge is also inclined to appoint a discovery referee to review the documents and balance the right of privacy against the relevance of the documents.

The parties are ordered to meet and confer to agree upon a referee and the terms of the reference. The court will set an order to show cause re: status of reference for December 14, 2023, to be heard concurrently with the Case Management Conference.
