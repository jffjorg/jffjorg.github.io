Moving Party:               Defendant,
CHLB, LLC dba College Medical Center
Opposing Party:           None
filed
Notice:                         OK
 
Plaintiffs, Brian and Frida Bundi
filed this action against Defendants, CHLB, LLC and Serap Sobnosky, M.D. for
medical malpractice.  
 
Plaintiffs filed their complaint on
7/19/22.  The Court held a CMC on
12/19/22 and scheduled trial for 12/04/23. 
Plaintiff added Christina Tran, M.D. as a doe defendant on 2/27/23.  She filed an answer the same day.  Plaintiff recently dismissed Sobnosky from
the action.  
 
CHLB moves to continue the trial
for 90-120 days.  It seeks relief because
(a) Tran has only recently appeared in the action, (b) the parties have been
engaged in ongoing mediation, and have a second session of mediation scheduled
for 8/07/23, and (c) substantial discovery remains outstanding because Frida
Bundi has been unable to answer questions about her husband’s finances, health,
etc., and needs more time to provide the necessary information.  
 
The Court finds the foregoing
constitutes good cause to continue the trial date.  The Court finds the requested 90-120 days
reasonable.  The Court advances the
12/04/23 trial date to today’s date and continues it to Thursday, 4/04/24 at
8:30 a.m. in Department S27.  The Court advances
the 12/01/23 FSC date to today’s date and continues it to Monday, 4/01/24 at
8:30 a.m. in Department S27.  
 
Moving Defendant is ordered to give
notice.  
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as
directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar.  If a party submits on the tentative, the
party’s email must include the case number and must identify the party
submitting on the tentative. If any party does not submit on the tentative, the
party should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on this matter.
