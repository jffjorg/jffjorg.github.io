Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered a demurrer filed by defendants LAUSD, Dennis Jenkins, and Jennifer Mak to the complaint filed by plaintiffs Jane M.M. Doe and John J.C. Doe. The demurrer argues that M.M.'s claims are inappropriate because she has also asserted claims in an earlier-filed case, and that J.C.'s claims are inappropriate because he is a mere bystander and does not allege the elements required to state a claim for bystander liability. The court has sustained the demurrer to M.M.'s claims without leave to amend, but has overruled the demurrer to J.C.'s claims. The court has also denied defendants' motion to strike various allegations in the complaint. Finally, the court has denied defendants' motion for attorneys' fees.
