Here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Edgar Ramirez and Mercedes Benz USA, LLC. The case involves a dispute over the purchase of a used 2016 Mercedes C300W. The plaintiff, Edgar Ramirez, claims that the defendant, Mercedes Benz USA, LLC, breached a contractual agreement and made false representations about the vehicle. The defendant has filed a demurrer and motion to strike, arguing that the plaintiff's claims are vague and lack specificity.

The court has determined that the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend for the first, second, and third causes of action. This means that the plaintiff will need to re-file a complaint that meets the pleading standards. The court has also granted the defendant's motion to strike any references to Mercedes Benz USA, LLC having a DBA, as this is a false and improper statement.

The court has ordered the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 30 days.
