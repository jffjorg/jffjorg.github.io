And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement. The plaintiff, Zanutta, LLC, sued the defendant, Davis, for unlawful detainer and the court entered a stipulated judgment on May 3, 2024. The defendant failed to make timely payments as required by the stipulated judgment, resulting in default. The plaintiff brought an ex parte application to shorten the time for judgment, which the defendant opposed. The defendant argued that the motion is unnecessary since the plaintiff has possession of the property and that the request for back-rent is barred by the stipulated judgment. The judge found that the defendant breached the terms of the stipulated judgment by failing to make payments and granted the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement.
