Doe v. Weinstein, Case no. 23SMCV00591
Hearing date December 3, 2024
Defendant
Weinstein’s Motion for Trial Preference
On
December 19, 2022 defendant Weinstein was criminally convicted of raping
plaintiff Doe, who sues based on that assault. Defendant moves for trial
preference, asserting his age and poor health, per Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §36. Plaintiff
opposes the motion, arguing Weinstein has not requested preference in other
pending matters. 
A
party to a civil action who is over 70 years of age may petition for trial
preference, which the court “shall” grant if the court finds: (1) the party has
a substantial interest in the action as a whole, and (2) the health of the party
is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party's
interest in the litigation. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §36(a)(1)-(2). 
Defendant
is 72, currently imprisoned in New York and suffers from various medical
conditions. Defendant argues he will be prejudiced if trial preference is not
granted. Weinstein is the sole defendant in this action, establishing his
substantial interest. Defendant offers the declaration of counsel Bonjean, as
allowed per Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §36.5, regarding his medical condition (filed
under seal). The declaration details defendant’s current health status,
including various significant diagnoses and recent medical procedures. See
Bonjean decl., paras. 4-7. Defendant’s health is such that preference is
necessary to prevent prejudice.
Plaintiff
argues defendant will not be prejudiced if the motion is denied and asserts the
motion is an attempt to avoid potential collateral estoppel arising from
defendant's ongoing criminal cases. This is speculative. The Code states such
motion “shall” be granted if the requisite findings are made, as here. Motion GRANTED.
