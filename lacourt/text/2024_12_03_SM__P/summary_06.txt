Significant Statements:
  - "The doctrine of forum non conveniens allows a trial court discretion to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a cause and parties otherwise properly before it if it concludes the action may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere." (Cal-State Bus. Prod. & Servs., Inc. v. Ricoh (1993) 12 Cal. App. 4th 1666, 1670)
  - "In applying the traditional forum non conveniens analysis, the trial court must engage in a two-step process, on which the defendant bears the burden of proof. In the first step, the court must determine whether a suitable alternative forum exists. If the court finds that a suitable alternative forum exists, it must then balance the private interests of the litigants and the interests of the public in retaining the action in California." (Animal Film, LLC v. D.E.J. Prods., Inc. (2011) 193 Cal. App.4th 466, 472)
  - "California strongly disfavors noncompete clauses, so there are strong public benefits to allowing the case to continue here." (In re Marriage of Greaux & Mermin (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1249)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of AD.Net, Inc. v. Web Design and Consulting Services, Inc. The defendants have moved to dismiss or transfer the case to a more convenient forum, citing forum non conveniens. The court has denied the motion to dismiss or transfer, but granted the motion to stay the case pending resolution of the pending lawsuits in Florida and Maine. The court has determined that the interests of judicial economy favor staying the case until the Florida and Maine cases can be resolved. The court has also taken judicial notice of various court decisions and statutory provisions, including California's strong public policy against noncompete clauses. The court has concluded that while California is a suitable forum for the case, the pending lawsuits in Florida and Maine raise concerns about conflicting judicial outcomes and duplicative litigation.
