Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion to extend the discovery cutoff and conduct additional limited discovery. The judge finds that the defendants have shown a necessity for the discovery, were not dilatory in seeking it, and that allowing the discovery will not delay the trial or prejudice the plaintiff. The judge also finds that the defendants are entitled to discover communications regarding the plaintiff's mother's involvement in the case, despite previously being denied access to them. The judge denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
