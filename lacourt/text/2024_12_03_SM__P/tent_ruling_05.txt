Zanutta, LLC v. Davis, Case no. 24SMCV00121
Hearing date December 3, 2024
Plaintiff
Zanutta’s Motion to Enforce Settlement
Plaintiff
landlord Zanutta sued defendant Davis for unlawful detainer. The court entered
a stipulated judgment 5/3/24. Plaintiff alleges defendant failed to make timely
payments as required by the stipulated judgment, resulting in default.
Plaintiff brought an ex parte application to shorten the time for
judgment to be entered. Min. Order 11/15/24. Defendant opposed, arguing the
motion is unnecessary, as plaintiff has possession of the property, and to the
extent plaintiff seeks back-rent, such requests are barred by the stipulated
judgment.
If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties,
for settlement of the case, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court retains
jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §664.6.
The
parties stipulated the court would retain jurisdiction. Plaintiff argues
defendant failed to make payments due 10/1/24 and 11/1/24 until 11/7/24, which
plaintiff rejected, as defendant was in default. Defendant does not contest the
late payments but argues plaintiff has possession of the property, and he is
willing and attempted to make the remaining payments under the terms of the
stipulated judgment, rendering the motion unnecessary. Defendant asserts
plaintiff brings the instant motion so as to collect back-rent in the future. This
is speculative and not before the court. The only issue is whether the terms of
the stipulated judgment were breached. Since defendant failed to pay, he breached
the terms of the stipulated judgment. Motion GRANTED.
