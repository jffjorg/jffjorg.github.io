And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Chun, and sustained their demurrer to the defendant's second amended cross-complaint. The defendant, Smith, had cross-complained against Chun for intentional tort and fraud arising from Chun's police reports and alleged assault, and then added a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, the judge found that the defendant's claims were insufficient to constitute a cause of action because they were based on Chun's protected activity of reporting the assault to law enforcement, and the defendant failed to offer allegations showing outrageous conduct by Chun sufficient to establish a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge also noted that the defendant's claims were similar to those previously found unavailing, and that the defendant failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action despite being given multiple opportunities to amend their pleading.
