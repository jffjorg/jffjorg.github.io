employment agreement and misuse of trade secrets. Defendants sued Aragon on

pending. 
Individual

Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss,
Transfer or Stay
Via
Code of Civil Procedure sections 410.30 and 418.10, a defendant may challenge a
plaintiff's selection of California as the forum for litigation. Cal-State
Bus. Prod. & Servs., Inc. v. Ricoh (1993) 12 Cal. App. 4th 1666, 1670.
“[T]he doctrine of forum non conveniens allows a trial court discretion to
decline to exercise jurisdiction over a cause and parties otherwise properly
before it if it concludes the action may be more appropriately and justly tried
elsewhere.” Id. at 1675. “In applying the traditional forum non
conveniens analysis, the trial court must engage in a two-step process, on
which the defendant bears the burden of proof. In the first step, the court
must determine whether a suitable alternative forum exists. (citation) If the
court finds that a suitable alternative forum exists, it must then balance the
private interests of the litigants and the interests of the public in retaining
the action in California. Animal Film, LLC v. D.E.J. Prods., Inc. (2011)
193 Cal. App.4th 466, 472. The existence of a suitable alternative forum is a
legal question. Id.
Defendants
argue the case should be dismissed because cases concerning the same parties
and subject matter have already been filed in more appropriate venues. 
Plaintiffs
argue all parties have strong ties to California, making it an appropriate
venue. Defendants Web Design and Consulting Services, Inc. and Ad.com
Interactive Media Inc are incorporated in California, as is plaintiff AD.Net,
Inc. Plaintiffs argue California is the correct venue due to California’s
strong public policy against noncompete clauses, and the parties’ connections
to California implicate that policy, which is regularly enforced against
out-of-state parties. See Application Group, Inc. v. Hunter Group,
Inc. (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 881; Globespan, Inc. v. O'Neill
(C.D.Cal.2001) 151 F.Supp.2d 1229.
Defendants
argue the parties’ interest in avoiding duplicative litigation outweigh the
public benefits of allowing this case to continue. 
Plaintiffs
argue California law strongly disfavors noncompete agreements, so there are
strong public benefits to allowing the case to continue her. “This statutory
prohibition on noncompetition agreements reflects not just a prohibition on
contracts restricting one's business or employment but a settled public policy
in favor of open competition.” In re Marriage of Greaux & Mermin
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1249. 
Though
California strongly disfavors noncompete clauses, judicial economy concerns
weigh against allowing this matter to proceed. Plaintiffs’ claims in the
instant action arise from the noncompete clauses in their previous employment
contracts with defendants; those same contracts and clauses are the subject
matter of the pending Florida and Maine lawsuits. Allowing the instant matter
to go forward would result in duplicate litigation and a significant risk of
competing judicial outcomes.
Defendants
argue, in the alternative, the case should be stayed pending resolution of the
Florida and Maine cases to avoid potentially conflicting outcomes on the same issues.
Both are suitable forums for resolution of the parties’ disputes. Judicial
economy favors staying this matter until the Florida and Maine cases can be
resolved.
The
motion to dismiss or transfer for forum non conveniens is DENIED. The motion to
stay is GRANTED pending resolution of the existing Florida and Maine cases.
