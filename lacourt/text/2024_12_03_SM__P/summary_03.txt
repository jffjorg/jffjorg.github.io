And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for trial preference filed by defendant Weinstein. Weinstein was criminally convicted of raping plaintiff Doe on December 19, 2022. He is now 72 years old, imprisoned in New York, and suffers from various medical conditions. Weinstein argues that he needs trial preference to prevent prejudice due to his age and health. Plaintiff Doe opposes the motion, claiming that Weinstein has not requested preference in other pending matters and that this is an attempt to avoid potential collateral estoppel arising from his ongoing criminal cases. The court finds that Weinstein has a substantial interest in the action as the sole defendant, and his health is such that preference is necessary to prevent prejudice. Therefore, the motion is granted.
