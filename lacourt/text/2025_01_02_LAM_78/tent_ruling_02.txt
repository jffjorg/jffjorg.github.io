 Case Number:  24STCV03770    Hearing Date:   January 2, 2025    Dept:  78 DEPT:  78 HEARING DATE: 01/02/2025 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 24STCV03770 CAROLYNE MARIA CHANDLER, et al. vs 1460 35TH ST, LLC PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR TYRONE NATHANYL OUTRAM, Age 5 TENTATIVE RULING: DENY  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimants and their guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Plaintiffs agreed to settle their claims against Defendants for the total amount of $80,000, with $2,500 being apportioned each to Tyrone Nathanyl Outram (“Claimant”). If the settlement is approved, $625 will be used for attorneys’ fees. The net balance of $1,875 will be deposited into a blocked account.  The petition filed on October 15, 2024 is denied for the following reasons:  On Items 4, 5, 6, and 7 on MC-350, Petitioner Carolyne Maria Chandler (“Petitioner”) refers to her own attached declaration. Petitioner’s declaration fails to provide all the information requested for these specific Items. The Court requests that Petitioner fill out the Items individually on the form as intended.  Item 10 on MC-350 is the amount offered to be paid to the particular claimant named in the petition, which differs from the total amount offered by all Defendants to the others in Item 11(b)(1). In other words, the aggregation of Item 10 and Item 11(b)(1) should equate to the full settlement amount. Here, Petitioner provides that Defendants are offering Claimant $80,000, and the other defendants $80,000, which does not match with Item 16. It appears that Item 10 should read $2,500, and Item 11(b) should read $75,500.  Item 13 on MC-350 requests a copy of any written fee agreement and a declaration from the attorney explaining the basis for the request, which should include a discussion of applicable factors listed in rule 7.955(b) of the Cal. Rules of Court. Here, Petitioner provides only a copy of the contingency fee agreement. No attorney declaration was attached to the petition.  Petitioner provides in Item 16 that $2,500 will be apportioned to Claimant, and that $625 will be used for attorney’s fees. Petitioner did not subtract the attorney’s fee from the gross proceeds to obtain the net balance for Item 16(f), which should equate to $1,875 and not $2,500 as stated.  Item 18 appears to be incorrectly filled. Petitioner is Claimant’s guardian ad litem, which is different from having a guardianship of a minor’s estate. Petitioner, through her counsel, is to carefully review the available options and consider whether Item 18(b) and Item 18(b)(2) are more appropriate under the facts of this matter.  Petitioner must reserve a new hearing date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least nine (9) court days before the continued hearing date.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
