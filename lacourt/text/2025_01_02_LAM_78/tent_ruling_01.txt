  Case Number:  23STCV12816    Hearing Date:   January 2, 2025    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ DIVINA VILLEDA and CONSUELO “LUCY” GAMBOA, Plaintiff(s), vs. VILMA HOOD, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 23STCV12816 Hearing Date: January 2, 2025   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS  I. BACKGROUND On January 11, 2024, Plaintiffs Divina Villeda (“Villeda”) and Consuelo “Lucy” Gamboa (“Gamboa”) (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against defendants Vilma Hood (“Hood”), Jan Tarble (“Tarble”), Dega Nalayeh (“Nalayeh”), Radostina “Tina” Videnova, San Pasqual Fiduciary Trust Company, As Trustee of The Jan Tarble Trust, Dated September 25, 1992 As Amended, Filipino American Personal Health Care Services, LLC, and Does 1 through 100. The FAC sets forth fourteen causes of action for (1) wrong termination – retaliation for protesting elder abuse (2) wrongful termination – retaliation for protesting failure to pay overtime wages, (3) violation of Labor Code §1102.5, (4) false imprisonment, (5) intentional interference with prospective economic relations, (6) negligent interference with prospective economic relations, (7) post-termination retaliation in violation of Labor Code §1102.5, (8) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (9) failure to pay overtime wages, (10) failure to pay minimum wage, (11) failure to provide meal periods, (12) failure to provide rest periods, (13) violation of Labor Code §226, and (14) violation of Labor Code §552. On October 22, 2024, Hood filed the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff Villeda’s seventh cause of action for post-termination retaliation in violation of Labor Code §1102.5. Hood argues section 1102.5 requires the existence of an employer-employee relationship at the time the alleged retaliatory action occurred, and that the FAC’s allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action for violation under this section. On December 18, 2024, Plaintiff Villeda filed an opposition. On December 26, 2024, Hood filed a reply that should have been filed no later than December 25, 2024. Although untimely, the Court will consider it.  II. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS Meet and Confer “Before filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the motion for judgment on the pleadings for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be reached that resolves the claims to be raised in the motion for judgment on the pleadings.” (CCP § 439(a).) The moving party shall file a declaration stating the “means by which the moving party met and conferred” and “that the parties did not reach an agreement resolving the claims raised by the motion for judgment on the pleadings.” (CCP § 439(a)(3).) Hood’s counsel declares they met and conferred telephonically with Plaintiffs’ counsel on October 17, 2024 regarding the seventh cause of action, and the parties did not reach an agreement. (Nair Decl. ¶ 2.) The Court finds Hood has met the meet and confer requirement prior to filing the motion. Timeliness “A motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made at any time either prior to the trial or at the trial itself. [Citation.]”¿(Ion Equipment Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 877.) While there are time limits for the motion brought pursuant to CCP section 438, there are no time limits for non-statutory common law motion for judgment on the pleadings.¿(Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650; Sofias v. Bank of America¿(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 583, 585-86.) Here, Hood brings a statutory motion under CCP § 438. Unless the court orders otherwise, a statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings cannot be made after entry of pretrial conference order (CRC Rules 3.720-3.730) or 30 days before the initial trial date, whichever is later.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 438(e).) Regardless of timeliness, “Granting leave to file an untimely motion for judgment on the pleadings is a matter in the trial court's discretion to control litigation before it.” (Sutherland v. City of Fort Bragg (2000) 86 Cal. App. 4th 13 fn. 4 [citing to Code of Civil Procedure section 438, subdivision (e)—authorizes the trial court to permit late filings of such motions and does not specify any grounds which might serve to limit its power to do so].) “Even if nonstatutory motions for judgment on the pleadings are still viable postsection 438…trial judges should think twice before becoming ensnared in addressing them on the merits on the eve of trial where, especially like here, the operative pleading has never been challenged before.” (Tung v. Chicago Title Company (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 734, 758-759.) This is the first time Plaintiff Villeda has challenged the FAC. Although the statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings is untimely, it was not brought on the eve of trial since the trial date is not until May 27, 2025. The Court exercises its discretion and will consider the motion on the merits.  III. LEGAL STANDARD A defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings when the “complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.”¿(CCP §438(b)(1) and (c)(1)(B)(ii).)¿¿ “A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.” (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999 (Citations).) The standard for ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322 (citing Schabarum v. California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216).)  IV. DISCUSSION Allegations of the FAC Here, the FAC alleges, in relevant part, the following. Defendants Hood and Tarble hired Plaintiff Villeda to be a caregiver for Tarble. (FAC ¶ 25.) During Plaintiff Villeda’s employment with Hood and Tarble, Plaintiff Villeda lived in a small room on Tarble’s property next to the main house, which was shared with her co-worker Plaintiff Gamboa. (Ibid.) Plaintiffs observed Hood’s abuse of Tarble, and after Hood ignored their protests of elder abuse, Plaintiff Villeda contacted Adult Protective Services (“APS”) in April 2022, reported to the Los Angeles Police Department in May 2022, and reported elder abuse to a nurse at Saint John’s Hospital after Tarble fell and fractured her hip on August 13, 2022. (FAC ¶¶ 40-41, 43.) In August 2022, the APS social worker arrived to interview Tarble; Hood yelled at Plaintiff Villeda that she knew she called APS, and to further intimidate Plaintiff Villeda from reporting elder abuse, Hood on several occasions stated she would fire and kill anyone who reported elder abuse to APS. (FAC ¶¶ 48-48.) On September 14, 2022, Plaintiff Villeda reported Hood’s emotional/psychological and financial abuse of Tarble during an interview with LAPD officers. (FAC ¶ 49.) On September 15, 2022, defendant Nalayeh told Plaintiff Villeda that she was fired effective immediately, and to pack her belongings and leave. (FAC ¶ 53.) Plaintiff Villeda alleges her protests of Defendants’ elder abuse of Tarble was a substantial motivating part of her termination, and that Defendants conspired to wrongfully fire Plaintiff Villeda in retaliation for her reports of illegal and improper conduct. (FAC ¶¶ 55-56.) About two days after Defendants terminated Plaintiff Villeda, Plaintiff Villeda alleges Defendants engaged in post-termination retaliatory acts against Plaintiff Villeda, such as hiring thugs to intimidate and threaten Plaintiff Villeda to move out the small shared room she had been living; illegally cutting off water, power, internet, changing locks, and making threats that she needed to vacate the small room; hiring a private investigator to intimidate and bully Plaintiff Villeda to leave; posting large signs calling Plaintiff Villeda a leech; that Hood stood outside the small room and took a picture of Plaintiff Villeda through the window; Defendant Nalayeh giving Plaintiff Villeda the finger; and pursuing an unlawful detainer action against her to intimidate and discourage her from pursuing this action for wrongful termination. (FAC ¶¶ 58-67, 138.) Plaintiff Villeda’s seventh cause of action for post-termination retaliation is brought pursuant to Labor Code § 1102.5 and/or public policy. The Parties’ Arguments Hood argues post-termination retaliation is not a legally cognizable claim under Labor Code § 1102.5, in reliance on  Hansen v. California Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation (2008) 171 Cal.App.4th 1537 (Hansen) and Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal.4th 260 (Soukup). In opposition, Plaintiff Villeda argues that Soukup is inapplicable because Soukup involved an anti-SLAPP motion, there was no cause of action for violation of section 1102.5, and that the Soukup court made the statement in passing. Plaintiff Villeda argues Hansen also involved an anti-SLAPP motion, and did not contain any analysis of the facts and law supporting a cause of action for violation of Labor Code §1102.5. Plaintiff Villeda contends Hansen relied on dicta in Soukup regarding the existence of an employer-employee relationship, and argues instead that “employee” in Labor Code §1102.5 should include “former employee”, and that the holdings of Robinson v. Shell Oil, (1997) 519 U.S. 337 (Robinson) and United States ex rel. Felten v. William Beaumont Hosp., No. 20-1002, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 9387 (6th Cir. Mar. 31, 2021) (Felten) support post-termination retaliation claims in the whistleblower context. In reply, Hood argues the plaintiff in Soukup alleged violation of Labor Code §1102.5 against her former employer and notes that the court undertook a detailed analysis of Labor Code §1102.5(b), which is binding precedent. For similar reasons, Hood contends Hansen is on point and binding, and that Labor Code §1102.5 is unambiguous and does not include “former employee” within the meaning of “employee.” Analysis The Court finds neither Robinson nor Felten relevant. Robinson involved an employment discrimination lawsuit under §704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and it examined the term “employees” as used specifically in § 704(a) of Title VII for retaliatory postemployment actions. Felten involved the anti-retaliation provision of the False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U.S.C.S. § 3730(h). Neither of the two cases involved or discussed Labor Code §1102.5. Cases are not authority for propositions not considered. (B.B. v. County of Los Angeles (2020) 10 Cal.5th 1, 11; citing Am. Fed'n of Lab. v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. (1996) 13 Cal. 4th 1017, 1039.) Under Labor Code section 1102.5, subdivision (b),¿ “[a]n employer, or any person acting on behalf of the employer, shall not retaliate against an employee for disclosing information, or because the employer believes that the employee disclosed or may disclose information, to a government or law enforcement agency, to a person with authority over the employee or another employee who has the authority to investigate, discover, or correct the violation or noncompliance, or for providing information to, or testifying before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry, if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation, regardless of whether disclosing the information is part of the employee's job duties.” In scrutinizing section 1102.5, courts must give the actual words of the statute their plain and commonsense meaning. (California Tchrs. Assn. v. Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified Sch. Dist. (1997) 14 Cal. 4th 627, 633.) The Court finds that there is no basis to read “employee” to include “former employee” as argued by Hood. “‘This court has no power to rewrite the statute so as to make it conform to a presumed intention which is not expressed.’ [Citations].” (Ibid.) Hood’s reliance on Robinson and Felten is therefore misplaced. The common law definition of “employee” applies to claims under the statute providing for whistleblower retaliation action against employer. (Bennett v. Rancho California Water Dist. (2019) 35 Cal. App. 5th 908, 924 [Term “employee” intended to describe the conventional master-servant relationship as understood by common-law agency doctrine.].) To make a claim under Labor Code §1102.5, which prohibits retaliation against employees for disclosing information relating to an employer’s alleged violation of state or federal statutes, a plaintiff must show (1) she disclosed information about her employer’s noncompliance with the law; (2) she was thereafter subjected to an adverse employment decision; and (3) a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action. (Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 287-288.) A prerequisite to asserting a violation of the whistleblower statute is the existence of an employer-employee relationship at the time the allegedly retaliatory action occurred. (Hansen v. California Dep't of Corr. & Rehab. (2008) 171 Cal. App. 4th 1537, 1546 citing Soukup v. L. Offs. of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal. 4th 260, 288.) The Court has reviewed Hansen and Soukup and finds them to be relevant to the matter. Contrary to Plaintiff’s contention, the Court does not find that Soukup’s analysis of Labor Code §1102.5 is dicta. In Soukup, Soukup claimed that defendants’ filing and maintenance of an underlying malicious prosecution against her was illegal as a matter of law because it violated Labor Code §1102.5(b) and 29 United States Code section 1140. The court concluded Soukup failed to meet her burden showing defendants’ initiation and maintenance of the underlying action violated these statutes as a matter of law because “a prerequisite to asserting a violation of Labor Code section 1102.5 is the existence of an employer-employee relationship at the time the allegedly retaliatory action occurred.” (Soukup, supra, 9 Cal. 4th  at 288.) Soukup conceded she was not an employee at the time she complained to the Department of Labor about the pension plan distribution or when the underlying action was filed to have violated the specific provisions of section 1102.5. In Hansen, plaintiff Hansen claimed that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) violated Labor Code §1102.5, alleging he was defamed by CDCR personnel following his retirement in retaliation for complaints made during his employment. There, Hansen could not meet his burden to show the probability of success on his first cause of action under Labor Code §1102.5 after defendant moved to strike the complaint under Section 425.16, because there must be a causal connection between plaintiff’s adverse employment action and plaintiff’s engagement in protected activity. In that case, Hansen alleged the retaliation took place after he retired. The Hansen court considered the language and purpose of Labor Code §1102.5(b), finding that the existence of an employer-employee relationship at the time the allegedly retaliatory action occurred is a prerequisite, in reliance on Soukup. As such, Hansen could not state a cause of action under section 1102.5. (Hansen, supra, 171 Cal. App. 4th at 1546.) Here, Plaintiff Villeda alleges retaliatory acts occurring two days after she had been terminated from her employment. (FAC ¶ 58.) "To prove a claim of retaliation under this statute, the plaintiff “must demonstrate that he or she has been subjected to an adverse employment action that materially affects the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.” [Citation].” (Francis v. City of Los Angeles (2022) 81 Cal. App. 5th 532, 540–41.) Because there was no employer-employee relationship at the time of these alleged retaliatory acts, such that there was necessarily no material effect on her employment, Plaintiff Villeda has not met the prerequisite to bring a cause of action under Labor Code §1102.5.  V. CONCLUSION Defendant Hood’s motion for judgment on the pleadings against Plaintiff Villeda’s seventh cause of action for post-termination retaliation in violation of Labor Code §1102.5 is GRANTED without leave to amend.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: December 31, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
