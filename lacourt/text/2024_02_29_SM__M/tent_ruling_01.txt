Legal
Standard
 
With respect to attorney fees and costs,
unless they are specifically provided for by statute (e.g., CCP §§ 1032, et
seq.), the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law
is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties.¿(CCP § 1021.) The
prevailing party on a contract, which specifically provides for attorney fees
and costs incurred to enforce the agreement, is entitled to reasonable attorney
fees in addition to other costs.¿(Civ. Code § 1717(a); CCP §§ 1032, 1033.5(a)(10)(A).)¿The
court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall determine the prevailing party
and shall fix, as an element of the costs of suit, the reasonable attorney
fees.¿(Civ. Code § 1717(a), (b).)¿Any notice of motion to claim attorney fees
as an element of costs under shall be served and filed before or at the same
time the memorandum of costs is served and filed; if only attorney fees are
claimed as costs, the notice of motion shall be served and filed within the
time specified in CRC 3.1700 for filing a memorandum of costs.¿(CRC 3.1702; Gunlock
Corp. v. Walk on Water, Inc. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303, fn. 1.) 
 
“It is well established that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence
of an abuse of discretion. [Citation.]” (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily
“begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v. Robinson
Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[A] computation of time
spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a
determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin v. Reg’l
Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided. (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing
factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].) Such an approach anchors
the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney’s
services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Id. at 48,
fn. 23.) The factors considered in determining the modification of the lodestar
include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the
skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Mountjoy v. Bank of Am. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 266, 271.) 
 
In challenging attorney fees as excessive
because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging
party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and
citations to the evidence.¿(Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)¿General
arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice. (Ibid.) 
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff Marina City Club
Condominium Owners Association moves for attorneys’ fees and costs against
Defendants Cynergy Group Int’l LLC and Mark Farag. Plaintiff claims it is entitled
to recover $23,035.46. Particularly, Plaintiff seeks fees in connection with
Defendants’ motion to enforce the settlement agreement pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure (CCP) section 664.6, which followed Plaintiff’s post-appeal fee
motion. 
 
There is no reasonable dispute that
Plaintiff is entitled to fees. The settlement agreement provides an award of
attorneys’ fees for fees arising from or relating to the settlement agreement,
including proceedings brought pursuant to CCP section 664.6. The Court has already
determined that Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this action generally,
including the underlying motions to enforce the settlement agreement per CCP
section 664.6. As such, Plaintiff is entitled to a fee award.
 
The Court is uncertain how
Plaintiff calculated the requested fees of $23,035.46. Plaintiff provides
verified time records of counsel, claiming 28.6 hours of work at $125.00 and $280.00
per hour. (Babikian Decl., Ex. 1.) Plaintiff also requests an increase to its
counsel’s rates to $350.00 per hour based on their training and experience.
However, using either rate would only result in a lodestar of $8,008.00 (at
$280.00 per hour) or $10,010.00 (at $350/hr.)—not $23,035.46. Further, the individual
amounts billed on verified time records do not add up to the requested fee. Using
those figures, the total amount billed comes to $7,613.69, including costs.
Even considering the anticipated fees for reply and appearance, Plaintiff does
not come close to establishing the full amount of the requested fees. Thus, the
Court will independently review the time records, determine the reasonable
amount of time worked on the claimed tasks, and award a reasonable rate for
that time considering counsel’s experience, education, and training. 
 
The Court finds that the verified
time records show counsel worked approximately 26.5 hours on this action since
the initial fee award. The Court discounts the anticipated time spent on reply,
since there was no opposition to this motion and thus no need to reply. Further,
the Court finds that a reasonable rate for counsel’s work would be $280, which
is consistent with the initial fee award. Using the lodestar method, Plaintiff
is entitled to an award of $7,220.00 in reasonable attorneys’ fees, plus costs
of $86.19, for a total award of $7,306.19. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
