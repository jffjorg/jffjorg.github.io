And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is about the motion for attorneys' fees and costs filed by the Plaintiff, Marina City Club Condominium Owners Association, against the Defendants, Cynergy Group Int'l LLC and Mark Farag. The Plaintiff is seeking $23,035.46 in fees and costs, but the judge is uncertain how the Plaintiff calculated this amount. The judge notes that the Plaintiff is entitled to fees under the settlement agreement, which provides for an award of attorneys' fees for fees arising from or relating to the settlement agreement. The judge determines that the Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this action and is entitled to a fee award.

The judge reviews the verified time records and determines that counsel worked approximately 26.5 hours on this action since the initial fee award. The judge discounts the anticipated time spent on reply and finds that a reasonable rate for counsel's work would be $280.00 per hour. Using the lodestar method, the judge awards the Plaintiff $7,220.00 in reasonable attorneys' fees, plus costs of $86.19, for a total award of $7,306.19. The motion is granted.
