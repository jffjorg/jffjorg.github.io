And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this case. The plaintiff, Alejandro Lopez, alleges that the defendant, Indizen Optical Technologies of America, LLC, et al., was negligent in its duty to maintain the premises where Lopez fell from the ceiling due to a live electric bus bar. However, the judge has found that the defendant did not have a duty to inspect the premises or warn others of the bus bar's location because it did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the bus bar's location and did not retain control over the premises.

The judge has also found that the defendant's lease agreement with the plaintiff's employer, Younger Optics, did not impose a duty on the defendant to inspect the premises or warn others of the bus bar's location. Additionally, the judge has found that the plaintiff failed to provide competent evidence to establish a triable issue of material fact regarding the defendant's alleged lack of control over the premises.

As a result, the judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment and has ordered the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
