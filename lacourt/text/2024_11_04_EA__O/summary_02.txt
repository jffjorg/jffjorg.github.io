The judge has granted the motion filed by Tina Abdolhosseini, counsel for Jon Edwards, to be relieved as counsel for Jon Edwards. The motion was granted due to a significant breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, despite efforts to obtain a voluntary substitution of attorney form from Jon Edwards. The judge found good cause to grant the motion, but noted that Jon Edwards has retained new counsel, as indicated by a notice of change of law firm address filed on October 25, 2024. The ruling is effective upon service of the court's order upon all parties.
