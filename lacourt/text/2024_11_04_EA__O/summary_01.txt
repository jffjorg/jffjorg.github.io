```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has continued the hearing on the defendant's motion for summary adjudication, pending the completion of depositions by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion, but instead seeks a continuance to complete the deposition testimony of the administrator of the defendant's facility, as well as the deposition of the person most knowledgeable at the regional center. The judge has determined that the depositions are necessary to reveal facts about the inadequate staffing and awareness of insufficient training and qualifications at the facility. The defendant has disputed the plaintiff's claims, stating that the plaintiff has taken a lackadaisical approach to completing depositions and that the plaintiff's counsel unilaterally noticed the continued deposition of the administrator. The judge has ruled that the motion will be continued pending the completion of the depositions.
