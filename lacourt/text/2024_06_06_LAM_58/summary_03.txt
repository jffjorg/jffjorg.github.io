English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is overruled. The court finds that the defendants' arguments are lacking in legal support and appear frivolous and interposed for an improper purpose. The court concludes that the defendants' arguments are not well-taken and that the plaintiffs have stated a cause of action. The court finds that the defendants' attempts to challenge the standing of the plaintiffs under the California Franchise Investment Law are unpersuasive. The court also rejects the defendants' arguments that the plaintiffs failed to plead the validity of the franchise agreement. The court orders the defendants to file and serve their answer to the First Amended Complaint on or before June 27, 2024.
