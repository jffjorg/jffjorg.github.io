And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that the settlement agreement between Defendant Shawn Tabetha Swanier and Plaintiff Charisse Evans is made in good faith. The court finds that the settlement amount of $40,000 is within the Tech-Bilt ballpark and does not appear to be grossly disproportionate to the Plaintiff's potential recovery. The court also notes that Defendant Swanier has already paid the settlement amount to the Plaintiff. The court grants the motion for determination of good faith settlement and orders Defendant Swanier to provide notice.
