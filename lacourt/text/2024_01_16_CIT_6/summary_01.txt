```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court sustains the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) with leave to amend. The FAC fails to plead a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation/fraudulent concealment because it does not allege facts demonstrating that the sales representative at the dealership was authorized to make any statements or representations on behalf of General Motors LLC. The FAC also fails to allege facts with the specificity required for fraud claims and does not demonstrate that General Motors LLC had a duty to disclose information to the plaintiff.

Additionally, the Court grants the motion to strike the request for punitive damages in the FAC because the FAC does not allege a cause of action that provides for punitive damages. The plaintiff must file and serve a Second Amended Complaint within 20 days of the Court's order, and then the defendant must file a responsive pleading per statute. Alternatively, if the plaintiff does not file and serve the Second Amended Complaint within 20 days of the Court's order, the defendant must file and serve an Answer to the remaining causes of action in the First Amended Complaint within 30 days of the Court's order.
