And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Cosentino Group, S.A., and granted the motion to quash service of summons. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to establish personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant was properly served, but the plaintiffs' evidence was insufficient to show that the defendant had sufficient minimum contacts with the state of California to establish personal jurisdiction. The court concluded that the plaintiffs' additional jurisdictional discovery, including a deposition of the defendant's officer, did not uncover evidence to support a finding of personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
