Superior Court (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1160, 1169)
  - "To establish the 'minimum contacts' necessary to create specific jurisdiction, Plaintiffs must establish that Defendant purposefully directed its acts to California and these acts create a 'substantial connection' with the state." (Walden v. Fiore (2014) 571 U.S. 277, 284)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash service of summons, finding that the plaintiff has not established personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The plaintiff had argued that the defendant's ownership of trademarks and its activities in California established minimum contacts, but the judge found that the evidence presented did not support this claim. The judge relied on several California cases to conclude that the defendant's activities in California were insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction. The judge specifically noted that the defendant's testimony at deposition did not show that the defendant had purposefully directed its activities to California. Therefore, the court declines to find that personal jurisdiction exists as to the defendant, and the motion to quash service of summons is granted.
