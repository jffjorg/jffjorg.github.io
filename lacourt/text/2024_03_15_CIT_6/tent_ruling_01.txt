  Case Number:  22PSCV00248    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Cindy Lo’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendant:  Treeium Inc.  TENTATIVE RULING             Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED on the condition that  Plaintiff submits a corrected Proposed Judgment on Judicial Council Form  JUD-100 reflecting the correct total amount of $46,595.16 as set forth herein.            BACKGROUND             This  is a breach of contract and fraud action. On March 16, 2022, plaintiff Cindy Lo  (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Treeium Inc. (Defendant) and  Does 1 through 100, alleging causes of action for fraud, breach of contract,  breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and negligent  hiring, supervision and retention. On December 18, 2023, the Court struck  Defendant’s answer to the complaint and entered default against Defendant for  failure to retain counsel. On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for  entry of default judgment, which the Court later denied without prejudice.              On  February 22, 2024, Plaintiff resubmitted the request for entry of default  judgment.            LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a  proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment  is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil  Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)  exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by  statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800.)  ANALYSIS Plaintiff seeks  default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $46,595.16,  including $46,050.00 in damages, $0.00 in interest, $0.00 in attorney fees, and  $545.16 in costs. The Court finds Plaintiff’s request for entry of default  judgment to be adequately supported by the evidence. However, the Court notes  that the Proposed Judgment on Judicial Council Form JUD-100 reflects different  calculations from those listed on Judicial Council Form CIV-100.  CONCLUSION              Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is GRANTED on the condition that Plaintiff  submits a corrected Proposed Judgment on Judicial Council Form JUD-100  reflecting the correct total amount of $46,595.16 as set forth herein.
