And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment in the reduced amount of $70,334.52. The plaintiff filed a breach of contract action against the defendants, DS Life Tree, Inc. and Jiahui David Shen, and default was entered against them. The plaintiff's default judgment package is incomplete due to an incorrect prejudgment interest calculation based on California law, whereas the contract is governed by Florida law. The court finds that the plaintiff's calculation is incorrect and grants the request for default judgment in the reduced amount, pending submission of a revised prejudgment interest calculation based on Florida law. If the plaintiff accepts the reduced amount, it must submit a new proposed judgment with the reduced amount.
