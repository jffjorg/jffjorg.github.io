 Case Number:  23PSCV00209    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Welding Certification Center’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendants:  Carlos Ramirez  and Felipe DeJesus Ramirez Garcia  TENTATIVE RULING             Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.            BACKGROUND             This  is a breach of contract action. On January 24, 2023, plaintiff Welding  Certification Center (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Carlos  Ramirez (Ramirez), Felipe DeJesus Ramirez Garcia (Garcia) (collectively,  Defendants) and Does 1 to 50, alleging one cause of action for breach of  written contract. On June 20, 2023, default was entered against Ramirez. On  October 26, 2023, default was entered against Garcia. On March 11, 2024,  Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment.            LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a  proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment  is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil  Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)  exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by  statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800.)  ANALYSIS Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $19,617.10,  including $11,649.00 in damages, $2,718.10 in interest, $5,250.00 in attorney  fees, and $0.00 costs. The Court finds multiple problems with Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment. First, Plaintiff did not provide a copy  of the original loan agreement at issue or a declaration in lieu of the  original explaining why the original could not be produced. (Cal. Rules of  Court, rule 3.1806; Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th  1118, 1122.) Second, it is not sufficiently clear how Plaintiff calculated its  request for prejudgment interest. (Londo Decl., ¶ 7; Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800, subd. (a)(3).) Third, Plaintiff’s supporting declaration fails to  adequately explain or provide justification for $5,250.00 in attorney fees when  the maximum recovery here would otherwise be $739.47 per Local Rule 3.214. (Londo  Decl., ¶ 8; Local Rule 3.214.)  CONCLUSION             Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
