 Case Number:  23PSCV02752    Hearing Date:   March 15, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  DHL Express (USA), Inc.’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendants: DS Life Tree, Inc., a corporation, and Jiahui David  Shen, an individual aka David Shen  TENTATIVE RULING             Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount  of $70,334.52. Alternatively, Plaintiff may submit a revised prejudgment  interest calculation based on Florida law.                  If Plaintiff accepts the reduced amount, Plaintiff shall submit a new Proposed Judgment with the  reduced amount.    BACKGROUND             This  is a breach of contract action. On September 8, 2023, plaintiff DHL Express  (USA), Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants DS Life Tree, Inc.  (Life Tree), a corporation, Jiahui David Shen, an individual aka David Shen  (Shen) (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 to 100, alleging causes of action  for breach of contract and breach of personal guarantee. Default was entered  against Life Tree on January 2, 2024, and against Shen on February 1, 2024.  Plaintiff submitted a default judgment package on February 1, 2024.            LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a  proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment  is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil  Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)  exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by  statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800.)  ANALYSIS Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $79,428.14,  including $69,730.46 in damages, $9,093.62 in interest, $0.00 in attorney fees,  and $604.06 in costs. The Court finds Plaintiff’s default judgment package is  otherwise in order, except for the prejudgment interest calculation. The laws  of the State of Florida govern the contract here. (Compl., Ex. 1, ¶ 7.) This  means the governing law for purposes of prejudgment interest is Florida law. (Airs  Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies Inc. (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th  1009, 1014 [New York choice-of-law clause governed recovery of prejudgment  interest].) Plaintiff’s calculation does not specify which state’s laws it  applied in calculating prejudgment interest here, but it appears it is based on  the 10% interest rate under California law. (See Gaba Decl., ¶¶ 3-4; Civ. Code,  § 3289, subd. (b).) If Plaintiff wishes to recover prejudgment interest in this  matter, Plaintiff may submit a new declaration containing a prejudgment  interest calculation under Florida law. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800,  subd. (a)(3).) Otherwise, the Court will disregard Plaintiff’s prejudgment  interest calculation, and grant default judgment in the reduced amount of $70,334.52.  CONCLUSION             Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $70,334.52.  Alternatively, Plaintiff may submit a revised prejudgment interest calculation  based on Florida law.              If Plaintiff accepts the reduced amount, Plaintiff shall submit a new Proposed Judgment with the  reduced amount.
