And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Jessica Cook's motion for attorneys' fees in the reduced amount of $8,460.00. The motion was filed in response to the Defendant's successful special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP motion) against Plaintiff Alexander Frankian. The judge finds that the Defendant is statutorily entitled to recover her attorneys' fees and costs under California Code of Civil Procedure §425.16(c)(1). The judge determines that the reasonable hourly rate for Defendant's counsel is $600 per hour and that the billed hours for the anti-SLAPP motion are reasonable, but reduces the total amount of fees requested by 50% due to concerns over the reasonableness of the fees and the lack of detailed time records.
