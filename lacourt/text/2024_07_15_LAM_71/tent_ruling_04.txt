1.   
Motion to Compel Hakopchrkyan - FROG
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses from Hakopchrkyan to Plaintiff’s FROG No. 17.1, the Court rules as follows.
           On or about November 12,
2023, Plaintiff served FROG (Set Two) on Hakopchrkyan via his counsel at the
time, Patricia Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”) at the Rodriguez Law Group Inc.  (Decl. of Haddad ¶2, Exhs. 3, 5.)  Hakopchrkyan never responded to the discovery
request.  (Decl. of Haddad ¶2.)  On November 13, 2023, Rodriguez sent
Plaintiff an email stating that she had recently served a notice of
unavailability as well as a Motion to Withdraw as Counsel for Defendants, which
Plaintiff never received.  (Decl. of
Haddad ¶3, Exh. 6.)  On December 12, 2023,
Rodriguez emailed Plaintiff stating that she had no working relationship with
Defendants.  (Decl. of Haddad ¶6, Exh. 9.)  As of the date of this motion no responses
have been served on Plaintiff.  (Decl. of
Haddad ¶9.)  Plaintiff now moves to
compel responses.  
           Plaintiff’s motion to
compel responses to Plaintiff’s FROG (Set Two) No. 17.1 is granted pursuant to
C.C.P. §2030.290(b).  Hakopchrkyan is ordered to provide
responses to Plaintiff’s FROG No. 17.1 compliant with C.C.P. §§2030.210(a) and
2030.220 without objections within 20 days.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions totaling $3,275.04 against Hakopchrkyan and his counsel, jointly and severally. 
The Court declines to award Plaintiff sanctions against Hakopchrkyan’s
former counsel, Rodriguez, because her inability to provide timely responses to
Plaintiff’s discovery requests was due to Hakopchrkyan’s
non-cooperation and procedural challenges in the withdrawal process, and not
due to any willful misconduct or negligence.
           Further, the Court declines to award Plaintiff
attorneys’ fees against Hakopchrkyan as a pro per litigant; Plaintiff did not incur
attorneys’ fees by hiring an attorney.  (Kravitz v. Superior Court (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1015,
1020.)

Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.

2030.220 without objections within 20 days.
