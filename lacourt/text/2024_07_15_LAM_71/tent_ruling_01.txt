Moy (“Moy”) and request for production of documents.  (Notice Quash Moy, pgs. 1-2.)  Defendants also move for sanctions against
Plaintiff and/or her counsel in the amount of $930.00.  (Notice Quash Moy, pg. 2; C.C.P. §2025.450.)  
          Defendants move to quash Plaintiff’s
notice of Deposition of Joe Santos (“Santos”) and request for production of
documents.  (Notice Quash Santos, pgs.

against Plaintiff and/or her counsel in the amount of $930.00.  (Notice Quash Santos, pg. 2; C.C.P. §2025.450.)

move for sanctions against Plaintiff and/or her counsel in the amount of

(Notice Quash Huang, pgs. 1-2.) 
Defendants also move for sanctions against Plaintiff and/or her counsel
in the amount of $930.00.  (Notice Quash Huang,
pg. 2; C.C.P. §2025.450.)   
Plaintiff
moves to compel the deposition of Moy, Conair LLC’s employee, and produce the
documents according to Plaintiff’s April 17, 2024, Deposition Notice.  (Notice MTC Moy, pgs. 2-3;
C.C.P. §§2024.050, 2025.450.)  Plaintiff
moves on the following grounds: (1) the Witness’s identity was first disclosed
to the Plaintiff by Conair’s April 10, 2024, production of documents that
Conair LLC had improperly withheld from production at its January 24, 2024,
deposition through its designee Jonathan Berera; (2) that fact discovery cutoff
in this matter occurred on April 16, 2024; (3) that on April 17, 2024 the
Plaintiff promptly served the Deposition Notice to require the Witness to
appear on May 1, 2024; (4) that Conair has not served a valid objection under C.C.P.
§2025.410; (5) that Conair seeks a protective order and refuses to produce the
Witness or documents based upon discovery cutoff and other unmeritorious
objections; (6) that there is good cause for production of requested documents;
(7) that the Plaintiff requires the evidence of the Witness’s testimony and
document production to oppose Conair’s pending motion for summary judgment and
to appropriately prepare for trial; and (8) that the Witness did not appear as
noticed.  (Notice MTC Moy, pg. 2.)  Plaintiff requests this Court first reopen
discover only as it pertains to Moy and, in the event that Conair LLC might
then maintain its refusal to timely produce the Witness, second to compel the
Witness to appear for, and to testify and produce documents at, deposition. (Notice
MTC Moy, pg. 2; Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products,
Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568.)  Plaintiff
also requests sanctions against Defendant Conair LLC and upon its attorneys Klinedinst
PC, Teresa M. Beck, Marianne Laleuf-Thom, and Natasha Mayat in the amount of $3,410.00.  (Notice MTC Moy, pg. 3; §§2023.010, et seq.,
2024.050(c), 2025.450(g).)

the documents according to Plaintiff’s April 17, 2024, Deposition Notice.  (Notice MTC Santos, pgs. 2-3; C.C.P. §§2024.050,
2025.450.)  Plaintiff requests this Court
first reopen discover only as it pertains to Santos and, in the event that
Conair LLC might then maintain its refusal to timely produce the Witness,
second to compel the Witness to appear for, and to testify and produce
documents at, deposition.  (Notice MTC Santos,
pg. 2; Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc., 165 Cal.App.4th at pg. 1568.)  Plaintiff also requests sanctions against Defendant
Conair LLC and upon its attorneys Klinedinst PC, Teresa M. Beck, Marianne
Laleuf-Thom, and Natasha Mayat in the amount of $3,410.00.  (Notice MTC Santos, pg. 3; §§2023.010, et
seq., 2024.050(c), 2025.450(g).)[1]
 
1.    
Defendants’
Motion to Quash Deposition Notice- Moy
Meet
and Confer
A party
moving to staying the taking of a deposition and quashing the deposition notice
must also file a meet and confer declaration under C.C.P. §2016.040.  (C.C.P. §2025.410(c).
Defendants’
counsel declares that on April 25, 2024, she sent meet and confer
correspondence to Plaintiff’s counsel requesting the deposition notices be
withdrawn as they were not timely served and harassing.  (Decl. of Mayat ¶9, Exh. D.)  Defendants’ counsel declares that on April
25, 2024, it timely served its objection to the Moy notice of deposition.  (Decl. of Mayat ¶10, Exh. E.)  Defendants’ counsel declares that on April
29, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel indicated he would not be withdrawing the notices
of deposition.  (Decl. of Mayat ¶11, Exh.
F.)  Defendants’ counsel’s meet and
confer declaration is sufficient under the statute.  Accordingly, the Court will consider the
instant motion.
 
Background
On January 24, 2024, Jonathan Berera appeared for
deposition and testified as the person most qualified (“PMQ”) designated by
Conair.  (Decl. of Mayat ¶2.)
On March 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel
Conair LLC PMQ Jonathan Berera to Attend and to Testify and Produce Documents
at Deposition. (Decl. of Mayat ¶3, Exh. A.) 
Therein, Plaintiffs sought an order from the Court to, among other
things, re-open discovery “for the limited purpose of conducting this deposition”
as the discovery cutoff occurred on April 16, 2024.  (See Decl. of Mayat ¶4, Exh. A at pg.
19, §H.)  Plaintiff further states, “[s]hould
the motion be granted … the Court will be ordering the Deposition to be conducted
after the April 16, 2024, discovery cut-off. Thus, to the extent necessary,
Plaintiff also moves to re-open discovery to conduct the Deposition.”  (Id.) 
On April 10, 2024, Defendants produced documents
that were at issue in the Motion to Compel, including emails that included
various employees as recipients thereof.  (Decl. of Mayat ¶5.)
On April 12, 2024, the Court heard the Motion to
Compel and granted it in part and denied in part, ordering the deposition of
Mr. Berera resume and the deponent answer questions about various topics on
which Plaintiff sought testimony. The Court otherwise denied the motion and did
not order discovery to be re-opened.  (See
Decl. of Mayat ¶6, Exh. B.)
On April 17, 2024, Plaintiff served four Notices of
Depositions of the employees who had been identified in the prior-produced
e-mails, including the Notice of Deposition at-issue. (See Decl. of Mayat
¶7, Exh. C.)  These Notice of Depositions
were served after the discovery cutoff.  (Decl.
of Mayat ¶8.)
On April 25, 2024, Defendant timely served objection
to the instant notice of deposition. 
(Decl. of Mayat ¶10, Exh. E.)
Defendants filed the instant motion on April 30,
2024.  Plaintiff filed her opposition on
May 16, 2024.  Defendants filed their
reply on May 21, 2024.
 
          Discussion
          C.C.P.
§2025.410(a) provides in part:
Any party served with a deposition
notice that does not comply with Article 2 (commencing with Section 2025.210)
waives any error or irregularity unless that party promptly serves a written
objection specifying that error or irregularity at least three calendar days
prior to the date for which the deposition is scheduled. 
 
(C.C.P. §2025.410(a).)  Further, “[a]ny party shall be entitled as a
matter of right to complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day . .
. before the date initially set for the trial of the action.”  (C.C.P. §2024.020(a).)
          Here,
Plaintiff sought an order from the Court via her Motion to Compel Deposition
to, among other things, re-open discovery “for the limited purpose of
conducting [the PMQ deposition],” as the discovery cutoff was to occur on April
16, 2024.  Plaintiff served the instant
deposition notice on April 17, 2024, after the discovery cutoff.  However, noticing a date after the discovery
cutoff date does not appear to be grounds for a motion to quash; the intended
date was not made in error by Plaintiff. 
Accordingly, the instant motion is not the appropriate procedural ground
for opposing Plaintiff’s motion.  Rather,
a motion to protective order would be the mechanism to seek appropriate
relief.  (See C.C.P.
§2025.420(b)(1).) 
Here, Defendants do not seek a protective order.
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to quash the
Deposition Notice of Moy is denied.
 
Sanctions
In light of the Court’s ruling, Defendants’ request
for sanctions is denied.
 
Conclusion
Defendants’ motion to quash the Notice of Deposition
to Moy is denied.
Defendants’ request for sanctions is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.

5.    
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Deposition- Moy
Background
Plaintiff’s December 20, 2023, notice of deposition
of Conair identified 20 matters for examination and included two document
requests including one for documents that the deponent had used in preparing
for the deposition.  (4/12/24 2024 Minute
Order, pg. 2.)
On January 24, 2024, Conair produced as its designee
witness Berera.  (4/12/24 Minute Order,
at pg. 2.)  Berera testified that he
consulted with one other employee of Conair to prepare for his deposition:
Ernst Miller.  (Decl. of Geragos ¶3, and Exh. 2 at 16:12-21, 42:16-19.)  Berera testified that he had reviewed a
website, his emails, design
documents, and an instruction booklet in order to prepare.  (Decl. of Geragos ¶3, and Exh. 2 at 42:20-43:1.)
Berera
did not produce any documents and Conair’s counsel instructed him not to answer
certain questions. (4/12/24 Minute
Order, pg. 2.)  Plaintiff filed a prior motion
to compel testimony and production of documents at that deposition. (Id.)  On April 12, 2024, the Court granted the prior
MTC in part and, among other things, ordered Conair to produce the documents
that Berera had used to prepare and compelled the resumption of Conair’s
deposition through Berera. (4/12/24 Minute
Order, at pgs. 4-5.) 
On
February 9, 2024, the Court granted Conair’s ex parte application to
continue trial in order to accommodate the July 9, 2024, hearing.  (2/9/24 Minute Order.)  The Court continued Trial from May 16, 2024,
to November 12, 2024.  (Id.)  The Court did not continue non-expert
discovery cutoff and instead left such fact discovery cutoff to be based upon
the former May 16, 2024, trial date subject “to any further motion or
application to extend such date.”  (2/9/24
Minute Order.) Fact discovery cutoff in this matter occurred April 16, 2024.
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on May 28,
2024.  Conair LLC filed its opposition on
July 1, 2024.  Plaintiff filed her reply
on July 8, 2024.
 
          Discussion
A judge cannot hear a party’s motion to compel
discovery after the cutoff date for discovery motions unless the party has
moved to reopen discovery under C.C.P. §2024.050.  (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc., 165
Cal.App.4th at pgs. 1586-1588 [stating it is a prejudicial abuse of discretion
for judge to grant motion without compliance with §2024.050].)  Such a motion to reopen may be made simultaneously
with the discovery motion to which it pertains, so long as there results some indication
in the record that the court considered the relevant factors including, but not
limited to, “[t]he necessity and the reasons for the discovery” and “[t]he
diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking . . . the hearing of a
discovery motion, and the reasons that . . . the discovery motion was not heard
earlier.”  (Id., at pgs. 1586-1587.)
Here, the statutory cutoff for non-expert discovery
in this action was April 16, 2024, and for hearing motions concerning the same
was May 1, 2024. Moy did not appear on May 1, 2024, for the noticed
deposition.  (Decl. of Geragos ¶10, Exh.
7.)
          Plaintiff requests in this motion that
this Court reopen discovery for the purpose of hearing the instant motion and
deposing Moy.  The Court exercises its
discretion to reopen discovery pursuant to C.C.P. §2024.050.  The factors weighing in favor of reopening
discovery include: (1) Moy’s deposition is necessary in order to discover
matters pertaining to the design, construction, and operation of the subject
blender, for the Plaintiff to appropriately prepare this matter for trial, and for
Plaintiff to present facts essential to justify opposition of Conair’s Motion for
Summary Judgment (Decl. of Geragos ¶12); (2) Plaintiff diligently sought the
discovery that revealed Moy’s identity, without limitation by requesting on
December 20, 2023 the production of documents on January 24, 2024, and Conair
first revealed the identity of Moy on April 10, 2024, just six days before non-expert
discovery cutoff; (3) the limited reopening of discovery sought by the instant motion
is unlikely to prevent the case from going to trial in November 2024 or to
interfere with any trial calendar, and Plaintiff will be prejudiced in the
event that discovery is not reopened; and (4) in February 2024, Conair LLC
requested the May 16, 2024 trial date be continued to November 12, 2024.
          Further,
Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause to compel the production of documents at
Moy’s deposition over Conair LLC’s boilerplate objections.  (See Associated Brewers Distributor Co. v.
Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 585-586.)  Here, Conair LLC has not asserted any
particular burden and there is nothing undue about requiring Conair LLC to
produce documents that Moy reviews or prepares or from Conair LLC’s files.
          Accordingly,
this Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel the deposition of Moy pursuant
to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders Moy to appear for deposition and produce documents and
things within twenty (20) days of this Court’s ruling.  
 
Sanctions
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to extend or to reopen discovery, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  (C.C.P. §2024.050(c).)
The Court declines to award sanctions on the basis
Conair LLC acted with substantial justification to oppose the instant motion
because discovery was closed, and the notice of deposition was untimely made in
the prior discovery cutoff period.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion to compel the deposition of Moy
is granted.  Moy is to appear for
deposition and
produce documents and things within twenty (20) days of this Court’s ruling.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
denied.
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
6.    
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Deposition- Santos
Discussion
Here, the statutory cutoff for
non-expert discovery in this action was April 16, 2024, and for hearing motions
concerning the same was May 1, 2024.  Santos
did not appear on May 1, 2024, for the noticed deposition.  (Decl. of Geragos ¶10, Exh. 7.)
Plaintiff requests in this motion that
this Court reopen discovery for the purpose of hearing the instant motion and
deposing Santos.  The Court exercises its
discretion to reopen discovery pursuant to C.C.P. §2024.050.  The factors weighing in favor of reopening
discovery include: (1) Santos’ deposition is necessary in order to discover
matters pertaining to the design, construction, and operation of the subject
blender, for the Plaintiff to appropriately prepare this matter for trial, and for
Plaintiff to present facts essential to justify opposition of Conair’s Motion for
Summary Judgment (Decl. of Geragos ¶12); (2) Plaintiff diligently sought the
discovery that revealed Santos’ identity, without limitation by requesting on
December 20, 2023 the production of documents on January 24, 2024, and Conair
first revealed the identity of Santos on April 10, 2024, just six days before non-expert
discovery cutoff; (3) the limited reopening of discovery sought by the instant motion
is unlikely to prevent the case from going to trial in November 2024 or to
interfere with any trial calendar, and Plaintiff will be prejudiced in the
event that discovery is not reopened; and (4) in February 2024, Conair LLC
requested the May 16, 2024 trial date be continued to November 12, 2024.
          Further,
Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause to compel the production of documents at
Santos’ deposition over Conair LLC’s boilerplate objections.  (See Associated Brewers Distributor Co. v.
Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 585-586.)  Here, Conair LLC has not asserted any
particular burden and there is nothing undue about requiring Conair LLC to
produce documents that Santos reviews or prepares or from Conair LLC’s files.
          Accordingly,
this Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel the deposition of Santos pursuant
to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders Santos to appear for deposition and produce documents and things within
twenty (20) days of this Court’s ruling.  
 
Sanctions
“The court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
extend or to reopen discovery, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.  (C.C.P.
§2024.050(c).)
The Court declines to award sanctions on
the basis Conair LLC acted with substantial justification to oppose the instant
motion because discovery was closed, and the notice of deposition was untimely
made in the prior discovery cutoff period.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions is denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion to compel the
deposition of Santos is granted.  Santos
is to appear for deposition and
produce documents and things within twenty (20) days of this Court’s ruling.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
denied.
