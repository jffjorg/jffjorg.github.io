ALEXANDER FRANKIAN,  
  
        
  vs.
 
JESSICA COOK.


 Case
  No.:  23STCV12216 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  July 15, 2024



 
Defendant Jessica Cook’s motion for attorneys’ fees against
Plaintiff Alexander Frankian is granted in the
reduced total amount of $8,460.00.
 
Defendant
Jessica Cook (“Cook”) (“Defendant”) moves for an order awarding her attorneys’
fees against Plaintiff Alexander Frankian (“Frankian”) (“Plaintiff”) in the total amount of $16,920.00
for fees incurred in connection with her special motion to strike (“anti-SLAPP
Motion”).  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2;
C.C.P. §425.16(c)(1).)  Defendant moves
on the grounds she prevailed on her anti-SLAPP Motion and is thus statutorily
entitled to recover her attorneys’ fees and costs, which are reasonable.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Background
On May 30, 2023, Plaintiff
filed his initial complaint against Defendant alleging five causes of action:
(1) conversion; (2) defamation; (3) breach of oral contract; (4) civil
extortion; and (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress.  
On January 4, 2024, this
Court heard oral argument on Defendant’s anti-SLAPP Motion, denying Defendant’s
motion as to the whole complaint and granting as to the 4th and 5th causes of
action.  (1/4/24 Minute Order.)
On January 8, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant motion for attorneys’ fees. 
On May 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition, noting Defendant did not
serve the instant motion on him.  As of
the date of this hearing no reply has been filed.
 
Discussion
C.C.P.
§425.16(c)(1) provides, in part, “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to
strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.”  California law makes the award of attorneys’
fees and costs to a prevailing anti-SLAPP defendant mandatory.  (See Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1131 [“[u]nder Code of Civil Procedure §425.16, subdivision (c), any
SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to strike is entitled to
mandatory attorney’s fees.”].)  Here, Defendant
was the prevailing party in the Anti-SLAPP Motion.  (See 1/4/24 Minute Order.)  Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for
attorneys’ fees is proper and she is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and
costs.
 
Reasonable Fees
The California Supreme Court has determined
the lodestar method is the proper mechanism to calculate attorneys’ fees under
C.C.P. §425.16(c).  (See Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at pg. 1136.)  To calculate a
lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by Defendant’s counsel.  The “reasonable hourly rate” applicable under
the lodestar method is the rate “prevailing in the community for similar work.”
 (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  “The trial court
makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors, including
the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill
required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success
or failure, and other circumstances in the case.”  (Id. at pg. 1096.)
Defendant’s Counsel declares his hourly rate
is $600.  (Decl. of Shafie ¶7.)  The Court determines based on its experience
that Defendant’s Counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable in his community of
practice.
Plaintiff’s argument that Defendant’s
Counsel’s fees are excessive is not well taken. 
Defendant’s counsel’s status as a sole practitioner, disciplinary record
on the state bar website, and negative Yelp.com reviews are insufficient to
demonstrate excessive fees.  (See Opposition, pg. 4.)
 
Billed Hours
The verified time entries of the attorneys
are entitled to a presumption of credibility, which extends to an attorney’s
professional judgment as to whether time spent was reasonably necessary to the
litigation.  (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396 [“We think
the verified time statements of the attorney as officers of the court are entitled
to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.”].)
 “California courts do not require detailed
time records, and trial courts have discretion to award fees based on
declarations of counsel describing the work they have done and the court’s own
view of the number of hours reasonably spent.”  (Syers
Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698-699.) 
Here, Defendant’s counsel submits billing
statements in support of his motion. 
(Decl. of Shafie ¶8, Exh. B.)  Defendant’s
counsel declares that he worked 25.2 hours on the anti-SLAPP motion and
anticipates billing an additional two hours to review the opposition and draft
a reply and one hour to attend the hearing on the motion for a total of 28.8
hours ($16,920.00).  (Decl. of Shafie ¶8,
Exh. B.)  
Plaintiff’s arguments in opposition to Defendant’s
motion are well taken.  The anti-SLAPP
motion is barely five pages long, yet Defendant’s counsel billed 15.3 hours for
his work.  Further, the reply to the
anti-SLAPP motion was barely six paragraphs and acknowledged that Defendant’s
counsel’s declining health forced him to hire paralegals to assist him with the
anti-SLAPP motion, which resulted in mistakes that he did not pick up on when
reviewing Defendant’s declaration. 
(12/26/23 Decl. of Shafie ¶4.)
Defendant’s counsel’s billing record is in
conflict with the declaration he submitted in lieu of a reply to the anti-SLAPP
motion; there is no billing record of paralegals assisting Defendant’s counsel
in the drafting of the anti-SLAPP motion, and all fees are billed at
Defendant’s counsel’s $600 per hour rate.
Accordingly, the Court reduces Defendant’s
requested hours by 50% of the requested total, or $8,460.00, granting Defendant’s
requested hours in the reduced total of $8,460.00.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion is granted in the reduced amount of $8,460.00.
