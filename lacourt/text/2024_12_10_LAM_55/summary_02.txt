And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of Tesla, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration in a lemon law action brought by Mathew Noto. Noto had alleged that Tesla had violated the Song-Beverly Consumer Protection Act, but Tesla argued that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration rather than a court trial. The judge found that the arbitration agreement signed by Noto when he purchased a 2017 Tesla Model from Tesla contained a valid arbitration provision. Noto had argued that the limitation of liability provision in the agreement waived his rights under the Song-Beverly Act, but the judge found that the provision only applied to "incidental, special, or consequential damages" and not to the full range of arbitrable issues. The judge concluded that Tesla's interpretation of the agreement was persuasive and that Noto's claims should be limited to his alleged violations of the Song-Beverly Act. As a result, the judge granted Tesla's motion to compel arbitration.
