  Case Number:  24STCV08921    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  55 Defendants' anti-SLAPP motionsOn 8/23/2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of related case in this case and the low-numbered case 22STCV26316. This Court understands that this lawsuit for malicious prosecution arises out of the litigation in 22STCV26316. To date, the court in the low-numbered case has not ruled on the NORC. This Court is not going to hold a hearing on the anti-SLAPP motions until the NORC has been ruled on by the other department because the case may not end up staying in Department 55. The Court will discuss the pending NORC with counsel and set a continued date for the anti-SLAPP motions in this department should this case remain in Department 55 after the decision on the NORC in the low-numbered court.
