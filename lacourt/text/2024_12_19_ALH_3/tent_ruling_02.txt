I.       INTRODUCTION
         On November
17, 2023, plaintiff Marti Mackey (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
defendants City of Pasadena (“City”) and Jim Wong (“Wong”) for elder abuse and
negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiff alleges
that she was wrongfully evicted from 540 N. Marengo Ave. #3, Pasadena, CA 91101
(“Property”) after City accepted $150,000 from a junior lienholder to reconvey its
first lien deed of trust, which allowed the Property to be foreclosed upon. (Compl.,
¶ 13.) Plaintiff alleges she was not required to make any monthly payments to
the City because the Property “was designated for low to moderate income by the
[City].” (Compl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff claims she paid property taxes and maintained
the Property for 6 years as required under the terms of the City’s lien. (Compl.,
¶. 3.) Plaintiff further alleges that the payoff of the lien was concealed and
that City failed to provide alternative housing to her even though she is a
handicapped senior. (Comp., ¶¶ 15, 17.) 
          On
April 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint,
asserting causes of action for breach of implied contract, negligent
misrepresentation, intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”) and
negligent infliction of emotional distress (“NIED”). The FAC, which consists of
over 70 pages of exhibits, alleges that City impliedly agreed that Plaintiff
could stay in the Property subject to the City’s lien and breached this
agreement when it reconveyed its lien. (FAC, ¶¶ 52-54.) Plaintiff alleges Wong,
as City’s employee, made misleading statements about the City’s intent to
preserve affordable housing units, causing her to pay significant amounts in
back taxes, homeowners’ association fees, and maintenance. (FAC, ¶¶ 56-57.)
Plaintiff also alleges she suffered emotional distress due to the foreclosure
and eviction and that Defendants acted with reckless disregard when she was
legally blind and unable to obtain alternate housing. (FAC, ¶¶ 59, 62.) 
          On
June 27, 2024, Defendants filed this demurrer arguing that Plaintiff fails to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Defendants also filed a
request for judicial notice. 
          On
October 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amendment naming “City of Pasadena
Successor-in-Interest to Pasadena Community Development Commission” as Doe 1. 
          On
November 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition brief. On November 5, 2025,
Plaintiff filed exhibits in support of her opposition brief and objections to Defendants’
request for judicial notice. 
          Defendants
filed a reply brief on November 12, 2024, responding to Plaintiff’s opposition
brief and objection. 
          On
November 19, 2024, the Court continued the hearing to allow Plaintiff to file any
admissible evidence regarding her non-receipt of a rejection notice by December
5, 2024. Defendants were also allowed to file a response. Plaintiff filed a
declaration on December 4, 2024. Defendants have not filed anything in response
to Plaintiff’s declaration. 
II.     LEGAL
STANDARDS
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of the pleadings and will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on
its face. (City of Atascadero v. Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445,
459.)  “We treat the demurrer as
admitting all material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions
or conclusions of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint
as true and also consider matters which may be judicially noticed. [Citation.]”
(Mitchell v. California Department of
Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d
593, 604 [“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally construed. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452.) In construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to
specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or
conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn
(1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.) 
III.    DISCUSSION
          Request
for Judicial Notice 
          Defendants
request the Court take judicial notice of: (1) Claim No. 2023-0280 (“First
Claim”) filed on April 14, 2023, by Plaintiff with the City, (2) a notice of
rejection of Plaintiff’s First Claim (“First Notice of Rejection”), (3) Claim
No. 2024-0201, filed on February 26, 2024 (“February 2024 Claim”), (4) Claim
No. 2024-0294 filed by Plaintiff on June 7, 2024 (“June 2024” Claim).
Defendants also request judicial notice of Article X of the Charter of the City
of Pasadena. 
          Plaintiff
objects to the First Notice of Rejection and Article X, but the Notice of
Rejection is judicially noticeable as an “official act” and record maintained
by City (Evid. Code § 452(c)) and Article X of the City’s charter is law (Evid.
Code, § 452(a).) Accordingly, Defendants’ request for judicial notice is
GRANTED. 
“Tort Claims Act
          Prior to
filing a suit against a public entity, a plaintiff must comply with the
Government Tort Claims Act, which states, in part: “no suit for money or
damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of action for which a
claim is required to be presented . . . until a written claim therefor has been
presented to the public entity and has been acted upon by the board, or has
been deemed to have been rejected by the board . . .” (Gov. Code, § 945.4.) Once
a governmental entity has sent proper written notice rejecting a claim, the
plaintiff has six months thereafter to file suit against the entity. (Gov.
Code, § 945.6, subd. (a)(1).) The six-month period commences as soon as the
notice is properly personally delivered or deposited in the mail even if not
actually received by the claimant. (Ibid.) If written notice is not
given, a claimant shall have 2 years from the accrual of the cause of action to
file suit. (Gov. Code, § 945.6, subd. (a)(2).) 
          Here,
Plaintiff presented her First Claim on April 14, 2023. The First Claim reflects
the date of loss as April 14, 2023, and states, in part, the following: 
-     
“City
did not inform claimant or probate court of selling/or reconveying Jenkins DoT-1st
lien. 2nd lien of R. May not valid as per Alhambra Court Case # 22AHCV00602. 
-     
“Claim
is for loss of housing – when sheriff arrives = $750,000”
-     
“Emotional
distress: 100k” 
-     
 “+legal fees 100K or as attorney submits”
-     
Claimant
is 72 and legally blind. 
(Serkisian Decl., Ex. A.) As for Plaintiff’s February or
June Claims, those appear to concern other events not related to this action
because Plaintiff identifies the date of loss on those as “January 31, 2024,
and ongoing” (Serkisian Decl., Ex. C) and May 12 and May 28, 2024; therefore,
they do not relate back to the First Claim. 
City claims it sent a notice of
rejection on May 4, 2023, to Plaintiff’s P.O. Box 91722 in Pasadena, CA. Plaintiff
then filed suit on November 17, 2023. Defendants point out that Plaintiff’s
First Claim states “loss of housing”, “emotional distress”, and “legal fees” as
her injuries arising from City’s reconveyance of its deed; therefore,
Plaintiff’s FAC alleges claims which were reflected in her First Claim and
rejected on May 4, 2023, and this action should have been filed within 6 months
of May 4, 2023.  
          In opposition,
Plaintiff argues that her suit is timely filed because she filed a claim on
April 14, 2023, and then re-submitted it because she forgot to date the first
one. Plaintiff claims the City received this amended claim (attached as Exhibit
1) sometime between April 20 and April 24, 2023, but never sent a second notice
of rejection. Plaintiff contends that because City did not act on her
resubmitted claim, she had two years from the accrual of her causes of action
to file the lawsuit. (Gov. Code, § 945.6, subd. (a)(2).) Plaintiff also
declares under penalty of perjury that she never received the City’s First
Notice of Rejection in response to her claims. (Mackey Decl., 1:6-8.) 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff “cannot
revise or reset the statute of limitations by re-filing a second claim with
some of the same allegations.” (Demurrer, p. 8.) The Court agrees. Government
Code section 910.6(a) states: A claim may be amended at any time before the expiration of the
period designated in Section 911.2 [6 months after cause of action accrues] or
before final action thereon is taken by the board, whichever is later, if the
claim as amended relates to the same transaction or occurrence which gave rise
to the original claim. The amendment shall be considered a part of the original
claim for all purposes. (Gov. Code, § 910.6, subd. (a).) Based on this statute,
the City was not required to send a second notice of rejection to Plaintiff’s re-submitted
claim sent in April 2023 because the re-submitted claim related to the same
transaction or occurrence underlying the First Claim. (Compare Opp., Ex. 1 with
Serkisian Decl., Ex. A.) Although Plaintiff does not include all pages of her
re-submitted claim, Plaintiff admits that her First Claim was not dated,
therefore she re-submitted it to include the date. Amending the claim to add a
date by her signature is not grounds for construing the re-submitted claim as
an entirely new claim. Therefore, she is not entitled to two notices of
rejection. 
However, Plaintiff raises legitimate issues
with the way that the First Notice of Rejection was served. An action against a
public entity must be brought within six months of written notice of a claim
denial. (Gov. Code, § 945.6.) Written notice may be given by mail and the
statute of limitations expires six months from the day the notice of rejection
is deposited in the mail. Where notice is given by mail, “[p]roof of mailing
may be made in the manner prescribed by Section 1013a of the Code of Civil
Procedure.” (Gov. Code, § 915.2.) Code of Civil Procedure section 1013a(3) states
that mail service is presumed invalid if there is more than a one-day
difference between the postmark or postage meter date and the date of service
shown on the proof of service. If no notice is given, a claimant has two years
from the accrual of the cause of action to file suit. (Gov. Code, § 945.6,
subd. (a)(2).) 
Here, the proof of service for the
Notice of Rejection states it was deposited in the mail on May 4, 2023. In her
supplemental declaration, Plaintiff explicitly denies having ever receiving it in
the mail and states that she first saw the Notice of Rejection on May 28, 2024,
when it was sent to her via email by defense counsel. Plaintiff states that the
post office does not return mail for any box that remains open and that she has
opened every piece of mail received, “checking particularly for anything
pertaining to legal matters,” but never received the Notice of Rejection from
the City. (Id., 1:24-25.) Plaintiff also authenticates proofs of service
for Defendants’ demurrer that were dated and signed on a Thursday but not
metered until Monday. (Mackey Decl., 2:15-18.)
Notably, Defendants did not address
Plaintiff’s arguments regarding mail service or submit evidence rebutting the
presumption of invalid service despite being given an opportunity to respond. Instead,
Razmik Serkisian only declares that he caused the Notice of Rejection to be
deposited in the mail in accordance with the normal practices and procedures of
his office. (Serkisian Decl., ¶ 3.) However, Plaintiff’s exhibits reflect that
the practices and procedures of the office do not apparently comply with Code
of Civil Procedure section 1013a. Absent a declaration regarding the normal
business practice for collecting and processing outgoing mail, Defendants do
not overcome the presumption of invalid service. (Katelaris v. County of
Orange (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1211, 1214-1216.) 
          Therefore,
the Court OVERRULES the demurrer based on the statute of limitations and
proceeds to evaluate the remainder of Defendants’ demurrer to the FAC.
          Plaintiff’s
Claims against Wong
As an initial matter, Defendants argue
that Plaintiff cannot bring any claims against Wong as a public employee
because he was not named in Plaintiff’s First or Second Claim. (Demurrer, p.
10.) The Court agrees. Plaintiff alleges that she was in contact with Wong
since 2019 (see, e.,g., FAC, ¶ 30.) She also called Wong in early
2023, notifying him of her need for affordable senior housing, and spoke with
him “[i]n about March-April, 2023” about motel vouchers. (FAC, ¶ 45.)
Plaintiff’s failure to include him in her claims mailed in April 2023 bars her
ability to file suit against him now. (Gong v. City of Rosemead (2014)
226 Cal.App.4th 363, 376 [factual allegations in complaint must correspond with
facts alleged in timely claim]; Munoz v. State of California (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 1767, 1776.) Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to the First,
Second, Third, and Fourth Causes of Action is SUSTAINED as to Wong (insofar as
Plaintiff intended to assert them against him) without leave to amend, leaving
only Plaintiff’s claims against City for consideration.  
First Cause of Action for Breach of
Implied Contract
          A contract
with a charter city is not binding unless it is formed in accordance with the
city charter. (First Street Plaza Partners v. City of Los Angeles (1998)
65 Cal.App.4th 650, 670. A contract that is made otherwise than as prescribed
by controlling legislative enactment, “is not binding or obligatory as a
contract and the doctrine of implied liability has no application in such
cases.” (Reams v. Cooley (1915) 171 Cal. 150, 153- 154.) Pasadena’s City
Charter states, “All contracts shall be in writing, and shall be executed in
the name of the City of Pasadena by an officer or officers authorized to sign
the same. All contracts shall be approved as to form by the City Attorney
before the execution thereof.” (Article X, Section 1001). Thus, City cannot be
sued for a breach of implied contract as the Charter expressly states that any
and all contracts must be in writing. (See Los Angeles Equestrian Center,
Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 432, 448-449.) 
          Defendants’
demurrer to the First Cause of Action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
          Second
Cause of Action for Negligent Misrepresentation
          Plaintiff
alleges that Wong made misleading statements “about the City’s intent to
preserve the City’s affordable housing units.” These statements led her to
“pa[y] significant amounts for catching up taxes from 2013 on, catch[] up HOA
dues owed in arrears by Robert May, and [make] property improvements.” (FAC, ¶
56.) Plaintiff states she would not have done so if she knew that City would
reconvey its lien and has suffered significant financial loss. (FAC, ¶ 57.) 
          City demurs
to this cause of action on the grounds that Government Code section 818.8 does
not allow a public entity to be held liable for injuries caused by an
employee’s misrepresentation, whether the misrepresentation was negligent or
intentional. City also argues that Plaintiff did not include any allegations of
misrepresentation in her First or Second Claim. Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer
to the Second Cause of Action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.  
          Third and
Fourth Causes of Action for IIED and NIED
City argues that it cannot be held
liable for IIED or NIED as they are common law claims and Plaintiff fails to
allege a statutory basis for these claims. In her opposition, Plaintiff cites
to Civil Code section 1714. This reference, however, is unavailing because it does
not provide the requisite statutory authority for a claim against a public entity.
(Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Authority (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1182.)
Therefore, Defendants’ demurrer to the Third and Fourth Causes of Action are
SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
IV.    CONCLUSION
Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer is
SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
Moving party to give notice.
