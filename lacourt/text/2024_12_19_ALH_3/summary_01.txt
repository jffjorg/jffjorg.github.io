And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendant/cross-complainant, Onni Paseo LLC, seeking leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint and to continue the trial date. The motion is unopposed and the judge has granted the motion, allowing Onni Paseo LLC to file the proposed First Amended Cross-Complaint within 10 days of the date of the order. The First Amended Cross-Complaint adds the City of Pasadena as a cross-defendant and asserts a claim for declaratory relief. The judge has also granted the motion to continue the trial date, finding good cause due to the addition of the new party, the City of Pasadena, and the need for additional discovery. The final status conference is continued to a later date, and discovery and motion cut-off deadlines will be based on the new trial date.
