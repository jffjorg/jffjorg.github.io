  - "The court finds that Defendant has not met its burden of showing that (1) there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record, and (2) the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to seal exhibit 9 to the declaration of Teresa Avila-Martinez. The defendant claimed that the exhibit contained confidential and proprietary business information, but failed to identify specific instant messages that supported this claim. The judge found that the defendant did not meet its burden of showing an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record, and that the proposed sealing was not narrowly tailored. The judge also noted that the court's review of some of the documents showed that most of the messages did not appear to include confidential and proprietary information. As a result, the judge denied the motion to seal and ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
