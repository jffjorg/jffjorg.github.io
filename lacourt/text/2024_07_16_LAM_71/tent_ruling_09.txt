Unlawful Detainer (1st COA)
To establish a claim for
unlawful detainer, a plaintiff must prove the following elements: (1) plaintiff
owns/leases the property; (2) plaintiff rented/subleased the property to
defendant; (3) under the lease/rental agreement/sublease, defendant was required
to pay rent in a specified amount per period; (4) plaintiff properly gave
defendant three days’ written notice to pay the rent or vacate the property;
(5) as of the date of the three-day notice, at least the amount stated in the
three-day notice was due; (6) defendant did not pay the amount stated in the
notice within three days after service/receipt of the notice; and (7) defendant
is still occupying the property.  (See C.C.P. §1161; CACI 4302.)
Plaintiff submitted undisputed
evidence that it owns the Premises leased to Defendant.  (Decl. of Saghian ¶4,
Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff submitted undisputed
evidence that it entered into an oral lease agreement for the Premises with
Defendant on February 1, 2023, for the amount of $4,000.00 to be paid on the
first day of each calendar month.  (Decl.
of Saghian ¶5.)  Plaintiff submitted
undisputed evidence that the three-day notice of pay rent or quit was
personally served to Defendant.  (Decl. of Saghian ¶6, Exhs. 2, 3.)  Plaintiff submitted undisputed evidence that after
the three-day notice of pay rent or quit, Defendant failed to pay or quit
possession of the Premises, and Plaintiff has not received any rent from
Defendant since March 2023 and Defendant is still in possession of the Premises.  (Decl. of Saghian ¶8.)  Plaintiff met its burden to demonstrate there
is no triable issue of material fact and it is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law.  Ordinarily, Plaintiff would
shift the burden to Defendant to raise a triable issue of material fact.  However, this motion is unopposed, and no
burden-shifting is applicable.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for summary judgement is
granted.
