TENTATIVE RULING
 



PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, ex rel.,
  ALLSTATE INSURANCE COMPANY,
  
         vs.
 
ADAM AVELARDO PEREZ, et al.


 Case No.: 
  21STCV45088
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  July 16, 2024



 
Plaintiff-Relator Allstate
Insurance Company’s motion to compel the deposition of Nonparty ProCare
Funding, LLC for business records is granted. 
ProCare is
ordered to appear for deposition and produce documents within 30 days of this
ruling.
 
          Plaintiff-Relators Allstate Insurance
Company’s (“Allstate”) (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel
the deposition of Non-party ProCare Funding LLC (“ProCare”) to appear for
deposition to produce business records issued on November 29, 2023.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2;
C.C.P. §2025.480(a).)  Plaintiff moves on
the basis ProCare failed to produce any responsive documents in compliance with
the lawfully issued subpoena without justification.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
          Meet and Confer
A
motion to compel a deposition must be accompanied by a declaration stating
facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion.”  (C.C.P.
§§2016.040, 2025.480(b).)
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that on March 19, 2024, she sent Defendant’s counsel Reed a
detailed meet and confer letter explaining the deficiencies in ProCare’s
purported objections to the subpoena. 
(Decl. of Stassi ¶6, Exh. D.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration substantially complies with the
requirements of C.C.P. §2016.040.
 
Background
On December 1, 2023, Plaintiff served a notice for
the deposition for production of business records to ProCare set for December
19, 2023.  (Decl. of Stassi ¶3, Exh. A.) 

On January 19, 2024, ProCare’s counsel set forth
ProCare’s purported objections to the subpoena in a letter.  (Decl. of Stassi ¶5, Exh. C.) 

Plaintiff filed the instant motion on March 22,
2024.  ProCare filed its opposition on July
3, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its reply on July
8, 2024.
 
          Discussion
Where a deponent fails to produce any document, the
subpoenaing party may move the court for an order compelling the production of
documents, upon a showing of good cause.  (C.C.P. §2025.480(a);
see also Thai v. Richmond City Ctr., L.P. (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 282,
289.)  “Good cause” may be established
where the request is made in good faith and that the documents sought are
relevant to the subject matter and material to the issues in the litigation.  (Associated Brewers Distributing Co. v.
Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586-587.) 
Documents are discoverable from third parties where
they are reasonably likely to lead to the discoverable information or aid in
evaluation of the claims. “In the context of discovery, evidence is relevant if
it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating its case, preparing for trial,
or facilitating a settlement.”  (Moore
v. Mercer (2016) 4 Cal. App. 5th 424, 447.)  The broad scope of permissible discovery “is
equally applicable to discovery of information from a nonparty as it is to
parties in the pending suit.”  (Johnson
v. Superior Court (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1050, 1062.)  At this stage, relevance is construed broadly
and “[a]dmissibility is not the test,” “information unless privileged, is
discoverable if it might reasonably lead to admissible evidence.”  (Stewart v. Colonial W. Agency, Inc.
(2001) 87 Cal.App. 1006, 1013.)
Here, good cause exists to compel compliance with
Plaintiff’s deposition subpoena.  The
only documents Plaintiff has requested from ProCare are related to the
transactions that form the fraudulent scheme alleged in the operative pleading.
 (SAC ¶¶75-92.)  Plaintiff has pursued party discovery,
including written interrogatories and requests for production of documents
served on New Hope, which has revealed that ProCare’s arrangement with New Hope
is similar to the arrangement New Hope has with Healthcare Financial Solutions,
LLC (“HFS”).  (Decl. of Stassi ¶8.)  Specifically, like HFS, ProCare agreed to
(and did) purchase patient accounts from New Hope prior to any patient services
(MRIs) having been rendered and paid New Hope up front for the accounts, as set
forth in the “Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement Between ProCare Funding,
LLC (“Buyer”) and Adam Avelardo Perez d/b/a New Hope Imaging Services
(“Seller”)” dated March 10, 2021 that Defendants produced in discovery.  (Decl. of Stassi ¶8.)  The agreement was subsequently amended in 2019,
and Defendants produced the amendment and a bill of sale from 2021 relating to
ProCare’s purchase of New Hope patient accounts.  New Hope’s bank account records that Plaintiff
subpoenaed from the banks show that ProCare paid New Hope at least $65,710.00
pursuant to this arrangement.  (Decl. of
Stassi ¶8; Supp-Decl. of Stassi ¶4, Exh. G.)
Plaintiff’s deposition subpoena does not seek
documents that would disclose patient information, and to the extent that some
patient information may be identified in responsive documents, HIPAA allows
such disclosure under an appropriate protective order such as the one that
exists in the instant matter.
ProCare claims it need not comply with the subpoena
because it requires production of “confidential and sensitive” business
information.  ProCare fails to meet its
burden to demonstrate exactly what “confidential and sensitive” information it
would be forced to produce and why the protective order does not provide
sufficient protection for that material.  “If an objection is based on a claim of
privilege or a claim that the information sought is protected . . . the
response shall provide sufficient factual information for other parties to
evaluate the merits of that claim, including, if necessary, a privilege log.” (C.C.P.
§2031.240(c)(1); see also HLC Properties, Limited v. Superior Court
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 54, 59 [“The objecting party has the burden to file evidence
of the preliminary facts establishing a privilege exists.”].)
Here, ProCare has not demonstrated that any such
privilege or protection it claims in its objections applies.  ProCare’s objections do not describe any of
these purportedly “confidential and sensitive” documents with particularity,
nor has it produced any privilege log.  Further,
any concern ProCare may have is outweighed by Plaintiff’s need for the
documents and the protections available under the existing protective order.  (See Supp.-Decl. of Stassi ¶3, Exh. F.)
ProCare’s objections that the subpoena is “overly
broad” and “oppressive” are unavailing because it fails to make a showing of
undue burden.  (C.C.P. §2020.220(e)
[subpoenaed person “bears the burden of demonstrating that the information is
from a source that is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or
expense”]; Vasquez v. California School of Culinary Arts, Inc. (2014)
230 Cal.App.4th 35, 42 [stating subpoenaed entity may only “oppose production
of electronically stored information on the basis that the information is from
a source that is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or
expense”].)  ProCare’s conclusory statements
do not satisfy its burden to demonstrate undue burden and expense.
The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion pursuant to C.C.P.
§2025.480 and orders ProCare to appear for deposition and produce documents and things within thirty
(30) days of this Court’s ruling. 
          Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion is granted.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion to compel ProCare’s compliance
with Plaintiff’s deposition subpoena for production of business records is
granted.  ProCare to appear for
deposition and produce the requested documents with 30 days of this ruling.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.
