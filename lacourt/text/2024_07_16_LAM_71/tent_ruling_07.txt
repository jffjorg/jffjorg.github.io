BEN WILKINS,
  et al.


 Case No.: 
  24STCV00029
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  July 16, 2024



 
Moving
Defendant Karen Wilkins’ motion to quash Plaintiff Bel Esprit Builders, Inc.’s
notice of deposition to Karen Wilkins is denied.
Moving
Defendant is to pay Plaintiff sanctions in the amount of $2,175.00, payable
within 20 days.

 
          Defendant
Karen Wilkins (“Karen”) (“Moving Defendant”) moves to quash Plaintiff Bel Esprit Builders, Inc.’s (“Bel Esprit”) (“Plaintiff”)
notice of deposition of Karen served on her on May 9, 2024, on the ground that
the deposition notice is defective. 
(Notice Quash, pg. 2; C.C.P. 2025.410.)
          
Meet and Confer
A party moving to staying the taking of a deposition and quashing
the deposition notice must also file a meet and confer declaration under C.C.P.
§2016.040.  (C.C.P.
§2025.410(c).)
Moving Defendant’s counsel does not declare that she met and
conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the instant motion, only that
counsel discussed Defendants’ demurrer. 
(See Decl. of Stepanian ¶3.) 
Defendants’ counsel’s meet and confer declaration is not sufficient
under C.C.P. §2025.410(c).  However, the
Court in its discretion will consider the instant motion.
 
Background
Plaintiff’s counsel contacted
Defendants’ counsel via telephone on May 8, 2024, at 4:35 p.m.  (Decl. of Stepanian ¶2.)  Plaintiff’s counsel requested Defendants’
counsel provide deposition dates for Karen by close of business the next day. (Decl.
of Stepanian ¶4.)
On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel’s
office e-mailed “Plaintiff Bel Esprit Builders, Inc.’s Notice of Taking in
Person Deposition of Karen Wilkins and Request to Produce Documents at
Deposition” to Defendants’ counsel, indicating the date of deposition was May
22, 2024.  (Decl. of Stepanian ¶5, Exh.
A.) Defendants’ counsel also received an email from Plaintiff’s counsel,
stating “I needed deposition dates for Ms. Wilkins from you by close of
business today. I did not receive dates, which left me no choice but to notice
the deposition.”  (Decl. of Stepanian ¶6,
Exh. B.)
Moving Defendant filed the instant
motion on May 22, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its
opposition on July 1, 2024.  As of the
date of this hearing no reply has been filed.
 
          Discussion
          C.C.P.
§2025.410(a) provides in part:
Any party served with a deposition notice that does not comply with
Article 2 (commencing with Section 2025.210) waives any error or irregularity
unless that party promptly serves a written objection specifying that error or
irregularity at least three calendar days prior to the date for which the
deposition is scheduled. 
 
(C.C.P. §2025.410(a).)  
A deposition notice must state “the
specification with reasonable particularity of any materials or category of
materials, including any electronically stored information, to be produced by
the deponent.”  (C.C.P. §2025.220(a)(4).)
          Karen’s
motion to quash is denied on the basis she failed to serve an objection to the deposition
notice at issue at least three calendar days before the deposition.  (C.C.P. §2025.410(a).)
 Moving Defendant did not file any
objection to the deposition notice on the basis the deposition notice caption
indicates a request for production of unspecified documents.  However, the body of the deposition notice
does not include any language making reference to the unspecified documents.  (See Decl. of Stepanian ¶5, Exh.
A.)  Further, Moving Defendant submitted
no evidence to the Court that the deposition notice violates the statutory
geographic limit for depositions.  (C.C.P.
§2025.250 [mandating depositions be set within seventy-five (75) miles of
Deponent’s residence].)
Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s motion
to quash the Deposition Notice of Karen is denied.
 
Sanctions
C.C.P. §2025.410(d) provides:
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to quash a deposition notice, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
C.C.P. §2025.410(d)
          Moving
Defendant’s counsel unsuccessfully made this motion without properly meeting
and conferring with Plaintiff’s counsel, and the insufficient basis for Moving
Defendant’s motion warrants sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.410(d) incurred
by Plaintiff.
          The
Court calculates sanctions as follows:
$775.00 (May 22, 2024, Deposition
Non-appearance fee) + (3.5 hours of attorney’s fees x $400/per hour) = $2,175.00
Moving Defendant is to pay Plaintiff
sanctions in the amount of $2,175.00 within 20 days of this ruling.
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendant’s motion to quash the
Notice of Deposition is denied.
Moving Defendant is to pay Plaintiff
sanctions in the amount of $2,175.00, payable within 20 days.
Moving Party to give notice.
