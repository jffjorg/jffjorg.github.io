And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding two motions filed by the plaintiffs. The first motion, filed by Sohrab Mardani, seeks to compel responses to deposition questions. The judge grants the motion as to questions 1-7, 9-15, 17, and 18, and in part as to question 16, with a limited scope. The judge denies the motion as to question 8. The second motion, also filed by Sohrab Mardani, seeks to compel further responses to requests for production. The judge denies this motion and awards no sanctions. The defendant, County of Los Angeles, is ordered to provide notice.
