 Case Number:  23STCV17296    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  61 SARTURO SALAS GARCIA vs STAY GREEN INC.TENTATIVEPlaintiff Arturo Salas Garcia’s
Motion for PAGA Settlement Approval is GRANTED, with the amount of litigation
expenses to be apportioned to Plaintiff’s counsel reduced from $10,614.23 to
$8,000.00, with the difference to be added to the PAGA penalties.
Plaintiff to give notice.DISCUSSIONUnder PAGA, “t[t]he superior
court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil
action filed pursuant to this part. The proposed settlement shall be
submitted to the agency at the same time that it is submitted to the court.” (Lab.
Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)
“[A] trial court should
evaluate a PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and
adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor law violations,
deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.” (Moniz
v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 77.) 
Federal courts have compared
and contrasted PAGA settlements to class action settlements:
In the class action context, where PAGA
claims often also appear, a district court must independently determine that a
proposed settlement agreement is “fundamentally fair, adequate and reasonable”
before granting approval. [Citations.] However, as the parties rightly point
out and as noted above, this is not a class action lawsuit, and PAGA claims are
intended to serve a decidedly different purpose-namely to protect the public
rather than for the benefit of private parties. [Citation.] In one recent district
court case, the LWDA provided some guidance regarding court approval of PAGA
settlements. [Citations.] In that case, where both class action and PAGA claims
were covered by a proposed settlement, the LWDA stressed that “when a PAGA
claim is settled, the relief provided for under the PAGA be genuine and
meaningful, consistent with the underlying purpose of the statute to benefit
the public and, in the context of a class action, the court evaluate whether
the settlement meets the standards of being “fundamentally fair, reasonable,
and adequate” with reference to the public policies underlying the PAGA.”
(Salazar, supra, 2017 WL
1135801 at pp. 3–4.) A number of these factors, “including the strength of the
plaintiff's case, the risk, the stage of the proceeding, the complexity and
likely duration of further litigation, and the settlement amount,” have been
recognized as useful in the analysis of PAGA settlements. (Moniz, supra,
72 Cal.App.5th at p. 77.) 
Plaintiff Arturo Salas Garcia
(Plaintiff) presents the terms of a proposed PAGA settlement as follows.
Defendant Stay Green, Inc. (Defendant) agrees to pay a gross settlement amount
of $150,000.00. (Ardestani Decl. Exh. 1, ¶ 1.11.) Plaintiff’s counsel is to be
paid from this amount $52,500.00, representing 35% of the total, plus expenses
of up to $8,000.00. (Id. at ¶ 3.2.3.) Plaintiff is to receive an
individual “enhancement” fee of $7,500.00. (Id. at ¶ 3.2.1.) Fees are to
be paid to the settlement administrator in the amount not to exceed $3,500.00.
(Ardestani Decl. ¶ 10.)
Plaintiff estimates that, of
the amount available to pay PAGA penalties, $56,911.33 shall go to the LWDA,
while $18,970.44 will go to aggrieved employees. (Ardestani Decl. ¶ 9.) With an
estimated class of aggrieved employees amounting to 215 employees, with 3,579
pay periods, Plaintiff estimates the average employee payout is $88 per
employee, (Ardestani Decl. ¶¶ 9, 14.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel presents a
fee lodestar of 96.1 hours worked, which given the fee award sought equals
approximately $546.30 per hour. (Ardestani Decl. ¶ 40.) Plaintiff’s counsel
states that application or their ordinary hourly rates would yield a fee
lodestar of $71,090.00. (Ardestani Decl. ¶ 40.)
Plaintiff estimates the maximum
total value of his claims to be $1,789,000.00, assuming a 100% violation rate
across each pay period at issue, and a full award of $100 per violation.
(Ardestani Decl. ¶ 15.) Plaintiff argues that Defendant presented defenses to
its claims, such as the existence of a code-compliant time-keeping system,
compliant written polices governing meal and rest breaks, employer-and provided
work-clothing for which no reimbursement was required. (Motion at p. 6.)
Plaintiff argues that the remaining claims are derivative of the same facts
supporting other wage-violation claims — such as waiting time penalties — and
are thus subject to defenses such as “good faith,” in addition to being
dependent on predicate violations. (Amaral v. Cintas Corp. No. 2 (2008)
163 Cal.App.4th 1157, 1201.)
The settlement agreement
presented to the court is reasonable in light of the purposes of PAGA, the
Defendant’s estimated exposure, and the fee lodestar presented by Plaintiff’s
counsel. The calculation of attorney fees from a percentage of a common fund
created by a settlement agreement is a permissible mode of fee calculation. (See
Laffitte v. Robert Half Internat. Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 503.) Courts
may evaluate the reasonableness of any percentage-based attorney fee award
through a “cross-check” with a lodestar calculation, as Plaintiff presents
here. (See Laffitte v. Robert Half Internat. Inc.
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 505.)
However, the expenses sought by
Plaintiff’s counsel must be reduced. The settlement agreement specifically
provides for expenses not to exceed $8,000.00. (Ardestani Decl. Exh. 1, ¶
3.2.3.) Plaintiff’s counsel nonetheless seeks expenses amounting to $10,614.23.
(Motion at p. 13; Ardestani Decl. ¶ 45.) Although Plaintiff argues that the
greater amount of expenses is reasonable, it has already specifically bargained
for a lower amount.
Accordingly, the motion is
GRANTED, with the amount of litigation expenses to be apportioned to
Plaintiff’s counsel reduced from $10,614.23 to $8,000.00, with the difference
to be added to the PAGA penalties.
