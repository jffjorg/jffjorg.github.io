And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for PAGA settlement approval, with the amount of litigation expenses to be apportioned to the plaintiff's counsel reduced from $10,614.23 to $8,000.00, with the difference to be added to the PAGA penalties. The settlement agreement is reasonable in light of the purposes of PAGA, the defendant's estimated exposure, and the fee lodestar presented by the plaintiff's counsel. The calculation of attorney fees from a percentage of a common fund created by a settlement agreement is a permissible mode of fee calculation.
