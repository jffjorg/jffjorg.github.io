The City's demurrer to the twelfth cause of action, wrongful termination, is sustained without leave to amend. The City's motion to strike is denied in part and granted in part. Specifically, the motion is denied as to the 2017 failure to promote allegations, granted with 10 days leave to amend as to the allegations concerning the 2017 Complaint, and granted without leave to amend as to the punitive damages prayer against the City and the individually named defendants.

The Judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's claims arising from the 2017 failure to promote are not time-barred, but that the claims based on the 2017 Complaint against the supervisors are time-barred. The Judge has given the plaintiff 10 days to amend the complaint to allege facts that could show that the claims are not time-barred.

The Judge has also ruled that the City is not liable for punitive damages and that the individually named defendants are not liable for failure to prevent. The Judge has ordered that the City's motion to strike be denied in part and granted in part, and that the plaintiff's claims be dismissed with prejudice.
