Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains Fusion's demurrer with 15 days' leave to amend. The Court agrees with Fusion that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim. The case revolves around the alleged unauthorized and unlawful use of a private alleyway. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief, quiet title, and injunctive relief, alleging that the easement has been abandoned. However, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to show abandonment, as their own allegations indicate use of the southern portion of the alley within the last 20 years. The Court also notes that the easement was recorded, which is required under Civil Code section 887.050. As a result, Plaintiffs will be given an opportunity to amend their complaint to allege sufficient facts to state a claim.
