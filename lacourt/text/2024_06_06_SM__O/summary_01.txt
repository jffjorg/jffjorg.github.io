And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend as to the 1st and 3rd causes of action for libel and negligence. The alleged defamatory statement was made by an attorney regarding the merits of a fee dispute between attorneys, which is non-actionable opinion. The litigation privilege bars the claims.

The 2nd cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations is also sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff does not plead facts to show an actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship between the parties, and the litigation privilege bars the action.

The litigation privilege applies to the email chain, which involved a fee dispute between attorneys. The statement was made in the midst of a fee dispute between attorneys, which is within the scope of the privilege.

The court finds that the allegations in the complaint are barred by the litigation privilege, and all three claims are dismissed.
