And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a student who was allegedly assaulted by a school aide during a physical altercation at school. The student, Pharrell Davis, is suing the school district and Inclusive Education and Community Partnership, Inc. (IECP), alleging that the school aide, Jose, was acting within the scope of his employment when he grabbed Pharrell and slammed him to the ground. The judge has ruled that IECP is not entitled to a demurrer, which would dismiss the lawsuit, and has denied IECP's motion to strike certain allegations from the lawsuit. The judge has also ruled that the lawsuit sufficiently pleads facts to support a claim for punitive damages against IECP and LAUSD. The case will proceed to a hearing on August 9, 2024.
