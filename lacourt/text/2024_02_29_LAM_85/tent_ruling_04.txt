            [1] Defendants
Castro and Ortiz failed to lodge a courtesy copy of their opposition, in
violation of the Presiding Judge’s First Amended General Order Re: Mandatory
Electronic Filing.  Their counsel is
admonished to provide courtesy copies in all future filings for this case or
they will not be considered.


            [2] The submitted
copy of the Note is a low-quality scan that is barely legible.  Miguel Decl., ¶5, Ex. 1.  Counsel is advised to ensure that exhibits
are readable.


[3] The
application also fails to address, for both Defendants who are natural persons,
that LaundryLux’s claim is based on a commercial claim which arises out of the
defendant’s conduct of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP §483.010(c).  Consumer transactions cannot form a basis for
attachment.   CCP §483.010(c); Kadison,
Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (“Kadison”) (1987)
197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial, not a
consumer, transaction).  
The application further seeks to attach, aside from the
Equipment, “All property subject to attachment” under CCP section
487.010(c).  Where the defendant is a
natural person, the description of the property must be reasonably adequate to
permit the defendant to identify the specific property sought to be
attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  The description fails to provide Castro and
Ortiz with sufficient notice of what property LaundryLux seeks to attach and is
inadequate.
