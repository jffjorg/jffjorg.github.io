And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses several issues raised by the attachment application filed by LaundryLux against Castro and Ortiz. First, the defendants failed to lodge a courtesy copy of their opposition, which is a violation of the Presiding Judge's First Amended General Order Re: Mandatory Electronic Filing. As a result, their counsel is admonished to provide courtesy copies in all future filings for this case. Second, the submitted copy of the Note is a low-quality scan that is barely legible, and counsel is advised to ensure that exhibits are readable. Third, the application fails to address the commercial nature of the claim, which arises from the defendant's conduct of a trade, business, or profession, and therefore consumer transactions cannot form a basis for attachment. Finally, the description of the property sought to be attached is inadequate and fails to provide Castro and Ortiz with sufficient notice of what property LaundryLux seeks to attach.
