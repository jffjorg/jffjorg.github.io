 Case Number:  23STCP00815    Hearing Date:   February 29, 2024    Dept:  85 
 
County of Los Angeles,
County of Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services v. Civil
Service Commission of the County of Los Angeles, 23STCP00815

 
Tentative decision on petition
for writ of mandate:   denied



 
            Petitioners
County of Los Angeles (“County”) and County of Los Angeles Department of
Children and Family Services (“DCFS” or “Department”) seek administrative
mandamus directing Respondent Civil Service Commission of the County of Los
Angeles (“Commission”) to set aside its decision not to sustain the discharge
of Real Party-in-Interest Elya Kazaryan (“Kazaryan”) and finding that DCFS
violated Kazaryan’s pre-deprivation (Skelly) due process rights.  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers,[1]
opposition, and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
            
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Petition
            Petitioners
County and DCFS commenced this proceeding on March 14, 2023.  The Petition alleges a cause of action for
administrative mandate and traditional mandate. 
The Petition alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Kazaryan
was employed by Petitioner DCFS as a Children’s Social Worker (“CSW”) III.  On September 17, 2020, Kazaryan was
discharged from her position.  
            DCFS’s
reasons for discharge included Kazaryan’s failure to conduct required home
visits and falsifying County records and time records.  Kazaryan had falsified DCFS Form 158s, Child
Welfare Services/Case Management (“CWS/CMS”) entries, mileage claims, and field
itineraries.  She falsified her overtime
reported on her time sheets for July 26, 2018, November 23, 2018, and March 23,
2019.  Kazaryan failed to conduct monthly
home visits for a family for November 2018, April 2019 and May 2019, and failed
to properly document such visits in CWS/CMS. 
            Kazaryan’s
discharge was in accordance with the following DCFS and County Policies: DCFS
Human Resources Manual (“HR Manual”) section 8.000; DCFS Procedural Guide
0400-503.10 (Contract Requirements and Exceptions); DCFS Management Directive
#17-01, Code of Conduct; HR Manual section 14.120 (Non-Progressive Discipline);
HR Manual section 14.140 (Unacceptable on-the-Job Behavior); HR Manual sections
14.520 (A-6), (A-7), (A-13), (B-4), (F-1), (F-2) and (F-10); and County Civil
Service Rule (“CSR”) 18.031.  
            Pursuant
to CSRs 4.02, 4.06 and 18.02, Kazaryan appealed her discharge to the Commission.  On January 13, 2021, the Commission granted
Kazaryan’s request for a hearing.  The
certified issues were: (1) whether the allegations in the Department’s
September 17, 2020 letter were true; (2) if so, whether termination was the appropriate
discipline; (3) whether the Department violated Kazaryan’s pre-deprivation due
process rights; and (4) if so, the appropriate remedy.  
The Hearing Officer conducted the appeal hearing on October
25 through 27, 2021, and February 22 and 23, 2022.  On June 28, 2022, the Hearing Officer issued
his Proposed Findings of Facts, Conclusions of Law and a Recommendation (“Report”).  The Report recommended that the Commission
overturn the Department’s termination of Kazaryan’s employment and concluded
that DCFS violated Kazaryan’s Skelly due process rights.  
On January 11, 2023, the Commission issued its Notice of
Final Commission Action and Final Order (“Final Order”) adopting the Hearing
Officer’s Report and recommendation.  
            The
County seeks a writ of mandate compelling the Commission to set aside its Final
Order, sustain DCFS’ decision to discharge Kazaryan, and order that DCFS did
not violate Kazaryan’s Skelly rights. 
The County seeks reasonable attorney’s fees, damages according to proof,
and costs of suit.  
            
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
May 24, 2023, Kazaryan filed an Answer.  
On August 30, 2023, the Commission filed a Notice of No
Beneficial Interest in Outcome.  
            
            B.
Standard of Review
            CCP
section 1094.5 is the administrative mandamus provision which structures the
procedure for judicial review of adjudicatory decisions rendered by
administrative agencies.  Topanga
Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, (“Topanga”)
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-15.  
            CCP
section 1094.5 does not on its face specify which cases are subject to
independent review, leaving that issue to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of Angels, (“Fukuda”)
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  In cases
reviewing decisions which affect a vested, fundamental right the trial court
exercises independent judgment on the evidence.  Bixby v. Pierno, (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130,
143; see CCP §1094.5(c).  Where the public employer brings the
petition, the court utilizes the substantial evidence test in reviewing the
agency’s decision.  County of Los Angeles v. Civil Service Commission,
(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 520, 633.
            “Substantial
evidence” is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate
to support a conclusion (California Youth Authority v. State Personnel Board,
(“California You Authority”) (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 575, 585) or
evidence of ponderable legal significance, which is reasonable in nature,
credible, and of solid value.  Mohilef v. Janovici, (1996) 51
Cal.App.4th 267, 305, n. 28.  The petitioner has the burden of
demonstrating that the agency’s findings are not supported by substantial
evidence in light of the whole record.  Young v. Gannon, (2002) 97
Cal.App.4th 209, 225.  The trial court considers all evidence in the
administrative record, including evidence that detracts from evidence
supporting the agency’s decision.  California Youth Authority, supra,
104 Cal.App.4th at 585. 
            The
agency’s decision must be based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at
the hearing.  Board of Medical Quality
Assurance v. Superior Court, (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860, 862.  The hearing officer is only required to issue
findings that give enough explanation so that parties may determine whether,
and upon what basis, to review the decision.  Topanga, supra, 11 Cal.3d 506,
514-15.  Implicit in CCP section 1094.5
is a requirement that the agency set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap
between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.  Id. at 115.
            An
agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code
§664), and the petitioner therefore has the burden of proof.  Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil Service
Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137. 
“[T]he burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the administrative
decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in excess of
jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.  Afford v. Pierno, (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d
682, 691.  
            The propriety of a penalty imposed
by an administrative agency is a matter in the discretion of the agency, and
its decision may not be disturbed unless there has been a manifest abuse of
discretion.  Lake v. Civil Service Commission, (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d
224, 228.  In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion,
the court must examine the extent of the harm to the public service, the
circumstances surrounding the misconduct, and the likelihood that such conduct
will recur.  Skelly v. State Personnel Board, (“Skelly”)
(1975) 15 Cal.3d 194, 217218.  The penalty should be upheld if
there is “any reasonable basis to sustain it”.  County of Los Angeles v. Civil Service Com.
of County of Los Angeles, (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 871, 877.  “Only in an exceptional case will an abuse of
discretion be shown because reasonable minds cannot differ on the appropriate
penalty.”  Ibid.  Neither an appellate court nor a trial court is free to
substitute its discretion for that of the administrative agency concerning the
degree of punishment imposed.  Nightingale v. State Personnel Board,
(1972) 7 Cal.3d 507, 515.  The policy consideration underlying such
allocation of authority is the expertise of the administrative agency in
determining penalty questions.  Cadilla v. Board of Medical Examiners, (1972) 26 Cal.App.3d
961.   
 
            C. Governing Law
            1.
DCFS Procedural Guide
            Welfare
and Institutions (“W&I”) Code section 16516.5 requires CSWs to regularly
visit all foster children placed in group homes or any licensed, certified or
approved foster home.  AR 501.  
            DCFS
Policy 0400-503.10 (Contact Requirements and Exceptions) requires a CSW to
conduct a face-to-face contact with all the children on the CSW’s caseload
every month.  AR 488, 492.  The purpose of the monthly visits is to
ensure child safety and well-being.  AR
488.  
            A
CSW is also required to document in CWS/CMS all contacts, including attempted
contacts (i.e. face-to-face, telephone, letter, email, etc.) within three
business days of the date of contact.  AR
495.  The CSW should document all observations,
not opinions.  AR 495.  Documenting standards give CSWs a framework
for documenting observations, activities, and actions taken to ensure child
safety.  AR 495.  Specific instructions are provided to CSWs on
how to document contact and edit or add information after saving a
contact.  AR 499-500.
 
            2.
HR Manual
            DCFS
employees are expected to understand and to adhere to County and Departmental
personnel policies.  AR 482 (Manual
§8.000).  Failure to comply with these
policies, regulations and instructions could lead to disciplinary action, which
could include discharge.  Id.
            Certain
acts of employee misconduct are, by their nature, not appropriate for
progressive discipline.  AR 513 (Manual
§14.20).  These acts are those that the
employee should have reasonably known to be unacceptable without specific
notice from the Department, or that are generally socially unacceptable.  Id. 
In these situations, discipline may be taken based on the degree of
severity appropriate to the nature of the problem and status of the
employee.  Id.  Such behavior includes, but is not limited
to, dishonesty, theft, violent or disruptive behavior, insubordinate behavior,
or behavior that is illegal or places the Department in violation of federal
law.  Id.  Such behavior should be disciplined by suspension,
or if warranted, discharge on the first occurrence.  Id. 

            A
DCFS employee is subject to disciplinary action for certain offenses.  AR 535 (HR Manual §14.520).  These offenses include the following: (1) submission
of false time or financial records (AR 524); (2) falsification or submission of
false time cards for self or other employees (AR 530); (3) falsifying,
concealing, removing, mutilating, or destroying reports or documents (AR 537); (4)
failure to follow established rules and regulations or adhere to security
policies (AR 542); (5) violation of the recognized code of ethics of the
professional group of the offender (AR 548); (6) consistently failing to meet
requirements, carelessness or negligence of duties resulting in improper service
being rendered to clients or dependents of the County in resulting in
impairment of a County function (AR 548); and (7) failure to exercise sound
judgment, which results in loss of or injury or damage to persons or property
of the County (AR 549).  HR Manual §14.520(A-6),
(A-7), (A-13), (B-4), (F-1), (F-2), (F-10). 

The list of disciplinary actions is a guide only and should
not be automatically applied to all real infractions.  AR 547 (HR Manual §14.520).  All the circumstances surrounding a
particular offense must necessarily be considered.  Id. 
Some degree of flexibility is available in determining the severity of a
disciplinary action.  Id.  This may result in an action more or less
severe than those listed in these guidelines.  Id. 
As with all matters relating to discipline, good judgment is imperative.  Id.
Aside from failure to follow established rules and
regulations or adhere to security policies, the discipline for a first offense
based on any of these violations ranges from suspension to discharge.  AR 524, 530, 537, 542, 548-49, 555.  The appropriate discipline for falsification
of timecards, and the submission of false timecards or financial records, is a 15
to 30-day suspension up to discharge for a first offense, a 30-day suspension
up to discharge for a second offense, and discharge for a third offense.  AR 524, 530. 

            
            3.
DCFS Management Directive
            All
employees are required to take responsibility for their actions and avoid any
behavior that has the appearance of impropriety.  AR 507 (DCFS Management Directive #17-01(C)).  They must practice professionalism and integrity,
commit to excellence, and be honest, forthcoming and transparent.  Id. 
They must act in accordance with County and Department policies and
procedures.  Id.  
            Employees
may be subject to disciplinary action, including discharge from their County
position and/or legal action when appropriate, for unacceptable behavior.  AR 507 (DCFS Management Directive #17-01(D)).  Such unacceptable behavior includes, inter
alia, (1) the failure to notify the appropriate supervisory staff of the
inability to report to work, including expected length of absence; and (4) misappropriating,
misusing, or abusing any County property, including, but not limited to, monetary
funds, equipment, computer systems, data, telephones and County vehicles.  Id. 
 
            4.  CSR 18.031  
            Failure
of an employee to perform his or her assigned duties so as to meet fully
explicitly stated or implied standards of performance may constitute adequate
grounds for discharge, reduction or suspension. 
Where appropriate, such grounds may include, but are not limited to,
qualitative as well as quantitative elements of performance, such as failure to
exercise sound judgment, failure to report information accurately and
completely, failure to deal effectively with the public, and failure to make
productive use of human, financial and other assigned resources. Grounds for discharge,
reduction or suspension may also include any behavior or pattern of behavior
which negatively affects an employee’s productivity, or which is unbecoming a
county employee; or any behavior or condition which impairs an employee’s
qualifications for his or her position or for continued county employment.  AR 566 (CSR 18.031).
 
            5.
Countywide Discipline Guidelines
            Countywide
Discipline Guidelines for employees define a separate range of discipline for
the first, second, or third or any type of offense.  AR 571. 
There is some degree of flexibility in determining the appropriate level
of discipline.  AR 571.  This may result in an administrative action
more or less severe than those listed.  AR 571. 
Only a weighing of all relevant factors, exercising good judgment, and
consultation with a Human Resources Office will lead to an appropriate
decision.  AR 571.  
 
            D.
Statement of Facts
            1. Background
            On April 16, 2001,
Kazaryan began working for DCFS and was promoted on September 7, 2007 to CSW
III in DCFS’s Santa Clarita Office.  AR
471-72.  As part of her duties, Kazaryan
developed case plans to assess and maintain the safety of the children in her
caseload as well as monitor compliance with court orders regarding the children’s
care.  AR 1323-24. Because reunification
is DCFS’ main goal for children placed in foster care, Kazaryan was also
expected to work toward family reunification. 
AR 979-80.  
            Kazaryan was supervised
by Michael Wikler (“Wikler”) from 2010 through 2018 and by Danielle Locke (“Locke”)
from February 2019 to February 2020.  AR 943-44,
1241, 1250.   She had no prior record of discipline,
including oral warnings, written reprimands, demotions, disciplinary transfers,
or suspensions.  AR 12.  
            Kazaryan received
positive overall evaluations. AR 12, 274-03. 
Every Performance Evaluation from March 2016 to February 2019 rated her
as Very Good or Competent.  AR 1917-46.  Some evaluations noted that she needed to
continue providing status review reports for any given case within 30 days of
the scheduled court hearing date.  AR
1936, 1945.
 
            2.  The Investigation
            Kazaryan went on leave on
July 30, 2019, and her caseload was dispersed to other CSWs.  AR 839, 1085. 
Kazaryan returned from leave on November 22, 2019.  AR 1085. 
            During Kazaryan's leave,
Supervising Children’s Social Worker (“SCSW”) Locke received a phone call from
Regina D. (“Regina”), the caregiver for three siblings on CSW Kazaryan’s
caseload.  AR 846-47.  Regina complained that, although Kazaryan
knew that she (Regina) was moving out, Kazaryan did not complete the paperwork
for the funding of Regina’s home out-of-state under the Interstate Compact for
the Protection of Children.  AR 847.  Regina also asserted that Kazaryan failed to
conduct some monthly visits, tried to schedule visits at the end of the month,
and then would cancel or just not show.  AR
847.  
            Locke notified Assistant
Regional Administrator Tina Mosley (“Mosley”) about Regina’s accusations.  AR 847. 
Mosley in turn reported them to Performance Management.  AR 847. 
Performance Management asked Mosley to obtain an affidavit from Regina.  AR 906.
            On August 1, 2019, Regina
sent Locke an affidavit asserting that Kazaryan did not conduct home visits in
July and November 2018 and April and May 2019. 
AR 623.  For July 2018, Kazaryan
asked to visit on July 26 despite receiving notice on July 2 that Regina and the
three children were on vacation.  AR 623.
            Mosley contacted Regional
Administrator Laura Shetzbarger about the allegations.  AR 910, 1177. 
On November 22, 2019, DCFS issued Kazaryan a memorandum placing her on
desk duty pending the investigation.  AR
1969-70.  She refused to sign it.  AR 1970. 

            Locke and Mosley met
with Kazaryan about her alteration of pre-approved Form 158s.  AR 910, 926-27.  When Kazaryan had a pre-approved overtime
request to see a client, she would change the 158 as needed.  AR 911. 

On January 15, 2020,
Kazaryan submitted an affidavit explaining her position on specific home visits
and DCFS documentation.  AR 1913-14.  She admitted that she could not remember if
she stopped by when one of the Home Services Aides (“HSAs”) visited the
youngest of the children on April 9, 23, and 30, 2019.  AR 1914. 
She did have contact with the older child that month, but it does not
appear on the system.  AR 1914.
 
            a. Investigation Report
            On February 26, 2020,
Internal Affairs (“IA”) Investigator Trina Rodgers (“Rodgers”) prepared and
submitted an Employee Misconduct Report (“Rodgers Report”).  AR 2002. 
The Rodgers Report explained that Rodgers investigated two issues.  AR 2002. 
The first issue was whether Kazaryan engaged in falsification or forgery
of County records like field itineraries, CWS/CMS, the Mileage Authorization
and Reimbursement System (“MARS”), and Form 158s.  AR 2002. 
The second issue was whether Kazaryan failed to conduct monthly home
visits for the children in Regina’s care, or to document said visits in
CWS/CMS.  AR 2003.
            Rodgers interviewed Regina,
Locke, Mosley, Kazaryan, and Wikler.  AR
2003-06.  She also reviewed CWS/CMS logs,
mileage claims, field itineraries, and Form 158s for July and November 2018 and
March, April, and May 2019.  AR 2006-08.  The Rodgers Report referenced 22 attachments,
including text messages, emails, and Kazaryan’s CWS/CMS logs, Form 158s,
mileage claims, and field itineraries. 
AR 2009.
            The Rodgers Report noted
that Regina incorrectly considered a visit to be a home visit if Kazaryan
entered her home and spoke directly with her about the well-being of the
children.  AR 2004.  IA concluded that, based on Kazaryan’s
documentation, the only months in question for home visits were July and
November 2018 and April and May 2019.  AR
2004.
            The Rodgers Report concluded
that Kazaryan falsified County records, including time records, and failed to
provide services or job duties.  AR
2008.  Kazaryan falsified Form 158s, CWS/CMS,
MARS claims, and field itineraries, as well as overtime reports for July 26,
2018, November 23, 2018, and March 23, 2019. 
AR 2008.  Rodgers also concluded
that Kazaryan either did not conduct monthly home visits or failed to properly
document said visits in CWS/CMS for November 2018 and April and May 2019.  AR 2008. 

 
            3. Documentary Evidence
            a. Emails and Texts
            On July 2, 2018, Regina
informed Kazaryan via email of a vacation she planned to take with the children
from July 19 to 24, 2008.  AR 307,
626.  Regina would then visit her parents
until July 29.  AR 307.  Kazaryan’s handwritten notes (AR 1355-56) stated
that this meant the children would not be with Regina during her visit to her
parents and instead would be with their grandparents from Vegas.  AR 307. 
She also wrote “mother’s visits will be arranged by grandparents.”  AR 307.
            On November 22, 2018,
Regina texted Kazaryan to cancel the next day’s visit and asked to reschedule for
some time the next week.  AR 2050.  Kazaryan’s handwritten notes on a printout of
this message states that she rescheduled for November 30, 2018, but failed to
update the field itinerary and mileage form to reflect that fact.  AR 2050.
            On March 22, 2019, at
11:25 p.m., Kazaryan texted the children’s father, Jeffrey DeMico (“Jeffrey”),
to arrange a visit the next day at 6:00 p.m. at a location somewhere around
Grenada Hills if they want to get something to eat.  AR 1882. 
Jeffrey chose one restaurant that afternoon, then another the next day
after Kazaryan said the first restaurant was too loud for a monitored
visit.  AR 1882-83.
            On March 23, 2019,
sometime after 5:00 p.m., Kazaryan texted one of the children’s caregivers, Dave
D. (“Dave”).  AR 1887.  Kazaryan said she was outside the home and asked
Dave to bring the kids out for their visit with Jeffrey.  AR 1887. 
Dave responded that he had to leave and took the kids with him.  AR 1887. 
He thought the visit was at 4:00 p.m. 
AR 1887.
            On April 22, 2019,
Kazaryan texted Locke to cancel a Children and Family Team (“CFT”) meeting
scheduled that day and proposed meeting April 24, 2019, at 6 p.m., in Granada
Hills.  AR 2028-30.  She subsequently proposed Thursday.  AR 2030.
            On May 3, 2019, Kazaryan
texted Jeffrey and asked if he could meet the next day at 5:00 p.m. for a
court-ordered monitored visit at a restaurant called the “Habit”.  AR 2054-55.        

            On May 4, 2019 at 5:00
p.m., Kazaryan texted Dave stating that she was “here” and asking him to bring
the girls out.  AR 2056.  Kazaryan’s handwritten notes state that this
was so she could take them to visit their father.  AR 1902. 
The Delivered Service Log has a contract entry for that date for the
three children with no narrative.  AR
1905.
            On May 22, 2019, Locke
emailed Kazaryan about a missing report for court.  AR 312. 
Kazaryan responded that she was on vacation and there was nothing she
could do about it if it was late.  AR
312.  Locke had been on vacation the week
before, and she was on vacation now.  AR
312.  She was receiving calls and emails
and was pressured for the reports when she needed to not be stressed.  AR 312.
            On May 31, 2019, Mosley
forwarded to Kazaryan an email from Human Resources.  AR 617. 
This email confirmed that employees should not alter an approval for a
specific request, including via cross-outs, once the Form 158 is approved.  AR 618. 
If management agrees to a change, the CSW should complete a new Form
158.  AR 618.
            On June 4, 2019,
Kazaryan replied she had been editing Form 158s for 15 years without issue
while keeping her supervisor informed. 
AR 317.  Eight minutes later, she
added that she felt harassed and would no longer work overtime.  AR 317. 
Locke emailed to ask if it was possible to see parents during Kazaryan’s
work hours.  AR 316.  Kazaryan responded that some parents cannot
take off work and complain.  AR 316.
 
            b. DCFS Logs
            A Form 158 submitted by
Kazaryan on July 17, 2018 requests two hours of overtime for a monthly home
visit on July 26.  AR 1984.  The overtime was necessary because the
children’s biological mother, Kristen D. (“Kristen”), was unavailable during
regular work hours.  See AR 1984.
            A Delivered Service Log
for July 3, 2018 reported that Kazaryan met with the children and Kristen at a
frozen yogurt store.  AR 1832.  
A later entry showed
that on July 26, 2018, Kazaryan texted Kristen at both numbers on file for
her.  AR 1832.  She asked Kristen to call because she had
been unable to reach her.  AR 1832.
            The Delivered Service Log
then shows that, on July 26, 2018, at 9:29 a.m., Kazaryan texted Regina and
asked her to call because Kazaryan tried to talk to her the day before and the
call went to voicemail.  AR 1836.  At 10:48 a.m., Regina replied that she did
not have great service where she was but would call shortly.  AR 1839. 
Kazaryan also asked Regina if the kids were having visits with their
mother Kristen.  AR 1839.  Regina said the children are having visits
with Kristen, and they typically see her on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  AR 1840. 
Kazaryan replied that Kristen was not answering her calls or texts and
she wanted to see the children’s visits with their mother.  AR 1840.
            A CWS/CMS entry and a
Delivered Service Log show that Kazaryan visited the children and Regina on November
23, 2018.  AR 1862, 1867.
            Kazaryan’s mileage claim
for November 30, 2018 shows that she left DCFS’ office in Santa Clarita at 6:00
p.m., arrived in Van Nuys for a home visit with a different client at 6:30
p.m., and returned home at 11020 Eldorado Place in Los Angeles at 8:00 p.m.  AR 1843. 
The form does not show a trip to Grenada Hills that day.  AR 1843. 
Her field itinerary for November 30 only shows a visit to “Jessica T.”
at the Van Nuys address from 6:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.  AR 1859.
            A Form 158, submitted by
Kazaryan on November 20, 2018, requested two hours of overtime for November 23,
2018.  AR 1870.  It stated that the hours were necessary for a
home visit where the family was not available during regular work hours.  AR 1870.
            Kazaryan’s timecards
show two hours of overtime for July 26 and November 23, 2018.  AR 1987, 1991.
            A Delivered Service Log
for March 9, 2019 shows a visit between the children and Jeffrey, on March 9,
but no entry for March 23.  AR 1875.  A Form 158, submitted on March 5, 2019,
requested four hours of overtime for a visit on March 23, 2019.  AR 1878. 
It explained Kazaryan would monitor a court-ordered visit for Kristen as
a drug treatment center that only allows visits on weekends.  AR 1878.
            A Delivered Service Log
for April 2019 shows visits by HSAs on April 9, 23, and 30, but none from Kazaryan.  AR 1890-95.[2]

            A Form 158, submitted on
May 1, 2019, requests four hours of overtime on May 4.  AR 1898. 
The form asserted that Kazaryan would conduct a monitored visit after
regular work hours on a weekend because the caregiver and minors were not
available to meet during the day.  AR
1898.
 
            4. The Notice of Intent
            On June 17, 2020, DCFS
issued to Kazaryan a Notice of Intent to Discharge (“NOI”), signed by Human
Resources Administrator Lynn Bowles Condon (“Condon”), informing her of DCFS’s
plan to terminate her based on the Rodgers Report.  AR 462-74. 
The NOI proposed Kazaryan’s discharge based on her failure to conduct
the required monthly home visits, her falsification of County records and time
records, and her failure to document interactions with clients and/or
collateral contacts.  AR 472-73.
            The NOI cited violations
of DCFS HR Manual, Chapter 8, Section 8.000; DCFS Procedural Guide
0400-503.10 (Contract Requirements and Exceptions); DCFS Management Directive
#17-01, Code of Conduct; HR Manual, Chapter 14, Section 14.120 (Non-Progressive
Discipline); HR Manual, Chapter 14, Section 14.140 (Unacceptable on-the-Job
Behavior); HR Manual, Chapter 14, Section 14.520 (A-6); HR Manual, Chapter 14,
Section 14.520 (A-7); HR Manual, Chapter 14, Section 14.520 (A-13); HR Manual,
Chapter 14, Section 14.520 (B-4), HR Manual, Chapter 14, Section 14.520 (F-1); HR
Manual, Chapter 14, Section 14.520 (F-2); HR Manual, Chapter 14, Section 14.520
(F-10); and CSR 18.031.  AR 462-67.
            The NOI included all the
attachments to the Rodgers Report, but the Rodgers Report itself was not among
the NOI attachments.  AR 475-477, 2009.  
 
            5. Kristen’s Affidavit
            On July 16, 2020, Kristen
submitted an affidavit stating that she has been trying to reunify with her
children since they were removed from her care in September 2018.   AR 270. 
Regina was doing everything possible to prevent that reunification, but
Kazaryan had been diligent in facilitating the reunification process. AR 270.  Kristen suspected that was why Regina had
made it clear from the beginning that she did not like Kazaryan.  AR 270-71. 

            Kristen visited her
children on July 3, 2018 at a frozen yogurt place, and Kazaryan oversaw the
meeting.  AR 271.  Kristen planned to visit her daughters again
on July 26, but Regina did not cooperate in making the girls available.  AR 271.
 
            6. Notice of Discharge
            After a Skelly
hearing on August 25, 2020, DCFS issued an amended Notice of Discharge (“NOD”)
on September 17, 2020, signed by Human Resources Administrator Condon.  AR 448-60.  The NOD stated that Kazaryan’s termination was
based on her failure to conduct the required home visits for Regina and her falsification
of County records and time records.  AR
449.  Kazaryan had falsified Form 158s,
CWS/CMS, mileage claims and field itineraries. 
AR 453.  She also falsified her
overtime hours on her timesheets for July 26 and November 23, 2018, and for March
23, 2019.  AR 453.  IA also had concluded she failed to conduct
monthly home visits for November 2018 and April and May 2019.  AR 453.
            The NOD acknowledged Kazaryan’s
lack of prior discipline and her performance ratings of Competent to Very Good from
March 2016 to February 2019.  AR 458.
 
            7. The Appeal
            On January 13, 2021, the
Commission granted Kazaryan request for an appeal hearing.  AR 18. 
The issues certified for hearing included (a) whether the allegations in
the NOD were true and (b) if so, whether termination was the appropriate
discipline.  AR 24.  The Commission later certified two additional
questions: (c) whether DCFS violated Kazaryan’s pre-deprivation due process rights
and (d) if so, the appropriate remedy.  AR
41.
 
            8. Wikler’s Affidavit
            On October 21, 2021, before
the appeal hearing, Wikler submitted an affidavit asserting that Kazaryan showed
tenacity and commitment to her job when he supervised her in the years through 2018.  AR 272-73. 
She demonstrated respect, dignity, and compassion to the families she
worked with.  AR 272.  She did struggle at times to enter her
contacts timely, but otherwise managed her caseload well and saw the children
on her caseload per DCFS standards.  AR
272.  
            Wikler never was
concerned that Kazaryan had falsified any documents, including Form 158s, or
lied about the overtime she worked.  AR
272-73.  The office practice was that
employees could modify their Form 158s if they worked more or less than listed.  AR 272. 
Kazaryan would always show Wikler whenever she needed to make changes,
and she would then change her time sheet if needed.  AR 273. 
Wikler could not recall a time he thought any discrepancy in the
documented hours was more than an oversight. 
AR 273.
 
            9. The Appeal Hearing
            The hearing took place on
October 25, 2021 and continued through October 2021 and February 2022.  AR 86. 
Pertinent testimony is as follows.
 
            a. Rodgers
            Rodgers has been
employed by DCFS since 2014 and as an IA investigator since September 2016.  AR 673. 

            In 2019, Rodgers was
assigned to investigate the claims of misconduct against Kazaryan.  AR 674.  The allegations included the falsification of
time records and DCFS records like field itineraries, mileage, and contact entries
in the CWS/CMS.  AR 674.  The alleged falsification of records occurred
from July 2018 through May 2019.  AR 676.  
            Rodgers received Regina’s
affidavit.  AR 683.  She then interviewed Regina about allegations
that Kazaryan would not show up for meetings, sometimes cancelled at the last
minute, and did not come at all for some months.  AR 685. 

            To verify the
allegations, Rodgers used the information Regina provided, the CWS/CMS contacts
that Kazaryan entered into the system, Kazaryan’s mileage reports, and her
requests for overtime via Form 158s.  AR
685-86.  CSWs use field itineraries to
show the supervisor where they plan to be during the day.  AR 686. 
A mileage claim is the way CSWs claim reimbursement for miles to drive
to families’ homes.  AR 686.  The field itineraries, mileage claims,
contacts, and time sheets should all match. 
AR 686.  
            Rodgers determined that
Kazaryan’s mileage reimbursement for May 1, 2019 was rejected.  AR 691. 
When she asked Locke why, Locke explained she was unable to match the
mileage claim with that day’s overtime request, which Kazaryan had changed
after it had been signed.  AR 691.
             Rodgers concluded that Kazaryan had not made a
home visit in July 2018.  AR 695.  This was based on her interviews with Regina
and Kazaryan, the contact notes, and inconsistencies in how Kazaryan conducted
her visits.  AR 695.  
            Rodgers reviewed the
date of July 26, 2018 because Kazaryan made a claim for two hours of overtime
on that date to visit the family.  AR
702.  An email from Regina stated that
the family would not be in town on that date. 
AR 702-03.  The family was not, in
fact, in town.  AR 731.  Kazaryan stated during her interview that no
visit occurred that day, but she drove to Regina’s home for an attempted visit.  AR 708. 
The attempted visit should have been documented by Kazaryan in her
CWS/CMS log, and it was not.  AR
708.  
            Her mileage claim and Form
158 show she went to the house on July 26, 2018.  Kazaryan claimed that she went there, and Rodgers
did not know if that was true.  AR 730-31.  Because Kazaryan knew from Regina’s email the
family was not there for a visit, she could seek reimbursement for the miles
driven, but she could not seek overtime because there was “no work.”  AR 732.
            Rodgers discovered that Kazaryan
entered a contact for November 23, 2018 when none existed.  AR 708-09. 
The family was out of town that day and the visit did not occur.  AR 709. 
Kazaryan admitted this fact in her interview but said she rescheduled
the visit for November 30.  AR 709.  That visit never happened either.  AR 709. 
CSWs are supposed to enter a Delivered Service Log within three days of
a visit, but Kazaryan did not enter one before December 3, 2018.  AR 710. 
She entered one only for the November 23 contact that did not
occur.  AR 710.
            Rodgers found that no contact
likely occurred, and none was documented, for the family in April 2019.  AR 713. 
A CFT meeting was scheduled but then cancelled.  AR 713. 
Rodgers did not know whether a CFT meeting would qualify as a monthly
visit.  AR 713.  There were no contacts entered for April
2019.  AR 713.
            Regina’s understanding
of a home visit was incorrect.  AR 723.  A home visit does not require that Kazaryan enter
the home and speak directly with Regina about the children.  AR 723. 
Kazaryan could have also spoken to the children at Regina’s home to
confirm their well-being.  AR 724.  Visiting the kids with the birth mother does
not qualify as a home visit; it is considered visitation.  AR 724.
            Rodgers never spoke with
the birth parents because the original allegation was not that Kazaryan was not
doing her job; it was that she changed and possibly falsified documents.  AR 757.
 
            b. Locke
            Locke began working for
DCFS in 2002.  AR 806.  Locke was assigned to the Santa Clarita
office in January 2019 and began directly supervising Kazaryan in February 2019.  AR 806, 943. 
Locke did not have any contact with Regina in 2018.  AR 967. 

            As a mobile CSW, Kazaryan
was required to complete a field itinerary. 
AR 814.  The CSW fills out the
field itinerary on the computer, prints it, and gives it to Locke to sign a few
days before the day on the itinerary.  AR
814-15.  One copy stays on her desk while
the CSW keeps the other while in the field. 
AR 815.  
CSWs will enter
their field itinerary onto MARS, print out a hard copy, and submit it with a
mileage claim.  AR 816.  Locke is responsible for matching employees’
hard copy field itineraries with submitted mileage reimbursement claims.  AR 816. 
Locke did not approve Kazaryan’s February 2019 mileage reimbursement
request because the field itinerary and the mileage claim printout from MARS did
not match the copies she had.  AR 821-22,
825.  
            Locke was also
responsible for signing off on Form 158s, which were submitted for time off,
vacation or overtime.  AR 829.  Because Kazaryan was a mobile CSW who did not
come into the office regularly, Kazaryan would submit her filed itineraries
with her Form 158 overtime requests and give them to Locke together.  AR 832. 

            The overtime requests in
Form 158s are specific to tasks requested and are approved for a specific
family or for their specific need.  AR
832.  Any change in the purpose set forth
in an overtime request would require submission of a new overtime request.  AR 833. 
A variance between planned and actual overtime was normal within 30
minutes and could be four hours in an emergency.  AR 834. 
Any greater variance would need supervisor approval.  AR 834.
            During a May 2019 meeting
with her supervisor, Locke discovered that Kazaryan was changing information on
her Form 158s after they had been approved. 
AR 835.  When CSWs submit a Form
158 and obtain advance approval, the actual time they visit the site may differ
from the time they wrote.  AR
835-36.  They need to fill out a
completely different Form 158 to reflect the correct time.  AR 836. 
Mosley explained at the meeting that CSWs are not entitled to change approved
Form 158s without a manager’s approval. 
AR 836.  CSWs must submit new Form
158s if there are changes.  AR 836.  
            Many people changed
information on the Form 158s themselves, although protocol required them to
submit a new Form 158 with new information. 
AR 953-54.  Once Mosley told Kazaryan
not to change her Form 158s, she did not do so anymore.  AR 953-54. 
Kazaryan told Locke that she did not know the practice was unacceptable
in the 15 years she had been revising her Form 158s.  AR 969. 
Locke emailed her whole unit to clarify that any changes to a Form 158
needed supervisor approval.  AR 954.
            Kazaryan went on
approved FMLA leave, and her cases were redistributed to other DCFS
employees.  AR 841.  Regina contacted Locke while Kazaryan was on
leave to report that Kazaryan failed to complete necessary paperwork for
funding her home to be approved out of state. 
AR 846-47.  Regina also asserted that
Kazaryan failed to make monthly home visits. 
AR 847.  She would schedule them
for the end of the month, only to either call to cancel or just fail to appear
without calling first.  AR 847.
            Locke informed Mosley of
Regina’s complaint, and Mosley instructed Locke to obtain an affidavit from Regina.  AR 848. 
Regina provided the affidavit to Locke, which Locke submitted to
Mosley.  AR 848.  Locke believed that Risk Management contacted
her regarding Kazaryan’s performance.  AR
849.  
During her
interview, Locke provided copies of Kazaryan’s field itineraries and mileage
printout and copies of her Form 158 overtime requests.  AR 849.  Locke compares the CWS/CMS with overtime
requests and field itineraries to verify completion of such tasks.  AR 866-67. 
One overtime entry was for March 23, 2019 to visit Kristen at a drug
treatment center from 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. 
AR 859.  When Locke approved that
overtime, she expected Kazaryan to pick the children up and take them to the
mother’s treatment center, monitor the children’s visit with the mother, from 1:30
p.m. to 5:30 p.m.  AR 859-60.  
            Kazaryan should have
documented the visit in CWS/CMS within the next three days to ensure
documentation that the children were seen and safe.  AR 860. 
The lack of service logs for March 23, 2019 would raise a concern that Kazaryan
did not complete the task she was paid to do. 
AR 866.  Locke approved overtime
for March 23, 2019, but there is no contact in CWS/CMS to show the work was
completed on that date.  AR 888-89.
            Counsel showed Locke the
March 23, 2019 text messages between Kazaryan and Dave, one of the children’s
caregivers.  AR 867, 1887.  Locke testified that Kazaryan did not show
her these messages.  AR 867.
            A May 4, 2019 entry has
no information about the supposed contact. 
AR 875.  This creates a “ghost
contact” in which a CSW creates a contact but fails to enter sufficient
information about it.  AR 876.  The entry only said that there was a
supervised visit of the father and the children, but what happened was not
entered.  AR 878.  Locke could not tell from that information if
a visit even occurred.  AR 878-79.
            Service logs show that HSAs
and other staff conducted visits on April 2, 17, and 23, 2019.  AR 880-82.  They do not show a visit from a CSW during
that month.  AR 886-87.
            At one point, Locke talked
to Mosley about her concerns that Kazaryan’s overtime did not match her
mileage.  AR 995.  She also noted that Kazaryan was working a
lot of overtime.  AR 996. 
            Kazaryan was reassigned
to a different supervisor in February 2020 after her previous reassignment
requests were denied.  AR 944.  Locke did not know why Kazaryan’s requests
were denied, but it might have been because she was under investigation.  AR 944. 
Locke never discussed her concerns about Kazaryan with Wikler, who had
been Kazaryan’s supervisor in 2018.  AR
1241.
            The Rodgers Report said
that Regina told Locke that she (Regina) was upset with Kazaryan because she advocated
too much for the parents.  AR 979.  Regina never told Locke that, and Locke never
told Rodgers that.  AR 979. 
 
            c. Mosley
            Mosley was Locke’s
supervisor at the DCFS Santa Clarita office. 
AR 1029.  Her supervisorial duties
include approval of court reports, overtime requests, and mileage
requests.  AR 896.  She also takes complaints from clients and
manages Performance Management issues. 
AR 896.  
            DCFS policy is that, within
72 hours of a child visit, the CWS should document in CMS/CWS who and what they
saw, whether they saw any marks or bruises, whether the house was in shambles,
and other details.  AR 1201-02.  A ghost contact occurs when a CSW creates a
contact in CMS/CWS on a certain date but fails to input any narrative about the
visit like the time of arrival, what the CSW did during the contact, and
whether there were any marks or bruises on the children.  AR 937. 
Ghost contacts were occurring more often than desired, and supervisors
were asked to randomly go through cases and look for them.  AR 938. 
            A field itinerary is used
by CSWs to document where they are going. 
AR 1202.  CSWs fill out the date,
time, and case they are going to see and an approximate time of arrival, and
the field itinerary is signed off by the immediate supervisor.  AR 1203. 
Field itineraries also show whether a CSW is working on their first
priority, which is going out to make sure the children in their caseload are
safe.  AR 900, 1041.  The visit times listed on field itineraries
may be estimates, especially when a CSW has more than one planned on the same
day.  AR 898-99.  The supervisors use the field itinerary for
their mileage accounting and to know where the CSWs are.  AR 1203. 
The person
overseeing the CSW’s mileage request might not approve it if the claim might be
inaccurate.  AR 897.  The mileage request should match the field
itineraries, which supervisors use to check if CSWs are seeing clients.  AR 897-98. 
  
            CSWs use Form 158s to request
overtime.  AR 1203-04.  The CSW should submit a Form 158 as early as
possible for approval, usually two or three days in advance.  AR 1041-42. 
No DCFS policy explicitly says that, but there is an “emergency
overtime” exception.  AR 1042.  If a CSW plans to change their approved overtime
work, he or she should notify their supervisor that the change will happen and
the Form 158 can be modified, or else the CSW should not perform that
work.  AR 913-914, 939, 1042-43.  
            Emergency situations do
arise, such as when an approved overtime request needs to be extended by
several hours to detain a child.  AR
1047-48.  The HR Manual says that the CSW
should use his or her phone to send an email to the supervisor about the change
to document it.  AR 1048-49.  The supervisor would have to go back and look
at the Form 158 and modify it.  AR 1048.
            When overtime changes for
non-emergency reasons – such as when the client asks to meet at a new time --
the CSW should communicate that fact to the supervisor.  AR 1050. 
Mosley admitted that everybody’s practice is different in this
regard.  AR 1050.  She would want a new Form 158 to reflect the time
actually worked so that audit controllers can see it.  AR 1051.
             Mosley contacted Performance Management through
the County’s fraud hotline regarding Regina’s complaints about Kazaryan.  AR 905. 
Performance Management instructed Mosley to obtain an affidavit from Regina,
which Locke obtained.  AR 906-07.  
            Mosley’s involvement in
the IA investigation of Kazaryan was limited to being a witness.  AR 909. 
She did not investigate the allegations herself or talk to any of
Kazaryan’s other clients.  AR 1183.  
            Mosely defined a visit as
any face-to-face contact with a child on the CSW’s caseload.  AR 1184. 
This includes a visit when children are with their biological
parents.  AR 1184.  When the children are at the home of a
parent, the CSW must visit this home either once or twice a month.  AR 1184. 
Because Mosely did not investigate this case, she did not ask the birth
parents if Kazaryan missed a home visit with either of them.  AR 1184.
            HSAs assist CSWs in
monitoring visits for children and their parents.  AR 1198. 
Because they are not social workers, a visit from an HSA does not count
as a face-to-face contact.  AR 1198.
            Mosley had a meeting
with Kazaryan regarding her form F58s. 
AR 910.  The Form 158 has to be
approved by the chain of command, which is the supervisor, Mosley, and Regional
Administrator Michael Rauso (“Rauso”), and it is a very cumbersome process.  AR 912-13. 
 Kazaryan would have a Form 158
approved by a supervisor like Locke.  She
would then cross out and change information without approval as she felt necessary. 
AR 911-12.  Mosley informed
Kazaryan that she should not unilaterally change her Form 158s after they were
approved.  AR 921, 927.  Because Kazaryan gave her reasons for
modifying the Form 158s, Mosely agreed to check with Human Resources to verify
the accuracy of her direction to Kazaryan. 
AR 1053.  Human Resources informed
him the same day as his email, May 30, 2019, that the policy is that the Form 158
must be pre-approved and cannot be changed except in an emergency situation.  AR 927-28.
            The Hearing Officer
asked if Mosley knew of any other CSW terminated for misusing or falsifying
overtime requests.  AR 925.  Mosley did not.  AR 925. 
She did not refer Kazaryan to the fraud hotline and does not know why
she was fired.  AR 925.  She just told Kazaryan to stop revising Form
158s without supervisor approval.  AR
926-27.
 
            d. Discussion About Rodgers’ Report
            During
Mosley’s testimony, the Hearing Officer asked DCFS’ counsel whether the
decisionmaker who issued the NOD reviewed the Rodgers Report.  AR 1086. 
DCFS said no because the Rodgers Report was not in the Skelly
packet.  AR 1086.  The Hearing Officer thought this was
odd.  A DCFS investigator conducted a
thorough investigation and prepared a detailed report and yet the decision-maker
did not use the report in deciding the discipline.  AR 1086-87.
            DCFS’
counsel admitted that the decisionmaker usually gets the investigative report.  AR 1088. 
In his experience, the decisionmaker makes the decision based on the
Letter of Discharge and the enclosures that the decision-maker receives.  AR 1088. 
Someone in Performance Management usually writes that letter for the
decisionmaker to sign.  AR 1088.
            The
Hearing Officer stated that this creates a “metaphysical twist.”  AR 1088. 
The would-be decision-maker is kept in the dark until he receives a
letter with orders to sign it.  AR
1088.  DCFS’ argument implies that merely
signing a letter somehow turns him into a decisionmaker.  AR 1088. 
The Rodgers Report was highly relevant for Kazaryan to know why
management decided to terminate her.  AR
1089.  Yet, she did not receive it until
the middle of the appeal hearing.  AR
1089.
            Kazaryan’s
counsel pointed out the Rodgers Report has exculpatory information from Wilker
that the decisionmaker did not see when he signed the NOD.  AR 1089. 
This meant that Kazaryan could not raise the Wilker information in the Skelly
proceeding.  AR 1089.
                        
            e.  Rauso
            Rauso is employed by DCFS
as a regional administrator.  AR
1271.  Rauso has been employed by DCFS for
18 years.  AR 1271.  
            Rauso made the decision “to
move toward termination” of Kazaryan.  AR
1273.  Rauso based his decision to
discharge on Kazaryan’s missed contacts, misrepresentations of those contacts,
and falsified overtime via submitted Form 158s. 
AR 1275.  He could not remember if
he reviewed the Skelly packet. 
AR 1275. 
            When Rauso reviews CWS/CMS
entries, he looks for what the CSW did and how they did it.  AR 1282. 
The details allow supervisors to confirm the CSWs covered what they were
supposed to cover.  AR 1282-83.
            If Rauso finds that an
employee conducted a child visit but did not document it, it causes
problems.  AR 1283-84.  If something happens to that employee, DCFS
cannot follow up on what that employee did. 
AR 1284.  The child could be in
danger, and DCFS would have no documentation of it.  AR 1284.
            Mosely alerted Rauso
that Kazaryan did not make her monthly visits. 
AR 1286.  She provided contacts
with the family members that the visits were not made.  AR 1286. 
A CSW who does not make the monthly visits cannot ensure the safety of
the child, as is the CSW’s duty.  AR
1286.  
            Rauso believed that
Kazaryan missed contacts for more than one family.  AR 1313. 
Even if it was for only one family, it was a very serious issue.  AR 1313. 

 
            e.  Kazaryan
            Kazaryan began as a CSW
I and was promoted to CSW III in 2007. 
AR 1323.  Kazaryan’s main priority
was to assess and maintain the safety of the children in her caseload.  AR 1323. 
Her job duties included assessing, identifying, documenting children’s
safety, providing services to the family, providing parents with reunification services,
and arranging visitation between parents and caregivers with children.  AR 1324. 
She would talk to a foster family, the birth family, and the foster
children because reunification is the main goal.  AR 1324, 1327.
            Kazaryan had not
received any discipline prior to Locke becoming her supervisor.  AR 1331. 
Locke frequently failed to timely process her mileage reimbursements and
Form 158s.  AR 1331.  Kazaryan once asked Locke why she had not
processed a mileage request after four months. 
AR 1331.  Locke’s response was
just “we’re still looking at it.”  AR
1331.
            Kazaryan’s visits
changed at the last minute after she submitted a Form 158 for pre-approval of
overtime.  AR 1337.  Kazaryan changed her Form 158s as needed to match.  AR 1337. 
She had done this for 15 years, and all the other CSWs in the office did
the same thing.  AR 1337.  Kazaryan stopped changing her Form 158s after
Mosley told her in May 2019 that it was unacceptable.  AR 1338.
            Regina never complained
to Kazaryan that she missed visits with her or the kids.  AR 1342. 
When Kazaryan was assigned Regina’s case, others described the case as
challenging because of Regina.  AR 1343.  Regina was writing letters to the Board of
Supervisors and lodging complaints, so Kazaryan was asked to take the case.  AR 1343. 

            When Kazaryan first
contacted her, Regina insisted that the parents were bad and that she needed to
adopt the children.  AR 1343.  Kazaryan informed Regina that reunification
was the goal and that she had to make reasonable efforts towards that
goal.  AR 1343.  Regina did not like that and felt that Kazaryan
was siding with the mother and trying to unify the children with their parents.
 AR 1343. 

            Kazaryan found Regina very
difficult.  AR 1343.  Regina would attempt to make the kids
unavailable for Kazaryan’s visits, coach and bribe them to make statements
against the parents, and generally try to persuade Kazaryan of the parents’
unfitness.  AR 1344.  
 
            The July 3, 2018 Visit
            On July 3, 2018, Kazaryan
visited the children.  AR 1354.  Regina has asserted Kazaryan did not conduct
a visit in July 2018.  AR 1364.  This likely was because Regina assumed the
visit had to be at the house.  AR
1364.  A home visit can be outside the
home at a school or during the mother’s visit. 
AR 1364.   Kazaryan visited the
children on July 3 when the girls were with Kristen.  AR 1364. 

 
            July 26, 2018 Overtime 
Regina emailed Kazaryan
on July 2, 2018 to say that she was going on vacation from July 19 to 24,
taking the kids camping, and then she and her husband were going away alone for
some adult time.  AR 1354-55.  Kazaryan understood that Regina and her
husband would be on vacation in the mountains and the girls were going to visit
their grandparents.  AR 1531.  
On July 26, 2018,
Kristen called Kazaryan to tell her she could not reach the grandparent who was
supposed to be watching the children while Regina and her husband were out of
town that week.  AR 1357.  Kazaryan tried calling and texting Regina but
could not reach her.  AR 1357-1358.  Kazaryan’s text that day read “How do you
reach Mom? She’s not answering me.”  AR
1533.  She was referring to Regina’s
mother -- the children’s grandmother whom she believed was watching the
children.  AR 1533-34.  Regina eventually texted that she had bad phone
reception because she was in the mountains. 
AR 1358.  Regina confirmed that Kristen
was supposed to visit that day.  AR 1358,
1416.  When Kazaryyan asked how Kristen
could talk to the grandmother watching over the kids, Regina did not answer due
to a bad connection.  AR 1358.  
            Kazaryan was not sure
how to respond to a situation where Kristen was waiting to have her scheduled
visit.  AR 1358.  By this point, Regina owed Kristen multiple
visits with her children.  AR
1358-59.  Kazaryan decided to conduct an
emergency visit and informed supervisor Wikler. 
AR 1358.  She wanted to pick up
the kids and transport them to Kristen. 
AR 1366.  When she arrived at the
home, she knocked but did not hear anything. 
AR 1358. She called Kristen and told her she would have to visit another
time.  AR 1358.
            This July 26 attempted visit
information is in the report to the court, but Kazaryan took responsibility for
not entering the contact narrative in the CSW/CMS.  AR 1366. 
If she had recorded the information, she would have said there was a
scheduled visit with the biological mother, she looked around the house for a
few minutes, heard nothing and saw nobody, and called Kristen to cancel the
visit and promised to arrange a future one. 
AR 1366-67.
 
            November 30, 2018 Home Visit and November
23, 2018 Overtime
            Kazaryan performed a
home visit on November 30, 2018 at 7:00 p.m.  AR 1369, 1371. 
She had planned a visit for November 23, which was Black Friday, but Regina
cancelled it and asked if they could do it the next week.  AR 1368-69. 
Kazaryan agreed and the visit was set for November 30 after 5:00 or 6:00
p.m.  AR 1369.  Due to oversight, Kazaryan did not change her
contact report which she already had entered into CSW/CMS, or her mileage claim,
to match the actual November 30 date.  AR
1368-69, 1457-59.  
Kazaryan wanted to
conduct the visit the next day instead because she worked late on November 30
to finish a court report.  AR 1370.  She then realized that the next day would be December
1, which meant that she would be in violation of the requirement that she visit
in November.  AR 1370.  She therefore informed Regina that she would
visit the evening of November 30, 2018, and Regina agreed.  AR 1371. 
That information was omitted from Regina’s affidavit.  AR 1371.
            Kazaryan requested
overtime for the planned November 23 visit. 
The Form 158 for that overtime was dated November 20, three days before
the scheduled date of November 23.  AR
1460-61.  The two hours listed on the
mileage claim form for going to Granada Hills should have been for November 30.
 AR 1468. 
Kazaryan did not fill out a mileage claim for November 30, the actual
date of the visit.  AR 1465.  She also did not claim or receive overtime pay
for the November 30 work.  AR 1464, 1553.  She just did not realize that she had not
changed the date from November 23 to November 30.  AR 1553.   

 
            March 23, 2019 Overtime
            Kazaryan did have a home
visit with the children on March 23, 2019. 
AR 1429.  Kazaryan texted Jeffrey on
March 22, 2019.  AR 1426.  Because he was the biological father, one of
her goals was to reunify him with his children. 
AR 1426.  They were coordinating
when he could visit, when the mother could visit, and what help HSAs could
offer.  AR 1427.  Although the texts refer to Jeffrey going to
a restaurant with the girls, it was considered a monthly home visit, which can take
place at any agreed location like a daycare or parent’s home.  AR 1429-30. 
CSWs still try to have at least every other visit be at the foster
home.  AR 1429-30.
            Kazaryan’s pre-approved Form
158 listed the meeting time as 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.  AR 1451. 
At the last minute, Jeffrey asked to schedule the visit for dinner
instead of lunch.  AR 1451-1452.  This did not make the request fraudulent
because Kazaryan still worked four hours of overtime, but from 4:30 p.m. to
8:30 p.m. instead.  AR 1451-52.  She forgot to change and initial her Form 158
to reflect the different time.  AR 1452.
 
            April 2019 Home Visit
            In April 2019, Regina
had moved to Wisconsin and the children were still with her husband.  AR 1432. 
They decided to have a CFT meeting to plan the resulting issues.  AR 1431-32. 
Kazaryan was trying to set up the meeting with all relevant team
members, including her supervisor Locke. 
AR 1432.  Locke said she was on
vacation, so Kazaryan told Regina that the CFT meeting was not possible.  AR 1433. 
Regina was upset, but it was beyond Kazaryan’s control.  AR 1433. 
Kazaryan told Regina that they would schedule the CFT in May.  AR 1433.
Kazaryan had visits
with the children that month, just not in the home.  AR 1433. 
Kazaryan had visits with the children that month, but not in the
home.  AR 1433.  Kazaryan initially did not recall if she
attended one of the HSA meetings. AR 1914. 
Those were monitored visits for the parents and the HSAs relieve the CSW
of performing that task.  AR 1590.  Kazaryan subsequently conceded that she was
not part of any of the April 9, April 17, and April 27 visits logged in by
HSAs.  AR 1589-90.  She explained that she may have logged a
visit under the name of the oldest of the three children, but CWS/CMS did not
properly populate she had visited all three children. AR 1587-88.  The system lists the three children as separate
cases and not the same case.  AR 1584,
1588.  Contacts may have been missing
from any one child’s file as a result. 
AR 1588.  
Kazaryan had a visit
scheduled for an April home visit that Regina cancelled because she was upset
that the CFT meeting would not occur.  AR
1591.  Regina would not allow Kazaryan to
conduct her home visit for the month, and it was a “missed visit”.  AR 1591. 
DCFS is not the police and CSWs cannot force their way into the home to
conduct visits.  AR 1591.  The computerized system informs CSWs when
there are missed visits for a particular month. 
AR 1441.
 
            May 2019 Home Visit
            She performed a home
visit in May 2019.  AR 1595.  Some ghost contacts occur because a
supervisor will interrupt Kazaryan while she types the contact report.  AR 1440. 
She usually remembers to come back and finish, but she forgot at
times.  AR 1440.   This
was true for the May 2019 contact.  AR
1595-96.  Kazaryan conceded that this was
a mistake.  AR 1597.
 
            f.  Wikler
            Wikler has been employed
by DCFS as a dependency investigative supervisor since December 2019.  AR 1477. 
Prior to that time, Wikler served as a continuing services supervisor
for 20 years. AR 1478.  Wikler supervised
Kazaryan from 2010 to December 2018.  AR
1479.
            Kazaryan was Wikler’s
co-lead worker in his unit.  AR
1479.  Kazaryan was a seasoned worker who
did extremely well.  AR 1479.  Wikler had no concerns about her social work
or what she did when she was with her clients. 
AR 1479.  Kazaryan’s visits with
her children were roughly at a hundred percent on a regular basis.  AR 1480. 
There are times when a CSW cannot make a monthly visit, often because
the family did not make itself available. 
AR 1480.  She documented missed
visits and her efforts to make them.  AR
1480.
            Kazaryan was the CSW on
the Regina case file while Wikler was her direct supervisor.  AR 1481. 
Wikler did not receive any complaints from Regina about Kazaryan during
the entire time he was Kazaryan’s supervisor. 
AR 1482.  Regina did call him once
or twice, but only about funding-related issues.  AR 1482.
            Wikler was Kazaryan’s
supervisor before the Form 158s were electronic.  AR 1484. 
 CSWs informed Wikler via phone
call or text if the time for a pre-approved Form 158 had changed.  AR 1483. 
They would change the overtime request by scratching out the old time
and replacing it with a new one.  AR
1484.  Wikler would then change his
documentation once the CSW got back to the office.  AR 1484. 
That flexibility in scheduling was necessary for the CSWs due to the
nature of their work, including the unavailability of the family at a specific
time.  AR 1488.
            Kazaryan worked a lot of
overtime, more than any other CSW in his unit. 
AR 1488.  Kazaryan’s overtime was
attributable to her own caseload and time spent assisting other CSWs on their
cases.  AR 1489.  For this reason, the amount of overtime
worked by Kazaryan was not unusual.  AR
1489.  Wikler never doubted Kazaryan
worked the overtime she claimed.  AR
1482-83.
            A ghost contact could
mean that the contact was not done.  AR
1508.  It could also mean the contact was
done and that the CSW started the entry with the intent to complete it later, but
it did not for whatever reason.  AR
1509.  It was not unusual for a CSW to
make the contact, start the entry, and not go back to complete the entry for a
good faith reason.  AR 1509.  An increase in workload sometimes makes it
impossible to log contacts within 72 hours. 
AR 1509-10.
 
            g. Kristen
            Kristen could not recall
whether she had a reachable phone number in July 2018.  AR 1676. 
She assumed so because she always kept updated records of her contact
information with whatever CSW was assigned to her children at the time.  AR 1676. 

            Kazaryan had her phone
number on July 26, 2019.  AR 1680.  The two talked about how the girls were not
at Regina’s house that day.  AR 1681.  She did not get to see her girls on that
date.  AR 1681-82.  Kristen recalled that they were out-of-state
with their grandparents.  AR 1682.
            Kazaryan never missed
any scheduled visits with her and the girls. 
AR 1682.
 
            h. Danielle Murphy
            Danielle Murphy oversaw
Adam Holguin, the CSW who had Regina’s case from 2019 to 2020.  AR 1732. 
It was hard to nail Regina down to visits.  AR 1736. 
He understood that Regina thought Jeffery was a “Disneyland dad” who would
not reunify.  AR 1736.  Regina appeared to really want the children
and made scheduling difficult.  AR
1737.  This is not an unusual situation
for caregivers.  AR 1737.  Some are frustrated or fed up and some have
become attached to the children.  AR
1737.
 
            9. The Hearing Officer’s Recommendation
            On June 28, 2022, the Hearing
Officer issued a report recommending that the Commission overturn
Kazaryan’s termination and award her backpay from October 25, 2021.  AR
86, 115.  
            
a. Analysis
The Hearing Officer concluded
that the allegations in the NOD were not true. 
AR 90.  The fact that all the
allegations concerned Kazaryan’s conduct with one family undermined any
argument that she has a practice of falsifying documents and neglecting her job
duties.  AR 91.  The superior court ordered reunification of
the children with their parents, which was therefore one of Kazaryan’s
responsibilities.  AR 91.
            Locke became Kazaryan’s
supervisor in February 2019, but a lot of the allegations concerned events pre-dating
her supervision.  AR 91-92.  Kazaryan’s previous supervisor, Wilker, said that
she was an extremely reliable and honest employe.  AR 92. 
In contrast, Locke and Kazaryan clashed almost immediately, and it only
worsened over time.  AR 92, 108.  By February or March 2019, Locke started to
question Kazaryan’s’ use of overtime and reported concerns to Mosley.  AR 92. 
She also refused to endorse a mileage reimbursement request because it
did not match other documents turned in. 
AR 92.  Locke stated that Kazaryan
was the only CSW who used overtime, and Locke felt that fact was
significant.  AR 92.
            Kazaryan took a FMLA
leave due to workplace stress in mid-2019. 
Locke first spoke with Regina in June and July 2019 to discuss County
funding so that the children could move with her to Wisconsin.  AR 93.  Regina blamed Kazaryan for the fact that
funding was not in place, and she also alleged that Kazaryan often missed
monthly visits with the family or waited to do them at the last minute.  AR 93. 
The Hearing Officer opined that Locke welcomed this negative report
based on her own suspicions and doubts about Kazaryan.  AR 93.
            While Kazaryan was on
leave, Locke spoke to Mosley, and Mosely spoke to Performance Management, about
Regina’s complaint.  AR 93.  Neither supervisor asked Kazaryan for her
response to Kazaryan’s allegations.  AR
93.  At the hearing, both Locke and Mosley
distanced themselves from the investigation and termination of Kazaryan.  AR 94. 
Mosley in particular testified that she did not have any role in the investigation
and only reported Regina’s comments to Performance Management.  AR 94.
            Rodgers conducted a
biased and incomplete investigation of Regina’s allegations.  AR 94. 
She accepted the allegations as fact and failed to interview the birth
parents.  AR 94.  Because visits often included at least one
birth parent, they would have had personal knowledge of Kazaryan’s conduct as a
CSW III.  AR 94.  Rodgers seemed to identify Locke and Regina
as the “good guys” and Kazaryan and the birth parents as the suspicious
wrongdoers, thereby creating a presumption of guilt.  AR 95. 
The Rodgers Report failed to report on the facts in an unbiased way.  AR 95.
            An example of Rodgers’
bias concerns the July  26, 2018
overtime.  AR 95.  The evidence shows that Regina often
frustrated Jeffrey, Kristen, and Kazaryan’s efforts to facilitate monthly
visits.  AR 95.  Kazaryan scheduled a visit for July 26, 2018,
based on the belief that the children would be home with a grandparent while
Regina was in Las Vegas.  AR 95.  Kazaryan therefore filed for four hours of
overtime.  AR 95. The visit was not
completed because the kids were in Las Vegas with Regina, but Regina never told
anyone.  AR 95.  Kazaryan visited the house, rang the bell,
and went home when no one responded.  AR
96.  She still spent two hours on this
task and claimed overtime for it, but Rodgers was adamant at the hearing that the
hours were still fraudulent without actual contact.   AR 96. 
When the Hearing Officer asked if Rodgers expected Kazaryan to donate
the time it took to go to the home and check, Rodgers had no answer.  AR  96.
            Rodgers’ understanding
is legally flawed and contrary to California employment law.  Rodgers demonstrated expectation bias; she
expects to find fraud and all the evidence looked like fraud to her.  AR 96.
Another example of
Rodgers’ bias is her findings about the Form 158s.  AR 96-97. 
The evidence showed that all CSWs in Kazaryan’s office were forced to
modify preapproved overtime requests, often in minor ways.  AR 97. 
For example, the requested overtime start and end time might change but not
the number of hours.  AR 97.  Kazaryan’s former supervisor, Wikler, allowed
CSWs to pencil in these changes and submit the corrected form to him.  AR 97. 
He never thought Kazaryan was untruthful in making her changes.  AR 97.
            Rodgers applied a very
rigid test to Kazaryan, treating any change to a Form 158 after approval as
fraud.  AR 97.  She refused to even consider that the
Department’s procedure was flawed and that DCFS policy was at fault for failing
to recognize the need for flexibility. 
AR 97-98.  After Locke became
supervisor, she issued a memorandum to instruct CSWs to resubmit a new Form 158
if changes became necessary.  AR 98.   Locke testified that the lack of procedural
clarity before then meant Kazaryan had not engaged in misconduct.  AR 98. 
Rodgers fixated on defending her findings of fraud, despite evidence
discounting such findings.  AR 98.  Her testimony was unreliable due to
expectation bias.  AR 111.
            Rauso’s testimony as
decisionmaker raised other concerns.  Because
he became the new Regional Administrator while Kazaryan was on leave, he never
worked with Kazaryan before or during the time of the alleged wrongdoing.  AR 98. 
Whether he knew about Kazaryan’s excellent work history is unclear.  AR 99. 
He testified that he terminated Kazaryan because “staff” recommended
termination.  AR 99.  By “staff”, he meant Mosley.  AR 99. 
This testimony contradicted Mosley’s testimony that she had a limited
role in the investigation after she reported Regina’s complaint to Performance
Management.  AR 99.  Such testimony was false because both Locke
and Mosley advocated to Rauso that he should terminate Kazaryan.  AR 111.
            Rauso’s testimony also
raised Skelly issues about the failure to provide the Rodgers Report to
Kazaryan.  AR 99.  The Rodgers Report had not been given to the Skelly
officer and was not marked as an exhibit for the appeal hearing.  AR 99-100. 
Rauso testified that he reviewed
the Rodgers Report, but DCFS’ counsel admitted that it had never been given to
Rauso.  AR 100.  The Hearing Officer found that DCFS did not
provide Rauso with a copy.  AR 110.  DCFS’ counsel argued that it had no Skelly
duty to provide the Rodgers Report to Kazaryan. 
AR 100, 110-11.  The question
becomes: What basis did Rauso have to terminate Kazaryan if he did not read the
Rodgers Report?  AR 100.  The answer seems to be Mosley’s
recommendation.  AR 100.  This raises the issue of who actually decided
to terminate Kazaryan?  It appears to
have been an institutional decision based purely on momentum from Regina’s
complaint without any managerial oversight. 
AR 100.
            DCFS did not call Regina
as a witness, even though her accusations initiated the investigation.  AR 100-01. 
Regina’s hearsay affidavit was not credible.  AR 101. 
Regina was difficult, and she actively opposed Kazaryan’s attempts at
reunification of the children with their parents.  AR 101, 109, 111.  She accused Kazaryan of missing home visits,
but her definition of a home visit was erroneous because it was limited to
visits to Regina’s home.  AR 101.
            Regina and Locke found
common cause in their shared disdain of Kazaryan.  AR 102. 
Regina wanted to adopt the kids, which is contrary to the stated intent
of both DCFS and the superior court.  AR
102, 109.  Lockes’ dislike of Kazaryan is
harder to explain but no less evident. AR 12. 
Locke felt disrespected by Kazaryan and experienced tension and conflict
ever since she became her manager.  AR
102.  Rodgers failed to detect the clear
bias of both Locke and Regina in her investigation.  AR 102. 

            Kazaryan was the only
witness with personal knowledge of the merits of the allegations, and her testimony
was generally credible.  AR 102.  She had a 20-year history without discipline,
and she testified that she never falsified Form 158s, field itineraries,
mileage claim forms, or entries in CWS/CMS. 
AR 103.  Revisions after approval
were necessary to ensure accuracy because clients often changed the meeting
times or locations too close to the meeting for advanced approval.  AR 103. 

            Kazaryan disputed the
allegation that she falsified an overtime claim and an CWS/CMS entry for November
23, 2018.  AR 103.  Regina cancelled the visit for that date, and
they agreed via text to a visit on November 30. 
AR 103.  Kazaryan had an overtime
request and field itinerary for November 23 pre-approved, and she forgot to
change the paperwork.  AR  103-04. 

            Although Regina’s
complaint accused Kazaryan of cancelling visits or waiting for the last day to
conduct them, Regina left out the fact that she is the one who cancelled the
November 23 meeting at the last minute. 
AR 104.  Kazaryan’s failure to
change the date in the record was a simple mistake, not willful dishonesty.  AR 104. 
In any case, this shows that Regina’s complaint cannot be trusted
because it hides her own culpability to paint Kazaryan in a bad light.  AR 104-105.
            DCFS’s accusations were
not based on reliable evidence.  AR
105.  Regional Administrator Rauso
terminated Kazaryan based solely on the recommendation of Mosley.  AR 105. 
Mosley’s only role, based on her testimony, was to report what Locke
told her to Performance Management and the County Auditor.  AR 105. 
Locke testified that she had concerns regarding Kazaryan but did not
testify to any specific wrongdoing.  AR
105.  Each of DCFS’s witnesses relied on
unreliable hearsay or lacked personal knowledge of any alleged wrongdoing.  AR 105. 

            Kazaryan’s testimony, on
the other hand, was credible and provided detailed personal knowledge
explaining and excusing the alleged wrongdoing as either being accepted
protocol or good faith errors.  AR 105.  Kazaryan credibly denied any wrongful
intent.  AR 105.         
            DCFS also committed a
due process (Skelly) violation. 
AR 106.  DCFS failed to provide a
copy of the Rodgers Report to Kazaryan prior to the Skelly hearing.  AR 106. 
Nor did it provide a copy to Rauso, who made the decision to discharge
Kazaryan.  AR 106.  DCFS’s failure to provide the document to
Kazaryan was a clear violation of due process. 
AR 107.  
            The discipline imposed
was not appropriate because the allegations in DCFS’s September 17, 2020 NOD
were not true.  AR 107.  The remedy for the due process (Skelly)
violation is back pay up to the date of the civil service evidentiary hearing,
October 25, 2021.  AR 108.  The remedy for the Skelly violation
would be mooted if Kazaryan’s discharge is rescinded and back pay
provided.  AR 108.  
 
            b. Findings of Fact
            Locke and Kazaryan experienced
friction as soon as Locke became her supervisor.  AR 108. 

            Regina felt strongly
that she should be permitted to adopt the children, but the court ordered DCFS
to provide reunification services to the family.  AR 109. 
Because of her interest in adopting the three minor children, Regina was
often uncooperative.  AR 109.  She would hide the children and withhold
information, all to frustrate reunification efforts.  AR 109.
            After DCFS received Regina’s
complaint, it assigned Rodgers to investigate. 
AR 110.  She produced the Rodgers Report,
but Rauso, the decisionmaker, did not have access to it.  AR 110. 
DCFS also failed to provide Kazaryan a copy of the Rodgers Report until
after the hearing began.  AR 110-11.  The Rodgers Report was not credible and
reflected expectation bias.  AR 111.
            DCFS relied on Regina’s complaint
to prepare the NOD, but the complaint was biased and not credible.  AR 111. 
The same is true for her affidavit. 
AR 111.
            Locke and Mosley testified
that they had no input into the decision to terminate Kazaryan.  AR 111. 
Rauso based his decision to terminate her on their recommendation, not the
Rodgers Report that he did not even see. 
AR 111.
            DCFS failed to show that
Kazaryan falsified Form 158s, CWS/CMS, field itineraries, and milage
claims.  AR 112.  She did work two hours of overtime on July
26, 2018.  AR 112.  Although she reported overtime on November
23, 2018, and not November 30, it was an inadvertent error.  AR 112. 
Her failure to update the four-hour timeframe for overtime on March 23,
2019 was also inadvertent.  AR 113.
            As for home visits, the
evidence showed Kazaryan conducted visits on November 30, 2018 and May 4,
2019.  AR 113.  For April 2019, Kazaryan could not be certain
whether she attended the three home visits that HSAs documented, but she
believed that she attended one.  AR
113.  She did not separately document
it.  AR 113.  The evidence on whether she personally conducted
a home visit that month was inconclusive. 
AR 113.
            For the Skelly
issues, the Rodgers Report summarizes the evidence and factual findings that
allegedly supported the termination.  AR
114.  DCFS relied on the Rodgers Report,
and its failure to give this to Kazaryan or Rauso in pre-deprivation disclosures
means it withheld material information from both.  AR 114.
 
            c. Conclusions of Law
            The allegations in DCFS’
September 17, 2020 NOD are not true and discipline is not appropriate.   AR 114. 
Kazaryan’s termination should be rescinded, and she should be returned
to her former position and awarded backpay. 
AR 114.  
The Department also
violated Kazaryan’s Skelly rights and she should be awarded back
pay from the date of termination to October 25, 2021 to cure the due process
violation.  AR 115.
 
            10. The Commission’s Decision
            On September 7, 2022,
DCFS objected to the Hearing Officer’s report and recommendation.  AR 119-141. 
On October 26, 2022, the Commission overruled DCFS’ objections and adopted
the Hearing Officer’s report and his recommendation not to sustain Kazaryan’s
termination.  AR 241-42.
 
            E. Analysis
            Petitioner
County seeks administrative mandamus, contending that the Hearing Officer’s
findings are not supported by substantial evidence.
 
1. The Hearing Officer’s Credibility Findings
The Hearing Officer
found that Rodgers conducted a biased and incomplete investigation of Regina’s
allegations.  AR 94.  She accepted the allegations as fact and
failed to interview the birth parents who would have had personal knowledge of
Kazaryan’s conduct of home visits.  AR
94.  Rodgers seemed to identify Locke and
Regina as the good guys and Kazaryan and the birth parents as suspicious
wrongdoers, thereby creating a presumption of guilt.  AR 95. 

            The Hearing Officer gave
as an example Rodgers’ adamance that Kazaryan’s request for two hours of overtime
on July 28, 2018 was fraudulent because she attempted but did not have actual
contact with the children.  AR 95-96.  A second example was Rodgers’ rigid treatment
of any change to an approved Form 158 as fraud, even though DCFS policy was at
fault for failing to recognize the need for flexibility and Locke’s admission
that the lack of procedural clarity until May 2019 meant that Kazaryan had not
engaged in misconduct.  AR 98.  
            The Hearing Officer essentially
found that Rauso’s decision to terminate Kazaryan lacked foundation.  He was the decisionmaker, but he never worked
with her and never read the Rodgers Report. 
What basis did Rauso have to terminate Kazaryan if he did not read the Rogers
Report?  AR 100.  He testified that he terminated Kazaryan
because “staff” recommended it.  AR
99.  By that, he meant Mosley.  AR 99. 
Yet, Mosley testified that she had a limited role in the investigation
after reporting Regina’s complaint to Performance Management.  AR 99. 
The Hearing Officer concluded that Kazaryan’s termination appeared to
have been an institutional decision based purely on momentum from Regina’s
complaint without any managerial oversight. 
AR 100.
            The Hearing Officer
found that Regina’s hearsay affidavit was not credible.  AR 101. 
Regina was a difficult caregiver to deal with, and she actively opposed
Kazaryan’s attempts at reunification of the children with their parents.  AR 101, 109, 111.  She accused Kazaryan of missing home visits,
but her definition of a home visit was erroneous because it was limited to
visits to Regina’s home.  AR 101.
            The Hearing Officer also
found Locke biased.  Lockes’ dislike of
Kazaryan was hard to explain, but she felt disrespected by Kazaryan and
experienced tension and conflict ever since she became Kazaryan’s manager.  AR 102. 

            Finally, the Hearing
Officer found Kazaryan to be credible. 
She was the only witness with personal knowledge of the merits of the
allegations.  AR 102.  She had a 20-year history without discipline,
and she testified that she never falsified Form 158s, field itineraries,
mileage claim forms, or entries in CWS/CMS. 
AR 103.  Revisions after approval
were necessary to ensure accuracy because clients often changed the meeting
times or locations, too close to the meeting for advanced approval.  AR 103. 
Kazaryan provided detailed personal knowledge explaining and excusing
the alleged wrongdoing as either being accepted protocol or good faith
errors.  AR 105.  Kazaryan credibly denied any wrongful
intent.  AR 105.      
            The
court agrees with the Hearing Officer that Rodgers failed to conduct a complete
investigation and applied rigid interpretations of the evidence and Department
policy that were unwarranted.  This was
not necessarily a bias; it was just an inadequate investigation.  The court further agrees that Regina’s
hearsay affidavit is suspect because of her prejudice against Kazaryan and
misunderstanding of the definition of a home visit.[3]  The court also
agrees that Rauso lacked sufficient knowledge of the facts and did not make an
independent decision to terminate Kazaryan. 
The court does not agree with the Hearing Officer that Locke was
prejudiced against Kazaryan; that conclusion is not supported by any
significant evidence.  See Pet.
Op. Br. at 10.
            None of
these credibility findings is crucial, however, because the only witness who
matters is Kazaryan.  The entire case
against her was based on documentary evidence and DCFS’ interpretation of
it.  Kazaryan was the only witness with
personal knowledge of the events, and she provided an explanation for every
accusation against her.  Some of her
explanations involved an admission of documentation errors, but she was not
accused of making errors.  Rather, she
was accused of deliberately falsifying records and failing to make certain home
visits.  The Hearing Officer found
Kazaryan’s explanations to be credible and that fact is dispositive. 
“On substantial
evidence review, we do not ‘weigh the evidence, consider the credibility of
witnesses, or resolve conflicts in the evidence or in the reasonable inferences
that may be drawn from it.’”  Doe v.
Regents of University of California, (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 1055,
1073.  The court is required
to accept all evidence which supports the successful party, disregard
the contrary evidence, and draw all reasonable inferences to uphold the verdict.
 Minelian v. Manzella, (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 457,
463.  Credibility is an issue of fact for the finder of fact to
resolve (Johnson v. Pratt & Whitney Canada, Inc., (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 613, 622,
and the testimony of a single witness, even that of a party, is sufficient to
provide substantial evidence to support a finding of fact.  In re Marriage of Mix, (1975) 14 Cal.3d 604, 614.  Doe v. Regents of University of California, (2016)
5 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1074.
The County argues that, although the court’s review is
limited under the substantial evidence standard, that does not preclude the
court from determining whether Kazaryan’s testimony constitutes substantial
evidence.  “Substantial evidence” is
relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a
conclusion, (California Youth Authority supra, 104
Cal.App.4th at 585), or evidence of ponderable legal significance, which is
reasonable in nature, credible and of solid value.  Mohilef v. Janovici, supra, 51
Cal.App.4th at 305, n. 28.  Reply at 3.
As discussed post, Kazaryan had reasonable and solid explanations
for the each of the six instances of misconduct of which she was accused.  Because the Hearing Officer believed her, her
explanations are substantial evidence requiring denial of the County’s
Petition.
 
            2. The
Six Charges
            a. The
Claim for Overtime on July 26, 2018
Documents
On July 2, 2018,
Regina informed Kazaryan via email of a vacation she planned to take with the
children from July 19 to 24, 2008.  AR
307, 626.  Regina would then visit her
parents until July 29.  AR 307.  Kazaryan’s handwritten notes (AR 1355-56) state
that this meant the children would not be with Regina during her visit to her
parents and instead would be with their grandparents from Las Vegas.  AR 307. 
She also wrote “mother’s visits will be arranged by grandparents.”  AR 307. 

Kazaryan’s Form 158,
submitted on July 17, 2018, requests two hours of overtime for a monthly home
visit on July 26, 2018.  AR 1984.  Kazaryan stated that the overtime was
necessary because the children’s biological mother, Kristen, was unavailable
during regular work hours.  See AR
1984.
             A Delivered Service Log shows that on July 26,
2018, Kazaryan texted Kristen at both numbers on file for her.  AR 1832. 
She asked Kristen to call because she had been unable to reach her.  AR 1832.
            The log then shows that,
on July 26, 2018 at 9:29 a.m., Kazaryan texted Regina and asked her to call
because Kazaryan tried to talk to her the day before and the call went to
voicemail.  AR 1836.  At 10:48 a.m., Regina replied that she did
not have great cell service where she was but would call shortly.  AR 1839. 
Kazaryan also asked Regina if the kids were having visits with their
mother, Kristen.  AR 1839.  Regina said the children are having visits
with Kristen and they typically see her on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  AR 1840. 
Kazaryan replied that Kristen was not answering her calls or texts and
she wanted to see the children’s visits with their mother.  AR 1840.
            Kazaryan’s timecard shows
two hours of overtime for July 26, 2018. 
AR 1987.
 
            Kazaryan’s Testimony
Kazaryan testified
that Regina emailed her on July 2 to say that she was going on vacation from
July 19 to 24, taking the kids camping, and then she and her husband were going
away alone for some adult time.  AR
1354-55.  Kazaryan understood that Regina
and her husband were on vacation in the mountains and that the girls were going
to visit their grandparents.  AR
1531.  
On July 26, 2018,
Kristen called Kazaryan to tell her she could not reach the grandparent who was
supposed to be watching the children while Regina and her husband were out of
town that week.  AR 1357.  Kazaryan tried calling and texting Regina but
could not reach her.  AR 1357-1358.  1Kazaryan’s text to Regina that day read “How
do you reach Mom?  She’s not answering
me.”  AR 1533.  She was referring to Regina’s mother -- the
children’s grandmother -- whom she believed was watching the children.  AR 1533-34. 
Regina eventually texted that she had bad cell reception because she was
in the mountains.  AR 1358.  Regina confirmed that Kristen was supposed to
visit that day.  AR 1358, 1416.  When Kazaryan asked how Kristen could talk to
the grandmother watching the kids, Regina did not answer due to a bad phone
connection.  AR 1358.  
            Kazaryan was not sure
how to respond in a situation when Kristen was waiting to have her scheduled
visit.  AR 1358.  By this point, Regina owed Kristen multiple
visits with her children.  AR
1358-59.  Kazaryan decided to conduct an
emergency visit and informed supervisor Wikler. 
AR 1358.  She wanted to pick up
the kids and transport them to Kristen. 
AR 1366.  When she arrived at the
home, she knocked but did not hear anything. 
AR 1358. She called Kristen and told her she would have to visit another
time.  AR 1358.
            Although Kazaryan
reported the July 26 attempted visit in her report to the court, she took responsibility
for not entering the contact narrative in CSW/CMS.  AR 1366. 
If she had properly entered the contact, she would have said there was a
scheduled visit with the biological mother, she looked around the house for a
few minutes, heard nothing and saw nobody, and called Kristen to cancel the
visit and promised to arrange a future one. 
AR 1366-67.
 
            The Hearing Officer Finding
            The Hearing Officer found that Regina often frustrated Jeffrey, Kristen,
and Kazaryan’s efforts to facilitate monthly visits.  AR 95. 
Kazaryan scheduled a visit for July 26, 2018, based on the belief that
the children would be home with a grandparent while Regina was in Las
Vegas.  AR 95.  The visit was not completed because the kids
were in Las Vegas with Regina, but Regina never told anyone.  AR 95. 
Kazaryan visited the house, rang the bell, and went home when no one
responded.  AR 96.  She spent two hours on this task and claimed
overtime for it, but Rodgers was adamant in her testimony that the hours were
fraudulent since there was no actual contact.  
AR 96.  Rodgers’ understanding was
legally flawed and contrary to California employment law.  AR 96.  Kazaryan did work two hours of overtime on
July 26, 2018.  AR 112.  
 
The County’s Argument
The County argues that the Hearing Officer’s finding that
Kazaryan worked the two hours of overtime on July 26, 2018 is not supported by
the evidence.  Rather, the evidence
corroborates Regina’s allegation that Kazaryan did not conduct a home visit on
July 26, 2018 because she (Regina) and the children were out of town.  AR 623. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 5.
Kazaryan admitted that a home visit did not occur on July
26, 2018, but claimed she spent two hours conducting an unannounced visit to
Regina’s Granada Hills residence.  Kazaryan
falsely claimed overtime for that date because she knew there was no reason for
an unannounced visit as the children were in Las Vegas with their grandparents,
as Kristen confirmed.  AR 1681-82.  Kristen testified that she was reachable all
day, and that Kazaryan had her phone number. AR 1676-83.  Pet. Op. Br. at 5-6.
Kazaryan did not log in CWS/CMS that she conducted an
unannounced visit.  Instead, Kazaryan
logged that she was unable to contact the mother. AR 1832. Kazaryan’s
contemporaneous text messages with Regina show that Regina responded to
Kazaryan well before the unannounced visit between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., and
that Kazaryan was unable to communicate with Kristen, not Regina or the
grandparents. AR 1836-40.  Kazaryan
claimed the reference to “mother” in her July 3, 2018 log referred to Regina’s
mother (the children’s grandmother). AR 1533-37.  Kazaryan’s illogical claim is refuted by her
own log entries on July 3 and July 26, 2018, where she consistently referred to
Kristen as mother.  AR 1832.  Kazaryan did not note in any Department record
that she conducted an unannounced visit.  Kazaryan also did not revise her Form 158 to
reflect that her reason for working overtime had changed from a scheduled home
visit to an unannounced visit. AR 1366-67, 1984.  Pet. Op. Br. at 6.
            The
County wrongly believes that its interpretation of the text messages should
control.  The issue is not whether its
interpretation of the messages is viable or constitutes substantial evidence,
but rather whether Kazaryan’s testimony, as corroborated by the messages, is
substantial evidence.  The parties’
dispute whether Kazaryan believed the children were with the grandparents in
Las Vegas or with them at the family home. 
Regina confirmed that Kristen
was supposed to visit on July 26, 2018. 
AR 1358, 1416.  Kristen called Kazaryan
that day and said that she could not reach the grandparent who was supposed to
be watching the children while Regina and her husband were out of town.  AR 1357.  Mistaken or not, the undisputed evidence is
that Kazaryan conducted an emergency visit to Regina’s home and informed
supervisor Wikler.  AR 1358.  Kristen testified that she and Kazaryan talked
about how the girls were not at Regina’s house that day and she did not get to
see them.  AR 1681-82.  
Substantial
evidence supports the Hearing Officer’s conclusion that Kazaryan conducted an
emergency visit on July 26, 2018 and that there was no legitimate basis to deny
her overtime for doing so.
 
            b. Home
Visit and Overtime in November 2018
Documents
            Kazaryan’s Form 158
submitted on November 20, 2018, requests two hours of overtime for November 23,
2018.  AR 1870.  It states that the hours were necessary for a
home visit where the family was not available during regular work hours.  AR 1870.
On November
22, 2018, Regina texted Kazaryan to cancel the next day’s visit and asked to reschedule
for some time the next week.  AR
2050.  Kazaryan’s handwritten notes on a
printout of this message state that she rescheduled for November 30, 2018 but
failed to update the field itinerary and mileage form to reflect that fact.  AR 2050.
Kazaryan’s mileage
claim for November 30, 2018 shows that she left DCFS’ office in Santa Clarita
at 6:00 p.m., arrived in Van Nuys for a home visit with a different client at
6:30 p.m., and returned home at 11020 Eldorado Place in Los Angeles at 8:00
p.m.  AR 1843.  The form does not show a trip to Grenada
Hills that day.  AR 1843.  Her field itinerary for November 30 shows a
visit to “Jessica T.” at the Van Nuys address from 6:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.  AR 1859.
            Kazaryan’s timecard shows
two hours of overtime for November 23, 2018. 
AR 1991.
 
            Kazaryan’s Testimony
Kazaryan performed a
home visit on November 30, 2018 at 7:00 p.m. 
AR 1369, 1371.  She had planned a
visit for November 23, which was Black Friday, but Regina cancelled and asked
if they could do it the next week.  AR
1368-69.  Kazaryan agreed and the visit
was set for November 30 after 5:00 or 6:00 p.m. 
AR 1369.  Due to an oversight, Kazaryan
did not change her contact already entered in CSW/CMS, or her mileage claim, to
match the November 30 date.  AR 1368-69,
1457-59.  
Kazaryan wanted to
conduct the visit the next day because she worked late on November 30 to finish
a court report.  AR 1370.  But she realized that the next day would be
December 1 and by waiting she would be violating the requirement that she have
a November visit.  AR 1370.  She therefore informed Regina that she would
visit the evening of November 30, 2018, and Regina agreed.  AR 1371. 
That information was omitted from Regina’s affidavit.  AR 1371. 

            Kazaryan requested
overtime for the planned November 23 visit and the Form 158 for that visit was
dated November 20, three days before the scheduled date of November 23.  AR 1460-61. 
The two hours listed on the mileage claim form for going to Granada
Hills should have been for November 30. 
AR 1468.  Kazaryan did not submit an
additional mileage claim for November 30, the actual date of the visit.  AR 1465. 
She also did not submit an additional claim for overtime for the
November 30 visit.  AR 1464, 1553.  She simply did not realize that she had not
changed the paperwork date from November 23 to November 30.  AR 1553.   

 
            The Hearing Officer’s Finding
Kazaryan disputed
the allegation that she falsified an overtime claim and an CWS/CMS entry for November
23, 2018.  AR 103.  Regina cancelled the visit for that date, and
they agreed via text to a visit on November 30. 
AR 103.  Kazaryan had an overtime
request and filed itinerary for November 23 pre-approved, and she forgot to
change the paperwork.  AR  103-04. 

            Regina’s complaint
accused Kazaryan of cancelling visits or waiting for the last day to conduct
them.  AR 104.  Regina left out the fact that she cancelled
the November 23 meeting at the last minute. 
AR 104.  Kazaryan’s failure to
change the date in the record was a simple mistake, not willful dishonesty.  AR 104. Although she reported overtime on November
23, 2018, and not November 30, this was an inadvertent error.  AR 112. 

 
The County’s Argument
The County argues that Kazaryan
admitted that she did not work overtime on November 23, 2018, and that her
November 23, 2018 timesheet was not accurate. 
AR 1550-52, 1991-92.  Kazaryan
further admitted that she did not travel on November 23, 2018 from her
residence in Shadow Hills to Regina’s residence in Granada Hills and return
home as indicated on her mileage claim and field itinerary.  AR 1465-70, 1563, 1843, 1859.  Pet. Op. Br. at 6.
Kazaryan did not document that she worked overtime on
November 30, 2018. She did not submit a field itinerary or a Form 158 seeking
approval to work overtime on November 30, 2018.  AR 1457-65. Kazaryan did not even alter her Form
158 to reflect that she worked overtime on November 30, 2018, even though this
was her admitted practice.  AR 1337-38,
1870.  
Kazaryan claimed that she created a ghost contact in CWS/CMS
for a visit on November 23, 2018, and that she forgot to change the date from
November 23 to November 30, 2018. AR 1369, 1862, 1867.  The text messages contradict Kazaryan’s testimony
that she worked overtime on November 30, 2018.  AR 2050-52. They only show that Regina
cancelled the home visit scheduled for November 23, 2018, and that Kazaryan
attempted to re-schedule the home visit for the following week.  Kazaryan did not submit any text message showing
that she was successful in re-scheduling the visit, that she arrived at
Regina’s residence, or that the home visit took place on November 30, 2018.  AR 2050- 52. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 7.
Kazaryan claimed that she did not arrive at Regina’s home in
Granada Hills until 7:00 p.m. on November 30, 2018 because she had to complete
a court report.  Yet, Kazaryan’s mileage
claim for November 30, 2018 shows she left DCFS’ office in Santa Clarita at
6:00 p.m., arrived in Van Nuys for a home visit for a different client at 6:30
p.m., and returned to her home address at 11020 Eldorado Pl in Los Angeles at
8:00 p.m.  AR 1843.  Kazaryan’s field itinerary for November 30,
2017 also shows that she was going to see client Jessica T. from 6:00 p.m. to
8:00 p.m.  AR 1859.  Pet. Op. Br. at 7.
            The
County’s reliance on a November 30 field itinerary for another client, which by
 definition was prepared several days
before November 30, is of little significance. 
It merely shows that Kazaryan scheduled another client to see on
November 30 besides the last minute rescheduled visit to Regina.  The mileage claim form contradicting Kazaryan’s testimony is more significant
because it shows that Kazaryan was traveling between her office, the other
client, and her home between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.  It does not seriously contradict Kazaryan,
however, because she agreed to visit Regina after 5:00 or 6:00 p.m.  AR 1369. 
She could have done so and still visited the other client, submitting
mileage only for that client.  
Kazaryan submitted
no additional overtime for November 30.  She
did not claim additional mileage for November 30, probably because she was
claiming mileage for the other client.  Whether
this other client visit affects the accuracy of her November 23 mileage submission
is an issue not raised by the Department. 
In any event, Kazaryan explained that her failure to amend the November
23 paperwork, including the mileage claim, was a mistake.  
Substantial evidence
supports the Hearing Officer’s conclusion that Kazaryan conducted a home visit
and incurred two hours of overtime on November 30, 2018, and that her reported
overtime on November 23, 2018 was an inadvertent error.
 
            c. Overtime for March 23, 2019
            Documents
On March 5, 2019, Kazaryan received approval to work four
hours of overtime on March 23, 2018, a Saturday, from 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.,
for the purpose of taking the children to the drug treatment center where
Kristen was an in-patient.  AR
1878-79.  
On March 22, 2019 at
11:25 p.m., Kazaryan texted the children’s father, Jeffrey, to arrange a visit
the next day at 6:00 p.m. at a location somewhere around Grenada Hills if they
wanted to get something to eat.  AR
1882.  Jeffrey chose a restaurant that
afternoon, then another the next day after Kazaryan said the first restaurant was
too loud for a monitored visit.  AR
1882-83.
            On March 23, 2019,
sometime after 5:00 p.m., Kazaryan texted one of the children’s caregivers,
Dave.  AR 1887.  Kazaryan said she was outside the home and asked
Dave to bring the kids out for their visit with Jeffrey.  AR 1887. 
Dave responded that he had to leave and took the kids with him.  AR 1887. 
He thought the visit was at 4:00 p.m. 
AR 1887.
A Delivered Service
Log shows a visit between the children and Jeffrey on March 9, 2019, but no
entry for March 23, 2019.  AR 1875.  
 
Kazaryan’s
Testimony
            Kazaryan had a home
visit with the children on March 23, 2019. 
AR 1429.  Kazaryan texted Jeffrey
on March 22, 2019.  AR 1426.  Because he was the biological father, one of
her goals was to reunify him with his children. 
AR 1426.  They were coordinating
when he could visit, when Kristin could visit, and what help HSAs could
offer.  AR 1427.  Although the texts refer to Jeffrey going to
a restaurant with the girls, it was considered a monthly home visit, which can
take place at an agreed location like a daycare or parent’s home.  AR 1429-30. 
She noted that CSWs still try to have at least every other visit at the
foster home.  AR 1429-30.
            Kazaryan’s pre-approved Form
158 listed the meeting time as 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.  AR 1451. 
At the last minute, Jeffrey asked to schedule the visit for dinner
instead of lunch.  AR 1451-1452.  This did not make the request fraudulent
because Kazaryan still worked four hours of overtime, but from 4:30 p.m. to
8:30 p.m.  AR 1451-52.  She forgot to change and initial the Form 158
to reflect the different time.  AR 1452.
 
Hearing Officer’s
Finding
DCFS failed to show
that Kazaryan falsified Form 158s, CWS/CMS, field itineraries, and milage
claims.  AR 112.  Her failure to update the four-hour timeframe
for overtime on March 23, 2019 was inadvertent. 
AR 113.
 
The County’s Position
Locke approved Kazaryan’s Form 158 to work overtime on March
23, 2019 from 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., for the purpose of taking the children to
the drug treatment center where Kristen was an in-patient.  AR 1878-79.  Locke expected that Kazaryan would pick up the
children and transport them to the drug treatment center where Kristen resided,
the visit would occur during the indicated hours, and Kazaryan would log the
visit in CWS/CMS. AR 859-65.  Pet. Op.
Br. at 8.
The County argues that the text messages between Kazaryan
and Jeffrey establish that Kazaryan did not work overtime at the approved time
and for the approved purpose. AR 1882-1884. The messages show that Kazaryan
attempted to schedule a visit for Jeffrey, not Kristen. AR 1426.  Kazaryan claimed the visit did not occur
between the approved time of 1:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. because Jeffrey requested
at the last minute to change the time.  AR
1451-52. Yet, the text messages show that Kazaryan, not Jeffrey, suggested that
the visit should occur between 6:00 and 8:00 p.m.  AR 1882-84.  Pet. Op. Br. at 8.
Kazaryan did not submit any official documentation to
substantiate that she monitored a visit for Jeffrey between the hours of 6:30
p.m. and 8:00 p.m.   Kazaryan did not log
a visit in CWS/CMS for March 23, 2019.  The
Delivered Service Logs for March 1 through March 31, 2019 show that Kazaryan
visited the children on March 9, 2019.  Kazaryan
did not even alter the Form 158 overtime approval or her field itinerary to
reflect that the time and purpose of the visit had changed. AR 1878-79.   Pet.
Op. Br. at 8.
Kazaryan’s opposition (see Opp. at 15) correctly notes that she
was charged with intentionally falsifying her overtime hours, not
making errors in CWS/CMS, the Delivered Service Log, or her Form 158.  See Lone Star Sec. & Video,
Inc. v. Bureau of Sec. & Investigative Servs., (2012) 209 Cal.
App. 4th 445, 457 (fraud consists of
the misrepresentation or concealment of material facts or a statement of fact
made with consciousness of its falsity).  The undisputed evidence is that she conducted
the visit on March 23, 2019, albeit with Jeffrey, not Kristin, and at a
restaurant, not Kristin’s treatment center. 
On March 23, 2019, Kazaryan drove to Regina’s home at approximately 5:00
p.m. to pick up the children for a supervised dinner with their father.  That Kazaryan later forgot to update these
documents to show the visit with the father and that it occurred at 6:00 p.m. has
no bearing on the fact that the visit occurred. 

Substantial evidence supports
the Hearing Officer’s conclusion that Kazaryan properly claimed four hours of overtime
on March 23, 2019. 
 
            d. Home Visit in April 2019
            Documents
            On April 22, 2019, Kazaryan texted Locke to cancel a Children and Family
Team (“CFT”) meeting scheduled that day and proposed meeting April 24, 2019 at
6 p.m. in Granada Hills.  AR
2028-30.  She subsequently proposed
Thursday, April 25.  AR 2030.
A Delivered Service
Log for April 2019 shows visits by HSAs on April 9, 23, and 30, but not from
Kazaryan.  AR 1890-95. 
 
            Kazaryan’s
Testimony
In April 2019,
Regina had moved to Wisconsin and the children were still with her
husband.  AR 1432.  They decided to have a CFT meeting to
plan.  AR 1431-32.  Kazaryan was trying to set up the meeting
with all relevant team members, including her supervisor Locke.  AR 1432. 
Locke said she was on vacation, so Kazaryan told Regina that it was not
possible.  AR 1433.  Regina was upset, but it was beyond
Kazaryan’s control.  AR 1433.  Kazaryan told Regina they would schedule the
CFT in May.  AR 1433.
Kazaryan had visits
with the children that month, but not in the home.  AR 1433. 
Kazaryan initially did not recall if she attended one of the HSA
meetings. AR 1914.  Those were monitored
visits for the parents and the HSAs relieve the CSW of performing that
task.  AR 1590.  Kazaryan subsequently conceded that she was
not part of any of the April 9, April 17, and April 27 visits logged in by
HSAs.  AR 1589-90.  She explained that she may have logged a
visit under the name of the oldest of the three children, but CWS/CMS did not
properly populate she had visited all three children. AR 1587-88.  The system lists the three children as
separate cases and not the same case.  AR
1584, 1588.  Contacts may have been
missing from any one child’s file as a result. 
AR 1588.  
Kazaryan had a visit
scheduled for April in the home that Regina cancelled because she was upset
that the CFT meeting would not occur.  AR
1591.  Regina would not allow Kazaryan to
conduct her home visit for the month, and it was a “missed visit”.  AR 1591. 
DCFS is not the police and CSWs cannot force their way into the home to
conduct visits.  AR 1591.  The computerized system informs CSWs when
there are missed visits for a particular month. 
AR 1441.
 
            The Hearing Officer’s Finding
For April 2019,
Kazaryan could not be certain whether she attended the three home visits that
HSAs documented, but she believed she attended one but did not separately
document it.  AR 113.  The evidence was inconclusive whether she conducted
a home visit that month.  AR 113.
 
The County’s
Position
The Hearing Officer’s finding the Department did not prove
the allegation that Kazaryan failed to conduct a home visit in April 2019 is
not supported by substantial evidence.  The
Delivered Service Logs in CWS/CMS show that Kazaryan did not document or log
that she conducted a visit for the children in April 2019. AR 713, 879-888,
1890-95.  It shows only the three visits
by HSAs, and a visit by an HSA does not count as a monthly visit. AR 1198.
Kazaryan admitted that she did not visit the children during the HSA
visits.  Nor did she conduct a regular
visit of her own.  While Kazaryan claimed
that she may have logged a visit under the name of the oldest of the three
sisters, and that CWS/CMS did not properly populate she had visited all three
children (AR 1584-89), the Delivered Service Logs for April 2019 in CWS/CWS
establish that the database was operable because the HSAs were able to enter
contacts for all three children for the April visits.  AR 1890-95. 
Pet. Op. Br. at 8-9.
Kazaryan responds that, while the Delivered Service Logs
show only the HSA visits, that does not mean that Kazaryan failed to conduct an April 2019 visit.  The Department had the burden to show her misconduct.  DCFS did not call any of the HSAs to rebut
Kazaryan’s testimony that she attended at least one of the meetings
between the HSAs and children in April 2019. 
Opp. at 16-17.
The court need not decide whether there is substantial
evidence that Kazaryan attended one of the April 2019 HSA visits because she
attempted an April home visit.  First,
Kazaryan undisputably tried to arrange a CFT meeting in April.  Rodgers
did not know whether a CFT meeting would qualify as a monthly visit (AR 713), and
the Department presented no evidence that it would not.  Thus, Kazaryan’s efforts for a CFT meeting
may well have been an attempted home visit, and this attempt was documented.[4]  
Second, Regina
refused to meet with Kazaryan in April 2019. 
The County argues without evidence that a caregiver refusing to
allow a CSW to visit the children under her care raises obvious safety concerns.
Yet, Kazaryan did not log any safety concerns in CWS/CMS or that she attempted
to contact Regina or conduct an unannounced visit. AR 1890-95.  Pet. Op. Br. at 9.  The short answer is that Kazaryan was not
charged with failing to document Regina’s refusal to meet in April 2019. 
Kazaryan’s unrebutted testimony is that Regina would not allow her to
conduct her home visit for the month, and that it was a “missed visit”.  AR 1591.
Substantial
evidence supports the Hearing Officer’s conclusion that that the Department
failed to meet its burden of proving that Kazaryan failed to conduct a home
visit in April 2019.  
 
e. Home Visit in
May 2019
            Documents
            On May 3, 2019, Kazaryan texted Jeffrey and asked if he could meet the
next day at 5:00 p.m. for a court-ordered monitored visit at a restaurant
called the “Habit”.  AR 2054-55.         
            On May 4, 2019 at 5:00
p.m., Kazaryan texted Dave stating she was “here” and asking him to bring the
girls out.  AR 2056.  Kazaryan’s handwritten notes state that this
was so she could take them to visit their father.  AR 1902. 
The Delivered Service Log has a contract entry for May 4 for the three
children with no narrative.  AR 1905.
 
            Kazaryan’s
Testimony
            Kazaryan performed a home visit in May 2019.  AR 1595. 
Some ghost contacts occur in CWS/CMS because a supervisor will interrupt
Kazaryan while she types the contact report. 
AR 1440.  She usually remembers to
come back and finish, but she could forget at times.  AR 1440.  
This was true for her contact in May 2019.  AR 1595-96. 
Kazaryan conceded it was a mistake not to complete the contact report.  AR 1597.
 
            The
County’s Position
The Hearing Officer’s finding that Kazaryan visited
the children on May 4, 2019 is not supported by substantial evidence.  Kazaryan did not log in CWS/CMS she conducted
visit on May 4, 2019, but instead created a ghost contact with no notes
documenting the visit.  AR 1595-98, 1905.
 Department policy requires that CSWs log
all contacts with clients in CWS/CMS, not though text messages.  Kazaryan did not present any text messages
confirming that Dave was home, or even knew a monitored visit had been scheduled.  Pet. Op. Br. at 9-10.
The short answer is that Kazaryan was not charged with
making an improper ghost contact in CWS/CMS. 
The text messages show that Kazaryan made arrangements to monitor a
visit by Jeffrey with his children at a restaurant on May 4 and that she sent a
text message to Dave informing him she had arrived and asking him to send the
girls out.  The Department presents no
evidence that Dave did not send the girls out and that Jeffrey did not have a
visit monitored by Kazaryan.
Substantial
evidence supports the Hearing Officer’s conclusion that that Kazaryan conducted
a home visit in May 2019.  
 
3. The Skelly Issue 
            Due
process entitles such public employees to procedural safeguards before
discipline is imposed against them, which include: (1) notice of the
disciplinary action proposed to be taken; (2) a statement of the reasons
therefor; (3) a copy of the charges and materials upon which the action is
based; and (4) the right to respond, either orally or in writing, to the
authority initially imposing the discipline.  Skelly, supra, 15 Cal.3d at 215-16; see also Cleveland
Board of Education v. Loudermill, (1985) 470 U.S. 532, 538-41.  The
purpose of these safeguards is to protect the employee who is wrongly
disciplined against the temporary deprivation of property before he has a
hearing.  Skelly, supra, 15 Cal.3d at 215. 
The County correctly notes (Pet. Op.
Br. at 12) that the Hearing Officer determined, without citing any caselaw, that
DCFS violated Kazaryan’s Skelly rights because it did not provide
her with a copy of the Rodgers Report.  The
case law is clear that the Department was not obligated to present all material
upon which the charges were based.  “We
reject appellant’s contention that the word ‘materials’ as used in Skelly means
each and every document identified [as relied upon] was required to be produced
prior to [the employee’s] pre-termination hearing in order to satisfy due
process.”  Gilbert v. City of
Sunnyvale, (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1280.  Pet. Op. Br. at 12.
The issue is whether the County provided Kazaryan with
sufficient material upon which the NOI charges were based.  This requires a comparison of the Skelly
information provided to Kazaryan with the information in the Rodgers Report,
something that the Hearing Officer failed to do.  He merely noted that the Rodgers Report summarizes the evidence and
factual findings that supported DCFS’ termination decision and concluded that DCFS’
failure to give it to Kazaryan violated Skelly.  AR 114. 

Kazaryan’s counsel did point out that the Rodgers Report has
exculpatory information from Wilker that Kazaryan was unable to present at the Skelly
proceeding.  AR 1089.  However, Kazaryan fails to show that
exculpatory information must be provided for a Skelly hearing.  Kazaryan also argues that the Rodgers Report
contained a full summary of Wilker and Mosley’s interviews (Opp. at 19, n. 7),
but fails to show those summaries were not provided in the Skelly proceeding
or that they were material.  The court agrees with the County that the Skelly
violation is not supported by substantial evidence.[5]  In any event, the issue is mooted by the fact
that the Hearing Officer’s determination that Kazaryan was wrongly terminated
is supported by substantial evidence.[6]
 
            F.
Conclusion
The Petition is denied. 
The Department’s case was entirely dependent on its interpretation of
texts, emails, and Kazaryan’s official entries in CWS/CMS, field itineraries, mileage
claims, and Form 158s.  Kazaryan
adequately explained these documents, admitted her failures, and credibly
testified that she performed the tasks at issue and made no intentionally false
entries.  The Hearing Officer found her to
be credible and his findings are supported by substantial evidence.    
Kazaryan’s counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed
judgment, serve it on the County’s counsel for approval as to form, wait ten
days after service for any objections, meet and confer if there are objections,
and then submit the proposed judgment along with a declaration stating the
existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for April 1, 2024
at 9:30 a.m.
