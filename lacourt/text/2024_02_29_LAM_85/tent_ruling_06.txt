[1] As
pointed out by Real Party Kazaryan (Opp. at 19, n. 7), the County’s moving
papers fail to provide a table of contents and table of authorities as required
by CRC 3.1113(f).  Additionally, the
County failed to include a bates-stamped version of the Hearing Officer’s
decision in the trial notebook as ordered by the court at the trial setting
conference.  The County’s counsel is
directed to follow all applicable CRC rules and court orders in future cases.


            [2] One of
the HSAs was named Tina Kazaryan (AR 1890), but she is no relation to Real
Party Kazaryan.


[3]
Rodgers also misunderstood the definition because she concluded that visiting
the kids with the birth mother did not qualify as a monthly visit.  AR 724. 
Yet, Mosley testified that a visit includes face-to-face contact with
the children and their biological parents. 
AR 1184.


[4] The
County notes that Kazaryan testified that she planned to conduct the CFT
meeting on April 22, 2019 but Locke cancelled the meeting.  Yet, the text messages show that Kazaryan
cancelled the meeting, not Locke. 
AR  2028-30.  Pet. Op. Br. at 9.  This argument is unfair.  Kazaryan clearly tried to arrange a CFT
meeting.  While Kazaryan canceled the April 22, 2019 meeting, she tried to set the
meeting for April 24 and then for April 25, to no avail.  AR 2028-30. 



[5]
The court has no opinion whether the failure to provide the Rodgers Report for
the appeal hearing violated discovery requirements.  


[6]
The parties debate whether dismissal is the appropriate penalty, but
substantial evidence supports the Hearing Officer’s finding that Kazaryan is
not guilty of the charges and the court need not address the penalty
issue.  See Pet. Op. Br. at 13-15;
Opp. at 17-19.
