Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel arbitration in the case brought by Walter Salazar. Salazar had filed a complaint alleging breach of warranty under the Song-Beverly Act, but Hyundai had argued that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration rather than through a court trial.

The judge found that Hyundai had established the existence of an arbitration agreement, which Salazar had not challenged. The judge also found that Salazar was equitably estopped from disclaiming the arbitration provision in the warranty. Furthermore, the judge found that the arbitration provision was not unconscionable, as it did not waive any of Salazar's statutory rights and did not create overly harsh or one-sided results.

As a result, the judge has granted Hyundai's motion to compel arbitration and stayed the case pending the outcome of the arbitration.
