And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The ruling is as follows:

* The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend as to the sixth cause of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress) and overruled as to the fourth cause of action (nuisance).
* The motion to strike is granted as to attorney's fees and denied as to punitive damages.

In essence, the judge is allowing the nuisance claim to proceed, but is dismissing the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. The judge is also striking the prayer for attorney's fees, as the plaintiffs are pro per litigants and therefore cannot incur or recover attorney's fees.
