Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Karyna Myres brings this
habitability suit against Defendants (1) Ernst Hacker, (2) Kape Property Management,
Inc. (Kape Property Management), (3) Doe 1 Tamir Hacker, as Successor
Co-Trustee of the Survivor’s Trust established under The Hacker Family Trust
dated March 24, 1988, and as Successor Trustee of Survivor’s Trust established
under the Ernst Hacker and Bila Hacker Trust, restated March 16, 2012, (4) Doe
2 Ronen Hacker, as Successor Co-Trustee of the Survivor’s Trust established
under The Hacker Family Trust dated March 24, 1988, (5) Doe 3 Adi Samuel
Hacker, as Successor Co-Trustee of the Survivor’s Trust established under The
Hacker Family Trust dated March 24, 1988, (6) Doe 4 Niza Hacker, as Successor
Trustee of the Ernst Hacker Survivor’s Trust, and (7) Does 5-100.
The operative February 3, 2022
Complaint alleges claims of (1) Nuisance, (2) Breach of Contract, (3) Breach of
the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (4) Negligence, (5) Breach
of Statutes, (6) Breach of Warranty of Habitability, (7) Breach of the Covenant
Quiet Enjoyment, (8) Constructive Eviction, (9) IIED, and (10) NIED.
The claims arise from allegations
that, in February 2020, while a tenant of a residential apartment unit located
at 718 North Hayworth Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90046 (Subject Premises),
seemingly unlicensed contractors performed construction and demolition work on
the unit adjacent to Plaintiff Myres’s unit, which caused portions of the
ceiling in her unit to collapse, with debris at one point falling on her head,
causing Plaintiff injuries and leading to a diagnosis of post-concussion
syndrome. The claims also arise from allegations of ongoing harassment by
Defendants’ agents—including allegations of unpaid rent by Defendants’ agents
and threats to Plaintiff’s person by construction workers—and allegations that
the construction and demolition work caused a gas leak at the Subject Premises,
leading SoCal Gas to deem the Premises uninhabitable in December 2020, and
forcing Plaintiff to move out of her unit.
Motion Before the Court
On or about December 9, 2022,
Defendant Ronen Hacker served Special Interrogatories, Set One (SROGs, Set One),
on Defendant Kape Property Management.
The statutory deadline for
Defendant Kape to respond to Defendant Ronen Hacker’s propounded
interrogatories was January 8, 2023, plus 5 days for mailing.
On or about March 10, 2023, having
received no response from Kape Property Management, Ronen Hacker’s counsel
mailed a letter to Kape Property Management’s counsel, asking for responses to
SROGs, Set One.
On March 28, 2023, still having
received no response from Kape Property Management, Ronen Hacker’s counsel
mailed a letter to Kape Property Management’s counsel, asking for responses to
SROGs, Set One.
On April 17, 2023, Kape Property
Management’s counsel called Ronen Hacker’s counsel to ask for an extension,
which a paralegal at Hacker’s counsel’s office refused, ending the call shortly
thereafter.
As of May 1, 2023, Kape Property
Management had failed to respond to SROGs, Set One.
That same day, Ronen Hacker filed a
motion to compel initial responses to SROGS, Set One, from Kape Property
Management. The motion seeks $1,935 in sanctions against Kape Property
Management and was set for hearing on August 17, 2022.
On July 19, 2023, the Court
continued the hearing on Ronen Hacker’s motion to August 22, 2022.
On July 24, 2023, Kape Property
Management’s counsel emailed Ronen Hacker’s counsel to inform the latter that
verified, objection-free responses would be provided the next day and asking Ronen
Hacker to remove this motion from the Court’s calendar.
That same day, Ronen Hacker’s
counsel responded that they would consider the request after receiving
responses and costs for bringing this motion.
On July 25, 2023, Kape Property
Management’s counsel indicated that responses would be provided at week’s end.
On August 1, 2023, Ronen Hacker’s
counsel followed up regarding compensation for Ronen Hacker for costs in
bringing this motion.
On August 4, 2023, Kape Property
Management served objection-free responses to SROGs, Set One.
On August 7, 2023, Kape Property
Management opposed the motion to compel.
That same day, Kape Property
Management’s counsel requested that Ronen Hacker remove this motion from the
Court’s calendar as moot.
On August 10, 2023, Ronen Hacker
noticed a continuance of the hearing to November 14, 2023.
On September 1, 2023, Ronen Hacker
replied to the opposition.
On November 8, 2024, Ronen Hacker sent
out a notice of continuance of the hearing to January 30, 2024.
Ronen Hacker’s motion is now before
the Court.
 
Motion to Compel Initial Responses to Interrogatories

Legal Standard
A motion to compel an initial
response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response
to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(a); see Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 (Sinaiko).) To establish this ground, a
movant must show:
(1) Proper service (see Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.080, subd. (a));
(2) Expiration of the deadline for
the initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (see
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subds. (a), (b)); and
(3) No timely response (see Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290).
A court must deny a motion to
compel initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of
discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19
(CBS); see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of discovery].) 
Order Compelling Initial
Responses: MOOT.
After review, the Court agrees with
Kape Property Management: Ronen Hacker’s motion is moot as to an order
compelling initial responses to SROGs, Set One.
Kape Property Management attaches a
copy of its August 4, 2023 responses to its opposition. (See Opp’n, Mosley
Decl., Ex. E.) A review of these responses shows that that they are
objection-free and verified. (See ibid.) This is proper because a
failure to respond to SROGs, Set One, within the permissible timeframe resulted
in a waiver of objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) A review
of the responses also shows that they are substantively responsive, to whatever
degree, to SROGs, Set One. (See Opp’n, Mosley Decl., Ex. E.) As a result, the
proper mechanism to challenge any deficiencies in the August 4th responses (see
Reply, pp. 2-4) is a motion to compel further interrogatory responses pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300.
Ronen Hacker’s motion is thus MOOT.
Sanctions: GRANTED.
The Court must impose monetary
sanctions against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes
or opposes the motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted
withs substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanctions unjust. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c); see Sinaiko,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404.)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
Here, despite eventually serving
responses to SROGs, Set One, Kape Property Management greatly delayed in doing
so, thus failing to respond to an authorized method of discovery, and meriting
sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d); Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348, subd. (a).)
The Court determines that sanctions
of $1,935 are reasonable in light of the reasonable fees and costs sought in
connection with this motion: reasonable rate of $375 per hour for five hours
expended on drafting this motion, which the Court will hold to include the time
to be expended attending this hearing; and costs of $60 in filing this motion.
(Mot., Quigg Decl., ¶ 10.)
Sanctions are thus GRANTED in the
amount of $1,935. 
Conclusion
Defendant Doe 2 Ronen Hacker’s
Motion for an Order Compelling Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set No.
One, and for Monetary Sanctions Pursuant to CCP §§ 2023.010 et seq. &
2030.300 Against Defendant Kape Property Management Inc. of $1,935 is:
(1) MOOT as to an order compelling
further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set No. One; and
(2) GRANTED as to sanctions in the
amount of $1,935.
Defendant Kape Property Management
Inc. is ORDERED to remit payment of these monies to Defendant Doe 2 Ronen
Hacker within 30 days of this order.
The Court notes that there remain
at least two more motions to compel on calendar and orders the parties to further
meet and confer in light of this ruling to see if they can be resolved
informally.
