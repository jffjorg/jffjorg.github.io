Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Gabriel Rueda sues
Defendants Emmanuel Pacquiao, Frederick Roach, Keith M. Davidson, Paramount
Global (Paramount; formerly CBS Corporation), Showtime Networks, Inc.
(Showtime) (with Paramount, the Showtime Defendants), and Does 1-25 pursuant to
a January 10, 2024 Second Amended Complaint (SAC) that alleges claims of (1)
Breach of Oral Contract, (2) Breach of Implied-in-Fact Contract, (3) Common
Counts for Labor, Work, and Services, (4) Quantum Meruit, (5) Fraud in the
Inducement, (6) Fraudulent Misrepresentation, (7) Unjust Enrichment, (8) Attempted

Anti-SLAPP Motion, Appeal,
Opinion, and Remittitur
On November 13, 2020, the Court granted
a special motion to strike filed by the Showtime Defendants pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 425.16 (anti-SLAPP motion) directed against the
then-operative First Amended Complaint’s (FAC) eighth and ninth causes of
action.
On January 7, 2021, Plaintiff Rueda
appealed the Court’s November 13, 2020 order.
On July 26, 2023, the court of
appeal issued its opinion in Plaintiff Rueda’s appeal, affirming in part and
reversing in part. Specifically, the court of appeal held that: “The trial
court’s order is reversed, and the cause is remanded with directions to enter a
new and different order granting the [Showtime] Defendants’ special motion to
strike the eighth and ninth causes of action (including the general allegations
incorporated therein) except insofar as those causes of action include claims
for vicarious liability based on the conduct of ‘Wildcard Gym members,’ Palmer,
or other nonparties. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.”
On October 5, 2023, the court of
appeal issued remittitur.

Motion for Attorneys’ Fees Incurred on Anti-SLAPP Appeal
Legal
Standard
 “[T]o collect appellate attorney fees, a party
must demonstrate the right to do so under either a statute or a contract,
independent of a costs statute.” (Butler-Rupp v. Lourdeaux (2007) 154
Cal.App.4th 918, 927.)
A prevailing defendant on an anti-SLAPP motion is entitled
to recover their attorney’s fees and costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.
(c)(1); Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.) Since
section 425.16, subdivision (c) provides for an award of attorney’s fees and
costs to a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike and does not
preclude recovery of appellate attorney fees by a prevailing
defendant-respondent, those fees are also recoverable. (Trapp v. Naiman
(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 113, 122; Dove Audio, Inc. v. Rosenfeld, Meyer &
Susman (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 777, 785.) A prevailing party may recover fees
incurred in defending an appeal to a favorable anti-SLAPP ruling even where the
appeal is voluntarily dismissed. (See Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
The
Court begins this inquiry “with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there, the “lodestar figure
may then be adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement] based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant
multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and]
(4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
No
specific findings reflecting the court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are
required; the record need only show that the attorney’s fees were awarded
according to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo
Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1344, 1349, disagreed with on other grounds in In
re Marriage of Demblewski (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 232, 236, fn. 7
[disagreement as to statement of decision requirements].) The Court has broad
discretion to determine the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which
will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial
error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)
Order
Granting Attorneys’ Fees: GRANTED, in part.
The
Showtime Defendants move for an award of $155,938 in legal fees as the alleged
prevailing party in an appeal filed by Plaintiff Rueda against the Showtime
Defendants’ successful 2020 anti-SLAPP challenge to the FAC’s eighth and ninth
causes of action.
I. Initial Notes
The
Court notes that it does not find sufficient merit to Plaintiff Rueda’s
argument that the Court should deny this motion, either in whole or in part,
based on the Showtime Defendants’ unclean hands in allegedly suppressing a
recording of a conversation between Defendant Davidson and Plaintiff Rueda. Without
ruling on whether the facts do, or do not, support such allegations, the Court
finds that no unfair surprise is at issue in this motion for attorneys’ fees.
(See Opp’n, p. 19.)
The
Court also notes that the May 24, 2022 stipulation between the parties does not
encompass fees recovered on appeal. (Opp’n, Khan Decl., Ex. 13, pp. 3-4.)
II. Prevailing Party on Appeal
With
exceptions not at issue here, “a prevailing defendant on a special [anti-SLAPP]
motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney’s fees and
costs.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).) “[A] party who partially
prevails on an anti-SLAPP motion must generally be considered a prevailing
party unless the results of the motion were so insignificant that the party did
not achieve any practical benefit from bringing the motion.” (Mann v.
Quality Old Time Serv. Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 328,
344-345 (Mann), overruled on other grounds in Baral v. Schnitt
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 392-396 (Baral) [disapproving Mann in its “refusal
to permit anti-SLAPP motions to reach distinct claims within pleaded counts”];
accord. Moran v. Endres (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 952, 956 (Moran)
[defendants were not entitled to fees, where their partial success on their
anti-SLAPP motion “in every practical sense meant nothing”].) This no-practical-benefit
doctrine does not apply where the defendant “successfully narrowed the scope of
the lawsuit, limiting discovery, reducing potential recoverable damages, and
altering the settlement posture of the case.” (Mann, supra, at p.
340.) The no-practical-benefit doctrine is a “narrow” exception to the general
rule mandating a fee award to a partially successful defendant. (Morrow v.
Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1446.) Except
with limited types of claims, a prevailing defendant on a special motion to
strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).) Whether a partially successful
defendant achieved sufficient benefit to be a “prevailing party” is left to the
discretion of the trial court and reviewed accordingly. (Mann, supra,
at p. 340.)
After
review, the Court finds that the Showtime Defendants are the prevailing party
on appeal.
As
noted by the court of appeal, the Showtime Defendants defended against Plaintiff
Rueda’s appeal to the November 13, 2020 ruling only insofar as the ruling
struck allegations from the FAC relating to conduct by Defendant Keith
Davidson. (Mot., Brenner Decl., Ex. 13, Remittitur, pp. 16, 17; see 10/18/19
Anti-SLAPP Mot., p. 1, Notice [seeking order altogether striking eighth and
ninth causes of action on grounds that claims arose from protected statements
by Defendant Davidson and Plaintiff was unable to establish likelihood of success
on merits].) The Court of appeal affirmed the appeal on this issue. (See Mot.,
Brenner Decl., Ex. 13, Remittitur, pp. 12, 22.) (The Court notes that Plaintiff
Rueda’s appeal focused on the first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis and
evidentiary objections in the trial court ruling without contesting the second
prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis: likelihood of prevailing on the merits. (See Mot.,
Brenner Decl., Ex. 13, Remittitur, p. 16 [“Rueda has not challenged the trial
court’s determination that he has no reasonable probability of prevailing on
the claims that arise from Davidson’s conduct …[;] [w]e accordingly need not
analyze the issue; we can and do hold there was no error in granting the
anti-SLAPP motion as to those claims”].)) The court of appeal only reversed an
issue not challenged by the Showtime Defendants: harassment and intimidation by
third parties, as alleged in the FAC’s eighth and ninth causes of action, which
they reasonably contend was not pled to clearly implicate the Showtime Defendants,
and did not mention them by name. (See Mot., Brenner Decl., Ex. 13, Remittitur,
pp. 17-21.)
However,
it should be noted that as discussed above, the Showtime Defendants’ defense on
appeal was limited to the trial court striking the allegations regarding Defendant
Davidson’s conduct, as it supported the eighth and ninth causes of action. In
contrast, Plaintiff Rueda’s appeal also encompassed striking the allegations
related to third parties from the eighth and ninth causes of action, which the
Showtime Defendants specifically did not contest on appeal. (See Mot., Brenner
Decl., Ex. 13, Remittitur, pp. 17-18.) Thus, the Showtime Defendants defended
the appeal only in part.
The
Court also notes that, in the trial court proceedings, while the Showtime
Defendants based their anti-SLAPP motion on the argument that these claims
arose from allegations of protected activity by Defendant Davidson, the Showtime
Defendants did not request that the Court only strike allegations relating to
Davidson from the eighth and ninth causes of action and leave allegations
relating to third parties, whose connection to the Showtime Defendants as Doe
Defendants was unclear. Instead, the Showtime Defendants requested a wholesale
striking out of the eighth and ninth causes of action. (See 10/18/19 Anti-SLAPP
Mot., p. 1, Notice.)
Returning
to the merits, on the portion of the appeal that they defended, the Showtime
Defendants undoubtedly prevailed: affirmance as to whether Defendant Davidson’s
conduct arose from protected activity for anti-SLAPP purposes as it relates to
the eighth and ninth causes of action. (See Mot., Brenner Decl., Ex. 13,
Remittitur, pp. 12, 22.) This suffices for the anti-SLAPP statute. Indeed, even
had the Showtime Defendants argued that the third-party conduct alleged in the
FAC arose from protected activity and the trial court had granted the motion on
those grounds only for the court of appeal to overturn, the Showtime Defendants
would have partially succeeded on their appeal insofar as it related to
Defendant Davidson’s alleged conduct. Here, however, the Showtime Defendants
did not make such an argument on appeal, showing that the defense of the appeal
was only partial—even if entirely successful.
Last,
the Court agrees that the Showtime Defendants’ defense on appeal made them the
prevailing parties for the purposes of this motion. The affirmance “narrowed
the scope of the lawsuit, limiting discovery, reducing potential recoverable
damages, and altering the settlement posture of the case” by affirming a
removal of Defendant Davidson’s alleged conduct as grounds for the eighth and
ninth causes of action, leaving only the conduct of mostly unnamed third
parties as the bases for those claims. (Mann, supra, 139
Cal.App.4th at p. 340.)
The
Showtime Defendants are thus prevailing parties for anti-SLAPP fee recovery
purposes. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).)
The Court notes that although the court of
appeal instructed that the parties were to bear their costs on appeal (see Mot.,
Brenner Decl., Ex. 13, Remittitur, p. 22), that direction does not affect the
Showtime Defendants’ entitlement to fees as the prevailing party with partial
success on appeal. (See Butler-Rupp v. Lourdeaux (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th
918, 925-928 [appellate court’s remittitur stating parties are to bear own
costs does not preclude trial court from awarding appellate attorney fees on
remand].)
III. Indigence of Plaintiff Rueda
In
determining whether amount of fees to be awarded is reasonable under statute,
trial court must consider the financial circumstances of the losing party and
the impact of the award on that party, but the court must not neglect to
consider other circumstances in setting the amount of fees. (Garcia v.
Santana (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 464, 476-477 (Garcia).)
After
review, the Court finds that indigence is a relevant factor in determining
whether an amount of fees to be granted is reasonable.
While
the Showtime Defendants argue that it makes a difference whether the fees are discretionary
or mandatory, this distinction seems to be one without a difference. Under Garcia,
indigence affects the reasonability of a fee award, not the mandatory or
discretionary nature of the award. (Garcia, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at pp. 476-477.) The Showtime Defendants—who have the burden on
this motion (ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993,
1020)—have failed to cite to any authority, California or otherwise, holding
that courts may not consider indigence when determining the reasonability of a
request for mandatory fees. Absent such authority, the Court will not restrict
Plaintiff Rueda’s indigence argument in relation to a reasonable fee award.
The
Court also notes that while Garcia may have been distinguished by
subsequent cases,  it has not been overturned
by the California Supreme Court and is still good law. The Court accepts Garcia
as controlling authority over the determination of reasonable fees as it
relates to statutory entitlement to fees, as contrasted with two decisions
referenced by the Showtime Defendants that dealt with other issues. (See Reply,
p. 6; cf. LAOSD Asbestos Cases (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 1116, 1123-1126
[holding that ability to pay is not a factor in determining allowable costs,
as opposed to fees], Walker v. Ticor Title Co. of Cal. (2012) 204
Cal.App.4th 363, 374 [contractual fees].) The Court does not find that Garcia
indicated that the result would have been different under the SLAPP statute
(Reply, p. 6), and even if it had, such a holding would have been dicta since
the SLAPP statute was not at issue there. 
Next,
the Court recognizes the serious policy implication raised by the Showtime
Defendants to the effect that allowing indigence to be a consideration in SLAPP
fee awards may open the floodgates to indigent litigators filing SLAPP cases
with impunity and little financial repercussions. (Reply, p. 6.) Thus, the
Court will exercise its discretion, as directed by the court in Garcia,
to balance all the circumstances, including the statutory purposes of entitlement
to fees on the one hand, with Rueda’s ability to pay on the other.
Last,
the Court accepts Plaintiff Rueda’s evidence as to his financial condition,
which shows Plaintiff as being financially in dire straits. (Opp’n, Rueda
Decl., ¶¶ 3, 8-13, Exs. 2-5.)
 
IV. Reasonable Fee Rates
After
review, the Court finds that the fee rates sought by the Showtime Defendants,
which were discounted considerably, are eminently reasonable based on the
Court’s experience with fee rates in the Los Angeles County area and based on the
declarations of counsel supporting those rates. (Mot., Brenner Decl., ¶¶ 49-56,
Godino Decl.; Excelsior Union High Sch. Dist. of L.A. Cnty. v. Lautrup
(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 434, 448 (Excelsior).)
V. Reasonable Hours
After
review, the Court finds that the hours expended by the Showtime Defendants’
counsel should be reduced in certain respects.
The
Court initially notes that while Showtime Defendants did not provide billing
records with their motion, but rather, declarations and charts providing the
total number of hours expended by the attorneys who worked on the appeal.
(Mot., Brenner Decl., Ex. 15.) While timesheets for that work are not entirely
necessary (Sommers v. Erb (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1644, 1651 (Sommers);
Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794, 1810 (Dunk)),
the moving party has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours expended
and hourly rates (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th
751, 784 (City of Colton).
Moving
to the merits, the Court first determines that the 47 hours spent on preparing
a motion to strike and reply in the appeal—for a requested recovery of $23,554—should
not be recovered. As noted by the court of appeal, the Showtime Defendants’
motion to strike “[wa]s not before th[e] court [of appeal]” because the request
by Rueda that the Showtime Defendants were challenging had been filed in the
trial court, not the appellate court. (See Mot., Brenner Decl., Ex. 12, p. 1.)
The
Court next discounts 15% of the recovery sought for hours expended on the legal
brief before the court of appeal, i.e., a reduction of $15,139.05. This is
because Plaintiff Rueda’s appeal did not focus on the second prong of the
Court’s November 13, 2020 order, but rather, limited itself to rulings on
evidentiary objections and the first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis. (See
Mot., Brenner Decl., Ex. 13, Remittitur, p. 16 [“Rueda has not challenged the
trial court’s determination that he has no reasonable probability of prevailing
on the claims that arise from Davidson’s conduct”].) The work on the second
prong was thus not necessary based on the scope of the appeal and is
consequently not recoverable.
As
to the remaining request of $117,244.95—comprised of $155,938, minus $23,554 in
motion to strike fees, minus $15,139.05 in briefing related to the second prong
of the anti-SLAPP analysis—the Court finds that the request is excessive.
“When
a voluminous fee application is made the court may make across-the-board
percentage cuts either in the number of hours claimed or in the final lodestar
figure” (Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24,
40, quoting Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
41 (Warren), internal quotation marks and ellipses deleted.) “A trial
court is not required to state each charge it finds reasonable or unreasonable.
A reduced award might be fully justified by a general observation that an
attorney overlitigated a case.” (Karton v. Ari Design & Construction,
Inc. (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 744.) “But the court must clearly explain
its reasons for choosing the particular negative multiplier that it chose;
otherwise, the reviewing court is unable to determine that the court had valid,
specific reasons for its across-the-board percentage reduction.” (Warren,
supra, at p. 41.)
However,
the Court is considered “an expert in the matter of attorney fees” since “[t]he
value of attorney’s services is a matter with which a judge must necessarily be
familiar.” (Excelsior, supra, 269 Cal.App.2d at p. 448.) Accordingly,
“[w]hen the court is informed of the extent and nature of such services, its
own experience furnishes it with every element necessary to fix their value.” (Ibid.)
Here,
the Court’s experience with fee awards for partially and wholly successful
appeals informs its determination that the number of hours for which the
Showtime Defendants seek an award is excessive. In this case, the 200 hours
expended in preparing the appeal brief in particular are excessive. In the
Court’s experience, when taking the Court’s reductions above into account, the
compensable attorney fee range for the entirety of the appeal should be
somewhere closer to $80,000 to $100,000. Second, while the Court notes that block
billing is not prohibited by California law, nor is it mandatory to attach the
actual time records, in some cases block billing can make it difficult to
establish the appropriateness of all the hours expended. The declarations filed
by the Showtime Defendants failed to show the reasonableness as to all the
hours requested that were expended on the appeal.
The
Court thus makes a 20% across-the-board reduction to the remaining lodestar
amount—$117,244.95—for an initial lodestar calculation of $93,795.96.
VI. Fees Conclusion
The
Court makes a further reduction of 50% from the initial lodestar calculation
based on Plaintiff Rueda’s showing of indigence. (See Section III discussion
supra.) The Court recognizes that this is still a heavy burden on Plaintiff,
but concludes that the legislative command for mandatory entitlement to fees under
the anti-SLAPP statute weighs in favor of issuing a substantial, though significantly
reduced, award against him.
The
Showtime Defendants’ motion is thus GRANTED, in part, in the amount of $46,897.98.
 

Conclusion
Defendants Showtime Network Inc.
and Paramount Global’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees Incurred on Anti-SLAPP Appeal
is GRANTED, in part, in the amount of $46,897.98.
