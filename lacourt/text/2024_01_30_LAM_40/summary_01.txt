Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is on Defendant Ronen Hacker's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories, Set No. One, and for monetary sanctions against Kape Property Management, Inc. The court finds that the motion is moot as to an order compelling initial responses to special interrogatories, Set No. One, since Kape Property Management eventually served objection-free responses. However, the court imposes monetary sanctions against Kape Property Management in the amount of $1,935 for its delays in responding to the special interrogatories. The court notes that there remain at least two more motions to compel on calendar and orders the parties to further meet and confer to see if they can be resolved informally.
