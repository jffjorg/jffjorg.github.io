REASONING
 
An action against an attorney
for a wrongful act or omission, other than for actual fraud, arising in the
performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year after
the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have
discovered, the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission, or four years
from the date of the wrongful act or omission, whichever occurs first.


(Code Civ.
Proc., § 340.6, subd. (a).)
 
            The CCP § 340.6(a) “time bar applies to claims whose
merits necessarily depend on proof that an attorney violated a professional
obligation in the course of providing professional services.” (Foxen v.
Carpenter (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 284, 292.) “In this context, a ‘professional
obligation’ is an obligation that an attorney has by virtue of being an
attorney, such as fiduciary obligations . . . the obligations embodied in the
State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct.” (Ibid.) The Duty to
Communicate is “an integral part of competent professional performance as an
attorney.” (Calvert v. State Bar (1991) 54 Cal.3d 765, 782.)
 
I.               
Demurrer to the first cause of action for Breach
of Contract – WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
            The essential elements of breach of
contract are “(1)
the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the
plaintiff." (D'Arrigo Bros. of California v. United Farmworkers of
America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 790, 800.)           
 
            Lisitsa argues the CCP § 340.6(a) one-year
statute of limitations applies to the breach of contract claim because the
claim arises out of an alleged breach of an attorney’s duty to communicate.
(See Motion, pp. 11–13.)  The Court
agrees. The FAC states, “LISITSA breached her contractual obligation to keep
GILERMAN informed of her case and to be able to make intelligent decisions
concerning how to best proceed with her case.” (FAC, ¶ 24.) Plaintiff Erina
Gilerman (“Gilerman”) essentially pleads that Lisitsa breached the contract by breaching
the attorney’s professional duty to communicate during the course of providing
Gilerman with professional services. The time bar for allegations of a breach
of attorney’s professional duties including the duty to communicate, are
governed by the one-year statute of limitations under CCP § 340.6(a).  Austin v. Medicis (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 577,
587
 
            The underlying case was dismissed on
4-15-21, denied a motion for new trial on 6-24-21, with the decision affirmed
on appeal on 3-20-23. The statute of limitations for actions against attorneys
are not tolled by appeal and so the latest the limitations period can start
running was on 4-1-21 when the initial adverse judgment occurred. (See Laird
v. Blacker (1992) 2 Cal.4th 606, 618, as modified on denial of reh'g
(July 16, 1992) [“Section 340.6 and its legislative history make clear that
once a client has been injured by an adverse judgment, the limitations period
commences and is not tolled by filing an appeal absent continuous
representation by the trial attorney.”].)
 
            Additionally, “[F]or purposes of
Code of Civil Procedure section 340.6, subdivision (a)(2) . . . the
representation ends when the client actually has or reasonably should have no
expectation that the attorney will provide further legal services.” (GoTek
Energy, Inc. v. SoCal IP Law Group, LLP (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1240, 1247.)
Gilerman filed for a substitution of attorney on 4-30-21consenting to new
representation under Zhonette Reed, objectively ending Defendants representation
of Gilerman. (See RJN, Ex. 5.)
 
            Based on the allegations of Gilerman’s
FAC and the Court’s judicial notice of the date of the dismissal of the
underlying case, Gilerman cannot allege any new facts that would overcome the the
statute of limitations defense. 
Therefore, Gilerman’s request for leave to amend is denied. 
 
II.            
Demurrer to the third cause of action for Fraud
– SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.

            "A complaint for fraud
must allege the following elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the
defendant; (2) an intent to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable
reliance by the plaintiff; and (4) resulting damages. Every element must be
specifically pleaded. [citations omitted]" (Service by Medallion, Inc.
v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816.)
 
            “[T]he elements of a cause of action for fraud based on
concealment are: (1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material
fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the
plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed
the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have
been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of
the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or
suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” (Bigler-Engler
v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276, 310–311, citations omitted;
see also CACI 1901)
 
            CCP §340.6 expressly excludes an action for “actual
fraud” from the one-year statute of limitation. 
Regardless, Lisitsa argues “The test for determining whether a cause of
action falls within the statute of limitations contained in section 340.6(a) is
“whether the claim, in order to succeed, necessarily depends on proof that an
attorney violated a professional obligation as opposed to some generally
applicable nonprofessional obligation.” (Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225,
1238.) Further, section 340.6(a) applies to any claims that meet this test,
notwithstanding how they are styled. (Id. at p. 1239; see also Bergstein v. Stroock
& Stroock & Lavan LLP (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 793, 819 [“ ‘[w]hen
determining which statute of limitations applies to a particular action, a
court considers what the principal purpose or “gravamen” of the action is,
rather than the form of action or the relief demanded.’ ”].)”  The Court agrees.  Again, as alleged, Gilerman’s claim for fraud
is the Defendant’s failure to disclose to her the addition of Berhend in the
second amended complaint, and the improper purpose for doing so, and the fact
of Defendant’s prior representation of Berhend. 
Although unartfully pleaded, the Court agrees that the allegations of
the second cause of action labeled “fraud” allege a breach of Defendant’s
professional duties of disclosure, not actual fraud.  As alleged, this claim, therefore, is barred
by the one-year statue of limitation under Section 340.6.
 

            In addition, Defendants argues Gilerman has not
alleged Defendants’ intentionally concealed facts from Gilerman with the intent
to deceive her.  Indeed, Gilerman alleges
Defendants’ purpose:  “GILERMAN is
informed and believes that LISITSA and/or SHEMTOUB added Berhend [sic] solely
so that Berhend could file a CCP §170.6 motion.” (FAC, ¶ 18 [emphasis added.)  Without a doubt, the allegations show a fraud
on the court, as both the trial court and the Court of Appeal found in the
underlying action.  However, Gilerman has
not alleged, not explained how she could allege the Defendants’ intent to
deceive, or otherwise harm her.  In her
proposed proposed second amended complaint (improperly filed on April 17, 2024.)
repeats the same allegation of defendant’s purpose was “so that Berhend could
file a CCP §170.6 motion”  Again,
Gilerman fails to allege the Defendants intended to deceive her in her proposed
second amended complaint.  Gilerman,
therefore, has failed to meet her burden to show further leave to amend should
be granted.
