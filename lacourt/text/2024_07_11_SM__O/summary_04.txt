And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint and the motion to strike. The demurrer to the complaint based on the alleged settlement agreement is overruled, as the court cannot take judicial notice of the facts or interpretations within the settlement agreements when they are reasonably under dispute within the complaint. The demurrer to the 3rd cause of action for Constructive Fraud and Concealment is also overruled, as the cross-claimants have pled all the required elements to meet a claim for constructive fraud, including the knowledge element. Finally, the motion to strike is denied, as the cross-claimants have demonstrated the requisite elements for constructive fraud, and punitive damages may be appropriate in this case.
