Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the demurrer to the 1st cause of action for breach of contract and the 3rd cause of action for fraud without leave to amend. The court has also granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of the documents requested, but not the truth of the facts asserted within the documents.

The court has ruled that the one-year statute of limitations under CCP § 340.6(a) applies to the breach of contract claim because it arises out of an alleged breach of an attorney's duty to communicate. The court has also ruled that the claim for fraud is barred by the one-year statute of limitation under Section 340.6 because it alleges a breach of the defendant's professional duties of disclosure, not actual fraud.

The court has denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend because the allegations of the second cause of action labeled "fraud" do not allege the defendant's intent to deceive or induce reliance, and the plaintiff has failed to meet her burden to show further leave to amend should be granted.
