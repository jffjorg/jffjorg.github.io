TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiff Grace Kang’s Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Special Interrogatories. (Set Two) Nos. 32–34 against Defendant Jason
Varughese is GRANTED pursuant to CCP § 2030.300. Plaintiff served SROGS (Set
Two) on 3-11-24. (Rhow Decl., ¶ 2, Ex.) Defendant responded to SROGS (Set Two)
with statutorily defective responses and general objections on 4-11-24. (Id.,
¶ 3, Ex. 2.) Plaintiff sent a meet and confer email explaining the deficient
discovery responses on 4-22-24, with a follow up email due to no response from
Defendant on 5-9-24. (Id., ¶¶ 4, 5 Ex. 3, 4.)  On 5-11-24 Defendant responded to meet and
confer email stating the Defendant stands by the objections and did not submit
any supplemental responses (Id., ¶ 6, Ex. 5.) Plaintiff filed the Motion
to Compel Further SROGS along with a separate statement on 5-13-24, within 45
days of the Plaintiff's initial responses, pursuant to CCP § 2030.300. 
 
The
Court finds Defendant’s objections to SROGS No. 32–34 are evasive and frivolous
(See Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783 [“A party may not
deliberately misconstrue a question for the purpose of supplying an evasive
answer . . . . where the question is somewhat ambiguous, but the nature of the
information sought is apparent, the proper solution is to provide an
appropriate response.”]; see also Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3
Cal.5th 531, 541, citing Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010 [“A party may use
interrogatories to request the identity and location of those with knowledge of
discoverable matters.”]; Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [“Discovery may be
obtained of the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any
discoverable matter.”]; Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277,
1291 [“Questions regarding the same subject should be allowed although they
include an ‘and’ or ‘or.’”].)


Defendant
is ordered to submit code compliant responses to SROGS Nos. 32–34 within 30

PARTY:   Plaintiff Grace KangRESP.
PARTY:         Defendant Jason Varughese
 TENTATIVE
RULING             Plaintiff
Grace Kang’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFPs is GRANTED IN PART as
to the issue of the privileged documents only. The Parties are ordered to
continue to meet and confer regarding the other issues of discovery concerning the
harm to the Plaintiff and Defendant’s redactions. Defendant Jason Varughese is
ordered to produce all communications with Angelika Bowles, Well Baby Center,
and Jackie Miller in response to Plaintiff’s RFPs. Defendant is ordered to
produce communications with Stephen Poulter related to child abuse claims,
child abuse reports, and investigations of Plaintiff in response to Plaintiff’s
RFPS.   REASONING            “Where the psychotherapist-patient privilege is claimed
as a bar to disclosure, the claimant has the initial burden of proving the
preliminary facts to show the privilege applies,” with preliminary facts
meaning "the existence of a psychotherapist-patient relationship.” (In
re A.C. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 262, 266.)              Under
Article 7 which governs the psychotherapist-patient privilege a “patient” is
defined as the following: “a person who consults a
psychotherapist or submits to an examination by a psychotherapist for the
purpose of securing a diagnosis or preventive, palliative, or curative
treatment of his mental or emotional condition or who submits to an examination
of his mental or emotional condition for the purpose of scientific research on
mental or emotional problems.

(Evid. Code, § 1011.)                        The
psychotherapist-patient privilege is “narrowly construed when the party seeking
to claim the privilege is attempting to establish the existence of the
requisite relationship.” (People v. Cabral (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 820,
822.).              The
privilege does not apply to “if the services of the psychotherapist were sought
or obtained to enable or aid anyone to commit or plan to commit a crime or a
tort or to escape detection or apprehension after the commission of a crime or
tort.” (Evid. Code § 1018.) This exception includes psychotherapist-patient
communications related to false child abuse reporting. (See Roe v. Superior
Court (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 832, 844 [“It is clear from the entire
statutory scheme concerning child abuse reporting that the Legislature never
intended to provide immunity to patients who knowingly or recklessly cause
their psychotherapists to file false child abuse reports.”].)            Additionally,
the psychotherapist-patient privilege is waived “if any holder of the
privilege, without coercion, has disclosed a significant part of the
communication or has consented to disclosure made by anyone.” (Evid. Code §
912, subd. (a).) I.               
Angelika Bowles, Well Baby Center and Jackie
Miler             Defendant
Jason Varughese (“Varughese”) does not prove preliminary facts to show the
privilege applies to Angelika Bowles, Well Baby Center, and Jackie Miller. Varughese
admitted to enrolling in the Well Baby Center for “a parenting class” as
ordered by the Family Law Court, where Angelika Bowles (“Bowles”) was the
teacher. (6/25/24 Varughese Decl., ¶ 2; see FAC, Ex. B, Bowles Tr., at 12:5-15;
Rhow Decl., Ex. 2 at p. 87.) Varughese’s statements made to Bowles during a
parenting class does not establish the existence of a psychotherapist-patient
relationship. (See In re A.C., supra, 37 Cal. App. 5th at p. 266
[psychotherapist-patient privilege did not apply to defendant’s statements made
to a therapist who was not providing therapy sessions to defendant]; Cabral,
supra, 12 Cal. App. 4th at p. 827 [psychotherapist-patient privilege did
not apply to a defendant who disclosed confidential information in a letter to
a psychologist, because defendant failed to establish a psychotherapist-patient
relationship].)              Varughese
does not prove a psychotherapist-patient privilege existed between Jackie
Miller (“Miller”) and Varughese as Miller admits on her website that she does
not offer “mental health” services. (See Kang Decl., Ex. C [“Jackie is not a
mental health professional. Clients are responsible for engaging their own
mental health professionals and are responsible for their own mental
health.”].) Further, evidence shows that Varughese spoke to Miller regarding DCFS
investigations and child abuse reporting, and not necessarily communication
regarding Varughese’s mental health. (See Rhow Decl., Ex. 1, at 62.)             Additionally,
even if the communications between Varughese and Bowles/Well Baby Center and
Jackie Miller could be classified as privileged, these communications fall
under the recognized exceptions to psychotherapist-patient privilege for
criminal conduct under Evidence Code Section 1018 and false child abuse
reporting. See Roe, 229 Cal. App. 3d 832, at 844 (“the Legislature never
intended to provide immunity to patients who knowingly or recklessly cause
their psychotherapists to file false child abuse reports.”).             Varguhese
is ordered to produce all communications with Bowles, Well Baby Center and
Miller in response to Plaintiff Grace Kang (“Kang”) RFPs.  II.            
Stephen Poulter             Varughese
waived the psychotherapist-patient privilege between himself and Stephen
Poulter (“Poulter”) regarding communications related to the child abuse claims,
child abuse reports, and investigations of Plaintiff, upon including the
Poulter Declaration within Varughese’s 9-22-22 anti-SLAPP motion. (See Rhow
Decl., Ex. 5, Poulter Decl., ¶¶ 3-6.) The Poulter Declaration includes references
to statements made between Poulter and Varughese regarding the issue of false
child abuse reporting, the main issue in this case, thus the privilege is
waived regarding those specific issues. (See Fish v. Superior Court
(2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 811, 819 [“What constitutes a significant part of the
communication is a matter of judicial interpretation; however, the scope of the
waiver should be determined primarily by reference to the purpose of the
privilege.”]             Varughese
is ordered to produce communications with Poulter related to child abuse
claims, child abuse reports, and investigations of Plaintiff in response to
Kang’s RFPS.
