And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Grace Kang's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories (Set Two) against Defendant Jason Varughese. The judge finds that Defendant's objections to the special interrogatories are evasive and frivolous. The judge orders Defendant to submit code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories within 30 days.

The judge has also granted Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to request for production (RFPs) in part, as to the issue of privileged documents only. The judge orders Defendant to produce all communications with Angelika Bowles, Well Baby Center, and Jackie Miller in response to Plaintiff's RFPs.

However, the judge has denied Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to RFPs as to the issue of non-privileged documents. The judge orders the parties to continue to meet and confer regarding the other issues of discovery concerning the harm to the Plaintiff and Defendant's redactions.

The judge has also waived the psychotherapist-patient privilege between Defendant and Stephen Poulter regarding communications related to child abuse claims, child abuse reports, and investigations of Plaintiff. The judge orders Defendant to produce communications with Poulter related to these issues in response to Plaintiff's RFPs.
