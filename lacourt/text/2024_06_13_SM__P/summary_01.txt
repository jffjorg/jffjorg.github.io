And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Based on the evidence presented, the court grants HCR's motion to amend the judgment to add judgment debtors. HCR has demonstrated that its correct legal entity name is "HCR Wealth Advisors", not "HCR Wealth Advisors, Inc.". The court finds that HCR's motion is proper under California Code of Civil Procedure §187, which allows the court to amend a judgment to add judgment debtors. The court notes that there is no time limit for such motions, and that great liberality is encouraged in the allowance of amendments. The court grants HCR's motion to amend the judgment and designates "HCR Wealth Advisors" as the judgment debtor.
