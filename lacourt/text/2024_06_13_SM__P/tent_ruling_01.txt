Drake v. HCR Wealth Advisors, Inc., Case No. SC128009
Hearing date June 13, 2024
HCR Wealth Advisors Inc.’s Motion to Amend HCR Wealth
Advisors’ Name 
 
Plaintiff Drake sued his former employer HCR Wealth Advisors
for violation of Cal. Lab. Code §2802 and declaratory relief to indemnify Drake
for attorney’s fees he incurred as a result of an investigation of HCR and
plaintiff by the SEC. HCR cross-complained for equitable indemnity, breach of
duty of loyalty, breach of contract and fraud. 
 
On December 2, 2021 judgment was entered by the court in
favor of HCR on the cross-complaint for $525,000.00, with execution of the
judgment stayed for one year. Drake’s complaint against HCR was dismissed with
prejudice. The stay has expired.
 
Before the court is HCR’s unopposed motion to amend the
12/2/21 judgment that amends “HCR Wealth Advisors, Inc.” to “HCR Wealth
Advisors” on all prior pleadings, as well as the entry of Judgment. 
 
Under Cal. Code of Civ. Proc.
§187, the court may amend a judgment to add judgment debtors. Curci
Investments, LLC v. Baldwin (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 214, 220. This is an
equitable procedure based on the theory that the court is not amending the judgment
to add a new defendant but is merely inserting the correct name of the real
defendant. NEC Electronics Inc. v. Hurt (1989) 208
Cal.App.3d 772, 778.
 
There is no time limit for such
motions; they may be made any time, so the judgment properly designates the
true parties. Carolina Casualty Ins. Co. v. L.M. Ross Law Group, LLP
(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1188. “In order to see that justice is done, great
liberality is encouraged in the allowance of amendments brought pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 187. (Greenspan v. LADT LLC (2010)
191 Cal.App.4th 486, 508.)” Misik v. D'Arco (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th
1065, 1073, parallel citations omitted.
 
HCR states that it recently
became aware its name on all pleadings and the judgment includes “Inc.,” which
is not part of HCR’s full, legal entity name, as reflected in its amended
Articles of Incorporation. Lubin Decl. ¶4, Exh. 3. The amended Articles of
Incorporation displays a stamp indicating it was filed with the Secretary of
State on 9/9/14. The President and Secretary of Heller Capital Resources,
Financial and Insurance Services, Inc., Gregory S. Heller, certified the
corporation was amending its name to “HCR WEALTH ADVISORS.” 
 
The evidence demonstrates HCR’s
correct legal entity name is “HCR Wealth Advisors,” not “HCR Wealth Advisors,
Inc.” HCR Wealth Advisors is properly designated as the judgment debtor. GRANTED.
