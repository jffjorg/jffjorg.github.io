If a party fails to provide a timely
response to a request for admission, the party waives any objection to the
requests.  (C.C.P. § 2033.280(a).)  Moreover, “[t]he requesting party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction….”  (C.C.P. § 2033.280(b).)  
 
When timely responses to
interrogatories are not received, “[t]he party propounding the interrogatories
may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.”  (CCP § 2030.290(b).) “If a party to whom a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve
a timely response to it. . .  [t]he party
to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed
waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product. . . .  The
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand.”  (CCP § 2031.300(a)–(b).)
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Giselle
Rodriguez moves compel responses to FIs and RPDs, set one, and to deem RFAs,
set one, admitted against Defendant/Cross-Complainant Tuyen Kim Nguyen. Cross-Defendant
served the subject discovery on January 5, 2024. Responses were due on February
9, 2024. As of the filing of these motions, Cross-Defendant has not received
responses. 
 
In opposition, Cross-Complainant, who
is unrepresented by counsel, states that she does not have knowledge of
Cross-Defendant's underlying claims (which have since been dismissed), that she
did not receive the subject discovery and that all information in her
possession is alleged in the cross-complaint. 
 
As Cross-Complainant claims that she
did not receive the discovery, the Court will continue the motions to allow
Cross-Complainant to respond. The Court notes that while the cross-complaint remains
active, Cross-Complainant must respond to discovery. 
 
Cross-Defendant's motions are
CONTINUED to October 25, 2024 at 9:00 am. Cross-Complainant to serve responses
to the subject discovery no later than October 11, 2024. Cross-Defendant to
file a declaration stating whether responses have been served no later than
October 18, 2024.
