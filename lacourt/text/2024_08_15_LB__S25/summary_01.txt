Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by Defendant Los Alamitos Medical Center to certain causes of action in a complaint filed by the plaintiff. The demurrer was sustained with leave to amend in regard to the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 9th causes of action. The judge found that the allegations in the 2nd cause of action (violation of the Unruh Act) were insufficient and that the claims in the 4th and 5th causes of action (false imprisonment and medical malpractice) were time-barred. The judge also found that the allegations in the 6th cause of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress) did not rise to the level of "outrageous" or "reckless" conduct, and that the allegations in the 9th cause of action (fraud) were not pled with the required particularity. The judge gave the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The motion to strike certain paragraphs was mooted by the judge's ruling.
