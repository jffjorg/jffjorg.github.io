Summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law action case. The plaintiff, Rogelio Badajoz, is seeking to compel further responses to form interrogatory no. 12.1, which asks for witness identifying information related to the incident that underlies the action. The defendant, General Motors, LLC, objected to the interrogatory, citing vagueness and ambiguity of the term "incident", protection of attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine, and information equally available to the plaintiff. The judge has ruled that the objections lack merit and that the defendant should provide a complete response to the interrogatory. The judge has granted the motion to compel further response and ordered the defendant to provide a response within thirty days.
