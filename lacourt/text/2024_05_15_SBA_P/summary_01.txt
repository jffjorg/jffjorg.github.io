And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court has considered the motion to reclassify the case from limited jurisdiction to unlimited jurisdiction. The Plaintiff, Dwayne Dickson, alleges that he was injured on June 9, 2023, and seeks damages from the Defendants. The Plaintiff filed a complaint, and the Defendants filed an answer. The Court held an Order to Show Cause hearing, and the parties stipulated to reclassification to limited jurisdiction. However, the Plaintiff's counsel later discovered that the Plaintiff's medical expenses exceeded the limited jurisdiction limits of $35,000. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's damages will exceed the jurisdictional maximum for a limited civil action and grants the Plaintiff's motion to reclassify the case from limited jurisdiction to unlimited jurisdiction. The Plaintiff is ordered to pay the reclassification fee of $140.
