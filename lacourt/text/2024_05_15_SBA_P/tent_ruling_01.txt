  Case Number:  23TRCV02444    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  P Having considered plaintiff’s motion and the associated exhibits thereto, the court rules as follows: The motion to reclassify is GRANTED.I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUNDOn July 27, 2023, Plaintiff Dwayne Dickson (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Black Badge Security (“Black Badge”), Fairfield Harvard Yard Glenmary LP (“Fairfield”), Kevin Sauceda (“Sauceda”) (collectively “Defendants”), and DOES 1 to 100, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) Negligence; (2) Negligent Hiring, Supervision, Training and Retention; (3) Assault; (4) Battery; and (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.On August 30, 2023, Defendant Fairfield filed an Answer to the Complaint.On November 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Case Management Statement.Also, on November 13, 2023, default was entered against Defendant Black Badge and Defendant Sauceda.On November 27, 2023, the Court held a Case Management Conference and there was no appearance by Defendant Fairfield. (11/27/23 Minute Order.) The Court set an OSC Re: Failureto Appear by Defendant Fairfield and Failure to Failure to File Case Management Statement for January 10, 2024 in Department M at Torrance Courthouse. (11/27/23 Minute Order.)On December 18, 2023, Defendant Fairfield filed a Case Management Statement.On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Case Management Statement.On January 10, 2024, before the Honorable David K. Reinert sitting in Department M at Torrance Courthouse, an OSC re: Failure to Appear by Defendant Fairfield and Failure to File Case Management Statement was held. (01/10/24 Minute Order.) The Court discharged the OSC. (01/10/24 Minute Order.) The Court inquired of the parties as to whether the case should be reclassified as a limited civil case and the parties stipulated to reclassification. (01/10/24 Minute Order.) As such, “[p]ursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 403.010 through 403.090, the entire action [was] ordered reclassified as [a] civil limited jurisdiction case.” (01/10/24 Minute Order.)Also, on January 10, 2024, this action was reassigned to the Honorable Douglas W. Stern sitting in Department B at Torrance Courthouse effective January 16, 2024.On January 24, 2024, this action was reassigned from the Honorable Douglas W. Stern to the Honorable David K. Reinert sitting in Department P at Torrance Courthouse effective January 29, 2024.Plaintiff was ordered to give notice of the case reassignments; however, Plaintiff did not file a proof of service concerning notice of any of the case reassignments.On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion to reclassify this case from a limited jurisdiction to an unlimited jurisdiction case or, alternatively, transfer this case back to unlimited jurisdiction in Department M so that the Court can perform a noticed case and medical bill evaluation and in full compliance with court noticed constitutional due process.As of May 13, 2024, Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed. Any opposition to the motion was required to have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing pursuant to CCP § 1005(b). Due to the lack of opposition to Plaintiff’s motion, an inference is created that the motion is meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)II. FACTUAL BACKGROUNDPlaintiff alleges that on or about June 9, 2023, he was at or near 8711 South Harvard Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90047 (the “Property”) inside the main lobby and was trying to talk with the management. (Complaint, ¶ 8.) Defendant Sauceda who works for Defendant Black Badge confronted Plaintiff and told him to go back to his apartment after a verbal altercation. (Complaint, ¶ 8.) Defendant Sauceda nudged the Plaintiff to leave and then Plaintiff turned around to go toward the elevator. (Complaint, ¶ 8.) Once the elevator door opened, Defendant Sauceda shoved Plaintiff from behind, which caused Plaintiff to slip and fall. (Complaint, ¶ 8.)Plaintiff seeks among other damages, general damages according to proof, special damages, and punitive and exemplary damages. (Complaint at p. 11:2-17.)III. LEGAL STANDARD“The plaintiff . . . may file a motion for reclassification within the time allowed for that party to amend the initial pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).) “The court, on its own motion, may reclassify a case at any time.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).) “A motion for reclassification does not extend the moving party’s time to amend . . . or otherwise respond.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).)“[A] civil case in which the damages claimed are less than $25,000 or less is a limited civil case.” (AP-Colton LLC v. Ohaeri (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 500, 505.) “In a limited civil action, the judgment cannot exceed $25,000.” (Ibid.) “For reclassification of a case from a limited civil case to an unlimited civil case, a fee shall be charged as provided in Section 70619 of the Government Code. This reclassification fee shall be in addition to any other fee due for that appearance or filing in a limited civil case.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.060, subd. (a).) “The fee for reclassification of a case from a limited civil case to an unlimited civil case under Section 403.060 of the Code of Civil Procedure is one hundred forty dollars ($140).” (Gov. Code § 70619.) “If a plaintiff . . . files an amended complaint . . . that changes the jurisdictional classification from limited to unlimited, the party at the time of filing the pleading shall pay the reclassification fee . . ., and the clerk shall promptly reclassify the case.” (AP-Colton, supra, 240 Cal.App.4th 500, 505.) An action may be reclassified where the maximum amount in controversy exceeds that of a limited civil jurisdiction case. (Ibid.)“[A] matter may be reclassified as a limited civil action when (i) the absence of jurisdiction is apparent before trial from the complaint, petition, or related documents, or (ii) during the course of pretrial litigation, it becomes clear that the matter will necessarily result in a verdict below the superior court’s jurisdictional amount.” (Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005)129 Cal.App.4th 266, 276, internal quotations omitted, emphasis in original.) “[T]he test [is] . . . whether lack of jurisdiction is clear . . . [or] virtually unattainable.” (Id. at p. 277, citation omitted, internal quotations omitted.) “This standard involves an evaluation of the amount fairly in controversy, not an adjudication of the merits of the claim, and . . . requires a high level of certainty that [the] damage award will not exceed $25,000.” (Ibid., emphasis in original.) “The [trial] court may believe it highly unlikely that plaintiff will recover the amount demanded, but this is not enough to defeat jurisdiction, unless it appears to a legal certainty that plaintiff cannot recover the amount [of the] demand[].” (Ibid.) “[T]he superior court must deny the motion to reclassify the case as limited (and thus keep the matter in the unlimited civil court) unless it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff’s damages will necessarily be less than $25,000.” (Ibid., emphasis in original.)Effective January 1, 2024, a limited civil action is an action where the amount in controversy does not exceed $35,000. (Code Civ. Proc., § 85, subd. (a).) “A civil action or proceeding other than a limited civil case may be referred to as an unlimited civil case.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 88.)IV. DISCUSSIONMoving Party’s ArgumentsPlaintiff argues that this action should be reclassified as an unlimited civil action as Plaintiff’s damages will exceed the jurisdictional maximum for a limited civil action.Responding Party’s OppositionNo opposition filed as of May 13, 2024.Moving Party’s ReplyNo reply filed as of May 13, 2024.Motion’s MeritsAppropriateness of ReclassificationIn support of the motion, Plaintiff’s counsel, Ernest Lingenfelter (“Lingenfelter”), provides a declaration relevantly stating the following: at the Order to Show Cause hearing, the Honorable David K. Reinert asked if both parties stipulated to the case being reclassified to limited jurisdiction based upon the status of the current CMC statements on file for the matter. (Lingenfelter Decl., ¶ 4.) After reviewing the CMC statement, Mr. Lingenfelter along with counsel for Defendant Fairfield, stipulated to the reclassification based upon information that was presented to him at the time. (Lingenfelter Decl., ¶ 4.) After hearing, however, Mr. Lingenfelter was informed that Plaintiff’s medical records and bills were far in excess of the statutory limited jurisdiction bar, and that it should not have been reclassified. (Lingenfelter Decl., ¶ 5.) Had he been aware of the information at the time of the hearing, Mr. Lingenfelter states that he would not have stipulated to sending the case to limited jurisdiction. (Lingenfelter Decl., ¶ 5.)Plaintiff’s counsel, Gene J. Goldsman (“Goldsman”), also provides a declaration in support of the motion. Mr. Goldsman states that upon review of new records and billing records shortly obtained after the last hearing, this case should be moved back to unlimited jurisdiction. (Goldsman Decl., ¶ 14.) Plaintiff provides medical and billing records showing current medical expenses of $15,021.00 (Goldsman Decl., ¶¶ 3-9; Exhs. 1-7), and Plaintiff argues that there is a recommendation for future disc replacement surgery in the amount of $150,000.00 and that he continues to receive post-injury treatment, the bills of which continue to this day. (Memorandum of Points and Authorities at p. 6:5-12; Goldsman Decl., ¶ 13; Exh. 11.)Given that Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed, the Court finds that Defendant Fairfield has conceded to Plaintiff’s arguments because “[c]ontentions are waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to authority.” (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.) Irrespective of such fact, the Court finds that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to warrant reclassification of this action. Plaintiff has presented evidence that his medical expenses—given that he continues to receive post-injury treatment—will exceed the limited jurisdiction limits of $35,000.00. The Court does not find that there is a legal certainty that Plaintiff’s damages will be less than $35,000.00.Exercising its discretion, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to reclassify this action from limited jurisdiction to unlimited jurisdiction. Plaintiff is ordered to pay the reclassification fee of $140.00 pursuant to CCP § 403.060(a) before this action will be reclassified.V. CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, the Motion to Reclassify Plaintiff’s Case from Limited Jurisdiction to Unlimited Jurisdiction is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to pay the reclassification fee of $140.00 pursuant to CCP § 403.060(a) before this action will be reclassified to an unlimited civil jurisdiction matter.Moving Party to give notice.The Motion to Reclassify Plaintiff’s Case from Limited Jurisdiction to Unlimited Jurisdiction filed by Plaintiff Dwayne Dickson on 3/22/2024 is granted.
