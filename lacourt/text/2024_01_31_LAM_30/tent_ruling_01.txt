Tentative Ruling re: 
Defendant’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint
Defendant TransUnion
Rental Screening Solutions, Inc. (Defendant) demurs to
the second cause of action in Plaintiffs’ first amended complaint. The demurrer
is sustained without leave to amend. 
In
reviewing the legal sufficiency of a complaint against a demurrer, a court will
treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions, or conclusions of law. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 (Blank); C & H Foods Co. v. Hartford Ins. Co. (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1062.) It is well settled that
a “demurrer lies only for defects appearing on the face of the complaint[.]” (Stevens
v. Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 594, 601.)
“The rules by which the sufficiency of a complaint is tested against a general
demurrer are well settled. We not only treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but also give the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.” (Guclimane
Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19
Cal.4th 26, 38 (internal quotes omitted).) For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, the complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable
inferences from the facts pleaded. (Wilner v. Sunset Life Ins. Co. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 952, 958.) 
 When
ruling on a demurrer, the Court may only consider the complaint’s allegations
or matters which may be judicially noticed. (Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318.) The Court may not consider any other
extrinsic evidence or judge the credibility of the allegations plead or the
difficulty a plaintiff may have in proving his allegations. (Ion
Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881.) A demurrer is properly sustained only when the complaint, liberally
construed, fails to state facts sufficient to constitute any cause of action. (Kramer
v. Intuit Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 574,
578.) 
Second Cause of Action for Invasion of Privacy
Plaintiffs’
cause of action for Invasion of Privacy alleges that “Plaintiffs had a
reasonable expectation that TransUnion would not solicit or receive information
concerning their character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or
mode of living, unless TransUnion complied with all governing laws.” (FAC.
¶ 73.) They further allege that “Plaintiffs had a reasonable expectation that
they would be protected by the laws governing dissemination of information of a
private nature concerning their character, general reputation, personal
characteristics, or mode of living.” (FAC. ¶ 74.) They go on to allege that Defendant invaded the Plaintiffs’ rights of privacy “by
obtaining investigative consumer reports about the Plaintiffs without complying
with mandatory requirements under the ICAA [sic] for getting investigative
reports about the Plaintiffs.” (FAC. ¶ 77.)
The ICRAA
applies to “investigative consumer reports,” defined as “a consumer report in
which information on a consumer's character, general reputation, personal
characteristics, or mode of living is obtained through any means.” (Civ. Code §
1786.2, subd. (c).) This definition includes tenant screening reports. (See
Moran v. Screening Pros, LLC (9th Cir. 2019) 943 F.3d 1175, 1180.) 
The common law tort for invasion of
privacy “seeks to vindicate multiple and different interests that range from
freedom to act without observation in a home, hospital room, or other private
place to the ability to control the commercial exploitation of a name or
picture.” (Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 24.) “Actionable
invasions of privacy also must be ‘highly offensive’ to a reasonable person
[Citations], and ‘sufficiently serious and unwarranted as to constitute an
‘egregious breach of the social norms.’ ” (Hernandez v. Hillsides, Inc.
(2009) 47 Cal.4th 272, 295.) 
“[I]n discussing the right of privacy
in the area of public disclosure of embarrassing private facts, Prosser stated:
‘The disclosure of the private facts must be a public disclosure, and not a
private one; there must be, in other words, publicity.’ [Citation.] [¶] Thus, except in cases involving
physical intrusion, the tort must be accompanied by publicity in the sense of
communication to the public in general or to a large number of persons as
distinguished from one individual or a few.” (Kinsey v. Macur (1980) 107
Cal.App.3d 265, 270.) Additionally, “the facts disclosed must be private
facts, and not public ones.” (Sipple v. Chronicle Publishing Co.
(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 1040, 1045.)
“[T]he plaintiff in an invasion of
privacy case must have conducted himself or herself in a manner consistent with
an actual expectation of privacy, i.e., he or she must not have manifested by
his or her conduct a voluntary consent to the invasive actions of defendant. If
voluntary consent is present, a defendant's conduct will rarely be deemed
‘highly offensive to a reasonable person’ so as to justify tort liability.” (Hill,
7 Cal.4th at 26.)
Defendant’s
alleged violations of the ICRAA are insufficient to support a tort cause of
action for invasion of privacy. The allegations fail to show that TransUnion
publicly disclosed private facts about Plaintiffs, or that the disclosure was
to a large number of persons. Instead, they show the opposite: “Defendants kept
Plaintiffs’ private information private from Plaintiffs… .” (FAC. ¶ 78.)
The invasion of privacy claim is also precluded by
Plaintiffs’ allegation that they consented to the release of their information.
(FAC. ¶ 34.) While Plaintiffs point out that the remedies provided by the ICRAA
are not exclusive (Civ. Code § 1786.52), this does not mean that a violation of
the ICRAA will necessarily constitute an actionable invasion of privacy. Accordingly,
the demurrer is sustained as to the second cause of action.
