And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions, Inc., has demurred to the plaintiff's second cause of action for invasion of privacy. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant obtained investigative consumer reports about them without complying with mandatory requirements under the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA). However, the allegations do not show that the defendant publicly disclosed private facts about the plaintiff or that the disclosure was to a large number of persons. Additionally, the plaintiff consented to the release of their information. Therefore, the defendant's alleged violations of the ICRAA are insufficient to support a tort cause of action for invasion of privacy, and the demurrer is sustained as to the second cause of action.
