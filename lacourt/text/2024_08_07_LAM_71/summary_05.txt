English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling issued by a judge in a California superior court case, numbered 23STCV30389. The case involves a dispute between Plaintiff Doe (a.k.a. Jerome Eady) and Defendant Hankey Investment Company LP. The Defendant has moved for an order requiring the Plaintiff to furnish a security in the amount of $90,000 to proceed with the litigation. The judge grants the motion, finding that the Plaintiff has been declared a vexatious litigant and that there is no reasonable probability that the Plaintiff will prevail in the litigation. The judge also finds that the litigation has no merit and has been filed for the purposes of harassment or delay. As a result, the judge orders the Plaintiff to furnish a security in the amount of $90,000 to be paid within 10 days of the ruling, and stays the entirety of the litigation until the security is furnished.
