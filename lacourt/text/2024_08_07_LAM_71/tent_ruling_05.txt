(“Defendant”) moves unopposed for an order requiring Plaintiff Doe aka
Jerome Eady (“Eady”) (“Plaintiff”) to furnish a security in the amount of
$90,000.00 to proceed with this litigation, or in the alternative to dismiss
this action.  (Notice Motion, pgs. 1-2;

Request for Judicial Notice
Defendant’s 4/2/24 request for judicial notice
of (1) The Court’s Order Declaring Jerome Eady to Be a Vexatious Litigant, LASC
Case No. 23STCV30391, decided on February 8, 2024, (D-RJN, Exh. A); (2)
Judgment for the Unlawful Detainer against Eady, LASC Case No. 23STUD08792,
decided on January 22, 2024, (D-RJN, Exh. B); and (3) Order amending the
Judgment for the Unlawful Detainer against Eady, LASC Case No. 23STUD08792,
signed on February 23, 2024, (D-RJN, Exh. C) is granted.
 
Background
On December 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed his eleventh
unlimited lawsuit against Defendant.  On
February 8, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Declare Jerome Eady a
Vexatious Litigant.  On March 4, 2024,
the Court declared Plaintiff a vexatious litigant.  (3/4/24 Order Declaring Eady Vexatious
Litigant.)
Plaintiff lost the unlawful detainer case
against him by Defendant.  (See
D-RJN, Exh. B.)  In the Court’s Ruling,
the Court entered judgment “for Plaintiff Circa 1200, LLC against Defendant
Jerome Eady and Defendant Dan Jones on the Complaint filed by Circa on
07/17/2023 for past rent due in the amount of $7,568.00, holdover damages
$2,432.00, and costs of $360.00 for a total of $10,360.00.”  (See D-RJN, Exh. B at pg. 1.)  The Court further ordered that the
restitution and possession of 1200 S. Figueroa Street #W1704, Los Angeles, CA
90015 is granted for Circa 1200, LLC.  (See
D-RJN, Exh. B at pg. 1.)  Finally, the
Court forfeited the lease agreement which Plaintiff is currently attempting to
sue under.  (See D-RJN, Exh. B at
pg. 1.)  The Court also granted an order
to amend the Writ of Possession to reflect all names of Plaintiff.  (See D-RJN, Exh. C at pg. 2.)
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §391.3(a) provides that a Court shall
order a vexatious litigant to furnish security if “there is no reasonable
probability that the plaintiff will prevail.” C.C.P. §391.3(a) states:
Except as provided in subdivision (b), if, after hearing the
evidence upon the motion, the court determines that the plaintiff is a
vexatious litigant and that there is no reasonable probability that the
plaintiff will prevail in the litigation against the moving defendant, the
court shall order the plaintiff to furnish, for the benefit of the moving
defendant, security in such amount and within such time as the court shall fix.
 
(C.C.P. §391.3(a), emphasis added).  In the alternative, however, if the Court
finds that the litigation has no merit, the Court shall dismiss the
action.  C.C.P. §391.3(b) states, in
part: “If, after hearing evidence on the motion, the court determines that the
litigation has no merit and has been filed for the purposes of harassment or
delay, the court shall order the litigation dismissed.”  (C.C.P. §391.3(b).)
 
Discussion
Defendant’s motion for an order requiring
Plaintiff to furnish a security to proceed in this matter is granted.  First, Plaintiff has been declared a vexatious
litigant by order of this Court, satisfying the first condition of C.C.P.
§391.3(a).  (See 3/4/24 Order
Declaring Eady Vexatious Litigant.)
Second, Plaintiff alleges a breach of contract
claim against Defendant in his complaint. Under C.C.P. §391.3, the required
showing that there is no reasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail
on his claim is “ordinarily made by the weight of the evidence.”  (Golin v. Allenby (2010) 190
Cal.App.4th 616, 642, as modified on denial of reh’g, (Dec. 23, 2010).)  A lack of merit may also be established “by
demonstrating that the plaintiff cannot prevail in the action as a matter of
law.”  (Id.)  Here, Plaintiff cannot prevail in this
lawsuit as a matter of law because the issue in this matter (breach of rental
contract) has already been determined in Case No. 23STUD08792 and is therefore
barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.
Under C.C.P. §391(c), a security is meant to
assure payment to the party that benefits from the security.  (See C.C.P. §391(c).)  C.C.P. §391(c) states, in part: “‘Security’
means an undertaking to assure payment . . . of the party’s reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees and not limited to taxable costs, incurred
in or in connection with a litigation instituted, caused to be instituted, or
maintained or caused to be maintained by a vexatious litigant.”  Here, Defendant has incurred attorney’s fees and
costs of over $90,000 in connection with all the lawsuits filed by Plaintiff.  (See Decl. of Lauro, Exh. D.)
Under CCP §391.6, the entirety of this
litigation is stayed. The stay shall remain effective until 10 days after the
security is furnished, and the statute does not carve out any exception for
proceedings that may continue during that period except for the dismissal of
the action.  (See Hanna v. Little
League Baseball, Inc. (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 871, 875-876.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff is ordered to furnish a
security in the amount of $90,000.00 to be paid within 10 days of this ruling.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s unopposed motion is
granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to furnish
a security in the amount of $90,000.00 to be paid within 10 days of this
ruling.
