Petitioners
Heng Li’s, Jie Li’s, and Ning Jiang’s unopposed motion for attorneys’ fees is granted in the total amount of $26,580.00.

 
Petitioners Heng Li (“Heng”), Jie Li (“Jie”),
and Ning Jiang (“Jiang”) (collectively, “Petitioners”) move unopposed for
an order awarding their attorneys’ fees in the amount of $26,580.00 pursuant to this Court’s confirmation
of their Consent Award and issuance of a Judgment in their favor against Respondents FMB Development
LLC (“Development”) and FMB Consulting LLC (“Consulting”) (collectively,
“Respondents”) on March 27, 2024. 
(Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; Civ. Code §1717.)  
 
Background
This matter originates from an
agreement between Respondents and Third Parties (“Assignors”) that was executed
in April 2019.  Respondents agreed to
make scheduled payments toward a debt amount owed of $2,930,637.00. Respondents
paid $300,000.00 and failed to pay any other amounts toward the debt owed.  Respondents defaulted on their loan
obligations.
On January 2, 2020, Assignors
assigned all their rights, title and interest, in and to the Agreement to
Petitioners.
A dispute subsequently arose
between Petitioners and Respondents, relating to the continued failure of
Respondents to perform, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.
On March 20, 2020,
Petitioners demanded mediation under the Agreement, pursuant to paragraph 15.
The Parties attended mediation on May 19, 2020, but were unable to resolve the matter
at mediation. 
The matter was submitted to
arbitration before Hon. Suzanne G. Bruguera (Ret.) (“Arbitrator”) with ADR
Services on July 3, 2020.
Prior to the arbitration
hearing set for January 2021, and to avoid further expenditure of time, money
and resources, the Parties agreed to settle the dispute through a Consent Award
in favor of Petitioners.  (Decl. of
Feazell ¶4, Exh. 1.) 
Respondents failed to pay any
of the Consent Award.  Petitioners then
sought a judgment.
Petitioners filed their
Petition to Confirm Consent Award on June 5, 2023. On March 12, 2024, this
Court heard and granted the unopposed Motion to Confirm Consent Award.  This Court executed and entered a Judgment
against Respondents on March 27, 2024.
On
May 28, 2024, Petitioners filed this motion for attorneys’ fees.  As of the date of this hearing no opposition
has been filed.
 
Discussion
Civil Code §1717(a) provides, in part:
In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides
that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract,
shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then
the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether
he or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to
reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.
 
Where a contract provides for attorney’s fees, as set forth above,
that provision shall be construed as applying to the entire contract, unless
each party was represented by counsel in the negotiation and execution of the
contract, and the fact of that representation is specified in the contract. 
 
Reasonable attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the court, and shall be
an element of the costs of suit.
 
(Civ. Code §1717(a).)
Here, Petitioners are the prevailing
party in a contract, the Consent Award, containing an attorneys’ fees provision.  (Decl. of Feazell ¶4, Exh. 1
at §13.)  Petitioners are the undisputed
prevailing party in the March 27, 2024, Judgment of the Court, and the Judgment
of the states that attorneys’ fees and costs shall be awarded upon Motion. Therefore,
Petitioners are entitled to an award of their reasonable attorneys’ fees.
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by the Plaintiff’s counsel.  The Supreme Court of California has concluded
that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for private
attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Petitioners’
counsel declares the following hourly rates: (1) Gene H. Shioda ($600.00/hour);
(2) Christopher J. Langley ($500.00-$600.00/hour); (3) Stephen P. Chang
($500.00/hour); (4) Heidi M. Cheng ($400.00/hour); (5) Jason A. Feazell
($400.00/hour).  (Decl. of Feazell ¶¶5-11;
Exh. 3.)  These rates are appropriate
given each the attorney’s relative experience and qualifications.  (See id.)  Petitioners have sufficiently demonstrated their
counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their community of practice in their
specialized area of law.
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
Petitioners’
counsel’s fee recovery is based on 52.6 hours spent by their attorneys
litigating this case for a total of $21,780.00.  (Decl. of Feazell ¶4, Exh. 3.)  
Petitioners
also request an additional $4,800 to draft the instant motion, bringing the
total amount of attorneys’ fees to $26,580.00. 
(Decl. of Feazell ¶12.)
Petitioners’
motion is granted.
 
Conclusion
Accordingly, Petitioners’ unopposed
request for attorneys’ fees is granted in the amount of $26,580.00.
Moving Party to give notice.
