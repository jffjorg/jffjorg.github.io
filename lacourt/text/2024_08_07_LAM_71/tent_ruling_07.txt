LARRY NORWOOD,  
  
         vs.
 
LEROY HOLT,
  SR.


 Case No.: 
  24STCV06708
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  August 7, 2024



 
Defendant
Leroy Holt Sr.’s unopposed demurrer to Plaintiff Larry Norwood’s 1st
cause of action in his Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to
amend.
 
          Defendant Leroy
Holt Sr. (“Holt”) (“Defendant”) demurs to the the 1st cause of action in
Plaintiff Larry Norwood’s (“Norwood”) (“Plaintiff”) complaint
(“Complaint”).  (Notice of Demurrer, pgs.
1-2.)
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the
moving party must meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who
filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the
objections to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41, emphasis added.) 
Defendant’s counsel submitted a
meet and confer declaration stating that since June 7, 2024, he made numerous
phone calls and left a voicemail to Plaintiff’s counsel to meet and confer and
follow up on whether Plaintiff will agree to amend the Complaint, and Plaintiff
has failed to affirm whether Plaintiff will comply and withdraw the 1st cause
of action.  (Decl. of Pogosyan ¶¶3-4.)  Defendant’s counsel’s declaration is
proper.  Accordingly, the Court will
consider Defendant’s demurrer.
 
          Background
          Plaintiff,
in pro per, filed the operative Complaint on March 18, 2024, against
Defendant alleging three causes of action: (1) wrongful eviction; (2) breach of
quiet enjoyment; and (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress.[1]  Plaintiff’s causes of action arise from
Plaintiff’s and his wife’s residence at real property located at 1537 ½ W. 58th
Pl., Los Angeles, CA 90047 (“Subject Property”).  (See Complaint ¶6.)
          Defendant
filed the instant demurrer on June 18, 2024. 
As of the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Summary of
Demurrer
Defendant demurs
to the 1st cause of action alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint on the basis it fails
to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because it fails to
allege that Plaintiff has surrendered possession of his residence to Defendant who
is his landlord.  (Demurrer, pg. 2.)  
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State
a Claim
Wrongful Eviction (1st COA)
California
recognizes the tort of wrongful eviction. 
(See Barkett v. Brucato (1953) 122 Cal.App.2d 264, 275.)  “An essential element of a wrongful eviction
claim is that the tenant has vacated the premises. [Citations.]”  (Ginsberg v. Gamson (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 873, 900.)
The elements of a
cause of action in tort for wrongful eviction are (1) the tenant has property
rights and privileges with regard to the use or enjoyment that has been
interfered with; (2) there has been a substantial invasion of those rights or
privileges; (3) the conduct of the landlord is the legal
cause of the invasion of the tenant’s rights or privileges; and (4) the invasion
is intentional and unreasonable, or unintentional and otherwise actionable
under the rules governing liability for negligent, reckless or ultrahazardous
conduct.  (Tooke v. Allen
(1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 230, 237.)
Plaintiff alleges
on or about January 1993, he moved into the Subject Property with his spouse,
Bridgette Norwood.  (Complaint ¶6.)  Plaintiff alleges on October 1, 2020, the
neighbor, who is also Defendant’s tenant, had a water pipe burst, which flooded
Plaintiff’s garage, causing loss to many personal items which had sentimental
value.  (Complaint ¶7.)  Plaintiff alleges after his garage flooded,
Defendant unilaterally discarded Plaintiff’s belongings without proper notice
or any form of compensation, which began a “caustic relationship” between
Defendant and Plaintiff. (Complaint ¶8.)  
Plaintiff alleges
on November 18, 2020, Defendant[2] illegally changed Plaintiff’s
lock on the garage door without providing Plaintiff prior notice or answering
Plaintiff’s numerous calls for other accommodation for the loss of his garage
and loss of use of his personal property therein.  (Complaint ¶9.)  Plaintiff alleges on November 19, 2020,
Plaintiff reported Defendant’s unilateral conduct of changing the lock on the
garage to the LAPD, incident number “0284”.  (Complaint ¶10.)  Plaintiff alleges from November 20, 2020, to
March 21, 2021, Plaintiff was not able to access his belongings inside the
garage due to Defendant’s unlawful unilateral act of usurping Plaintiff’s
garage.  (Complaint ¶11.)  
Plaintiff alleges
on March 9, 2021, Defendant posted a note of Plaintiff’s door and a verbal
altercation ensued, wherein the police were called, and the LAPD was able to
convince Defendant to provide Plaintiff with a garage key.  (Complaint ¶12.)  Plaintiff alleges on October 15, 2021,
Defendant confronted Plaintiff on the Subject Property and falsely accused him
of stealing Defendant’s tools. 
(Complaint ¶13.)  
Plaintiff alleges
on February 9, 2023, Defendant sent a letter to Plaintiff demanding that
Plaintiff remove all things from inside of his garage or pay an additional $150
a month to continue using the garage. 
(Complaint ¶14.)  Plaintiff alleges
on March 16, 2023, Defendant[3] posted a notice that he
will do some repairs that Plaintiff had previously requested at 1 PM the next
day, March 17, 2023.  (Complaint ¶15.)  
Plaintiff alleges
that on March 17, 2023, Defendant arrived at 10 AM, not 1 PM per his notice,
and Defendant never knocked on Plaintiff’s door and Defendant used his key to
effectuate his trespass.  (Complaint ¶16.)
 Plaintiff alleges a verbal altercation
ensued and Defendant changed the locks on Plaintiff’s door and left.  (Complaint ¶16.)  
Plaintiff alleges
on September 19, 2023, Defendant filed a retaliatory unlawful detainer (LASC
Case No. 23STUD12282) to terminate Plaintiff’s and his wife’s tenancy.  (Complaint ¶22.)  Plaintiff alleges on February 6, 2024,
Defendant dismissed the unlawful detainer action.  (Complaint ¶24.)  
Plaintiff fails
to allege he vacated the premises.  (Ginsberg,
205 Cal.App.4th at pg. 900.)  
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action is sustained with
20 days leave to amend.
 
          Conclusion
Defendant’s unopposed
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action is sustained with 20 days
leave to amend as to the 1st cause of action.
Moving Party to
give notice.
