And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant FPI Management, Inc.'s motion to compel further answers to special interrogatories (Set One) from Plaintiff Isaiah Sampson. Plaintiff is ordered to provide code-compliant responses without boilerplate objections within 20 days. The judge also grants Defendant's request for sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $3,031.75, which is payable by Plaintiff within 20 days.

The judge denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions against Defendant FPI Management, Inc. and its counsel, as Plaintiff failed to make a good faith effort to meet and confer with Defendant's counsel.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that Plaintiff's responses to the special interrogatories were incomplete, evasive, and contained boilerplate objections. The judge also finds that Plaintiff failed to provide factual responses to certain questions, and that Defendant's counsel spent significant time and resources preparing and reviewing the motion to compel.
