          Defendant FPI Management, Inc. (“FPI”)
(“Defendant”) moves to compel further responses to its Special Interrogatories
(Set One) (“SROG”) from Plaintiff Isaiah Sampson (“Sampson”)
(“Plaintiff”). 
(Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §2030.220(a).)  Defendant requests sanctions against
Plaintiff in the amount of $3,031.75. 
(Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2023.010, 2023.030.)
 
Meet and Confer
Defendant’s counsel declares she sent a meet and
confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel on April 2, 2024.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶4, Exh. C.)  Defendant’s counsel declares she sent a follow-up
email on April 2, 2024, requesting Plaintiff’s counsel’s availability for an
IDC.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶5, Exh. D.)  Defendant’s counsel declares that to date,
Plaintiff’s counsel has not provided a response.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶6.)  Defendant’s counsel declares that because
Plaintiff’s counsel has not responded concerning availability for an Informal Discovery
Conference, her office was instructed by the Clerk in Dept. 71 to note the lack
of response in my declaration and no Informal Discovery Conference will take
place prior to the motion to compel. 
(Decl. of Eaton ¶8.)
 
Background
          On February
6, 2024, Defendant propounded its SROG on Plaintiff.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶2, Exh. A.)  On March 1, 2024, Plaintiff served responses
to the SROG.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶3, Exh.
B.)
          Defendant
filed the instant motion on April 14, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed his opposition on May 3, 2024.  Defendant filed its reply on May 17, 2024.
 
          Discussion
A “party may obtain discovery regarding any matter,
not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action . . . if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  (C.C.P. §2017.010.)  “[A] civil litigant’s right to discovery is
broad” and the “statutes governing discovery must be construed liberally in
favor of disclosure.”  (Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541.)  When “a deponent fails to answer any question
. . . specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party
seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer or
production.”  (C.C.P. §2025.480(a).)
“[E]vidence is ‘relevant’ if it might reasonably
assist a party in evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a
settlement.”  (Moore v. Mercer (2016)
4 Cal.App.5th 424, 447).  A party is
entitled to discover “any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action.”  (C.C.P. §2017.010.)  The phrase “subject matter” is broader than
relevancy to the issues (which determines admissibility of evidence at trial).  (Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1392.)  Courts have uniformly held that, for discovery
purposes, information should be regarded as “relevant” to the subject matter if
it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial,
or facilitating settlement.  (Stewart
v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1013.)
A motion to compel further responses to interrogatories
lies where the party to whom the discovery responses are directed gives
responses that the propounding party deems incomplete or evasive.  (C.C.P. §§2030.300(a)(1)-(3).) Providing incomplete
or evasive discovery responses constitutes a misuse of the discovery process
for which the court may impose sanctions.  (C.C.P. §§2030.300(d), 2023.030(a).)
Plaintiff inserts boilerplate objections into all of
his responses to the entire set of discovery. 
Boilerplate objections are inappropriate and grounds for sanctions.  (Korea Data Systems Co. v. Superior Court
(1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1517.)  Here,
Plaintiff copied and pasted, verbatim, the same paragraph of objections
throughout all of his responses.  For
example, SROG No. 3 seeks information regarding the last date Plaintiff lived
at the Subject Property.  Plaintiff
raises the following boilerplate objections: “Objection; this request violates
the attorney-client and or attorney work product privileges and judicial
doctrines…” and “Objection; this request is so overbroad as to constitute
oppression.”  These objections are
inappropriate. The work product privilege would only protect writings, which
are not called for here.  (In re
Jeanette H. (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 25, 32 [stating attorney work product applies
to material compiled by an attorney in preparation of his or her case].)  Further, an attorney-client privilege
objection is similarly misplaced as it does not call for a communication
between an attorney and client.
Each of Plaintiff’s responses contains the
following: “Objection; the requested inspection request is not described with
specificity.”  For example, SROG No. 9,
asks the Plaintiff to state the lease period for each residential lease he
entered into at the Property. This objection is obviously misplaced as the SROGs
are not inspection requests. These same objections are inserted into all of
Plaintiff’s responses. Accordingly, Plaintiff is ordered to submit further responses
following the present motion without the cut and paste boilerplate objections.
Plaintiff failed to serve code-compliant responses
to several SROGs; the majority of Plaintiff’s responses contain extensive
paragraphs of non-responsive information that either does not address the
specific SROG, contains the same conclusory statements alleged in the first amended
complaint (“FAC”) or is directed in response to all Defendants instead of
responding concerning information related to FPI.  Pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.220(a), each answer
to an interrogatory must be as complete and straightforward as the information
reasonably permits. False and evasive answers are improper.  (C.C.P. §2031.210(f).)
Where the question is specific and explicit, an
answer that supplies only a portion of the information sought is improper. It
is also improper to provide “deftly worded conclusory answers designed to evade
a series of explicit questions.”  (Deyo
v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783.)  Plaintiff’s responses to SROG Nos. 18, 28, 29,
32, 38, 43, 52, 55, 64, 73, 79, 85, 88, and 100 fall short of these
requirements.  Accordingly, Plaintiff is
ordered to provide responsive answers to SROG Nos. 18, 28, 29, 32, 38, 43, 52,
55, 64, 73, 79, 85, 88, and 100.
Furthermore, Plaintiff failed to provide a factual
response to SROG Nos. 29, 32, 52, 85, and 88, which seek information related
specifically to interactions, notice, and actions/inactions of FPI.  Plaintiff’s responses to these SROGs failed to
provide factual responses at all, and instead provided a generic response
concerning “Defendants” collectively. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff is ordered to provide responsive answers to SROG
Nos. 29, 32, 52, 85, and 88.
Accordingly, Plaintiff is ordered to provide
substantive, responsive answers without boilerplate objections to SROG Nos. 18,
28, 29, 32, 38, 43, 52, 55, 64, 73, 79, 85, 88, and 100.
 
Sanctions
Pursuant to C.C.P. § 2030.300(d), monetary sanctions
“shall” be awarded
when a party files a motion to compel further
responses, unless the Court finds, “the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the
sanction unjust.” 
          Defendant
requests sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $2,194.25.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶9.)  Defendant’s counsel declares her billable
rate on this file is $335.00 per hour, and associate Mustafa Karim’s rate is
$215.00.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶9.)  Defendant’s counsel declares she spent 8.8
hours preparing and reviewing this motion and a second motion for Larisha
Perkins, and Mustafa Karim spent 6.7 hours preparing the separate statement in
support of this motion and the separate statement in support of the motion for Larisha
Perkins.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶9.)  Defendant’s counsel declares that because the
motions were all quite similar, and much of the work duplicative, she divided
the total cost to prepare the motions in half and attributed that amount to each
motion.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶9.)  Defendant’s counsel declares she estimates an
additional 2.5 hours to review any opposition, review legal authority therein,
prepare a reply, and appear at the hearing. 
(Decl. of Eaton ¶10.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel declares the total cost to prepare the present motion to compel against
Plaintiff to $3,031.75, representative of $2,194.25 (cost to prepare the
motion) plus $837.50 in additional cost to file reply brief and appear at the
hearing.  (Decl. of Eaton ¶11.)
          Defendant’s
request for sanctions against Plaintiff is granted in the amount of $3,031.75.  Sanctions are payable by Plaintiff within 20
days.
Plaintiff also requests sanctions against Defendant
and its counsel of record. Here, Plaintiff failed to respond to any of FPI’s
meet and confer efforts.  Plaintiff
provides no declaration that he made a good faith effort to meet and confer
with Defendant’s counsel.  In light of
the Court’s ruling on the motion, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied.
 
Conclusion
          Defendant’s
motion to compel further answers to SROG Nos. 18, 28, 29, 32, 38, 43, 52, 55,
64, 73, 79, 85, 88, and 100 from Plaintiff Sampson is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to produce
Code-compliant responses without boilerplate objections within 20 days.
          Defendant’s
request for sanctions against Plaintiff Sampson is granted in the amount of $3,031.75.  Sanctions are payable by Plaintiff within 20
days.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
