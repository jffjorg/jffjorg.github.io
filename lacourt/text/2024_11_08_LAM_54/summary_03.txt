And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a demurrer to a complaint filed by plaintiff Idan Castiel against defendants Philly Auto, Inc. and Alexander Landa. The demurrer was filed by defendant Landa, who argued that he, as an individual, cannot be held liable for retaliation, wrongful termination, or wage and hour claims. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to show that Landa controlled Philly Auto and acted as Castiel's employer. As a result, the judge has ordered Landa to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling. The judge has also instructed the parties to notify each other of any intent to submit on the tentative ruling.
