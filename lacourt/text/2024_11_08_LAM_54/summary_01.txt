And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is that the Motion to Vacate Arbitration and Reinstate Action filed by Plaintiffs Derrick R. Upchurch and Sari M. Upchurch is DENIED. The motion was filed against Defendant Nathalie Dougé on the grounds that she failed to timely pay an arbitration invoice. Defendant's counsel claimed that the invoice was not received on September 3, 2024, due to a "system wide 'parameter error'" and was not received until September 24, 2024. The court was not persuaded that Defendant had violated CCP § 1281.98(a), which requires payment of fees and costs during the pendency of an arbitration proceeding. Defendant's counsel sent payment to AAA before the October 4, 2024 deadline, and the court ruled that the motion was denied.
