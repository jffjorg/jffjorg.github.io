 Hearing Date:  July 18, 2024



 

Plaintiff
Bear Valley 2005, LLC’s motion for leave to amend its First Amended Complaint
is granted.  Plaintiff may file the
proposed Second Amended Complaint with the Court.
 
Plaintiff Bear Valley 2005, LLC, (“Bear Valley”)
(“Plaintiff”) moves for leave to amend its first amended complaint (“FAC”) and
file a second amended complaint (“SAC”) to set forth a single additional
affirmative defense based on failure of condition precedent.  (Notice of Motion Amend, pgs. 1-2.)
 
Background
Plaintiff filed its initial complaint
(“Complaint”) in this action on July 6, 2021. 
Plaintiff filed the operative FAC on February 23, 2023, against
Defendant Mechanics Bank (“Mechanics Bank”) (“Defendant”) alleging three causes
of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) fraud; and (3) negligent
misrepresentation.
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on June 3,
2024.  Defendant filed its opposition on
July 5, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its reply
on July 11, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
Courts have a liberal policy in favor of
permitting amendments.  (Mabie v.
Hyatt (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 581, 596.)  The policy favoring amendments is so strong
that denial of a request for leave to amend is rarely justified.  (Id.)  Requests for leave to amend will normally only
be denied where the moving party has been dilatory in seeking leave to amend
and where the delay in bringing the motion has resulted in prejudice to the
opposing party.  (Hirsa v. Superior
Court (1981) 118
Cal.App.3d 486, 490.)  A mere showing of unreasonable delay by the
moving party without any showing of resulting prejudice to the opposing party
is an insufficient ground to justify denial of a motion.  (Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565.)
The form and content of a notice of motion for
leave to amend are governed by the rules governing motions generally. (C.C.P.
§1010.)  The motion must include a copy
of the proposed amendment (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(1)), and identify by page,
paragraph, and line number any additions to and deletions from the prior
pleading (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(2), (3)). 
 
          Discussion
          Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to amend its FAC and file the proposed SAC is granted.  Plaintiff’s motion substantially complies with CRC
Rule 3.1324(a).  The motion includes a copy of the proposed SAC.  (Decl.
of Carvalho ¶2, Exh. 2.)   Plaintiff’s motion sets forth the new allegation
proposed to be added to the breach of contract cause of action, but does not
state where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the proposed
additions/deletions are located.  (Motion, pg. 7; CRC Rule 3.1324(a)(3).) 
However, Plaintiff attached a redlined copy of the proposed SAC indicating
where the proposed additions will be added to the pleading.  (See Decl. of Carvalho, Exh. 1.)
Plaintiff’s motion substantially complies with CRC
Rule 3.1324(b).  Plaintiff’s counsel
submitted a separate declaration that specifies the effect of the amendment and
explains why the amendment is necessary and proper.  (Decl. of Carvalho ¶¶3-4.) 
Plaintiff asserts the amendment is necessary because it will allow the claim to
be properly stated and to address the affirmative defense of failure to satisfy
condition precedent first alleged by Defendant in its amended answer filed
March 21, 2024.  (Decl. of Carvalho ¶4.)
Plaintiff’s counsel states when the facts giving
rise to the amendment was discovered and why the request for amendment was not
made earlier; Plaintiff’s counsel declares, “The facts are not new. Mechanics
Bank is not surprised, nor will it be prejudiced[] by the proposed amendment.
Plaintiff set forth the facts underlying the new allegation in its response to Mechanics
Bank’s original motion for summary judgment. A portion of the argument with
reference to the evidence was made at page 9 of Plaintiff’s February 9, 2023
memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to Defendant’s first Motion
for Summary Judgment.”  (Decl. of Carvalho
¶5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares, Defendant has been aware since no
later than May of 2022 of the facts supporting and the nature of the allegation
that it prevented or excused Plaintiff from satisfying the contractual condition
and thereby anticipatorily breach the agreement prior to the time Plaintiff was
to have performed the condition. It will not suffer prejudice as a result of
the proposed amendment.”  (Decl. of
Carvalho ¶7.)
Defendant has not demonstrated that it will suffer
any prejudice from the proposed amendment; Defendant’s opposition does not
submit a declaration from Defendant or its counsel identifying such prejudice
(i.e. statement of hours spent that would now be wasted, surprise at the
allegations, need the revamp its entire defense, conduct additional discovery,
hire new experts, etc.).
Further, Defendant’s argument that Plaintiff’s
amendment is futile is unavailing. 
Defendant’s opposition essentially asks this Court to consider the validity
of the proposed SAC, which is inappropriate at this juncture.  After leave to amend is granted, Defendant
will have the opportunity to attack the validity of the amended pleading.  (See Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048; Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 760 [“the better
course of action would have been to allow [plaintiff] to amend the complaint
and then let the parties test its legal sufficiency in other appropriate
proceedings”].)
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for
leave to amend its FAC and file the proposed SAC is granted.  
 
          Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to amend its FAC is granted. 
Plaintiff may separately file the proposed SAC with the Court.
          Moving Party to give notice.
