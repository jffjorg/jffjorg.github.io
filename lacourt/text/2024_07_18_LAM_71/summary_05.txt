And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's default judgment packet and sets a hearing to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned $250 for failing to enter the default judgment. The judge's concerns include the lack of an apartment unit number on the address for service, the failure to serve a statement of damages for punitive damages, and the lack of a signed cost memorandum on the CIV-100 form. The judge also notes that the complaint does not specify the damages claimed, and that the request for court judgment does not properly seek an amount equal to or less than the amount sought in the prayer of the complaint. The judge is concerned that the plaintiff has failed to comply with procedural rules and lacks evidence to support the damages claimed.
