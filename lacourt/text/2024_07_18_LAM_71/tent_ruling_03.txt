1.    
Motion to Compel Compliance- Harbor UCLA
Service
CRC Rule 3.1346 provides, “[a] written notice and all moving papers
supporting a motion to compel an answer to a deposition question or to compel
production of a document or tangible thing from a nonparty deponent must be
personally served on the nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent
agrees to accept service by mail or electronic service at an address or
electronic service address specified on the deposition record.”  (CRC, Rule 3.1346, emphasis added.)
Wirshing’s proof of service on Harbor UCLA indicates
Harbor UCLA was served with the instant motion by U.S. Mail on June 13,
2024.  Wirshing’s method of service of
the instant motion on Harbor UCLA is in violation of CRC Rule 3.1346 because
the motion was not personally served on Harbor UCLA.
The Court continues the hearing on Wirshing’s motion
to August 9, 2024, at 8:30 am, and directs Wirshing to
effect proper service of the instant motion on Harbor UCLA.

 
2.     Motion
to Compel Compliance- Las Encinas

Service
CRC
Rule 3.1346 provides, “[a] written notice and all moving papers supporting a
motion to compel an answer to a deposition question or to compel production of
a document or tangible thing from a nonparty deponent must be personally
served on the nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees to
accept service by mail or electronic service at an address or electronic
service address specified on the deposition record.”  (CRC, Rule 3.1346, emphasis added.)

Wirshing’s
proof of service on Las Encinas indicates Las Encinas
was served with the instant motion by U.S. Mail on June 20, 2024.  Wirshing’s method of service of the instant
motion on Las Encinas is in violation of CRC Rule 3.1346 because the motion was
not personally served on Las Encinas.
The
Court continues the hearing on Wirshing’s motion to August 9, 2024, at 8:30 am,
and directs Wirshing to effect proper service of the instant motion on Las
Encinas.
 
3.    
Motion to Compel Compliance- LAFD
Service
CRC
Rule 3.1346 provides, “[a] written notice and all moving papers supporting a
motion to compel an answer to a deposition question or to compel production of
a document or tangible thing from a nonparty deponent must be personally
served on the nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees to
accept service by mail or electronic service at an address or electronic
service address specified on the deposition record.”  (CRC, Rule 3.1346,
emphasis added.)
Wirshing’s
proof of service on LAFD indicates LAFD was served with the instant motion via
messenger service on June 14, 2024, and is therefore proper under CRC, Rule
3.1346.
 
Background
          This matter arises out of Decedent’s
death by suicide and Plaintiffs’ allegation that Defendants should have
prevented Decedent’s death.  Plaintiff’s
Complaint identified LAFD as having provided information sufficient to make
Defendant aware of Decedent’s condition at the time of his hospital admission
that preceded his death.  (See
Decl. of Pruett ¶3, Exh. 1.)  
Wirshing
issued a subpoena to the custodian of records for LAFD on January 17, 2024.  (Decl. of Pruett ¶4, Exh. 2.)   The
subpoena was served to the custodian of records for LAFD at 200 North Main
Street, #1620, Los Angeles, CA 90012.  (Decl.
of Pruett ¶4, Exh. 2.)   To date, LAFD has failed to respond.  (Decl. of Pruett ¶¶4-5, Exhs. 3-4.)
The
subpoena requested the following documents regardless of date: 
All dispatch and response logs,
treatment, medical and billing records, and any other records or logs,
including but not limited to any records/documents that may be stored digitally
and/or electronically, all detailed screen shots within any computer system,
electronic records, purged records, all electronic correspondence affecting or
relating to Le’Wayne Wright AKA: Le’Wayne A. Wright, Le’Wayne Anthony Wright, DOB:
4/11/1994, ss#: xxx-xx-0381. Patient was transported and treated November
23/24, 2020 to Exodus Recovery, Inc. Urgent Care Center located in East Los Angeles.
 
(Decl.
of Pruett ¶4, Exh. 2.)
          The subject subpoena was properly
issued by attorneys for Defendant, as permitted under C.C.P. §2020.210(b):
“Instead of a court-issued deposition subpoena, an attorney of record for any
party may sign and issue a deposition subpoena.”  Subpoenas may be used to compel a California
nonparty’s production of documents.  (C.C.P.
§§2020.010(a)(3), 2025.280(b); Terry v. SLICO (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th
352, 357.)  A deposition subpoena may
require a witness to produce records for copying.  (C.C.P. §2020.510.)
          C.C.P. §56.10 provides: “A provider of
health care, a health care service plan, or a contractor shall disclose medical
information if the disclosure is compelled by any of the following: [¶] (1) A
court order. . .. [¶] (3) A party to a proceeding before a court or administrative
agency pursuant to a subpoena, subpoena duces tecum, notice to appear served pursuant
to Section 1987 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or any provision authorizing
discovery in a proceeding before a court.” 
(C.C.P. §56.10.)
C.C.P.
§56.05(j) defines “‘Medical Information’ means any individually identifiable
information, in electronic or physical form, in possession of or derived from a
provider of health care, health care service plan, pharmaceutical company, or
contractor regarding a patient’s medical history, mental health application
information, reproductive or sexual health application information, mental or
physical condition,
or treatment. ‘Individually identifiable’ means that the medical
information includes or contains any element of personal identifying information
sufficient to allow identification of the individual, such as the patient's
name, address, electronic mail address, telephone number, or social security
number, or other information that, alone or in combination with other publicly
available information, reveals the identity of the individual.”  (C.C.P. §56.05(j), emphasis added.)
The
subpoenaing party may seek a court order mandating the non-party’s compliance
with the subpoena.  (C.C.P. §2025.480; Unzipped
Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 123, 132-133.)  Additionally, C.C.P. §1987.1 provides, in
relevant part, “if a subpoena requires the . . . production of books,
documents, electronically stored information, or other things before a court .
. . or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by
any person described in subdivision (b) . . . may make an order . . . directing
compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare.”  (C.C.P. §1987.1.)
Here,
LAFD has not objected or responded to Wirshing’s subpoena.  Plaintiffs have not asserted any objections
to the subject subpoena.  Defendant has exhausted
all legal avenues to obtain the requested records from LAFD and Plaintiffs have
failed to cooperate or provide a valid legal basis for withholding the records
by not responding to Wirshing’s requests for a signed authorization form to authorize
LAFD to release the dispatch records concerning Decedent’s mental health.
Although
medical and mental health information is generally privileged, the privilege
gives way when the medical or mental health issues are presented as the issues
in litigation, as here.  Wirshing’s
subpoena seeks records pertaining to the Decedent’s mental state and health attributed
to the incident giving rise to the lawsuit.  Litigation seeks to ascertain the truth and
this discovery is needed to pursue the truth relative to the nature of the
decedent’s mental illness that ultimately led to his suicide. Therefore, such
records are well within the scope of permissible discovery.  (C.C.P. §2017.010.)
 
Conclusion
Wirshing’s
unopposed motion to compel LAFD to comply with Defendant’s Deposition
Subpoena for Production of Business Records is granted.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.
