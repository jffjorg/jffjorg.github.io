PAOLA MELGAR,  
  
         vs.
 
EAST LA AUTO
  SALES, INC.


 Case No.: 
  24STCV08590
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  July 18, 2024



 
Cross-Defendant
Paola Melgar’s demurrer to Cross-Complainant East LA Auto Sales, Inc.’s cross-complaint
is sustained.
 
          Cross-Defendant
Paola Melgar (“Melgar”) (“Cross-Defendant”) demurs to Cross-Complainant East LA
Auto Sales, Inc.’s (“East LA”) (“Cross-Complainant”) cross-complaint (“CC”) on
the following grounds: (1) the 1st cause of action for breach of contract does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action; and (2) the 2nd cause of action for negligence does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 1.)
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the
moving party must meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who
filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the
objections to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41, emphasis added.) 
Cross-Defendant’s counsel declares
that at least five days before the date the responsive pleading date was due to
be filed, he met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading, and they
did not reach an agreement resolving the matters raised in the demurrer.  (See Decl. of Rose ¶2a.)  Cross-Defendant’s counsel’s declaration is insufficient
under C.C.P. §430.41 because his declaration does not state that the parties
met and conferred in person, by telephone, or by video conference.  However, the failure to sufficiently meet and
confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(4); Dumas v. Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355; Olson v.
Hornbrook Community Services District (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 502, 515.)  Accordingly, the Court will consider Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer.
 
          Background
          Cross-Complainant
filed the operative CC on May 8, 2024, against Cross-Defendant alleging two
causes of action: (1) breach of contract; and (2) negligence.  Cross-Complainant’s causes of action arise
from its entry into a Retail Installment Sale Contract (“Contract”) with
Cross-Defendant on August 16, 2022, in which Cross-Complainant agreed to
purchase a used 2009 BMW (“Subject Vehicle”). 
(See CC ¶5.)
          Cross-Defendant
filed the instant demurrer on June 10, 2024. 
Cross-Complainant filed its opposition on July 3, 2024, and filed a
second opposition on July 5, 2024.  Cross-Defendant
filed her reply on July 8, 2024.
 
Summary of
Demurrer
Cross-Defendant
demurs to the 1st and 2nd causes of action on the basis the claims fail to
state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action.  (Demurrer, pg. 3.)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State
a Claim
Breach of
Contract (1st COA)
“To prevail on a cause
of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract,
(2) plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) resulting damage to the plaintiff.” (Richman v.
Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)
Cross-Complainant
alleges on August 16, 2022, Cross-Defendant entered into the Contract with Cross-Complainant
in which Cross-Defendant agreed to purchase the Subject Vehicle from Cross-Defendant.  (CC ¶5, Exh. A.)  Cross-Complainant alleges it performed all of
its obligations under the Contract.  (CC
¶6.)  Cross-Complainant
alleges in ¶2, §2 of the Contract, Cross-Defendant agreed not to expose the
Subject Vehicle to “misuse.”  (CC ¶7.)  Cross-Complainant alleges on or about October
2022, Cross-Defendant poured coolant into the Subject Vehicle’s engine, causing
damage to the Subject Vehicle.  (CC
¶8.)  Cross-Complainant alleges it
suffered harm and damages as a result of Cross-Defendant’s conduct.  (CC ¶9.)
Nonetheless, Cross-Complainant
does not sufficiently how Cross-Defendant’s pouring coolant into the Subject
Vehicle constitutes a breach of the Contract, nor how Cross-Complainant
suffered any affirmative damages thereby. 
Accordingly, Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer to Cross-Complainant’s 1st cause of action is sustained with 20
days leave to amend.
 
          Negligence (2nd COA)
“The elements of
a cause of action for negligence are well established. They are (a) a legal
duty to use due care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; [and] (c) the breach as
the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.”  (Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12
Cal.4th 913, 917, internal quotations omitted.)
“The first
element, duty, ‘may be imposed by law, be assumed by the defendant, or exist by
virtue of a special relationship.’”  (Doe
v. United States Youth Soccer Association, Inc. (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 1118,
1128 [214 Cal.Rptr.3d 552].)
“[T]he existence
of a duty is a question of law for the court.”  (Kentucky Fried Chicken of California v.
Superior Court (1997) 14 Cal.4th 814, 819.)
Cross-Complainant
alleges Cross-Defendant owed Cross-Complainant a duty of care not to
subject the Subject Vehicle to misuse.  (CC ¶15.) 
Cross-Complainant alleges in October 2022, Cross-Defendant breached the
duty of care owed to Cross-Complainant by pouring coolant into the Subject
Vehicle’s engine, causing damage to the Subject Vehicle, causing harm to
Cross-Complainant.  (CC ¶16.)  Cross-Complainant alleges Cross-Defendant’s
conduct was the proximate cause and cause in fact in causing harm and damages to
Cross-Complainant.  (CC ¶17.)  Cross-Complainant alleges as a result of
Cross-Defendant’s breach, Cross-Complainant sustained general and specific
damages in an amount to be determined at trial. 
(CC ¶18.)
Cross-Complainant
fails to allege a legal duty owed by Cross-Defendant to Cross-Complainant.  Specifically, Cross-Complainant fails to
allege a legally cognizable duty a buyer owes to a seller to not subject the
Subject Vehicle to misuse.
Accordingly, Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer to Cross-Complainant’s 2nd cause of action is sustained with 20
days leave to amend.
 
          Conclusion
The Court
observes that absent allegations of affirmative damages, the causes of action
pled in the Cross-Complaint appear more appropriately pled as affirmative
defenses.  Cross-Defendant’s demurrer to Cross-Complainant
is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
Moving Party to
