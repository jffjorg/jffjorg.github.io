ANGELENO
  HOMES, LLC,  
  
         vs.
 
GERALD
  G. HILL, et al.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV23617
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  July 18, 2024



 
The Court
denies Plaintiff’s default judgment packet. 

The Court sets a hearing on an order to show cause why the complaint
should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s counsel sanctioned $250 for failing
to enter default judgment (California Rule of Court, rule 3.110(h)) on September
18, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse for the
following reasons:

1.     The
address for service currently does not reflect the apartment unit number that
appears on a public records search for the defaulted defendant.  The address should be for 800 W 110th Street
Apt. 108, Los Angeles, CA 90044.
 
2.     Complaint
seeks punitive damages, but no statement of damages was served by personal
service on Defendant. 
 
3.     No
signed cost memorandum on the back of the CIV-100 form for Court Judgment.
 
4.     No
JUD-100 submitted to the Court.
 
5.     No
foundation for the documents submitted to the Court, only a request to take
judicial notice.
 
6.     No
interest calculation provided to the Court, nor is there an indication on the
CIV-100 request for Court judgment that interest is sought.  However, the proposed judgment indicates that
interest is sought.
 
7.     The
Complaint does not specify the damages claimed? 
Punitive damages are sought, did the plaintiff personally serve the requisite
statement of damages or notice of punitive damages (C.C.P. §425.11(c) and
425.115)? If Plaintiff seeks punitive damages, is there evidence of the
defendant’s wealth? An award of punitive damages requires evidence as to the
defendant’s wealth. (Devlin v. Kearny
Mesa AMC (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 390; Adams v. Murakami (1991) 54 Cal.3d 105, 118.)
 
8.    
The request for court judgment does not
properly seek an amount that is equal to or less than the amount sought in the prayer
of the complaint or C.C.P. §425.11 statement of damages.  (See, e.g., Falahati v.
Kondo (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 823, 830-831 [stating court
acts in excess of its jurisdiction and the resulting default judgment is void
if the court awards default judgment in an amount greater than that demanded in
the complaint, including if the complaint does not specify the amount demanded]).
 
9.     No
declaration submitted by witness with percipient knowledge and with sufficient
foundation to support the damages sought.
