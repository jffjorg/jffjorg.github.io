And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Bear Valley 2005, LLC's motion for leave to amend its First Amended Complaint to add a single additional affirmative defense based on failure of condition precedent. The motion is granted because it substantially complies with the rules governing motions generally, and the defendant has not demonstrated that it will be prejudiced by the proposed amendment. The judge notes that the defendant's opposition does not submit a declaration identifying any prejudice that would result from the proposed amendment. The judge also rejects the defendant's argument that the proposed amendment is futile, stating that the defendant will have the opportunity to attack the validity of the amended pleading after leave to amend is granted.
