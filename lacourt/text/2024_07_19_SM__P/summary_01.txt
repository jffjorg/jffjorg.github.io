English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge in the case of Utica Leaseco, LLC v. Hicks, et al., Case No. 22SMCV02025. The defendants, including Benson and Hicks, have moved to set aside the default and default judgments against them, arguing that they were never served with the summons and complaint. The judge has considered the evidence presented and has made the following rulings:

* The default judgments against Apex Solutions, Inc. are void and are set aside.
* The motion to quash service of summons by Benson and Hicks is denied as moot, since all defendants were served with the complaint.
* The motion to quash service of summons by Apex Solutions, Inc. is granted, since the service was not proper.
* The court finds that the defendants rebutted the presumption of service and that Apex Solutions, Inc. is not effectively served.

The judge notes that the plaintiff did not resubmit documents as required and that the defendants were substitute served at 12130 Millenium Drive.
