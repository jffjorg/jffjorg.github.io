And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge on a motion for summary adjudication in a case involving a condominium unit owner, Steiger, and the Nine Eighteen Twenty-First Street Homeowners Association. Steiger alleges that the HOA improperly restricted his ability to renovate his unit by installing hardwood floors and a washer/dryer. He moved for summary adjudication on three issues of duty owed by the HOA. The judge granted summary adjudication on the first two issues of duty, which concern the HOA's duty to provide a fair, reasonable, and expeditious procedure for approval and to decide in good faith and in a manner that is not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. However, the judge denied summary adjudication on the third issue of duty, which concerns the HOA's duty to exercise due care in processing Steiger's request or application to install hardwood floors and a washer/dryer. The judge found that whether the HOA had a duty to process such requests and applications is a triable issue of material fact.
