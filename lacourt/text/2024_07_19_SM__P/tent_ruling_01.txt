Utica Leaseco, LLC
v. Hicks, et al., Case No. 22SMCV02025
Hearing Date: July

1.     
Specially Appearing Defendants Benson and Hicks’
Motion to Vacate Default and/or Default Judgment, or in the Alternative to
Quash Service
2.     
Specially Appearing Defendant Apex Solution, Inc.’s
Motion to Vacate Default and/or Default Judgment, or in the Alternative to
Quash Service
3.     
Specially Appearing Defendants Benson and Apex
Solutions, Inc.’s Motion to Quash 
 
Plaintiff Utica sues
Apex Solutions, Benson and Hicks for breach of a lease agreement. Defendants specially
appear to move to set aside and vacate the default and default judgments
against them, arguing they were never served with the summons and complaint. 
 
On July 6, 2023
the court clerk entered default as requested on 1/10/2023 and 2/7/2023 against
all defendants for $289,555.70. On August 28, 2023 the court clerk entered
default as requested on 7/6/2023 against all defendants for $289,555.70. On February 9, 2024, the court previously presiding
over this case denied the default judgment electronically submitted on July 6,
2023 and stated: “Without prejudice. The court needs to better understand the
legal fees and the legal costs, which seems a bit like double counting. A clear,
concise declaration explaining the basis for each item of damages is needed.”
2/9/24 Minute Order. The Minute Order stated “Filing party may resubmit all
documents with the above-listed information.” Plaintiff did not resubmit
documents but filed requests for entry of default against Apex and Benson on
May 30, 2024 and Hicks on June 4, 2024, which were rejected because the instant
motions were scheduled.
 
Benson and Hicks filed a motion to vacate
under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5 or, in the alternative, to quash
service of summons. Apex filed a motion to vacate under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473(d) or, in the alternative, to quash service of summons. 
 
Requests for
Judicial Notice
Both motions to
set aside request judicial notice of Apex’s Statement of Information filed with
the CA Secretary of State, Articles filed with the CA Secretary of State and
plaintiff’s proof of service dated November 28, 2022. These court takes notice
of these exhibits per Evidence Code §§452(d), (h). The court takes judicial
notice of the documents, but not the truth of their contents.
 
Benson and Hicks’
Motion to Set Aside under CCP §473.5
A court may set
aside a default or default judgment when service of summons has not provided a
party with actual notice. Code Civ. Proc. §473.5. “When a defendant challenges
the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process
‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by
proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.’” Summers
v. McClanahan¿(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413. A proof of service filed by
a plaintiff including the declaration of a registered process server gives rise
to a presumption of the facts stated therein, requiring defendant to produce
evidence of non-service. American Exp. Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 383, 390.
 
On January 3, 2023
plaintiff filed proofs of service by registered process server I. Anis with
declarations of diligence regarding substitute service. See Hicks POS filed
01/03/2023; see also Benson POS filed 01/03/2023. This establishes a
presumption of valid service under Evid. Code §647. The burden shifts to
defendants to prove they were not served.
 
Both defendants were substitute served at
12130 Millenium Drive in Playa Vista, a WeWork co-working space. Defendants
state they have never had any connection with that address. Benson Decl. ¶3(c);
Hicks Decl. ¶3(a). Benson used a WeWork space on Jefferson but ended that tenancy
in 2020. See Benson Decl. ¶3(b).
Defendants attest they did not live or work at any address listed in the
declaration of diligence.
 
Plaintiff admits defendants are entitled
to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, but argues they failed
to file a proposed responsive pleading. Plaintiff contends defendants were
served, citing a hearsay statement from the Jefferson WeWork receptionist that
defendants were “not here,” not that they no longer leased space. Plaintiff’s
investigator obtained addresses for defendants and served them in January 2024.
However, service in January 2024 is irrelevant to whether service was properly
effectuated at the Millenium address. Plaintiff presents no evidence defendants
ever used the Millenium address or that service at that location would be valid.
Defendants establish the substitute service did not constitute actual notice, but
the motion cannot be granted until they comply with section 473.5(b) by filing
a proposed responsive pleading.
 
Apex’s Motion to
Set Aside Default Judgment under CCP §473(d)
The court may, upon motion of either party
after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order. Code of
Civil Proc. §473(d). Apex moves to set aside the default judgment for invalid
service of summons. No opposition was filed. For the reasons stated above, the
default judgment void and is set aside. GRANTED.
 
Alternative Motions to Quash Service by (1)
Benson and Hicks and (2) Apex
Defendants’ alternative
motions to quash service of summons is DENIED as MOOT. All defendants were served
with the complaint. Schiern Decl. ¶¶2-6. This renders the motion to quash MOOT.
See Code Civ. Proc. §418.10(3)(a).
 
Apex’s Motion to
Quash
“A defendant, on or
before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that
the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for
one or more of the following purposes: To quash service of summons on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.” Code Civ. Proc.
§418.10(a)(1).
 
On April 24, 2024 plaintiff filed POS on Apex by
substitute service on April 14, 2024 upon “‘JOHN DOE’ BENSON (DECLINED FULL NAME), OCCUPANT/PERSON IN CHARGE
Description: CAUCASIAN, Male, 50+ yrs old, 6 ' 0" tall, 180 lbs., BLACK
hair[.]” at 535 Avenue C, #B, Redondo Beach by registered process server
Martinez. See Apex POS filed 04/24/2024. Plaintiff’s POS creates a rebuttable
presumption of proper service. The burden shifts to defendant to rebut the
presumption.
 
Effecting
service on a corporation requires
delivery of summons and complaint to some person on behalf of the corporation. Code Civ. Proc. §416.10; Dill v. Berquist Const. Co.,
Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1437. When the defendant is a corporation, the “person
to be served” is one of the individuals specified in section 416.10 as agent
for service of process. 
 
Defendant Benson is agent for service of
process for Apex. Benson Decl. ¶1.
But he denies having been served been served or being at the location of
alleged service on the date and time specified. He is the only male occupant in his dwelling. Benson Decl. ¶3.
Benson is not 6 feet tall, and his hair is not black, as stated in the POS. Benson
Decl. ¶5. Benson
was allegedly served at home, but the business address for Apex and for Benson
as agent for service of process is in Oakland. He did not receive any summons
and complaint in the mail. Benson Decl. ¶4.
 
In opposition, plaintiff argues Benson was
properly served because the proof of service created a rebuttable presumption,
and Apex is a suspended corporation that cannot defend itself. 
 
California law prohibits a suspended
corporation from appearing to defend itself. Rev. & Tax. Code §23302. Reed
v. Norman (1957) 48 Cal.2nd 338, 343. The fact that Apex is a suspended
corporation does not affect adequacy of service. Under California law, a
plaintiff may affect service of process on a suspended corporation under the
regular service of process statutes. See Grell v. Laci Lea Beau Corp.,
73 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1306 (1999). If Apex is not effectively served, the court does
not have jurisdiction, regardless of whether it is suspended.
 
The Martinez POS creates a rebuttable
presumption of service; he states he attempted service at the Redondo Beach
residence on April 5, 7, 9, and 13, and a man opened the door on April 14,
identifying himself as Benson. Martinez Decl. ¶¶3-5. Martinez mailed copies of the summons and complaint to that
address, which was not returned. Martinez Decl. ¶5. 
 
However, in light of Benson’s declaration
and denial of service, and the inconsistencies between the POS and Benson’s
declarations, the court finds defendant rebutted the presumption of service. GRANTED.
