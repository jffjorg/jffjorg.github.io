The judge concludes that the motions are moot because Plaintiff CMI has now served verified responses to the discovery requests. The judge also finds that Plaintiff CMI is relieved from the waiver of its objections to the discovery requests. The judge denies Defendant Park's request for monetary sanctions because Plaintiff CMI acted diligently to serve responses once alerted to the lack of responses.
