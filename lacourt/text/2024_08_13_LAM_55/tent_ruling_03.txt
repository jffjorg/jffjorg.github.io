Janada Capital, LLC’s demurrer without motion to strike first amended
complaint. 
 
BACKGROUND
On 03/26/24,  ROBERT
M. ABER, and individual and TRUSTEE OF ROBERT M. ABER REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST
CREATED FEBRUAY 11, 2004 (“Plaintiff”) filed the operative First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) against PHH MORTGAGE CORPORATION, MORTGAGE ASSETS MANAGEMENT and other
defendants (“Defendants”) related to defendants allegedly enabling Plaintiff’s
estranged sons to fraudulently sell Plaintiff’s home, when they knew or should
have known of the fraud. 
The causes of action are:
1) Violations of Welfare & Institutions Code
§15600 et seq. (Elder Abuse);
2) Violations of Civil Code § 1798.93;
3) Violations of Civil Code § 2924.11;
4) Violations of Civil Code § 2924.17;
5) Violations of Civil Code § 3273.11; 
6) Violations of the Home Equity Sales Contract Act
(HESCA), Civil Code §1695;
7) Slander of Title;
8) Unfair Business Practices;
9) Violations of the Rosenthal Act;
10) Negligence;
11) Breach of Contract;
12) Breach of the Implied Covenant; 
13) Fraud;
14) Negligent Misrepresentation;
15) Intentional Interference with Contract;
16) Quiet Title; and 
17) Cancellation of Deed.
 
Defendant JANADA CAPITAL, LLC demurs to the Seventh
and Eighth causes of action on the grounds that (1) the FAC fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; (2) these causes of action
are uncertain; and (3) the FAC contains a defect or misjoinder of parties
within the meaning of CCP Section 430.10(d). 
Plaintiff opposes the demurrer.
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE 
Defendant JANADA CAPITAL, LLC requests judicial notice
of the Corporation Assignment of Deed of Trust recorded on August 7, 2023. 
Plaintiff requests judicial notice of this Court’s
July 8, 2024 ruling on Defendants PHH MORTGAGE CORPORATION and MORTGAGE ASSETS
MANAGEMENT, LLC’s Demurrer without Motion to Strike. 
A trial court errs in taking judicial notice of facts
contained in recorded documents, where they are in dispute. (Herrera v.
Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375 (addressing
recorded assignment of deed and substitution of trustee, and reversing summary
judgment where bank defendant failed to show it was a beneficiary under deed of
trust). 
“When judicial notice is taken of a document ... the
truthfulness and proper interpretation of the document are disputable.” (Aquila,
Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 569.)
The Court therefore denies Defendant JANADA CAPITAL,
LLC’s request for judicial notice of the Corporation Assignment of Deed of
Trust.
The Court grants Plaintiff’s request for judicial
notice of the Court’s July 8, 2024 Demurrer without Motion to Strike ruling
pursuant to Evidence Code Section 452(d). 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
“The primary function of a pleading is to give the
other party notice so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect in
a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect
substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th
203, 240.)¿
“A¿demurrer¿tests the legal sufficiency of the factual
allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2017) 9
Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The Court looks to whether “the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses a complete defense.” (Id.)
The Court does not “read passages from a complaint in isolation; in reviewing a
ruling on a demurrer, we read the complaint ‘as a whole and its parts in their
context.’ [Citation.]” (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th
780, 804.) The Court “assume[s] the truth of the properly pleaded factual
allegations, facts that reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded
and matters of which judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris, supra, 56
Cal.4th p. 240.) “The court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions,
deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare
(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)¿¿¿ 
¿A general demurrer may be brought under Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) if insufficient facts are stated to
support the cause of action asserted or under section 430.10, subdivision (a),
where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action
alleged in the pleading. All other grounds listed in Section 430.10, including
uncertainty under subdivision (f), are special demurrers. Special demurrers are
not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd.
(c).)¿¿¿ 
¿Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.)¿¿
 
 
Defect or Misjoinder of
Parties 
First, Defendant JANADA CAPITAL, LLC (hereinafter,
“JCL”) argues that it is not a proper party to the Seventh and Eighth causes of
action alleged in the FAC because it is no longer the owner of the loan in
question and is no longer in a position to do anything with respect to the deed
of trust allegedly recorded against the Property at issue in this matter. 
The FAC alleges that through a series of fraudulent
documents authorizing Alvin and Alan Hatchett to sell Plaintiff’s Property
located at 200 South Vista Street, Los Angeles, CA 90036 in early 2023, a
payoff demand was tendered to Defendant PHH Mortgage Corporation. (FAC ¶¶60-120,
370.) The FAC further alleges that Plaintiff repeatedly informed Defendant PHH
Mortgage Corporation that the parties who solicited the payoff demand were not
authorized to take any action on his loan. (FAC ¶371.) The FAC further alleges
that a Grant Deed was recorded on May 8, 2023, purporting to transfer title of
Plaintiff’s Property to Defendant Asur I, LLC and a Deed of Trust recorded,
naming JCL as the beneficiary. (FAC ¶¶372-373.) The FAC alleges that JCL’s
interest was then transferred to Defendant Emerald, LLC through a Corporation
Assignment of Deed to Trust. (FAC ¶374.)
In support of its arguments, JCL cites to Johnson
v. County of Fresno (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1087, which states “[o]nce a
claim has been assigned, the assignee is the owner and has the right to sue on
it.” (Johnson v. County of Fresno (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1087, 1096.) As
a result, “the assignor lacks standing to sue on the claim.” (Id.)
Although the FAC does allege that JCL’s interest in the Deed of Trust was
assigned to Defendant Emerald, LLC, the case law cited by JCL does not stand
for the proposition that an assignor cannot be held liable as a tortfeasor for
injuries resulting from a document or loan they owned due to assignment of that
loan or other document. In fact, the assignee in Johnson v. County of Fresno
merely sought indemnification on an assigned stipulated judgment, which is not
the case here. Similarly, Teater v. Good Hope Development Corp. (1942)
55 Cal.App.2d 459, is also inapposite in this instance because it was a
replevin action for mortgage fixtures wherein the Court held that a Lumber
Company was allowed to file a cross-complaint claiming ownership of the
mortgage fixtures based on an assignment of such claim. (Teater v. Good Hope
Development Corp. (1942) 55 Cal.App.2d 459, 462.) Finally, JCL cites to no
statutory authority that supports its contention either. 
Therefore, the demurrer is overruled on the ground of
defect or misjoinder. 
Seventh Cause of Action
for Slander of Title 
Next, JCL argues that the seventh cause of action
fails because there are no allegations which tie JCL to the alleged conspiracy,
or that it behaved in an improper or malicious manner, or did anything other
than lend money in its normal capacity as a lender. 
“To establish slander of title, a plaintiff must show:
‘(1) a publication, (2) which is without privilege or justification, (3) which
is false, and (4) which causes direct and immediate pecuniary loss.’” (Klem
v. Access Ins. Co. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 595, 612.) Slander
of title may also be “defined to be defamation of title to property, real or
personal, by one who falsely and maliciously disparages the title thereto, and
thereby causes the owner thereof some special pecuniary loss or damage.
(Citations.) Admittedly under this definition slander of title may be committed
by maliciously clouding the title to real property and causing damage to the
owner thereof by the execution, willful acceptance, and malicious recordation
of a deed which falsely declares the title of the property involved to be in a
person other than the true owner.” (Howard v. Schaniel (1980) 113
Cal.App.3d 256, 263.)
The FAC alleges that Defendants allowed a payoff
demand to be tendered to Defendant PHH Mortgage Corporation without
authorization by Plaintiff and despite notice that such demand was not
authorized by Plaintiff. (FAC ¶¶370-371.) The FAC alleges that a Grant Deed was
then recorded purporting to transfer title of Plaintiff’s Property to Defendant
Asur I, LLC. (Fac ¶372.) The FAC further alleges that a Deed of Trust was
recorded naming Defendant Asur I, LLC as a borrower and JCL as the beneficiary.
(FAC ¶373.) The FAC further alleges that the payoff demand, recordation of the
Grant Deed, Deed of Trust, and reconveyance of the Deed of Trust constituted
fraudulent impediments of Plaintiff’s title. (FAC ¶376.) The FAC further
alleges that recordation of the Grant Deed, Deed of Trust, and Full Reconveyance
directly impaired Plaintiff’s ability to remain the Property until his death,
access his reverse mortgage loan line of credit, sell the Property, or obtain
any secured loans on the Property. (FAC ¶380.) The FAC also alleges that JCL as
a beneficiary of the Deed of Trust slandered Plaintiff’s title by laying claim
to the Property despite knowing the fraudulent nature of the sale after being
informed of the fraud through an August 25, 2023 letter. (FAC ¶¶ 238, 413.)
However, the FAC fails to allege any facts supporting
JCL knew the sale and/or payoff demand were fraudulent prior to its recordation
of the Deed of Trust on May 8, 2023. As such, a reasonable jury could not infer
that JCL’s act of recording the Deed of Trust was done knowing JCL had no
privilege or justification for doing so. 
Therefore, the demurrer is sustained with leave to
amend as to the seventh cause of action for slander of title. 
Eighth Cause of Action
for Unfair Business Practices 
Lastly, JCL argues that the eighth cause of action
fails because there no facts indicating JCL acted unlawfully, unfairly, or
fraudulently with respect to Plaintiff. 
“To bring a UCL claim, a plaintiff must show either an
(1) ‘unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice,’ or (2) ‘unfair,
deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.’” (Adhav v. Midway Rent A Car,
Inc. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 954, 970.) A plaintiff alleging unfair business
practices under these statutes must state with reasonable particularity the
facts supporting the statutory elements of the violation.” (Khoury v. Maly's
of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 619.) “An ‘unlawful’ business
practice or act within the meaning of the UCL ‘is an act or practice, committed
pursuant to business activity, that is at the same time forbidden by law.’” (Bernardo
v. Planned Parenthood Federation of America (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 322,
351.)
The FAC alleges in a conclusory manner “the unlawful
acts and practices of Defendants alleged herein constitute unlawful, unfair or
fraudulent business practices within the meaning of Business and Professions
Code§ 17200.” (FAC ¶414.) The FAC also alleges that JCL slandered Plaintiff’s
title by laying claim to the Property under the Deed of Trust despite knowing
the fraudulent nature of the sale after receiving the August 25, 2023 letter
from Plaintiff detailing the purported fraud. (FAC ¶¶ 238, 413.)
As discussed above, the FAC fails to allege sufficient
facts supporting that JCL knew the sale and/or payoff demand were fraudulent
prior to its recordation of the Deed of Trust on May 8, 2023. Thus, a
reasonable jury could not infer from the face of the FAC that JCL acted
unlawfully, unfairly, or fraudulently towards Plaintiff in recording the Deed
of Trust. 
Therefore, the demurrer is sustained with leave to
amend as to the eight cause of action for unfair business practices.
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Defendant Janada Capital,
LLC’s demurrer without motion to strike first amended complaint is sustained
with leave to amend the seventh and eighth causes of action.
