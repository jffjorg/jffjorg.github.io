And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Sundae, Inc.'s, motion to compel arbitration. The court has found that the arbitration agreement exists and is enforceable. The plaintiff, Wendy Il' Grande, had argued that the agreement was procedurally unconscionable because it was an adhesion contract, but the court found that there was only a low degree of procedural unconscionability due to the unequal bargaining power between the parties. The court also found that the agreement was not substantively unconscionable despite some limitations on discovery and venue. As a result, the court has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stayed the action.
