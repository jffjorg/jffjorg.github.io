And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration against plaintiff Veronica Romero is granted. The Judge found that the arbitration agreement signed by Romero on August 20, 2021 covers all claims against the defendants, including those of harassment, gender discrimination, and retaliation. The Judge also found that the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA) does not apply to Romero's claims because they accrued before the Act's enactment in March 2022. The Judge noted that allowing Romero to litigate her claims against the defendants in court while simultaneously arbitrating the same claims against the co-defendants would likely result in prejudice to the defendants and inconsistent determinations. The Judge will sever the portion of the arbitration agreement relating to payment of initiation fees by Romero and the parties will be governed instead by applicable law.
