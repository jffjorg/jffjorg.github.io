Motion for Leave to Amend
Legal
Standard
California
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1) provides, in relevant
part: “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking
out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party,
or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time
for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice
to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”
“This
discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial
policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit.” (Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047 (Kittredge
Sports).) California courts will not ordinarily consider the validity of a
proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion for leave to amend given that
any grounds for a demurrer or a motion to strike will be premature at that
time. (See California Casualty General Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985)
173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280-281 (California Casualty), citations omitted, overruled
on other grounds by Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co.
(2000) 23 Cal.4th 390, 403-406; see also Kittredge Sports, supra,
213 Cal.App.3d at p. 1048 [Where “the proposed legal theory [at issue] is a
novel one, ‘the preferable practice would be to permit the amendment and allow
the parties to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on
the pleadings or other appropriate proceedings’”], quoting California
Casualty, supra, at p. 280.)
Under
California Rules of Court Rule, rule 3.1324, subdivision (a), a motion to amend
a pleading shall: (1) Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended
pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous
pleadings or amendments; (2) State what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph and line
number, the deleted allegations are located; and (3) State what allegations are
proposed to be added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, the additional allegations are located.
Under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivision (b), a separate declaration
must accompany the motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2)
Why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to
the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) The reasons why the request
for amendment was not made earlier.
However,
leave to amend may also be properly denied when “the insufficiency of the
proposed amendment is established by controlling precedent and … [can]not be
cured by further appropriate amendment.” (California Casualty, supra,
173 Cal.App.3d at pp. 280-281; see, e.g., Foxborough v. Van Atta (1994)
26 Cal.App.4th 217, 231 [not an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend when
“proposed amendment would have been futile because it was barred by the statute
of limitations” with no indication of relating back to the original
complaint].) 
Analysis
Here,
the motion for leave to amend satisfies California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324
subdivision (a)(1) by attaching a copy of the proposed FAC. (Mot. Parker Decl.,
Ex. A.) 
 The motion also satisfies California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324, subdivisions (a)(2)-(3) by explaining that in July 2024,
Defendants provided documents in response to a document production request, and
Plaintiff identified additional facts to support his claim. (Mot. Parker Decl.,
¶¶ 4-5.)
 Additionally, the motion satisfies California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivisions (b)(1)-(4) by providing the
information required by this rule. (Mot., Parker Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)
Therefore,
because Plaintiff has satisfied all the statutory requirements, the motion is
GRANTED. 
Conclusion

Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint for Damages is GRANTED.
