And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Demurrer and Motion to Strike filed by Defendant Jun I. Yoon. The judge has denied the Motion to Strike as to paragraphs 1-18 of the Third Amended Complaint, but granted it as to paragraphs 19-58. The judge has also overruled Yoon's Demurrer to the breach of contract claim, finding that the continuous accrual doctrine applies to the alleged overpayments made on or after February 17, 2018.

The judge has concluded that the breach of contract claim is not barred by the statute of limitations, and that 5007 Holdings has alleged facts sufficient to state a cause of action for the alleged overpayments made between February 17, 2018 and February 17, 2022.

The judge has ordered that the Demurrer and Motion to Strike be set for hearing, and that the parties be prepared to argue the issues before the court.
