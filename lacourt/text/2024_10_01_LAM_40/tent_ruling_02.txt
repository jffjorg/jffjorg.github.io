Defendants
  Demurrer and Motion to Strike the Third Amended Complaint [RES ID # 7820]
 



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff 5007 Holdings, LLC sues
Defendants Jun I. Yoon, an individual, and as Trustee of the Jun I. Yoon Trust
UDT August 15, 1994 (collectively, “Yoon”) and Does 1 to 10 pursuant to a February
7, 2024 Third Amended Complaint (TAC) alleging a single claims for Breach of
Contract. The claims arise from allegations that Plaintiff 5007 Holdings—a
successor-in-interest borrower on a loan made pursuant to a promissory note (as
amended) and deed of trust secured by real property owned by Plaintiff in
Marina Del Rey, California—was overcharged interest and late fee payments, as
well as attorney fees charged in relation to loan renegotiations with Defendant.

B. Relevant Procedural History
The original Complaint for this
action was filed on February 17, 2022, and based on the same general
allegations as the TAC but included additional claims for Misrepresentation and
Interference with Prospective Advantage.
On August 7, 2023, 5007 Holdings
filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) which did not include the Interference
with Prospective Advantage claim.
Yoon demurred to the SAC on the
grounds of sufficiency of the pleading. The Court overruled the demurrer as to
the first cause of action for Breach of Contract and sustained the demurrer,
with leave to amend, as to the second cause of action for Misrepresentation. (1/19/24
Minute Order.) 
C. Motion Before the Court
5007 Holdings filed the operative
TAC on February 7, 2024. 
On April 11, 2024, Yoon demurred to
the TAC on the grounds of sufficiency of the pleading because the claims are
barred by the statute of limitations. The same day,
Yoon filed a motion to strike the TAC on grounds that it is untimely, not drawn
in conformance with the Court’s January 19, 2024 Order, and is time-barred. 
On July 15, 2024, 5007 Holdings
opposed the demurrer and motion to strike. 
On July 18, 2024, Yoon replied. 
 
II. Motion to Strike
A. Meet and Confer
Yoon has met the motion to strike
meet and confer requirement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5
subdivision (a)(3)(B). (Knox, ¶ 2.) 
B. Legal Standard
The court may, upon a motion or at
any time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (a) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (b) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. §
436, subds. (a), (b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782
[“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].) 
For the purposes of a motion to
strike pursuant to Sections 435 to 437 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the term
“pleading” generally means a demurrer, answer, complaint, or cross-complaint,
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (a)), and an immaterial allegation or irrelevant
matter in a pleading entails (1) an allegation that is not essential to the
statement of a claim or defense, (2) an allegation that is neither pertinent to
nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense, or (3) a demand for
judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint or
cross-complaint (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3), (c)).
C. Analysis
Yoon moves to strike the TAC in its
entirety, or, in the alternative, portions thereof, on grounds that it is
untimely, not drawn in conformance with the Court’s January 19, 2024 Minute Order
ruling on the Demurrer to the SAC, and because it contains allegations that are
time-barred. The arguments are discussed in turn. 
First, in ruling on Yoon’s demurrer
to the SAC, the Court directed that 5007 Holdings may file an amended pleading
within fourteen days of the Order. (See 1/19/24 Minute Order.) 5007 Holdings
filed the TAC on February 7, 2024. Although the TAC was filed late, the Court
is empowered to permit this filing as to conform with justice. (See, e.g., Code
Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8).) The decision whether to dismiss a complaint
for failure to timely file an amended complaint is within the court’s
discretion. (Harding v. Collazo (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 1044, 1054.) Here,
the delay of 3 days is not sufficient for the court to grant such an extreme
remedy. (Compare, Harding, supra, 177 Cal.App.3d at p. 1052
[plaintiff delayed in filing second amended complaint for 60 days; dismissal
affirmed].) The Court denies the motion to strike to accord with public policy
to hear the case on the merits. “It has always been the policy of the courts in
California to resolve a dispute on the merits of the case rather than allowing
a dismissal on technicality.” (Harding, supra, 177 Cal.App.3d at
p. 1061 (dis. opn. of Lui, acting P.J.))
Second, Yoon moves to strike
paragraphs 16-104 of the TAC as improper new matter, unauthorized under, and
thus in violation of, the Court’s January 19, 2024 Order, because the Order
only gave 5007 Holdings leave to amend the second cause of action for misrepresentation.
Nevertheless, in the TAC, 5007 Holdings dropped the misrepresentation cause of
action and instead significantly revised the breach of contract cause of action
to include “an entirely new, previously unpled theory for relief” as well as additional
allegations. (Mot. to Strike, p. 8:5-9.) In opposition, 5007 Holdings requests
that the Court grant leave to amend because it is “more expedient” than requiring
5007 Holdings to file a formal motion for leave to amend and the new language
merely clarifies points already made in previous pleadings. (Opp. Mot. to
Strike, p. 5.) 
Third, Yoon moves to strike
paragraphs 19-58 of the TAC on the ground that the allegations therein are
barred by Code of Civil Procedure Section 337’s statute of limitations. 
Yoon’s arguments are correct. The
TAC significantly revises the breach of contract cause of action as compared to
the cause of action as described in SAC. While paragraphs 16-18 in the TAC introduce
a new theory of relief not pled in the SAC, the paragraphs do not include new
facts, per se. However, as discussed in detail in Section III (C) below, the
allegations in paragraphs 19-58 are time-barred. 
5007 Holdings is reminded that
failure to comply with Court Rules, including the timely filing of documents
and adherence to proper procedures for filing or amending pleadings, is not
trivial. Such violations may potentially infringe upon a defendants’ due
process rights, and the violations discussed may be considered in any future
motion, as appropriate.
Thus, the Motion to Strike the
Third Amended Complaint is GRANTED as to paragraphs 19 through 58. 
 
III. Demurrer
A. Meet and Confer
Yoon has met the demurrer meet and
confer requirement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41
subdivision (a)(2). (Knox Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.)
B. Legal Standard
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) This
device can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a
[general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
In testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally
and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v.
Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) The face
of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.)
C. Analysis
“A contract is a voluntary and
lawful agreement, by competent parties, for a good consideration, to do or not
to do a specified thing.” (Robinson v. Magee (1858) 9 Cal. 81, 83.) “To
prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove
(1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the
plaintiff.” (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)
Implicit in the element of damage is that the defendant’s breach caused the
plaintiff’s damage.” (Troyk v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 1305, 1352, italics omitted.)
The breach of contract claim arises
from the following allegations. Plaintiff 5007 Holdings, as the borrower and
owner of the property secured by a deed of trust, and Defendant Yoon, as the
lender in his individual capacity and as trustee, are parties to a promissory
note-based loan agreement dated May 6, 2006, which has been modified by
subsequent amendments. (TAC ¶¶ 5-13.) Most recently, in 2016 the parties agreed
to extend the maturity date for the Note to March 1, 2022. (TAC ¶ 13, Ex. H.) 
5007 Holdings alleges that in 2020
through early 2022, it discovered that throughout the life of the loan, Yoon
had been assessing and demanding interest and late fee payments that exceeded those
provided for under the Note and subsequent modifications, as well as collecting
attorneys’ fees exceeding that authorized by law or otherwise recoverable as a
condition to pay off the Note and deed of trust.
5007 Holdings offers two theories
of recovery for the breach of contract claim concerning the overpayments made
on the Note. Under the first theory, 5007 Holdings argues that pursuant to the Allocation
of Payments provision in the Note, each overpayment, beginning in September 2014,
constitutes a partial reduction in principal and each subsequent ‘interest-only’
payment should have been computed based on the revised principal amount. (TAC ¶¶
16-17, Ex. A ¶ 4.) Thus, under this theory, “the overpayments do not constitute
a breach as the agreement of the parties provides that they are to be treated
as a reduction in principal owed under the Note. The breach occurs when the
unmodified principal is demanded at maturity as a condition to release the Deed
of Trust that secured the Note.” (TAC ¶ 16.) 5007 Holdings contends that, “[i]n
March 2022, plaintiff paid those excessive amounts under protest in order to
obtain new financing and payment of the Note and Trust Deed at maturity.” (TAC
¶ 15.)
Alternatively, 5007 Holdings argues
that “each of the demanded overpayments constituted a breach of the Note, and
plaintiff is entitled to recover all overpayments as they occurred for the four
years prior to filing this action.” (TAC ¶ 105.) The original Complaint in this
action was filed on February 17, 2022. Thus, under this theory 5007 Holdings could
recover for overpayments beginning in February 2018. 
In his demurrer, Yoon argues that the
TAC fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action because the
breach of contract claim is barred by the statute of limitations. Yoon argues
that given that 5007 Holdings alleges that the overpayments began in 2014, under
Code of Civil Procedure Section 337, the statute of limitations on the claim
ran in 2018. (Demurrer p. 10; Code Civ. Pro. § 337.) Yoon also argues that the delayed
discovery rule is not applicable because the TAC neither alleges a fiduciary
relationship nor facts establishing that 5007 Holdings could not have
discovered the alleged overcharges earlier. (Demurrer pp. 11-12.) 
In opposition, 5007 Holdings argues
that under the theory of recovery based on allocation of payments, each
overpayment was merely a reduction of principal, but not a breach of contract.
Instead, “[d]emanding the entire principal amount is the breach of contract,
and it only occurs once at the maturity date of the Note when defendant
insisted on payment of the stated principal amount as if the principal had not
been reduced by overpayments.” (Opp. p. 4.)
5007 Holdings alternatively argues
that the continuous accrual doctrine applies, and thus allegations of
overpayments made between February 2018 and February 2022 are not barred by the
statute of limitations. (Opp. p. 2.) “Generally speaking, continuous accrual
applies whenever there is a continuing or recurring obligation: ‘When an
obligation or liability arises on a recurring basis, a cause of action accrues
each time a wrongful act occurs, triggering a new limitations period.’” (Aryeh
v. Canon Business Solutions, Inc. (2013) 55 Cal. 4th 1185, 199, quoting Hogar
Dulce Hogar v. Community Development Commission (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th
1288, 1295.)
Here, 5007 Holdings’ allocation of
payments theory is unavailing. The argument is that the breach occurred upon
the maturity of the Note when Yoon demanded payment without reducing the
principal. The maturity date for the Note was March 1, 2022. (TAC ¶ 13, Ex. H.)
5007 Holdings states that in March 2022, it paid the “excessive amounts under
protest.” (TAC p. 4.) Thus, under this theory, the breach occurred in March of
2022. However, 5007 Holdings filed the Complaint in this action on February 17,
2022. 5007 Holdings cannot now, in the Third Amended Complaint, argue that an
event that occurred in March of 2022 is the basis for the cause of action alleged
in the February 2022 Complaint. Thus, 5007 Holdings has not alleged facts
sufficient to support a cause of action based on this theory of recovery. 
Nonetheless, although the first
alleged instance of overpayment occurred in 2014, the continuous accrual
doctrine does apply to all allegations of facts that occurred on or after
February 17, 2018. Thus, 5007 Holdings has alleged facts sufficient to state a
cause of action as far as alleged breaches of contract that occurred between
February 17, 2018 and February 17, 2022. 
Accordingly, Yoon’s Demurrer is OVERRULED. 
IV. Conclusion
Defendant Jun I. Yoon’s Demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint is
OVERRULED. 
 
Defendant Jun I. Yoon’s Motion to Strike, is GRANTED in part, as set
forth above.
