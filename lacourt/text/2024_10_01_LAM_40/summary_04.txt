And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting plaintiff J.P.'s motion for leave to amend his complaint. The motion was filed on August 30, 2024, and the court has reviewed the proposed amended complaint and the supporting declarations.

The court finds that the motion satisfies all the statutory requirements, including providing a copy of the proposed amended complaint, explaining what allegations are being added or deleted, and providing a declaration specifying the effect of the amendment and when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered.

The court notes that the proposed amendment is necessary and proper, and that the plaintiff has identified additional facts to support his claim. The court has not considered the validity of the proposed amended pleading, as any grounds for a demurrer or motion to strike will be premature at this time.

Therefore, the court grants the motion for leave to amend the complaint, and the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend complaint for damages is granted.
