 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Motion to Compel
  Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents (Set One) and
  Request for Monetary Sanctions [RES ID # 0563]



 
I. Background
On July 24, 2024, Plaintiff Bagrat
Ogannes filed a motion to compel further responses to Request for Production of
Documents (RFPs), Set One, which Ogannes served on Defendant Harutiun
Kassakhian (Kassakhian) on May 23, 2024 and to which Kassakhian provided unverified
responses on June 27, 2024. Ogannes requests $4,762.50 in monetary sanctions
from Kassakhian and his counsel of record. 
On September 18, 2024, Kassakhian filed an opposition, and requested $4,500.00
in monetary sanctions against Ogannes and his counsel of record. 
On September 23, 2024, Ogannes
filed a reply. 
 
II. Motion
A.   
Meet and Confer
Before bringing a motion to compel
further responses to any discovery request, the moving party is required to
make efforts to meet and confer in good faith and must submit a declaration
attesting to those efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) “A meet
and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) However, a discovery motion need not be denied
automatically based upon the reason that the moving parties failed to¿meet and
confer in good faith.¿(See¿Obregon v. Superior Court¿(1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 424, 434.)¿
Ogannes mailed and emailed a Meet
and Confer letter to Kassakhian on July 6, 2024 (Mot., Ex. 3, Bhola Decl. ¶ 5.)
The letter states: “Please provide full and complete verified responses within
seven days of the date of this letter, or I will have no choice but to seek an
informal discovery conference and/or file a motion to compel with a request for
monetary sanctions.” (Mot., Ex. 3.) Kassakhian did
not respond to the letter. (Bhola Decl. ¶ 6.)
Ogannes’ counsel did not attempt to
arrange a meeting between the parties to confer about the discovery issues, but
rather warned he would seek court intervention if Kassakhian does not provide further
responses within the week. It is questionable whether this constitutes a good
faith effort at informal resolution. However, a discovery motion need not be
denied automatically based upon the reason that the moving parties failed
to¿meet and confer in good faith.¿(See¿Obregon v. Superior Court¿(1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 424, 434.) Considering Kassakhian did not respond to the letter,
the motion will not be denied on this ground. 
B.   
Legal Standard
A motion to compel a further response is used when a party
gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable objections to interrogatories,
demands to produce, or requests for admission. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) 
To request further production, a movant must establish: (1)
good cause for the production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko,
supra, at p. 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a)
the responding party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is
incomplete Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding
party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate, incomplete,
or evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding
party’s objection in the response is without merit or is too general (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior
Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party
objected to the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably
accessible the movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or
(ii) there is good cause for production of the ESI regardless of its
accessibility (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)). 
The Court retains jurisdiction to rule on the merits of
discovery motions even after requested discovery was provided after the motion
was filed. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 409.)
C.   
Analysis
Ogannes asserts that the unverified discovery responses received on
June 27, 2024, were inadequate. Further, despite the stated agreement to comply
in some responses, no documents were produced.  (Mot. p. 4., Ex. 2.) 
In opposition, Kassakhian states that all the requested
documents have now been produced, along with an updated verification. (Opp.,
Cooper Decl. ¶ 14.) 
Ogannes
replies that Kassakhian dropped a box of documents off at Ogannes’s counsel’s
office on September 18, 2024, but the documents were disorganized and there
were no separate written responses. (Reply pp. 4-5.) 
Documents
that are produced in response to a demand for inspection must be identified
with the specific request number to which the documents respond. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.310 subd. (a).) Accordingly, Kassakhian is ordered to provide responses
that comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310,
subdivision (a). 
D.   
Requests for Sanctions
Except in certain circumstances involving electronic stored
information, the court must impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).) 
The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in
favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).) 
Even
after a party provides discovery responses, a party can keep its motion on
calendar and the court has authority to grant sanctions, even if it denies the
motion to compel responses “as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko,
supra, at p. 409.)
Ogannes
requests sanctions for the motion to compel further responses to RFP, Set One
against Defendant, Kassakhian and his counsel, Steven J. Cooper, in the total amount of $4,762.50 based upon
counsel’s rate of $495.00/hour for 9.5 total hours of work as follows: (1) 4.5
hours to prepare the motion and separate statement, (2) 2.5 hours to prepare a
reply, (3) 2.5 hours to attend the hearing remotely, and (4) filing fee of
$60.00. (Mot., Bola Decl. ¶ 8.) 
The
hours requested are mostly reasonable, but the Court will deduct 1.5 hours from
the time to attend the hearing remotely, as it is unlikely this matter will
take more than one hour of counsel’s time. Thus, the sanctions are reduced by
1.5 x 495 = $742.50. 
Thus,
Ogannes’s request for sanctions is granted in the reduced total amount of $4020
(8 hours at $495/hr. plus $60 filing fee.) 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff Barat Ogannes Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents (Set One) is
GRANTED. Defendant Harutiun Kassakhian is ordered to provide code
compliant responses within 14 days.   
The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the total amount of $4,020.00 against
Defendant Harutiun Kassakhian and his counsel, Steven J. Cooper, jointly
and severally. Payment is due within 30 days.
