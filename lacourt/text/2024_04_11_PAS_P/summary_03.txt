And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the cases involving HCMC Legal, Inc. (Hire Counsel) against Brian Hartstein (Hartstein) and Epiq Systems, Inc. (Epiq) should be consolidated due to common questions of law and fact. The cases involve the triangular relationship between Hire Counsel, Hartstein, and Epiq, and the allegations include Hartstein's alleged violations of his employment agreement with Hire Counsel and Epiq's alleged recruitment and incentivization of Hartstein. The Judge finds that there are common questions of both fact and law in these cases, including whether Hartstein breached his employment agreement with Hire Counsel and whether Epiq solicited him to do so. The consolidation of the cases is intended to conserve judicial resources and allow for a more efficient trial.
