And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, meaning that the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's defamation lawsuit is granted, but the plaintiff has 30 days to file an amended complaint. The plaintiff is suing the defendant for defamation because the defendant played a recording of a telephone call in which the plaintiff allegedly threatened to harm the defendant. The recording was made and played in a small claims proceeding, and the plaintiff claims that the defendant's actions were defamatory.

The judge ruled that playing the recording is a communicative act and is protected by the litigation privilege, which allows parties to engage in litigation-related activities without fear of liability. The judge found that the recording was made in violation of California Penal Code section 652, but the plaintiff is suing the defendant for playing the recording, not for making it.

The judge granted the plaintiff leave to amend because the plaintiff may be able to allege a different tort that is tied to the making of the recording, rather than the playing of it. The judge is giving the plaintiff an opportunity to refile the complaint and try to state a valid claim.
