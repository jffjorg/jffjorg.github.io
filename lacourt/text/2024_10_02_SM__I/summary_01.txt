And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving an unrecorded covenant that restricts development on Lot 7. The dispute began in 1997 when property owners entered into an agreement to settle a dispute over property development. The agreement required one lot, Lot 7, to be left undeveloped, but it was not recorded. The plaintiff, Reith, bought Lot 7 without knowing about the restriction and sued the seller, West Pointe, for failing to disclose this fact. West Pointe then sued SDLI and Maple Tree, the general partners of Saddle Peak Associates, which was a party to the original agreement, for equitable indemnity.

The judge has ruled that West Pointe is not an intended third-party beneficiary of the original agreement and therefore cannot seek indemnity from SDLI and Maple Tree. The judge also found that the no third-party beneficiary clause in the agreement is clear and unambiguous and cannot be ignored. The judge has sustained the demurrer and given West Pointe 30 days to amend its cross-complaint.
