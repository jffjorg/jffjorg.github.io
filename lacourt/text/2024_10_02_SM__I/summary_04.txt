And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and is issuing a tentative ruling before the scheduled hearing on October 2, 2024. The case is a premises liability lawsuit, with the plaintiff alleging that the defendant, LA Fitness, failed to warn of a dangerous condition on the floor near the shower, which caused the plaintiff to slip and get injured. The defendant argues that Civil Code section 846 limits liability for landowners who allow recreational activities on their property, and that the plaintiff was not engaging in a recreational activity at the time of the incident.

The judge finds it difficult to understand the defendant's argument under Civil Code section 846, and believes that the statute was not intended to apply to membership health clubs like LA Fitness. The judge also disagrees with the defendant's contention that there is no basis for the tort of willful failure to warn, finding that the evidence suggests that the defendant's employee knew about the slippery floor and failed to take adequate measures to warn others.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer (a motion to dismiss the lawsuit) is overruled, and the defendant has the time allowed by law to answer the complaint. The judge also denied the motion to strike, finding that the allegations are enough to plead at the current stage of the case, although they may be vulnerable to a summary judgment motion.
