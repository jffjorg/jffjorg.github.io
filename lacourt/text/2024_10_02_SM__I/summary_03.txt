```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's discussion of res ipsa loquitur in the complaint. The defendant argued that this discussion is a legal doctrine, not a fact that should be alleged. The judge finds that the discussion does not cause harm and may even help illustrate the underlying facts and why they are sufficient to allege malpractice. The judge also denied the defendant's request to strike the plaintiff's request for fees, but noted that fees will not be awarded unless there is a legal basis for the award. The defendant has 30 days to answer.
