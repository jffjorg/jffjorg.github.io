 Case Number:  24SMCV02107    Hearing Date:   October 2, 2024    Dept:  I The motion to strike is DENIED.  The court, in its discretion, will consider
the untimely opposition, to which defendant has replied.  Defendant seeks to strike plaintiff’s discussion
of res ipsa loquitur in the complaint on the theory that it is a legal
doctrine, not a fact that ought to be alleged. 
Defendant also seeks to strike the request for fees. 
 
The court is not convinced that the meet and confer was
enough, but the court will overlook that. 
After all, at most that would result in continuing the hearing, and the
court sees no purpose in that.  The real
problem is that while one might argue that there is no place for a discussion
of law in a complaint, neither does it do harm and broadly viewing the
complaint, it could be that the discussion helps illustrate the underlying
facts and why they are sufficient to allege malpractice.  At any event, it seems to do no mischief.
 
As to fees, the court is not sure whether or not there will
be some basis for fees.  Defendant should
rest assured, however, that fees will not be awarded unless there is some legal
basis plaintiff establishes for the award. 
For now, the request does no harm.
 
The motion is DENIED. 
Defendant has 30 days to answer.
