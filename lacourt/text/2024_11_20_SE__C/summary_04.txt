And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further response to request for production of documents (Set One) from the defendant, Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC. The defendant is required to provide a further response within 45 days, absent agreement by the parties to a longer period. The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the defendant failed to meet and confer in good faith, and that the plaintiff has demonstrated the relevance of similar complaints about the same year, make, and model of vehicles sold in California for the past five years. The judge also considered the cost of compliance, the number of vehicle records to be searched, and the needs for the discovery in the context of the single case. The defendant had identified 366 Customer Relations Center (CRC) complaints, which took 4.7 hours to download and 37.2 hours to redact private information. The judge determined that producing documents in response to the request would not constitute an undue expense or burden on the defendant.
