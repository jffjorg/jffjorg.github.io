CASE NO.: 19NWCV00704 
HEARING: 11/20/2024
 
#1
TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Plaintiff Joselito Lopez’s unopposed motion for approval
of PAGA settlement agreement and award of attorney’s fees and costs is GRANTED.
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
Joselito Lopez (Plaintiff) moves for approval of the PAGA
settlement agreement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2698.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff individually, and on behalf of other aggrieved employees
pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA), filed a
complaint against Heraeus Precious Metals North America LLC and Heraeus Incorporated
(Defendants). Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint alleging a violation of
California Labor Code § 2698, et seq. for various employment violations
including failure to pay overtime, failure to provide meal periods, failure to
provide rest periods, and failure to pay minimum wages. 
 
Plaintiff brings the instant motion for an approval of the parties’
PAGA settlement agreement and release and award of attorneys’ fees and costs. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“The superior court shall review and approve any settlement
of any civil action filed pursuant to this part.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2699 subd.
(l)(2).) “Because many of the factors used to evaluate class action settlements
bear on a settlement's fairness—including the strength of the plaintiff's case,
the risk, the stage of the proceeding, the complexity and likely duration of
further litigation, and the settlement amount—these factors can be useful in
evaluating the fairness of a PAGA settlement.” (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc.
(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56.)
 
In determining whether to approve a class settlement, the
court’s responsibility is to “prevent fraud, collusion or unfairness to the
class” through settlement and dismissal of the class action because the rights
of the class members, and even named plaintiffs, “may not have been given due
regard by the negotiating parties.” (Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. v.
Kintetsu Enterprises of America (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 46, 60.)
 
In an effort to aid the Court in the determination of the
fairness of the settlement, Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 224, 244-245 discusses factors that the Court should consider when
testing the reasonableness of the settlement.
 
A presumption of fairness exists where: 1) the settlement is
reached through arm’s length bargaining; 2) investigation and discovery are
sufficient to allow counsel and the Court to act intelligently; 3) counsel is
experienced in similar litigation; and 4) the percentage of objectors is small.
(Id. at 245, citing Dunk, supra, 48 Cal.App.4th at 1802.) The
test is not the maximum amount a plaintiff might have obtained at trial on the
complaint but, rather, whether the settlement is reasonable under all of the
circumstances. (Id. at 250.)
 
In making this determination, the Court considers all
relevant factors including “the strength of [the] plaintiffs’ case, the risk,
expense, complexity and likely duration of further litigation, the risk of
maintaining class action status through trial, the amount offered in
settlement, the extent of discovery completed and the stage of the proceedings,
the experience and views of counsel, the presence of a governmental
participant, and the reaction of the class members to the proposed
settlement.’” (Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th
116, 128 (“Kullar”), citing Dunk, supra, 48 Cal.App.4th at
1801.)
 
“The fact that a proposed settlement may only amount to a
fraction of the potential recovery does not, in and of itself, mean that the
proposed settlement is grossly inadequate and should be disapproved.” (City
of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp. (2d Cir. 1974) 495 F.2d 448, 455; see also Linney
v. Cellular Alaska Partnership (9th Cir. 1998) 151 F.3d 1234, 1242 [“[I]t
is the very uncertainty of outcome in litigation and avoidance of wasteful and
expensive litigation that induce consensual settlements. The proposed
settlement is not to be judged against a hypothetical or speculative measure of
what might have been achieved by the negotiators.”].)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff and Defendants agreed to resolve this action for a
total settlement amount of $500,000. The settlement amount includes (1)
$190,000.000 in attorneys’ fees and $19,860.92 in costs to Plaintiff’s counsel;
(2) $7,500 as a general release fee to Plaintiff; (3) up to $5,000 in settlement
administration costs to the PAGA settlement administrator; and (4) the net
settlement amount to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency
(LWDA) and aggrieved employees. Of the net settlement amount, 75%, approximately
$208,229.31, will be distributed to the LWDA and 25%, approximately $69,409.77,
will be distributed to the aggrieved employees. The class is comprised of all
current and former hourly or non-exempt employees who worked for Defendants in
the state of California during the PAGA period.
 
Here, there is a presumption of fairness. The parties
engaged in arms-length bargaining. On December 10, 2021, after a full day
mediation conducted by Paul Grossman, Esq., the parties agreed to this
settlement. Paul Grossman, Esq. is a respected mediator with experience in
complex labor and employment matters. The parties were represented by counsel
experienced with complex labor and employment matters and reached this
settlement after engaging in formal and informal discovery. 
 
The settlement recovery reflects a fair and reasonable
resolution of this case based on Plaintiff’s claims and Defendants’ affirmative
defenses. It also reflects the parties’ consideration of how litigation may
have proceeded, trial, arbitration proceedings, potential appeals, and
uncertainty surrounding PAGA claims after recent amendments to the PAGA
statute. Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed.
 
Additionally, Plaintiff’s counsel requests 38%, or $190,000,
of the total settlement amount. Plaintiff retained Lawyers for Justice, PC under
a contingency fee agreement of at least 38% of the recovery. (Ghosh Decl., ¶
20.) Plaintiff’s counsel investigated issues, conducted discovery, and engaged
in settlement negotiations. (Ghosh Decl., ¶ 20.) Plaintiff’s counsel also
requests $19,860.92 in litigation costs and expenses. As evidence, Plaintiff’s
counsel included an itemization of the costs incurred in this case. (Ghosh
Decl., Exh. 3.) 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for approval of
PAGA settlement agreement and award of attorney’s fees and costs is GRANTED.
