Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED. 
Plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the amount of $29,381.45 including $1,810 in

Moving party to give notice. 
 
National Commercial Recovery, Inc. (Plaintiff) moves the
Court to enforce a settlement agreement it entered into with C & B
Croissants, Inc. and Chhay Kour (Defendants). Plaintiff also seeks an award of
attorney’s fees and costs.
 
Background
 
This is an action for common counts. On August 21, 2024, the
parties entered into a conditional settlement which required Defendants to make
weekly payments beginning on August 22, 2024, and ending on November 7, 2024,
for a total sum of $35,292.05. (Besnyl Decl., ¶ 2.)
 
This is a continuation. On September 12, 2024, National
Commercial Recovery, Inc. moved ex parte for entry of stipulated judgment. The
Court deemed the ex parte application to be the moving papers and allowed the
opportunity to file opposition and reply briefs. During the hearing on October
9, 2024, Plaintiff requested a continuance to provide Defendants with an
opportunity to make additional payments. 
The Court instructed Plaintiff to file a status report no later than
November 13, 2024.  
 
On November 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a status report
indicating Defendants have made additional payments, but they have not cured
their default.  
 
The motion is unopposed.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 subd. (a) states: “If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement
of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”
 
Discussion
 
Here, the parties entered a conditional settlement agreement
on August 21, 2024. The parties agreed to a settlement for $35,292.05. (Besnyl
Decl., ¶ 2.) Defendants failed to make their initial payments. On November 12,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a status report stating Defendants have made
additional payments but have not yet cured their default. (Status Report,
Besnyl Decl., ¶
2.) 
Defendants currently owe $2,000.00 for their payment that
was due on September 5, 2024, $3,000.00 payments that were due on September 12,
September 19, September 26, October 3, October 10, October 17, October 23, and
October 31, and $2,292.05 for the final payment that was due on November 7.
(Status Report, Besnyl Decl., ¶ 3.) 
 
Plaintiff additionally seeks attorney’s fees pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. Plaintiff seeks $1,200 in attorney’s
fees, representing two hours of work at a billing rate of $275, and costs
totaling $610. Under the stipulated settlement agreement, the parties agreed
that in the event of an uncured default, Plaintiff is entitled to an entry of
judgment and payment of attorney’s fees and costs. (Besnyl Decl., Exh. A.) The Court
notes that Plaintiff’s proposed judgment provides a different and higher amount
for attorney’s fees and costs. The Court will proceed with the amount requested
in Plaintiff’s motion. The Court awards fees and costs in the amount of $1,810.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to a judgment in the amount of
$29,381.45 reflecting $35,292.05 in damages, $2,279.40 prejudgment interest at
the annual rate of 18%, $1,810 in attorney’s fees and costs, and $10,000 credit
for Defendant’s additional settlement payments.
