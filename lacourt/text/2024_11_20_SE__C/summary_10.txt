And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of National Commercial Recovery, Inc. (Plaintiff) in its motion to enforce a settlement agreement with C & B Croissants, Inc. and Chhay Kour (Defendants). The parties entered into a conditional settlement agreement on August 21, 2024, requiring Defendants to make weekly payments totaling $35,292.05. However, Defendants failed to make the initial payments, and Plaintiff's counsel filed a status report indicating that Defendants have made additional payments but have not yet cured their default. The Judge has granted Plaintiff's motion, awarding judgment in the amount of $29,381.45, which includes $1,810 in attorney's fees and costs. The Judge has also noted that Plaintiff's proposed judgment provides a different and higher amount for attorney's fees and costs, and has proceeded with the amount requested in Plaintiff's motion.
