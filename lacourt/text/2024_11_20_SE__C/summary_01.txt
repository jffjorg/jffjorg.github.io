  - "Because many of the factors used to evaluate class action settlements bear on a settlement's fairness—including the strength of the plaintiff's case, the risk, the stage of the proceeding, the complexity and likely duration of further litigation, and the settlement amount—these factors can be useful in evaluating the fairness of a PAGA settlement."
  - "The fact that a proposed settlement may only amount to a fraction of the potential recovery does not, in and of itself, mean that the proposed settlement is grossly inadequate and should be disapproved."

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Joselito Lopez v. Heraeus Precious Metals North America LLC, et al. The Plaintiff, Joselito Lopez, has moved for approval of the PAGA settlement agreement and award of attorney's fees and costs. The Defendants have not opposed the motion.

The settlement agreement was reached after a full-day mediation conducted by Paul Grossman, Esq. on December 10, 2021. The settlement amount is $500,000, which includes attorneys' fees, litigation costs and expenses, and distribution to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) and aggrieved employees.

The Judge finds that the settlement amount is fair and reasonable based on the Plaintiff's claims and the Defendants' affirmative defenses. The Judge also notes that the parties engaged in arms-length bargaining and that the settlement reflects a fair and reasonable resolution of the case.

Accordingly, the Judge grants the Plaintiff's unopposed motion for approval of the PAGA settlement agreement and award of attorney's fees and costs.
