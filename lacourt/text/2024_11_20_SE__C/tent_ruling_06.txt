TENTATIVE ORDER
 
I.            
Defendant Honda Motor Co., Inc.’s
demurrer to the fifth cause of action in the Complaint is MOOT.
 
II.           
Defendant Honda Motor Co., Inc.’s motion
to strike punitive damages in the Complaint is MOOT.  
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
The Complaint in this lemon law action was filed on December
12, 2023.  American Honda Motor Co., Inc.
(Defendant) demurs to Sonia Martinez’s (Plaintiff) fifth cause of action for
fraudulent inducement - concealment and moves to strike portions of the
complaint seeking punitive damages.
 
Opposition to the demurrer was due on November 6, 2024.  On that date, in lieu of filing an opposition,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC).
 
“¿A party may amend its pleading once without leave of the
court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or
after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion
to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and served no later than
the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike.” (CCP §
472, subd. (a).)
 
Upon the timely filing of the FAC, the Complaint was no
longer the operative pleading.  Thus, the
demurrer to the Complaint is MOOT.
