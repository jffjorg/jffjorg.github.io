```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant, Hyundai Motor America, does not have standing to compel arbitration of the dispute because it is not a signatory to the arbitration agreement and does not meet the requirements for equitable estoppel. The ruling is based on the judge's analysis of the Federal Arbitration Act, California Civil Code Section 1793.2, and the California Evidence Code. The judge also cites several California Court of Appeals decisions, including Felisilda v. FCA US LLC, Ford Motor Warranty Cases, Montemayor et al. v. Ford Motor Company, and Kielar v. The Superior Court of Placer County, which are contrary to the defendant's position.
