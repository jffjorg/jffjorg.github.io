And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law action case between Plaintiff Andrea Martinez and Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The Defendant has moved for summary adjudication on Plaintiff's cause of action for fraudulent-inducement-concealment and prayer for punitive damages. The Judge has continued the hearing on the motion to February 19, 2025.

The Plaintiff has also moved to compel compliance with the Court's order dated June 11, 2024, which requires the Defendant to produce a person most qualified for deposition. The Judge has granted the motion and ordered the Defendant's person most qualified to appear for deposition within 30 days. The parties may stipulate to a longer period for the deposition.

The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that the Defendant did not provide a qualified deponent for deposition, and the Plaintiff lacks essential facts to oppose the Defendant's motion. The Judge has found that the Plaintiff is entitled to additional time to conduct the deposition and gather relevant facts to respond to the Defendant's claims.
