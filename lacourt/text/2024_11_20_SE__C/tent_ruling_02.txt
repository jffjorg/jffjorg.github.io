Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Defendant) moves for summary
adjudication as to Andrea Martinez’s (Plaintiff) fraudulent inducement –
concealment cause of action and prayer for punitive damages.
 
Background
 
This is a lemon law action. On August 29, 2022, Plaintiff
filed a complaint regarding her 2019 Honda Pilot, (Subject Vehicle) purchased
on March 19, 2019. Plaintiff alleges three causes of action: (1) violation of
Song-Beverly Act – breach of express warranty, (2) violation of Song-Beverly
Act – breach of implied warranty, and (3) fraudulent inducement – concealment. Plaintiff
alleges Defendant sold the Subject Vehicle knowing there was a transmission
defect. 
 
Discussion 
 
Defendant seeks summary adjudication as to Plaintiff’s cause
of action for fraudulent – concealment and prayer for punitive damages. 
 
On November 6, 2024, counsel for Plaintiff Timothy Lupinek
filed an affidavit regarding Plaintiff’s opposition pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c subd. (h). Plaintiff argues that she lacks evidence
required to oppose Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication because
Defendant did not provide a qualified deponent in response to Plaintiff’s
motion to compel deposition attendance of Defendant’s person most qualified for
matter nos. 1-28. (Lupinek Affidavit, ¶¶ 5, 6.) Matter nos. 1-28 request deposition testimony related to
the torque converter lock-up clutch equipped in the Subject Vehicle’s
transmission. (Lupinek Affidavit, ¶ 7.)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c subd. (h) states that “[i]f it appears from the
affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, or
both, that facts essential to justify opposition may exist but cannot, for
reasons stated, be presented, the court shall deny the motion, order a
continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be had, or make
any other order as may be just.” 
 
“The nonmoving party
seeking a continuance must show: (1) the facts to be obtained are essential to
opposing the motion; (2) there is reason to believe such facts may exist; and
(3) the reasons why additional time is needed to obtain these facts.
[Citations.]”  (Wachs v. Curry (1993)13 Cal.App.4th 616,
623.)  If these factors are met, a continuance is mandatory. Danieley
v. Goldmine Ski Associates, Inc. (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 111, 127. 
 
In the affidavit,
Plaintiff’s counsel includes deposition testimony of Defendant’s person most
qualified. (Lupinek Affidavit, Exh. C.) In the deposition testimony, Kaneisha Jones states she does not
know what a torque converter lock-up clutch does. (Lupinek Affidavit, Exh. C.) She further states she does not know
why 2019 Honda Pilot vehicles are equipped with torque-converter lock-up
clutches. (Lupinek Affidavit, Exh. C.) It is clear that Defendant did not put a person qualified to
provide deposition testimony regarding the Subject Vehicle’s transmission because
the deponent did not have knowledge about a relevant component. Plaintiff
argues these facts would aid in responding to Defendant’s claims that Plaintiff
lacks evidence that Defendant was the only party with knowledge of defects in
the torque converter lock-up clutch. (Lupinek Affidavit, ¶ 8.) The Court finds that Plaintiff
lacks essential facts to oppose this motion and there is reason to believe with
a deponent knowledgeable about the transmission, relevant facts may exist. 
 
On November 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel
compliance with the Court’s order dated June 11, 2024. Plaintiff requires
additional time to conduct the deposition and learn relevant facts. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication is CONTINUED to February 19, 2025 at 10:30 a.m.
in Dept. SE-C.  
 
Plaintiff Andrea Martinez’s Motion to Compel Compliance with
the Court’s Order dated June 11, 2024, is ADVANCED from May 29, 2025 to today’s
date and GRANTED.  Defendant’s PMQ is
ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days.  The parties may stipulate to a longer
period.  Defendant’s PMQ must be prepared
to testify regarding matter nos. 1-28 in Plaintiff’s Notice of Deposition.  No sanctions.
