TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant Luis Hernandez’s Motion to Compel Answers to
Special Interrogatories (Set One) is GRANTED.  
 
The Court GRANTS the Request for Sanctions in the
amount of $410.00.
 
Moving party(s) to give notice. 
 
This is an action for motor vehicle negligence. On July 17,
2023, Plaintiff Bryan Miranda (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant
Luis Hernandez (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 50. The Complaint alleges that on
August 27, 2021, Defendant negligently drove and collided into Plaintiff’s
vehicle, injuring Plaintiff. The Complaint alleges one cause of action for
negligence. 
 
On November 15, 2023, Defendant served the Special
Interrogatories (Set No .1) on Plaintiff. (Magnus Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. A.) 
 
On May 15, 2024, Defendant filed this Motion to Compel Answers
to Special Interrogatories (Set No.1) and Request for Sanctions.
 
No opposition or reply has been filed as of November 12,
2024. 
 
Motion to Compel 
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (b).) Failure to timely respond waives
all objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 (a)(1),
(a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no
responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a party does
not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)
 
Here, Defendant served the Special Interrogatories (Set No
.1) on Plaintiff on November 15, 2024. (Magnus Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. A.) Responses
were due within 30 days. Plaintiff failed to respond by the deadline, and on
December 29, 2023 Defendant’s counsel wrote to Plaintiff’s counsel stating that
discovery responses were overdue and requesting verified answers. (Magnus
Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. B.) After no response, Defendant’s counsel wrote to
Plaintiff’s counsel again on January 12, 2024, requesting answers. (Magnus Decl.,
¶ 5, Exh. C.) On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant’s
counsel and asked if Plaintiff owed discovery responses on this matter, and Defendant’s
counsel responded “Yes, we have received no discovery responses from your
office, despite meet and confers.” (Magnus Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. D.) On March 28,
2024, Defendant’s counsel forwarded to Plaintiff’s counsel the discovery
request initially served on November 15, 2023 as a reminder. (Magnus Decl., ¶
7, Exh. E.) As of May 14, 2024, Defendant’s counsel had not received verified
answers to the Special Interrogatories from Plaintiff. (Magnus Decl., ¶ 8.)
Plaintiff has filed no opposition, and there is no indication Plaintiff has
served any responses as of date. 
 
The unopposed Motion to Compel is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Bryan
Miranda is ORDERED to provide
verified responses and documents, without objection, by no later than 15
days from date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may be
extended by stipulation of the parties. If any objections are asserted, it will
be tantamount to no response at all and will be deemed a violation of this
Court’s order. 
 
Sanctions
 
If a motion to compel responses is filed, the Court shall
impose a monetary sanction against the losing party “unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290 (c).) Further, “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery
Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion
was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the
requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was
filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
 
The Court finds sanctions are warranted, even where Plaintiff
has filed no opposition. Defendant seeks sanctions for one hour to prepare the
Motion and two hours to attend the hearing at a rate of $175.00 per hour, plus
a $60.00 filing fee, in the total amount of $585.00. The Court finds two hours
for the hearing is excessive—the hearing should last no longer than one hour,
if not less. Thus, the Court imposes sanctions in the amount of $410.00 upon
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, payable within 60
days.
