And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Brian Corman's motion to object to the proposed order submitted by the Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) for minor beneficiary Caroline Corman will be continued to the hearing on the scheduled petition for an accounting. The Judge finds that Brian has waived and/or is estopped from asserting any claim that the Court either now lacks jurisdiction or that the case is stayed by virtue of the pending appeal. The Judge also finds that the GAL order has not lapsed and that the trustee is not complying with its fiduciary obligations to Caroline. The Judge does not see how the proposed order conflicts with the stipulation and order concluding the petition for instructions and does not find that the GAL has unreasonably expanded the scope of its authority. The Judge orders that any objections to the petition for accounting be filed and served one week prior to the hearing.
