And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling to clarify the scope of the Guardian ad litem's authority in a case involving the distribution of a trust. The Guardian ad litem was authorized to review the Deal Point memorandum, but this does not extend to filing petitions or initiating litigation without a court order. The judge notes that the Guardian ad litem is entitled to seek instructions from the court to avoid litigation. The petition for instructions and the petition for accounting both relate to the distribution of the trust and are within the scope of the Guardian ad litem's authority. The judge rejects Brian's contention that the Guardian ad litem lacks authority to file the petition, but notes that Brian may file an objection to the petition and the court will consider the issue further if necessary.
