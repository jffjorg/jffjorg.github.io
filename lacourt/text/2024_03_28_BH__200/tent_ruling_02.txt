[1] For ease of reference, the Court refers to family
members by their first name, without intending any disrespect. 


[2] GAL should also serve Elizabeth with notice of that
petition. 


[3] The Court acknowledges that, by order filed October
2, 2020, GAL was authorized to review the Deal Point memorandum as far as it
how affected Caroline’s rights. However, this does not change the scope of the
appeal or the resulting stay. 


[4] Whether GAL lacks authority to file a petition is not
properly before the Court on this motion related to a proposed order. To the extent
the issue is before the Court, it is rejected as without basis: 
          Brian is misreading the April 24,
2019 order: It states: “The Court further orders that at this time, the
Guardian ad litem, Mr. Friedman is only authorized to address Caroline’s
distribution rights from the Pacific Trust. Mr. Friedman is not authorized to
start filing pleadings in any pending petitions, or initiate other
litigation without an order from the Court.” (Emphasis added). The purpose of
this language was to make sure that GAL did not participate in any of the other
considerable pending litigation involving the Trust (that were resolved
in part by the Deal Point Memorandum), including the related civil case, and to
focus only on Christine’s distribution rights, given the number of lawyers
already involved in the underlying issues. The proposed order in question,
however, arises from a petition for instructions related to Christine’s
distribution rights. A GAL, as an agent of the Court, is entitled to seek
instruction – precisely to avoid litigation. Similarly, the petition for
accounting again goes to what rights of distribution Caroline may have. 
          If Brian contends GAL required a
court order to file the pending petition for accounting, he can file objection thereto
and the Court will consider the issue further, if necessary, in deciding that
petition.
