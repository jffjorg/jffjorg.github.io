The Court has denied the Defendant David Carlin's Motion to Fix Amount of Attorney's Fees to be Awarded without prejudice. The Defendant requested that the Court limit the amount of attorney's fees to $500.00 based on an amount stated in a contract. However, the Plaintiff, who is litigating in propria persona, did not oppose or respond to the Motion. The Court determined that the Motion is not ripe for adjudication since the prevailing party has not yet been determined and the Court has not considered all of the arguments and evidence that could come at trial.
