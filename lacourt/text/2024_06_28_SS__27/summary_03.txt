- The Court has broad discretion in selecting the appropriate sanction, and we must uphold the trial court's determination absent an abuse of discretion.
- Terminating sanctions are granted against Plaintiffs Damon Jackson and Jordan Saunders.
- Terminating sanctions are denied against Plaintiff George Heinen.

English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that terminating sanctions are granted against Plaintiffs Damon Jackson and Jordan Saunders due to their failure to comply with court orders, including serving responses to discovery requests, attending depositions, and responding to defense counsel's inquiries. The judge has also denied the motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff George Heinen, as Heinen has complied with the court's orders and has shown a willingness to engage in discovery.

The judge's decision is based on the Civil Discovery Act and the Court's orders, and is intended to obtain compliance with the discovery process and not to punish the parties. The judge has also considered the parties' conduct, including their failure to serve verifications to the discovery responses and their failure to attend depositions.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to revision based on any submissions or appearances at the hearing on June 28, 2024.
