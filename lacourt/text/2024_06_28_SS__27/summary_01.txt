And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for relief from dismissal filed by the plaintiffs, Karla Gomez et al., against Amanel Edison. The case was dismissed on January 26, 2024, due to the calendaring error of the prior counsel, Nare Kupelian, who failed to appear for the Order to Show Cause Re: Proof of Deposit and Dismissal. The plaintiffs argue that the dismissal was due to inadvertence, surprise, and excusable neglect, and that the court should grant discretionary relief. The court finds that the circumstances justify the issuance of discretionary relief, as minor plaintiff Vergara will be prejudiced by not receiving his portion of the settlement, and the court has discretion to allow relief from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against a party or his or her attorney. The court grants the present motion to set aside the dismissal and vacate the order of dismissal.
