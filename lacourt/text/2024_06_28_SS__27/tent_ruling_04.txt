Background
On March 14, 2024, Defendants
JOSE FRANCISCO CISNEROS, BLUAGENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC., and ACV LOGISTICS, LLC
("Defendants") served Special Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories,
Requests for Production, and Requests for Admissions (Set Ones) on Plaintiff Edwin
Castanon. The discovery responses were due on April 18, 2024. On April 19,
2024, Defendants' counsel sent Plaintiff a meet and confer letter informing him
that his discovery responses were overdue and that all objections had been
waived by operation of law. Plaintiff never responded to Defendants' counsel's
meet and confer letter. As of this date, Plaintiff has not served any responses
to the discovery requests at issue, and Defendant now moves the Court to compel
Plaintiff to provide initial responses to Defendants’ Special Interrogatories,
Form Interrogatories, Requests for Production, and Requests for Admissions (Set
Ones). No opposition was filed to any of the motions.
Legal Standard 
1.  Requests for Production and
Interrogatories 
 
A defendant may make a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling without leave of court at any time.
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd.
(a).) A plaintiff may make a demand for production of documents and propound
interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of
the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed,
whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿ 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)
 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.) 
 
2.  Request for Admissions 
 
“Any party may obtain discovery .
. . by a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness
of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion
relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may
relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”¿ CCP § 2033.010.¿ “Within 30 days after service of
requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve
the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the
response on all other parties who have appeared ....”¿ CCP § 2033.250(a).
 
If a party to whom request for
admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. CCP § 2033.280(a). The requesting party can move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions.
CCP § 2033.280(b). The court shall issue this order unless the party to whom
the request was made serves a response in substantial compliance prior to the
hearing on the motion. CCP § 2033.280(c). Unlike a motion to compel further
discovery responses, a motion to deem RFA admitted does not have any meet and
confer requirements. 
 
Discussion
 
It is undisputed that
Plaintiff failed to serve discovery responses at issue by the statutory
deadline. Plaintiff did not serve an opposition or any other filing indicating
that the discovery responses were served prior to the hearing. Thus, the
present motions are GRANTED. Defendants’ Requests for Admissions, Set One, are
deemed admitted. Plaintiff is ordered to produce verified and complete
responses to Defendants’ Special Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories, and
Requests for Production, Set Ones, without objection within 30 days of today.
Defendants request
sanctions in the amount of $685.00 per motion. In consideration of the
simplicity of the issues and the lack of any opposition, the Court grants
sanctions in the amount of $1,500 ($500 per defendant) for all of the motions.
The Court orders Plaintiff and his counsel, jointly and severally, to pay
sanctions of $1,500 to Defendants within 30 days of today’s date.
