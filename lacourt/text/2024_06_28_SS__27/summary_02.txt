And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment and quash the service of summons. The defendant, ROIG California LLC, argues that the service of process was improper because the address and individual allegedly personally served were not affiliated with the defendant. The judge finds that the plaintiff did not effectuate proper service on the defendant and grants the motion.

The judge also exercises its inherent equitable power to grant relief from the default judgment, finding that the purported affidavit and proof of service for personal service of the defendant are false. The defendant is ordered to file a responsive pleading within 30 days of the hearing date.

The parties are advised to submit to the tentative ruling by email to the court, and if they do not, they should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
