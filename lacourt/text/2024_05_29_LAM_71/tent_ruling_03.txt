 Hearing Date:  May 15, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Esther Lim’s unopposed motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement entered
on September 20, 2023, set aside the dismissal entered on September 20, 2023,
and enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation for Entry of
Judgment executed between Plaintiff and Defendants Jamgle Jam USA, Inc. and
Rama McCabe on August 30, 2023, is granted.
Plaintiff
is entitled to an order enforcing the Judgment in the amount of $210,000.00 and
the Court retains jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to C.C.P. §664.6.
 
Plaintiff
Esther Lim (“Lim”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed for this Court to set
aside the judgment of dismissal entered on September 20, 2023, and enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation for Entry of Judgment
executed between Plaintiff  and
Defendants Jamgle Jam USA, Inc. (“Banks Journal”) and Rama McCabe (“McCabe”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) on August 30, 2023, on the grounds the parties
entered in a Settlement and General-Release-of-Claims Agreement (“Agreement”)
as to the claims asserted by Plaintiff and Defendants have failed to remit full
payment of the Settlement Amount to Plaintiff in the manner prescribed by the
Agreement.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1;
C.C.P. §664.6.)  The Court interprets the
principal thrust of Plaintiff’s motion to be one to enforce the Agreement
rather than one to set aside the judgment of dismissal.
 
Background
          On August 30, 2023, the Parties
executed an Agreement to settle the claims asserted by Plaintiff against
Defendants in the within action.  (Decl. of
Zelenski ¶2, Exh. 1.)  The Agreement
provides that Defendants shall pay the Settlement Amount called for by the
Agreement in sixteen separate installments, with each installment due
approximately every two weeks, starting on September 15, 2023. (Decl. of Zelenski
¶2, Exh. 1 at §1.5.)
On
September 8, 2023, this Court entered an Order to “retain jurisdiction over the
within action and the Parties for purposes of supervising, implementing,
enforcing, construing, administering, and interpreting the Agreement . . .
under California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.”  (9/8/23 Stipulation.)  
Plaintiff
filed a Request for Dismissal on September 20, 2023, which was entered by the
Clerk that same day.  (9/20/23 Request
for Dismissal.)
Defendants
have failed to make the second installment payment, which was due on September
29, 2023, and no further payments under the Agreement have been issued to
Plaintiff.  (Decl. of Zelenski ¶4.)
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on December 18, 2023. 
As of the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Motion to Enforce Settlement
          C.C.P. §664.6 provides, as follows: “If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence
of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part
thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of
the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction
over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the
terms of the settlement.”
Plaintiff submitted evidence
Plaintiff and Defendants entered into the Agreement, which was signed by both
parties on August 20, 2023.  (Decl. of Zelenski ¶2,
Exh. 1.)  Pursuant to the terms
of the Agreement, 
In the event that any
of the contemplated sixteen installments is not made in full according to the
schedule set forth in [the Agreement], Banks Journal and McCabe shall have the
opportunity to cure the deficient installment by making the full missed
installment within five business days of notice having been provided as set
forth in section 3 of th[e] Agreement. In the event that any of the
installments is not duly delivered as set forth [in the Agreement], then Lim,
in her sole discretion, shall have the right, at any time prior to receipt of
the Settlement Amount in full, to extend the period of time for the Settlement
Amount to be paid, to enforce this Agreement, or to file the Stipulation for
Entry of Judgment attached [to the Agreement] as Exhibit A.  
 
(Decl. of Zelenski ¶2,
Exh. 1 at §1.6.)
Defendants failed to make the
second installment payment to Plaintiff, which was due on September 29, 2023.  (Decl. of Zelenski ¶4.)  On October 5 and 6, 2023, Defendants advised that they would
not be remedying the deficient installment payment, and no further payments
whatsoever have been made to Plaintiff under the Agreement.  (Decl. of Zelenski ¶4.)
On October 6, 2023, following
Defendants’ confirmation that they would not be making the payments
contemplated by the Agreement, Plaintiff lodged a Stipulation for Entry of
Judgment with the Court.  (Decl. of Zelenski
¶5, Exh. 4 at pg. 4.)  The Stipulation
that Plaintiff lodged was the Stipulation that the Parties had attached to the
Agreement as Exhibit A, and which all the Parties had signed on August 30,
2023.  (Compare Decl. of Zelenski
¶5, Exh. 4 with Exh. 1 at Exh. A at pg. 4.)
Under the terms of the Parties
mutually drafted Proposed Judgment, “[t]he total amount of the Judgment in
favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants is $210,000.00.”  (Decl. of Zelenski ¶5, Exh. 4 at 4:6–7.)  This amount exceeds the $48,000.00 Settlement
Amount, which is what the Parties had agreed to as an incentive for Defendants
to duly comply with the agreed-upon payment schedule, as well as a hedge against
potential bankruptcy.  (Decl. of Zelenski
¶5, Exh. 4 at §6 [stating that, “if Banks Journal or McCabe fails to pay any
portion of the Settlement Amount—including, but not limited to, on account of
any attempted rescission, or by virtue of any action by any bankruptcy
court—[Plaintiff] is permitted to immediately file with the Court the
Stipulation for Entry of Judgment attached hereto as Exhibit A”].)
The Court of Appeal has
supported liquidated damages provisions in similar to the provision at issue
here, specifically in Gormley v. Gonzalez (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 72,
which distinguished an earlier case, Vitatech International, Inc. v. Sporn
(2017) 16 Cal. App. 5th 796.
In Vitatech, the Court
of Appeal explained that “California law has . . . long recognized that a
provision for liquidation of damages for contractual breach . . . can under
some circumstances be designed as, and operate as, a contractual forfeiture.”  (Vitatech, 16 Cal.App.5th at pg. 805.)  “Under the 1872 Civil Code, a provision by
which damages for a breach of contract were determined in anticipation of
breach was [therefore] enforceable only if determining actual damages was
impracticable or extremely difficult.”  (Id.,
citing Civ. Code §1671 (1872).)
Similarly, the Vitatech
Court explained that “a[s] amended in 1977, the [Civil C]ode continues to apply
that strict standard to liquidated damages clauses in certain contracts
(consumer goods and services, and leases of residential real property . . . ).”
 (Vitatech, 16 Cal.App.5th at pg. 805,
citing Civ. Code §1671.)
Based on this understanding
of section 1671, the Vitatech Court held that it could not affirm the trial
court’s entry of a stipulated judgment upon the defendants’ failure to pay a
lesser amount, notwithstanding the defendants’ assent to the stipulated
judgment:
Vitatech. . . fails to recognize that a liquidated damages
provision lacking a reasonable relationship to the range of damages the parties
reasonably could have anticipated is unenforceable and void as against public
policy. (Civ. Code, § 1599 [“Where a contract has several distinct objects, of
which one at least is lawful, and one at least is unlawful, in whole or in
part, the contract is void as to the latter and valid as to the rest”]; Sybron
Corp. v. Clark Hosp. Supply Corp. (1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 896, 900 (Sybron)
[“Under California law liquidated damages not reasonably related to actual damages
are unenforceable and void as penalties”].) “[A] court cannot validly enter a judgment
or order which is void even if the parties agree to it.” (Plaza Hollister
Ltd. Partnership v. County of San Benito (1999) 72 Cal. App. 4th 1, 13.)
 
(Vitatech, 16 Cal.
App. 5th at pg. 807.)
          The Court of Appeal in Gormley distinguished Vitatech
based on
the statutory language of
Civil Code §1671.  Specifically, the Gormley
Court stated, “[f]ormer [Civil Code] section 1670, enacted in 1872, provided
[that] a liquidated damages provision was ‘void’”—not voidable— “unless it
complied with former section 1671.”  (Gormley,
84 Cal.App.5th at pg. 79.)  However,
“[i]n 1977, the Legislature adopted without change a California Law Revision
Commission . . . recommendation that repealed section 1670 and amended section
1671.”  (Id. at pg. 80.)
The Gormley Court
stated:
For nonconsumer contracts like the [s]ettlement [a]greement
in this case, however, subdivision (b) of section 1671 created “a new general
rule favoring the enforcement of liquidated damages provisions.” (Cal. Law
Revision Com. com., Deering’s Ann. Civ. Code, supra, foll. § 1671, p. 392,
italics added.) That rule provides, “a provision in a contract liquidating the
damages for the breach of the contract is valid unless the party seeking to
invalidate the provision establishes that the provision was unreasonable under
the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made.” (§ 1671, subd.
(b).)
 
(Gormley, 84
Cal.App.5th at pg. 81.)
Distinguishing Vitatech,
the Gormley Court explained that “Vitatech . . . acknowledge[s]
that section 1671 was amended in 1977, but . . . held the amendment did not
change the rule that a liquidated damages provision is invalid unless the
amount bears a proportional relationship to the damages that might actually
flow from a breach.”  (Id. at pg.
87.)  
It follows then that Vitatech
does not create a rule that allows a defendant in a lawsuit “to actively
negotiate a settlement agreement with a liquidated damages clause (and thus to
effectively halt the plaintiff’s prosecution of the case), to default on that
agreement, and then to resist entry of judgment by arguing the clause is
invalid because the damages it agreed to are too high.”  (Id. at 89.)  Put into the context of the above-captioned
action, “[h]ad Defendants not agreed to pay a reduced amount quickly (with a
steep liquidated damages provision if they defaulted on that promise),
Plaintiff[] might have preferred taking [her] case to trial.”  (Id.)  But “[b]y agreeing to, and then repudiating,
the . . . Agreement, Defendants have effectively taken that option away from
Plaintiff[].”  (Id.)  Put still another way, Vitatech does
not create a rule that allows Defendants “to assert what might be called the
‘hey neener neener, gotcha sucker’ defense.”  (Id.) 
Instead, under the plain language of §1671, the rule “favor[s] the
enforcement liquidated damages provisions” in stipulated judgments.  (Id. at pg. 81.)  There is thus “nothing unreasonable about
holding Defendants to the price they agreed to pay for failing to keep their
promise.”  (Id. at pg. 89.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff is
entitled to an order enforcing the Judgment in the amount of $210,000.00 and the
Court retains jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to C.C.P. §664.6.  The Court sets aside the judgment of
dismissal entered on September 20, 2023. 
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to enforce the Agreement is granted.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
unopposed motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement entered on August
20, 2023, and set aside the judgment of dismissal entered on September 20,
2023, is granted.
Plaintiff is entitled to an
order enforcing the Judgment in the amount of $210,000.00 and the Court retains
jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to C.C.P. §664.6.
