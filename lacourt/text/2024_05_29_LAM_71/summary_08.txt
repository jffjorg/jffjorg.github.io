And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court has sustained the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint with 20 days leave to amend as to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd causes of action. The defendants demurred to the complaint on the grounds that the causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action against the defendants and are stated ambiguously and unintelligibly. The court found that the plaintiff's allegations are inconsistent and unclear, and that the parties are not properly identified in the alleged contract. The court granted the defendants' demurrer and gave the plaintiff 20 days to amend its complaint.
