And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in response to an ex parte application by the defendant to extend the deadline for filing motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The defendant's notice of intent to move for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict was initially rejected due to an incorrect document type. However, the court has deemed the notice to have been timely filed on May 21, 2024, in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(d)(4). The court has granted the defendant's ex parte application and allows the defendant to file its points and authorities in support of its motions by June 10, 2024. The court has also set a hearing on the defendant's motions for July 19, 2024.
