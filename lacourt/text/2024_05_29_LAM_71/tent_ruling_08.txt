 Hearing
  Date:  May 29, 2024



 
Defendants Ben Wilkins’, Karen Wilkins’,
and the Wilkins Family Living Trust’s demurrer to Plaintiff Bel Esprit
Builders, Inc.’s complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend as
to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd causes of action.
 
Defendants Ben Wilkins (“Ben”), Karen Wilkins (“Karen”), and the
Wilkins Family Living Trust (“Trust”) (collectively, “Defendants”) demur to the
1st, 2nd, and 3rd causes of action in Plaintiff Bel Esprit Builders, Inc.’s (“Bel Esprit”)
(“Plaintiff”) complaint (“Complaint”) on the basis the causes of action fail to
state facts sufficient to allege causes of action against Defendants and are stated
ambiguously and unintelligibly.  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P.
§§430.10(e), (f), (g).)
 
Background
Plaintiff filed the operative Complaint against Defendants on January
2, 2024, alleging three causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) common
counts; and (3) foreclose a Mechanic’s Lien.
Plaintiff’s Complaint arises out of its entry into a written
contract (“Contract”) with Defendant whereby it agreed to provide services for
Ben’s and Karen’s residence located at 8181 Gould Avenue, Los Angeles,
California (“Project”).  (See Complaint
¶8, Exh. A.)  Plaintiff alleges it is,
and at all times relevant herein was, a licensed California general contractor
that specializes in construction consultation. 
(Complaint ¶8.)  Plaintiff alleges
it performed all obligations imposed upon it by the terms of the Contract except
for those excused by Defendants’ breach or prevented by Defendants’ acts.  (Complaint ¶9.)  
Plaintiff alleges the agreed price and reasonable value of the
labor and materials Plaintiff furnished to Defendant was and is the sum of
$29,063.98, and nothing was paid or credited thereon.  (Complaint ¶10.)
Plaintiff alleges Defendant became indebted to it within the last
year for labor, services, and materials rendered at the special instance and
request of Defendant and for which Defendant promised to pay Plaintiff the
reasonable value.  (Complaint ¶13.)  Plaintiff alleges the labor, services, and materials
furnished to Defendant were worth the sum of $29,063.98, and nothing was paid
or credited thereon.  (Complaint ¶13.)  Plaintiff alleges although demand was made
therefore, Defendant failed, neglected, and refused to pay the sum of
$29,063.98.  (Complaint ¶14.)  
Plaintiff alleges it duly gave Defendants a written preliminary
notice as prescribed by and in accordance with the requirements of Civil Code §3097,
and on November 13, 2023, it recorded its Mechanic’s Lien with the Los Angeles
County Recorder’s Office.  (Complaint ¶¶16-17,
Exh. B.)  Plaintiff alleges no notice of
completion of the Project and/or cessation of labor thereon was ever filed in
the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office, and at the time of the filing of
Plaintiff’s Mechanic’s Lien, ninety days had not elapsed or expired since the
completion of the Project or any cessation of labor thereon.  (Complaint ¶19.)    Plaintiff
alleges its work was necessary and required for the convenient use and
occupation of the Project.  (Complaint ¶20.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants have or claim to
have some estate, lien, right, title, or interest in or upon the Project or
some part thereof, and all such claims or liens are subject, subsequent, and
subordinate to Plaintiff’s Mechanic’s Lien.  (Complaint ¶21.)  Plaintiff alleges it is owed and seeks a
Judgment for its lien in the amount of $29,063.98 against the subject property.
 (Complaint ¶22.)  
On April 30, 2024, Defendants filed the instant demurrer.  On May 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed its
opposition.  Defendants filed their reply
on May 22, 2024.
Plaintiff objects to Defendants’ demurrer as untimely because the
demurrer was filed more than thirty days after service.  (Opposition, pg. 6.)  Plaintiff’s Complaint was served on Ben by
personal service on March 7, 2024; the Trust by substituted service on March
13, 2024; and on Karen by substituted service on March 7, 2024.  (3/13/24 POS Ben; 3/14/24 POS Trust; 3/14/24
POS Karen.)  Therefore, Ben’s and Karen’s
deadline to file a demurrer was April 6, 2024, and the Trust’s deadline was
April 12, 2024.  The instant demurrer was
filed on April 30, 2024, and was therefore untimely served by all Defendants.  However, the Court, in its discretion, will
consider Defendants’ demurrer. 
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer. 
(C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.) 
A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the
meet and confer process.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).)
Defendants’ counsel declares she met and conferred telephonically
with Plaintiff’s counsel on February 14, 2024, and the parties were unable to
resolve the issues in the demurrer. 
(Decl. of Stepanian ¶2.) 
Defendants’ counsel’s declaration is sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a).  Accordingly, the Court will consider the
instant demurrer.
 
Summary of Demurrer
Defendants demur to the 1st cause of action on the basis Defendants
are not a party to the written contract, as demonstrated by the attached
Exhibit A to Plaintiff’s complaint. 
(Demurrer, pg. 1; C.C.P. §430.10(e).) Defendants demur to the 2nd and
3rd causes of action in Plaintiff’s Complaint on the basis the causes of action
fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action against Defendants.
 (Demurrer, pg. 1; C.C.P. §§430.10(e).)  Defendants demur to all causes of action on
the basis they are uncertain.  (Demurrer,
pg. 1; C.C.P. §430.10(f).)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
          
Breach of Contract (1st COA)
“To prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract, the
plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance of the
contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4)
resulting damage to the plaintiff.”  (Richman
v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)
If a breach of contract claim “is based on alleged breach of a
written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the
complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated
by reference.”  (Harris v. Rudin,
Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.)  In some circumstances, a plaintiff may also
“plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.”  (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v.
TIG Specialty Insurance Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199.)
Plaintiff alleges it entered into a written
contract with Defendants who breached their obligation. (Complaint ¶9.)  Plaintiff attached and incorporated by
reference a true and correct copy of the alleged contract as Exhibit A.  (Complaint ¶8, Exh. A.)  A review of the Contract shows that Defendant
entered into a contract with an individual named Eric Chun, who is not named
herein as a party.  Exhibit A is a letter
addressed to “Eric Chun,” with the subject line “PROPOSAL,” and directly below
the subject line states, “Bel Esprit proposes to provide all labor and material
to accomplish the following.”  (Complaint
¶8, Exh. A.)  Defendants’ names are not
printed anywhere on the document.  There
is a signature on a line that states “approved by,” by the name of the signer
is indecipherable.
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of
action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Common Count (2nd COA)
“In the common law action of general assumpsit, it is customary to
plead an indebtedness using ‘common counts.’ In California, it has long been
settled the allegation of claims using common counts is good against special or
general demurrers. The only essential allegations of a common count are ‘(1)
the statement of indebtedness in a certain sum, (2) the consideration, i.e.,
goods sold, work done, etc., and (3) nonpayment.’” (Farmers Insurance
Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460, internal citations
omitted.)
A
demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the complaint is so bad
that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., he or she cannot reasonably
determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are
directed against him or her.¿ (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)¿ 
Plaintiff sufficiently alleges “Defendant” owes Plaintiff a sum
certain, that labor, services, and materials were rendered, and
nonpayment.  (Complaint ¶¶13-15.)  However, the Contract alleged in Plaintiff’s
1st cause of action contradicts the allegations stated in Plaintiff’s common
count cause of action because, first, none of the Defendants are named on the document
alleged to be the Contract, and second, Plaintiff’s cause of action states
“Defendant” became indebted to it but does not state which of the three
Defendants is the “Defendant” in question. 
The heading for the cause of action states the cause of action is
alleged against all three Defendants, but the factual allegations in the
Complaint do not correspond with the heading. 
Therefore, Plaintiff does not sufficiently state who is indebted to it
for common count and is uncertain.  (Khoury,
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 2nd cause of
action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Foreclosure of Mechanic’s Lien (3rd COA)
“[T]he elements of a cause of action to foreclose on a mechanic’s
lien [are]: [(1) the lienholder’s] labor, services, and materials were used in
a work of improvement[; (2)] the reasonable value of its contribution[; and
(3)] . . . the date the work was complete.” 
(Vought Construction Inc. v. Stock (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 622,
637, review denied (Jan. 25, 2023).) 
The lien claimant has the burden of establishing the validity of the
lien.  (Basic Modular Facilities, Inc.
v. Ehsanipour (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1480, 1485.)
If the facts in the exhibits contradict the facts in the
complaint, the facts stated in the exhibits take precedence.  (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001)
86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1446; Mead v. Sanwa Bank California (1998) 61
Cal.App.4th 561, 567-568; Breneric Associates v. City of Del Mar (1998)
69 Cal.App.4th 166, 180; Software Design & Application, Ltd. v. Hoefer
& Arnett, Inc. (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 472, 484.)
The written contract attached as Exhibit A to Plaintiff’s
Complaint is inconsistent with Plaintiff’s allegations in their cause of action.
 Plaintiff alleges a true and correct
copy of their mechanic’s lien is attached to their Complaint as Exhibit B.
(Complaint ¶18, Exh. B.)  Plaintiff
alleges a breach of contract against Defendants, who are not named in the
alleged contract attached to Plaintiff’s Complaint.  (Complaint ¶¶7-11, Exh. A.)  The individuals named in Exhibit B differ from
the contracting party named in the alleged Contract in Exhibit A. Therefore,
Plaintiff’s allegations are inconsistent, and this lack of clarity in
Plaintiff’s Complaint renders it uncertain, ambiguous, and subject to demurrer.  Because Plaintiff’s Exhibit A, the alleged
Contract, does not name Ben and Karen, and Plaintiff’s Exhibit B states that
such a Contract was made with Ben and Karen, Plaintiff fails to establish the
validity of Exhibit B, the lien.
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 3rd cause of
action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is sustained with
20 days leave to amend as to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd causes of action.
Moving Party to give notice.
