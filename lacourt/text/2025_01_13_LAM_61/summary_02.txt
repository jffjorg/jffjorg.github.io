And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff Stewart Lucas Murrey's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The motion is infirm because it does not attach the proposed pleading and does not address the required matters in the Rules of Court. Additionally, the proposed amendment seeks to add new causes of action against defendants who have already prevailed against Plaintiff on special motions to strike. The Judge has discretion to permit or deny the amendment of the complaint, but instances justifying the court's denial of leave to amend are rare. In this case, the motion is denied because it does not meet the required standards.
