Discussion
Yonsei Law Firm (“Firm”) seeks to be
relieved as counsel of record for Defendant (“Client”).
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See
Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
California
Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion
directed to the client (made on the Notice
of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The court may delay the effective
date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the
signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
Attorney John Heath (“Heath”) represents that “[t]here has been a
breakdown of attorney-client relationship” and that “[t]he client has fired
attorney and dissolved the corporation.” Heath requests that an in camera
hearing be conducted should the court desire further information.
Heath states that he has served the Client by mail at the Client’s last known
address with copies of the motion papers served with this declaration and that
he has confirmed, within the past 30 days, that the address is current, via
conversation.
The court
determines that the requirements of Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated above have been
sufficiently met.
Accordingly, the
motion is granted, effective upon the filing of a proof
of service showing service of the signed order upon
the Client.
The court will set an Order to
Show Cause Re: Representation of Corporation for August 1, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
