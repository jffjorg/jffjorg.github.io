And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the Los Angeles County Assessor to add 15 additional comparables to the record in an assessment appeal case. Time Warner Cable, Inc. (TWC) opposes the motion. The judge notes that, as a general rule, a hearing on a writ of administrative mandamus is conducted solely on the record of the proceeding before the administrative agency. However, the court may admit new evidence if it finds that the evidence was improperly excluded at the administrative hearing and is relevant to the case. The movant must establish the relevancy of the evidence and demonstrate that it was improperly excluded. The judge does not have sufficient information to resolve the motion because the administrative record was not provided to the court. The judge will discuss whether to deny the motion or continue the hearing with the parties.
