Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Petitioner's motion for attorney's fees under three different code sections. The Petitioner, Compton Property Group, had filed a petition for writ of mandate against the City of Compton, alleging that the City's housing element plan was not substantially in compliance with state law. The Petitioner had sought attorney's fees under Government Code section 65589.5, Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.420.

The judge found that the Petitioner is not entitled to attorney's fees under Government Code section 65589.5 because none of the situations identified in the code section had occurred in this case. The judge also denied the Petitioner's motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 because the Petitioner had ample financial incentive to pursue the case and did not make sufficient efforts to resolve the case before filing the action.

The judge further denied the Petitioner's motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.420 because the Petitioner had not proved the genuineness of any matter that Respondent denied and the case had been resolved by Respondent accepting the Petitioner's preliminary application.

The judge also declined to find that the Petitioner is the prevailing party at this point and dismissed the first and second causes of action as moot. The judge bifurcated the third cause of action and transferred that claim to an independent calendar court for trial.
