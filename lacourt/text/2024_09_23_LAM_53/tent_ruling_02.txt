 Case Number:  24STCV24108    Hearing Date:   September 23, 2024    Dept:  53 Young
v. Carpenters Southwest Administrative Corporation  24STCV24108 

Ex
Parte Application – 9/23/24
On September
19, 2024, plaintiffs filed an ex parte application for temporary restraining
order and order to show cause re preliminary injunction.  Plaintiff’s ex parte application has been set
for hearing on September 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 53.  But, pursuant to Local Rules 2.8(b) and 2.9,
plaintiff’s ex parte application for order to show cause and temporary
restraining order is required to be heard in Department 82.  The ex parte application has therefore been set
to be heard in the wrong department.  
The
court therefore orders plaintiff’s ex parte application to be taken off
calendar without prejudice to setting it for hearing in Department 82.  
The
court orders plaintiffs to give notice of this order.
