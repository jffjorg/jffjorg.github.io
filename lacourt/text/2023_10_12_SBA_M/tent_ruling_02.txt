BACKGROUND
            On March 22, 2023, Megna Real Estate
Investments, Inc. filed a complaint against Center Street Lending VIII SPE, LLC
and Prestige Default Services, LLC for (1) violation of Civil Code §2923.5, (2)
violation of Civil Code §2923.7, and (3) violation of Bus. and Prof. Code §17200.  
            On April 18, 2023, plaintiff filed a
FAC for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, (3) slander of title, and (4) conversion.
            On April 20, 2023, Center Street
Lending filed a notice of related cases.
            On May 10, 2023, the court denied
plaintiff’s ex parte application for a TRO to enjoin defendants from selling
property pursuant to a trustee’s sale.
            On June 22, 2023, plaintiff filed a
notice of automatic stay.
            On June 27, 2023, plaintiff filed a
notice of stay of proceedings.
            On July 7, 2023, as to a notice of
related case, the court found that the herein case and CVSW2302442 and
CVSW2302453 are related but that the cases are not to be transferred from one
county to another.  The court also stated
that plaintiff filed bankruptcy but that does not stay the case.  There is no cross-complaint against
plaintiff.  
            On September 12, 2023, the court
granted plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel.  The court notes that there has been no proof
of service filed as to the order on plaintiff.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context. 
Taylor v. City of Los Angeles
Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. 
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.”  SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.  “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.
DISCUSSION
            Defendant Center Street Lending VIII
SPE, LLC (“Center Street Lending”) demurs to each cause of action in the FAC on
the grounds that they fail to state sufficient allegations to constitute a
cause of action and are uncertain.
            The FAC alleges that on April 7,
2021, plaintiff took out a loan mortgage against the property from Center
Street Lending VIII SPE, LLC in the amount of $1,387,500.  FAC, ¶16. 
Pursuant to the deed of trust, a lender must apply plaintiff’s payments
according to the deed of trust.  Covenant
(f) of the deed of trust holds that plaintiff’s payments will be applied in the
following order:  (2) interest due under
the Note; (3) principal due under the Note. 
Id., ¶17.  Plaintiff made timely
payments until November 2022.  Id., ¶18.  On December 21, 2022, Prestige, on behalf of
Center Street Lending, recorded a Notice of Default against the property.  Id., ¶19. 
Prestige caused the recording of the Notice of Default, showing
plaintiff’s past due balance as $456,146.45. 
Id., ¶20.  This is while Center
Street Lending issued a mortgage statement on February 14, 2023 to plaintiff
reflecting a past due balance of $280,689.97. 
At the time of recording, the Notice of Default, Prestige and Center
Street Lending had known plaintiff had made significant payments and had
lowered the past due balance to $280,689.97. 
Id., ¶21.  Despite this knowledge,
Center Street Lending failed to apply plaintiff’s payment to plaintiff’s
account and instead deemed the payment a partial payment and placed it into a
suspense account, and wrongfully recorded the Notice of Default, thereby
breaching the loan agreement between the parties.  Id, ¶22. 
On March 30, 2023, Prestige, on behalf of Center Street Lending,
recorded a Notice of Trustee’s Sale against the property.  Id., ¶23. 
                        1st cause
of action for breach of contract
“The
elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are:  (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance
or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting
damages to plaintiff.”  Coles v.
Glaser (2016) 2 Cal. App. 5th 384, 391. 

The FAC
alleges that Center Street Lending is in breach of contract by applying
plaintiff’s payment to a suspense account, rather than to plaintiff’s principal
balance.  Pursuant to the DOT, the lender
must apply plaintiff’s payments according to the DOT.  Covenant (f) of the DOT holds that
plaintiff’s payments will be applied in the following order:  (2) interest due under the Note; (3) principal
due under the Note.  FAC, ¶27.  Plaintiff made timely payments until November
2022.  Id., ¶28.  Prestige caused the recording of the NOD,
showing plaintiff’s past due balance as $456,146.45.  Id., ¶29. 
This is while, Center Street Lending issued a mortgage statement on
February 14, 2023 to plaintiff reflecting a past due balance of
$280,689.97.  Id., ¶30.  At the time of recording the NOD, defendants
had known plaintiff had made significant payments and had lowered the past due
balance to $280,689.97.  Id., ¶31.  Despite this knowledge, Center Street Lending
failed to apply plaintiff’s payment to plaintiff’s account and instead, deemed
the payment a partial payment and placed it into a suspense account, and
wrongfully recording the NOD, thereby breaching the loan agreement between the
parties.  Id., ¶32.  Plaintiff suffered actual damages, including
inflated mortgage payments resulting from the breach of their agreement,
damaged credit, attorney’s fees, and any other damages according to proof at
trial.  Id., ¶33.
            Defendant argues that plaintiff has
not alleged any provision that could have been breached.  As to “Covenant (f)” of the deed of trust, it
makes no requirement as to “applying payments to interest and principal.”  See FAC, Exh. A.  Rather, Covenant (f) lists the beneficiary’s
security interest and specifically references and incorporates the terms of the
promissory note.  Further, defendant
contends, because plaintiff is “so clearly and admittedly in default,” it has
not shown actual damages resulting from any purported breach or that the
alleged actions of defendant interfered with its ability to perform (i.e., make
contractual payments).  Defendant further
argues that plaintiff has not alleged its own performance under the deed of
trust, including any payments made after November 2022.  Also, defendant asserts, the loan has matured,
and plaintiff has not shown that it repaid the loan.
            The court finds that the allegations
are insufficient as argued by defendant.
            The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE
TO AMEND.
                        2nd cause
of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing
“Every contract imposes upon each
party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its
enforcement.”  Hicks v. E.T. Legg
& Associates (2001) 89 Cal. App. 4th 496, 508.  “[T]he scope of conduct prohibited by the
covenant of good faith is circumscribed by the purposes and express terms of
the contract.”  Id. at 509.  “The covenant of good faith and fair dealing .
. . exists . . . to prevent one contracting party from unfairly frustrating the
other party’s right to receive the benefits of the agreement actually made.”  Guz v. Bechtel National Inc. (2000) 24
Cal.4th 317, 349.  Allegations of breach
of the covenant of good faith that do not go beyond a statement of a mere
contract breach may be disregarded as superfluous.  See Bionghi v. Metropolitan Water District
(1999) 70 Cal. App. 4th 1358, 1370. 
            The FAC alleges that in November
2022, plaintiff tendered a timely mortgage payment as required under the
DOT.  However, although defendant’s
servicer confirmed application of the payment, plaintiff later learned that
this payment was not applied to plaintiff’s account and was instead placed into
a suspense account, thereby interfering with plaintiff’s ability to make
payments on their loan according to the terms of the DOT.  In doing so, defendant breached the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing by interfering with plaintiff’s ability
to make payments under its loan.  FAC, ¶37.
Defendant argues the same as under
the 1st cause of action.
The court finds that the
allegations are insufficient to constitute a cause of action as argued by
defendant.
            The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE
TO AMEND.
 
            
 
                        3rd cause
of action for slander of title
“The elements of the slander of
title tort are (1) a publication, (2) without privilege or justification, (3)
falsity, and (4) direct pecuniary loss.” 
Weeden v. Hoffman (2021) 70 Cal. App. 5th 269, 293.  Civil Code §2924(d) extends the communications
privilege of Section 47 to the mailing, publication, and delivery of notices of
default, as well as the performance of the procedures set forth in Sections
2920 through 2944.10 regarding mortgages. 
“[A] slander of title claim has been held to be subject to a litigation
privilege defense.”  Id.  Where the litigation privilege provides a
complete defense to a slander of title claim, such claim may be struck from the
complaint.  Id.  
            The FAC alleges that within the last
year, defendant willfully, wrongfully, without justification, and without
privilege, published and caused to be recorded foreclosure documents and other
documents that cast doubt on plaintiff’s ownership of the property.  FAC, ¶41. 
As discussed supra, those documents were invalid or recorded improperly
and caused doubt to be cast on plaintiff’s title to the property.  Id., ¶42. 
Defendants’ publication and recording of those documents directly
impaired plaintiff’s right of ownership in and to the property.  Id., ¶43.
            Defendant argues that slander of
title is inapplicable to privileged communications such as the notice of
default and sale.  Defendant further
contends that plaintiff has not pled sufficiently that defendant was without
privilege or justification in recording the notice of default and notice of
sale as authorized by the deed of trust. 
Also, defendant asserts, the loan has matured, and plaintiff makes no
allegation that the loan was paid off. 
Defendant further argues that plaintiff has failed to plead actual
pecuniary loss (rather than a threat of potential loss).
            The court finds that the allegations
are insufficient as argued by defendant. 
Plaintiff’s claim arises from defendants’ issuance of the Notice of
Default and the Notice of Trustee’s Sale, both privileged publications under
Civil Code §47.  See Weeden,
supra. 
            The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND.
                        4th cause
of action for conversion
A cause
of action for conversion requires the following elements:  (1) plaintiff's ownership or right to
possession of personal property; (2) defendant’s disposition of the property
inconsistent with plaintiff’s rights; and (3) resulting damages.  Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General
Corp. (2007) 148 Cal. App. 4th 97, 119. “ It is not necessary that there be
a manual taking of the property; it is only necessary to show an assumption of
control or ownership over the property, or that the alleged converter has
applied the property to his own use.”  Spates
v. Dameron Hospital Association (2003) 114 Cal. App. 4th 208, 221. 
The FAC alleges that Center Street
Lending wrongfully exercised control over plaintiff’s personal property.  FAC, ¶48. 
Plaintiff had a right to have its payments applied toward the interest
and principal payments under the Note. 
Id., ¶49.  Center Street Lending
substantially interfered with plaintiff’s payments by knowingly or
intentionally preventing plaintiff from access to the payments when it applied
the payments to a suspense account.  Id.,
¶50.  Plaintiff did not consent to
applying the payments toward a suspense account.  Id., ¶51.
Defendant argues that this tort “is
clearly inapplicable to this case” and that plaintiff admittedly obtained the
loan and agreed to the terms of the promissory note and deed of trust.  Defendant asserts that because plaintiff owes
money to defendant under the terms of the loan, “it is impossible that
Defendant has obtained Plaintiff’s property by a wrongful act.”
The court finds that the
allegations are insufficient as argued by defendant.  The alleged facts do not support plaintiff’s
“ownership or right to possession” of the payments made to defendant.
The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND.
            Defendant is ordered to give notice
of ruling.
