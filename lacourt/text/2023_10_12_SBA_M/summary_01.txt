And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to reclassify the case from limited to unlimited civil jurisdiction. The case was originally filed as a limited civil action, but the plaintiff, Adrienne L. Spruth, has demonstrated that the potential holdover damages exceed $25,000 due to the delay in proceedings and the defendant's continued occupancy of the subject property. The court has ordered the case to be reclassified as an unlimited civil case and has directed the plaintiff to pay the reclassification fee.
