  Case Number:  21STCV41913    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ ELIZABETH'S FOOD CO., INC., Plaintiff(s), vs. ALEJANDRO CASTRO, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 21STCV41913 Hearing Date: October 30, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER (1) DENYING MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT, AND (2) CONTINUING MOTION FOR CLAIM OF EXEMPTION  I. MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT A. Background On November 12, 2021, plaintiff Elizabeth's Food Co., Inc. (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against defendants Alejandro Castro (“Castro”), Juan Leon, Olympic Pallets, Inc. and Does 1 through 10 alleging defendants Castro and Juan Leon took Plaintiff’s property by selling and converting its value into cash to Olympic Pallets, and taking those proceeds for themselves while they were employed by Plaintiff in its warehouse. The complaint sets forth three causes of action for (1) conversion, (2) negligence, and (3) sale and concealment of stolen property. Defendants Juan Leon and Olympic Pallets, Inc. have since been dismissed from the action. (Req. for Dismissal, May 23, 2022 & Aug. 25, 2022.) B. Relevant Procedural History On August 9, 2022, Plaintiff filed proof of service that the summons and complaint was served on Castro via substituted service to co-occupant “John Doe” at 9815 Madison Ave., South Gate, CA 90280 (“9815 Madison Ave.”) on August 4, 2022. (Proof of Service, Aug. 9, 2022.) On November 22, 2022, Plaintiff obtained entry of default against Castro. On July 25, 2023, default judgment was entered against Castro in the amount of $54,883.82.  On January 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed proof of service of the Notice of Entry of Judgment on Castro at 9815 Madison Ave. On August 2, 2024, Castro filed the instant motion to set aside entry of default and default judgment.  On October 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion. Any reply was due on or before October 23, 2024. No reply has been filed to date. C. Legal Standard CCP § 473.5, subdivision (a) provides, “When service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or default judgment has been entered against him or her in the action, he or she may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action. The notice of motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has been entered. (CCP § 473.5, subd. (a).) A motion to set aside under CCP § 473.5 based on lack of proper service of the action, such that defendant had no actual notice of the action in time to defend, requires the defendant to act with diligence upon learning of judgment. (Trackman v. Kenney (2010) 187 Cal. App. 4th 175, 180.) “[Citation] [“it does not require a showing that plaintiff did anything improper.... [T]he defaulting defendant simply asserts that he or she did not have actual notice]; [Citation].” (Ibid.) “Upon a finding by the court that the motion was made within the period permitted by subdivision (a) and that his or her lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect, it may set aside the default or default judgment on whatever terms as may be just and allow the party to defend the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (c).) Accordingly, “ ‘a default judgment entered against a defendant who was not served with a summons in the manner prescribed by statute is void.’ ” (Ibid.) Whether the lack of jurisdiction appears on the face of the judgment roll, or is shown by extrinsic evidence for a judgment that appears valid on its face, “in either case the judgment is for all purposes a nullity—past, present and future.” (OC Interior Servs., LLC v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC (2017) 7 Cal. App. 5th 1318, 1331.) If the judgment is not void on its face, the time limitations of Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5 apply. (Trackman v. Kenney (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 175, 180-81; Schekel v. Resnik (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 3-4 (“[t]he Rogers court held that the time limitation set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5 applies by analogy to motions for relief from default judgment valid on its face but otherwise void for improper service” [citing Rogers v. Silverman (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1124.]).) D. Discussion 1. Section 473.5(a) “An individual may be served by substitute service only after a good faith effort at personal service has first been made: the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the summons and complaint ‘cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered’ to defendants. [Citations.] Two or three attempts to personally serve a defendant at a proper place ordinarily qualifies as ‘reasonable diligence.’” (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 389.) If the summons and complaint cannot be personally delivered with reasonable diligence, then a copy may be served at the person’s “dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, in the presence of a competent member of the household or a person apparently in charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office box…who shall be informed of the contents thereof and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the person to be served…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).) The proof of service Plaintiff filed satisfies the requirements of Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20 and is valid on its face. Further, because service was effectuated by a registered process server, Plaintiff is entitled to a presumption of valid service. (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara¿(2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390; see also Evid. Code § 647.) This requires Castro to submit sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of valid service.¿¿ Castro declares he moved out of 9815 Madison Ave. in October 2021 after marital disagreements at home, that he did not reside at that location on August 4, 2022, and that no males resided at 9815 Madison Ave. (Castro Decl. ¶¶ 5, 7, 8.) Outside of his declaration, Castro’s admits that he never filed a change of address, but contends he was not trying to hide because his gas bill and a DMV notice was mailed to him at 909 N. Sloan Avenue, Compton, CA 90221, attached as Exhibits 6 and 7. The Court notes that Exhibits 6 and 7 are completely illegible. Further, Castro contends that according to the affidavit of diligence, the process server was informed that he did not live there. Plaintiff’s counsel declares Castro did have actual notice of the lawsuit, because Plaintiff’s counsel reached out to Defendant’s counsel, who represented Castro in the separate wage and hour arbitration proceeding (JAMS Case No. 1220073726), and inquired whether Castro’s counsel would accept service on Castro’s behalf. (Park Decl. ¶ 4.) Additionally, Plaintiff proffers the deposition transcript of Castro, wherein his February 21, 2024 testimony in JAMS Case No. 1220073726 provides the following testimony: “Q. And where do you currently reside? A. My legal address is 9815 Madison Avenue, South Gate, California, 90280. Q. Do you have other addresses? A. Yes. Q. What other addresses do you have? A. Friends', family members' addresses. Q. Okay. So my question is, where do you currently reside? Do you reside at 9815 Madison Avenue? A. Yes and no. Q. Okay. Could you explain why it's yes or no? A. After the situation, I had marital issues. Q. Okay. So other than 9815 Madison Avenue, what's the other address where you reside? A. I would like to keep that personal.” (Park Decl. ¶ 2; Exh. 2 at 15:25 & 16:1-16.) Based on the conflicting evidence presented, and the inferences drawn therefrom, the Court finds that Castro has not overcome the presumption of valid service at 9815 Madison Ave. and that he lacked actual notice of the lawsuit. (Wyoming Pac. Oil Co. v. Preston (1959) 171 Cal. App. 2d 735, 741 [When conflicting evidence is presented at a hearing of a motion to set aside a judgment, the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, its construction and the inferences to be drawn therefrom is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and should not be disturbed absent a clear showing of abuse].) Therefore, the time limitations of Section 473.5 apply. The Court notes that because Plaintiff filed a proof of service demonstrating Castro was served with a copy of the entry of judgment on January 2, 2024, this Motion should have been filed no later than 180 days later, that is, July 1, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., §473.5, subd. (a).) Castro’s request for relief under this section was filed on August 2, 2024 and therefore untimely. Further, it is not accompanied by a copy of his proposed responsive pleading as required by Code Civ. Proc. § 473.5, subdivision (b).  As a result, the request for relief from default and default judgment on this basis is denied. For the same reason as above, Castro’s alternative request to quash service is denied. 2. Section 473(b) Castro argues that if the Court determines that service was proper, that default be set aside pursuant to CCP §473(b) because of inadvertence, mistake, surprise, or excusable neglect, and that he filed the motion within a reasonable amount of time. CCP § 473(b) states, in pertinent part (emphasis added), “Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” Unlike the mandatory relief provision pertaining to attorney mistake, the general rule is that the six-month period within which to bring a motion to vacate under the discretionary provision of § 473 runs from the date of the default and not from the judgment taken thereafter. (Rutan v. Summit Sports, Inc. (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 965, 970.) Here, the date of default was November 22, 2022. Thus, the Motion under this section should have been filed no later than six months later, which was May 22, 2023. The instant motion was filed on August 2, 2024. Further, Castro failed to provide an accompanying copy of the Answer or other proposed pleading to be filed. As such, the Court is unable to grant relief under this section. D. Conclusion Castro’s motion to set aside default and default judgment is DENIED.  II. MOTION FOR DETERMINING CLAIM OF EXEMPTION Background On January 11, 2024, Elizabeth's Food Co., Inc. (“Judgment Creditor”) filed an Application for Issuance of Writ of Execution, Possession or Sale against Alejandro Castro (“Judgment Debtor”) in the amount of $54,883.82.  On April 29, 2024, Judgment Creditor obtained a Writ of Execution. Judgment Creditor provides that on May 29, 2024, Judgment Debtor filed a Claim of Exemption with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (“the Levying Officer”) claiming that the funds in the bank account, specifically the January 10, 2024 Workers’ Compensation Compromise and Release Settlement in the amount of $14,875.00, are exempt pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 704.130 and 704.160. Judgment Creditor avers that the Claim was served on its counsel on May 31, 2024 by the Leving Officer by U.S. mail. On June 13, 2024, Judgment Creditor filed the instant motion an order determining the claim of exemption. Judgment Creditor contends that Judgment Debtor has failed to meet his burden of tracing the exempt funds as required by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 703.080. Judgment Creditor asserts that Judgment Debtor has failed to provide any evidence, and that his Claim of Exemption must therefore be denied. To date, Judgment Debtor has not submitted any brief or other documents in connection with the motion. Legal Standard “Except as otherwise provided by statute, property that has been levied upon may be claimed to be exempt as provided in this article.”¿(Code Civ. Proc., §703.510.) A claimant may make a claim of exemption by following the procedure in CCP §703.520. CCP §703.580 provides:¿¿ The claim of exemption and notice of opposition to the claim of exemption constitute the pleadings, subject to the power of the court to permit amendments in the interest of justice.¿ At a hearing under this section, the exemption claimant has the burden of proof.¿ The claim of exemption is deemed controverted by the notice of opposition to the claim of exemption and both shall be received in evidence. If no other evidence is offered, the court, if satisfied that sufficient facts are shown by the claim of exemption (including the financial statement if one is required) and the notice of opposition, may make its determination thereon. If not satisfied, the court shall order the hearing continued for the production of other evidence, oral or documentary.¿ At the conclusion of the hearing, the court shall determine by order whether or not the property is exempt in whole or in part. Subject to Section 703.600, the order is determinative of the right of the judgment creditor to apply the property to the satisfaction of the judgment. No findings are required in a proceeding under this section.¿ The court clerk shall promptly transmit a certified copy of the order to the levying officer. Subject to Section 703.610, the levying officer shall, in compliance with the order, release the property or apply the property to the satisfaction of the money judgment.¿ Unless otherwise ordered by the court, if an exemption is not determined within the time provided by Section 703.570, the property claimed to be exempt shall be released.¿ "Money in a judgment debtor’s deposit account that is not otherwise exempt under this chapter is exempt to the extent necessary for the support of the judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgment debtor." (Code Civ. Proc., § 704.225.) "Money in the judgment debtor’s deposit account in an amount equal to or less than the minimum basic standard of adequate care for a family of four for Region 1, established by Section 11452 of the Welfare and Institutions Code and as annually adjusted by the State Department of Social Services pursuant to Section 11453 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, is exempt without making a claim." (Code Civ. Proc., § 704.220.) (This amount at the time of the Senate Bill deliberation was $1,724.)¿ At a hearing on a claim of exemption, “the [judgment debtor] has the burden of proof” in demonstrating that the property claimed exempt is indeed exempt. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 703.520, subd. (b), 703.580, subds. (b), (c).) In meeting this burden, the judgment debtor must establish the right by evidence or facts; an affidavit which merely follows the language of the statute and states nothing more than conclusions of law is insufficient.¿(Le Font v.¿Rankin¿(1959)¿167¿Cal.App.2d 433, 435.) Discussion “Within 10 days after service of the notice of claim of exemption, a judgment creditor who opposes the claim of exemption shall file with the court a notice of opposition to the claim of exemption and a notice of motion for an order determining the claim of exemption and shall file with the levying officer a copy of the notice of opposition and a copy of the notice of motion. Upon the filing of the copies of the notice of opposition and notice of motion, the levying officer shall promptly file the claim of exemption with the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.550.) The Court does not have complete information to rule on this hearing because the claim of exemption itself is missing. The Court cannot rely solely on Judgment Creditor’s general argument that Judgment Debtor does not satisfy his burden without assessing the actual claim. The Court will continue the hearing so that the defect may be cured.¿ Conclusion Based on the foregoing, the Hearing on Claim of Exemption/Third-Party Claim is CONTINUED to________________.   Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: October 29, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
