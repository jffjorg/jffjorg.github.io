And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying General Motors LLC's (GM) motion for summary judgment in the case of Edder Rodriguez vs. General Motors LLC. The case involves claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (SBA) for defects and nonconformities in a 2012 Chevrolet Sonic purchased by Rodriguez. GM argued that Rodriguez lacks standing to bring the claims because he did not provide sufficient evidence that he is a "buyer" under the SBA. The Judge found that GM failed to meet its burden of showing that there is no triable issue of material fact and that there is sufficient evidence to support Rodriguez's claims. The Judge also found that Rodriguez's testimony and supporting documents, including the Security Agreement and Vehicle Delivery Report, provide a measure of evidence that he purchased the Vehicle. The Judge concludes that GM's motion for summary judgment is denied and that the case will proceed to trial.
