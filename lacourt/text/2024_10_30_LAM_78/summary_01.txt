And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Elizabeth's Food Co., Inc. v. Alejandro Castro, et al. The court has denied Castro's motion to set aside default and default judgment, finding that Castro has not overcome the presumption of valid service at 9815 Madison Ave. and that he lacked actual notice of the lawsuit.

The court has also denied Castro's motion to quash service, as it was filed outside of the time limit allowed by law.

Additionally, the court has continued the hearing on Castro's claim of exemption, as the claim itself is missing and the court cannot rule on it without assessing the actual claim.

The court has ordered Castro to give notice of the continued hearing.
