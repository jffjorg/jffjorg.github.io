And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to quash service of summons filed by defendant Alvin Smith, Jr. The motion was filed on August 14, 2024, and the Court granted the application to serve the summons and complaint by posting on September 18, 2024. On October 4, 2024, the plaintiffs filed proof of service that the summons and complaint were served in accordance with the approved application by posting, which creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper. Despite Smith's claim that he was not personally served with the summons and complaint because he found them on the floor outside the premises, the Court finds that Smith has actual notice of the action. The Court concludes that the motion to quash service of summons is denied.
