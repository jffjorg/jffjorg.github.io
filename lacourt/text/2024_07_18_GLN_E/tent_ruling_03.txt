Case No: 23GDCV02091
Trial Date: UNSET
Case Name: GEVORK ADJEMIAN v. BMW NORTH AMERICA, LLC
TENTATIVE
RULING ON MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff,
Gevork Adjemian, filed the instant action against BMW North America LLC on
10/02/2023 for violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
 
ANALYSIS
It
is somewhat confusing as to what is going on in this file. 


For purposes of
potentially clearing up the confusion, the Court will cite the portions of the
tentative ruling from the 6/27/2024 Minute Order that did not pertain to the
issue of sanctions:
 
TENTATIVE RULING
On 1/25/2024, Plaintiff filed three
motions to compel further responses – RFAs Set One, RFPs Set One, and SROGs Set
One. Confusingly, there is only one motion to compel further responses on the
6/27/2024 Calendar. The single motion on the 6/27/2024 Calendar has a
Reservation ID ending in 8082. What Plaintiff did was use the same Reservation
ID for all three motions. This is improper, as Plaintiff should have had three
Reservation IDs so that three motions were on calendar. By Plaintiff filing
three motions under the guise of one motion, Plaintiff unfairly jumps ahead of
other litigants and does not properly allow the Court to manage its calendar.
Further, by only using one Reservation ID for three motions, Plaintiff deprives
the Court of filing fees it is otherwise entitled to collect. “[P]ayment of
filing fees is both mandatory and jurisdictional.” (Hu vs. Silgan Containers
Corp. (1999) 70 Cal. App. 4th 1261, 1269.)
 
Based on Plaintiff’s Reply papers,
Plaintiff indicates that it withdrew its motion to compel further responses re:
RFPs. Therefore, it appears as if Plaintiff wants only two motions heard – RFAs
Set One and SROGs Set One.
 
Before the hearing, Plaintiff is ordered
to pay the additional filing fees if it wants its two motions heard.
 
As to the merits of the two motions that
are allegedly on calendar – RFAs and SROGs, Set One – Defendant served
supplemental responses on June 14, 2024, which would have been after Plaintiff
filed the motion(s) and after Defendant already opposed the motions. 
 
Because Defendant provided supplemental
responses, Plaintiff’s motions to compel further re: RFAs and SROGs Set One are
denied as moot. 
 
Typically, the issue of sanctions would
not be moot because Defendant didn’t serve supplemental responses until after
the motion was filed; however, Plaintiff did not request sanctions. 
 
As to the Reply’s arguments that the
supplemental responses are not proper, those issues are not before the Court.
If Plaintiff has issues with the supplemental responses, Plaintiff would have
to follow all applicable law and code sections of the CCP to file a motion to
compel further responses directed at the supplemental responses.
 
…
 
Arguments are made by both parties. 
 
On the Court's own motion, the Case
Management Conference scheduled for 06/27/2024, and Hearing on Motion to Compel
Further Discovery Responses {Res ID:_8082} scheduled for 06/27/2024 are continued
to 07/18/24 at 08:30 AM in Department E at Glendale Courthouse.
 
Court orders counsel to meet and confer
telephonically in the next 5 business days to attempt to resolve discovery
issues. 
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
 
(Min. Order 6/27/2024, p. 1-3.)
 
Confusion
The
motion on Calendar for 7/18/2024 is titled “Hearing on Motion to Compel Further
Discovery Responses {Res ID:_8082}.”
 
As noted in the 6/27/2024 Minute Order, all three initial
motions and moving papers pertaining to compelling further responses to RFAs,
RFPs, and SROGs, Set One, contained a Res ID ending in 8082 and the Court noted
that this was improper. 
 
There are two motions on the 7/19/2024 Calendar titled
“Hearing on Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses To Plaintiff’s Set One
Special Interrogatories [Res ID: _2796]” and “Hearing on Motion to Compel
Further Discovery Responses To Plaintiff’s Set One Request For Admissions [Res
ID:_1230].” These two motions were filed on 6/26/2024, a day before the
6/27/2024 hearing, and seek responses to the same requests as those sought in
the RFA and SROG motions initially filed when using the Res ID ending in 8082.
The Court is assuming that the two motions filed on 6/26/2024 pertaining to
RFAs and SROGs were filed because of the fact that Plaintiff did not properly
pay reservation fees when it initially filed three motions using the Res ID
ending in 8082.
 
Therefore, the Court requests clarification about Res
ID 2796 and 1230.
 
Further, while the Reply argued that Plaintiff
withdrew its motion to compel further responses to RFPs, the Court will hear
argument. There are three motions on calendar – one on 7/18/2024 and two on 7/19/2024.
It appears as if the 7/18/2024 motion pertains to RFPs because Res ID 2796
pertains to SROGs and Res ID 1230 pertains to RFAs. However, the motion on
calendar for 7/18/2024 (Res ID 8082) does not specify which discovery tool it
pertains to. To the Court’s understanding, Movant can withdraw its own motion
on its own accord using the Court Reservation system. Movant should do so if it
seeks to do that. The Court will hear argument.
 
Discussion
As
to the merits of all of these motions, they all appear to be moot. Reply
appears to concede the RFP motion should be off calendar. As to RFAs and SROGs,
the Reply to the RFA motion indicated that Defendant served supplemental
responses to SROGs and RFAs on June 14, 2024, which was after Defendant filed
its Opposition. As the Court previously noted, compelling further responses to
RFAs and SROGs is moot because the moving papers and the responses in the
separate statements in the moving papers were not based on the supplemental
responses and thus not before the Court. The arguments in Reply that the
supplemental responses are not proper is unavailing, because those supplemental
responses were not put forth before the Court in the moving separate
statements. 
 
On 7/15/2024 the Parties filed a Joint Statement which
said:
 
The Court on its own motion continued all
hearings on Plaintiff’s motions to compel to July 18, 2024 at 8:30 AM. The
Court directed the parties to confer telephonically in advance of the continued
hearings date. The Court advised that it will consider the issue of sanctions
at the continued hearing date. 
 
The parties have met and conferred, after
which, on July 12, 2024, Defendant served (unverified) second supplemental
responses to all the remaining special interrogatories and requests for
admissions at issue. Defendant’s second supplemental responses to requests for
admissions and special interrogatories are attached as exhibits 1 and 2,
respectively. 
 
Plaintiff has reviewed the second
supplemental responses recently served, and (provided that verifications are
promptly served) Plaintiff has determined the following: 
 
- Defendant’s second supplemental
responses to requests for admissions belatedly resolve Plaintiff’s concerns as
to requests for admissions; 
 
- Defendant’s second supplemental
responses to special interrogatories nos. 3, 4, 9, and 10 resolve Plaintiff’s
concerns as to those interrogatories; 
 
- Plaintiff still finds Defendant’s second
supplemental responses to special interrogatories nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
remain deficient. 
 
Because Plaintiff’s concerns as to
responses to requests for admissions and some special interrogatories are
belatedly addressed, the Court has indicated intention to hear on the issue of
sanctions, and the register of actions reflects hearings on both July 18, and
19, the parties here update the Court and ask the Court to indicate how it
would like to proceed. E.g., whether and when the hearings will go forward as
to the remaining responses and sanctions, or if the Court desires for its
convenience to instead reschedule the hearings to a later date for additional
briefing regarding the supplemental responses.
 
(Joint Stipulation filed 7/15/2024.)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
The
Court still finds that the issue of compelling further responses is moot. Not
only did the Reply indicate that supplemental responses were provided after
filing the initial motions, but the Joint Stipulation indicated that second
supplemental responses were filed on 7/12/2024. None of the supplemental or second
supplemental responses were put before the Court in the initial moving papers.
Therefore, the Court tentatively plans to deny the motions to compel further
responses as moot (with respect to compelling further responses).
 
Sanctions
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2030.300(d).)
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (CCP § 2033.290(d).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
The Court will hear argument as to sanctions. Neither
Plaintiff’s moving papers nor Defendant’s Opposition requested sanctions. The
Court is concerned with notice issues since neither party requested sanctions.
