And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of oral contract and has sustained it without leave to amend. The Court finds that the allegations in the complaint do not state a cause of action for breach of oral contract because the contract is barred by the Statute of Frauds. The Court also finds that the contract is not capable of being performed within a year, as alleged by the Plaintiff.

The Court will hear argument on the cause of action titled "Common Counts", as it is unclear what this cause of action is.

The Court has granted the motion to strike the fourth cause of action for unfair competition without prejudice. The Court finds that the Plaintiff did not oppose the motion to strike and that the cause of action is moot in light of the ruling.

The Court will hear argument on the demurrer to the second and third causes of action, but will not make a ruling on these causes of action at this time.
