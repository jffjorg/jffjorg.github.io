And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses in the case of GEVORK ADJEMIAN v. BMW NORTH AMERICA, LLC. The plaintiff, GEVORK ADJEMIAN, filed three motions to compel further responses using the same Reservation ID, which is improper. The defendant, BMW NORTH AMERICA, LLC, served supplemental responses on June 14, 2024, which would have been after the plaintiff filed the motion(s) and after the defendant already opposed the motions. Therefore, the judge is denying the motions to compel further responses as moot. The judge will also hear argument as to sanctions, as neither party requested them. The judge is concerned with notice issues and will consider the issue of sanctions at the continued hearing date.
