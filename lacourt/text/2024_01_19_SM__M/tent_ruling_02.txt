Health System- So. Cal., et al.
CASE NO.:                21STCV07431
MOTION:                  Motion to Compel Further Responses 
HEARING DATE:   1/19/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
            In
the absence of contrary court order, a civil litigant’s right to discovery is
broad. “[A]ny party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged,
that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action . . . if
the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (CCP § 2017.010;
see Davies v. Superior Court
(1984) 36 Cal.3d 291, 301.) “For discovery purposes, information is relevant if
it ‘might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for
trial, or facilitating settlement.’ [Citation] Admissibility is not the test
and information, unless privileged, is discoverable if it might reasonably lead
to admissible evidence. [Citation] These rules are applied liberally in favor
of discovery.” (Gonzales v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539,
1546.) 
 
            A motion to compel further responses
to a demand for inspection or production of documents (RPD) may be brought
based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or
incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections. (CCP§ 2031.310(c).) A motion to compel
further responses to requests for production “shall set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.”
(CCP. § 2031.310(b)(1).) “To establish ‘good cause,’ the burden is on the
moving party to show both: [¶] Relevance to the subject matter (e.g., how the
information in the documents would tend to prove or disprove some issue in the
case); and [¶] Specific facts justifying discovery (e.g., why such information
is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial.)
[Citations.] [¶] The fact that there is no alternative source for the
information sought is an important factor in establishing ‘good cause’ for
inspection. But it is not essential in every case.” (Edmon & Karnow,
California Practice Guide: Civ. Proc. Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2017) ¶
8:1495.6.) 
 
Service of a proper deposition
notice obligates a party or “party-affiliated” witness (officer, director,
managing agent or employee of party) to attend and testify, as well as produce
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for
inspection and copying. (CCP § 2025.280(a).) If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party deponent fails to appear, proceed with the deposition, or
produce documents or tangible things for inspection without having served a
valid objection under CCP § 2025.410, the deposing party may move for an order
compelling attendance, testimony, and production. (CCP § 2025.450(a).) Further,
if a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent's
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production. (CCP § 2025.480(a).) The moving party must lodge a
certified copy of any relevant portions of the transcript of the deposition not
less than five days prior to the hearing on the motion. (CCP § 2025.480(h).) If
the court determines that the answer or production sought is subject to
discovery, it shall order that the answer be given or the production be made on
the resumption of the deposition. (CCP § 2025.480(i).)
 
            A motion to compel further must be
noticed within 45 days of the
service of a response, or any supplemental response, or on or before any
specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party
have agreed in writing. Otherwise, the propounding party waives any right
to compel further response to the inspection demand. (See, e.g., CCP §
2031.310(c).)
 
            Motions to compel further responses
must always be accompanied by a meet-and confer-declaration (per CCP §
2016.040) demonstrating a “reasonable and good faith attempt an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (CCP §§ 2030.300(b),
2031.310(b)(2), 2033.290(b).) They must also be accompanied by a separate
statement containing the requests and the responses, verbatim, as well as
reasons why a further response is warranted. (CRC, rule 3.1345(a).) The
separate statement must also be complete in itself; no extrinsic materials may
be incorporated by reference. (CRC rule 3.1345(c).)
 
            If a timely motion to compel has
been filed, the¿burden is on the responding party¿to justify any objection or
failure fully to answer.¿(Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210,
220–221 [addressing a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories];
see also¿Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245,
255.) 
 
Analysis
 
 
RPDs
 
The Wallachs served document
requests set nos. 6 and 7 on June 20, 2023, and July 11, 2023, respectively.
(Schwalbach Dec., ¶¶ 2, 3; Exs. 1, 2.) PSJH served its responses on September
29, 2023. (Id. Exs. 5, 6.) The Wallachs sent a meet-and-confer letter the
following business day. (Ex. 7.) The parties discussed the discovery issues through
the Court’s IDC process. (Ex. 9.) The parties have reached an impasse on the
outstanding issues. (Ex. 10.) 
 
RPD nos. 111-114: Training and Competency
 
Plaintiffs’ document request nos.
111-114 generally relate to the hospital staff’s training and competency for
preventing postpartum blood clots in new mothers.  They request documents evidencing that staff
members attending decedent were competent and trained in VTE procedures. Defendants
identify decedent’s medical records, the women’s services policies and
procedures, and the HealthStream reports of the relevant nursing staff
previously produced in discovery as responsive. 
 
Defendants object to further production,
arguing that such education, training, and competency materials constitute
nothing more than irrelevant character evidence. In support, Defendants cite Hinson
v. Clairemont Community Hospital (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1110. However, Hinson
does not support its position that the Hospital’s training materials would be
improper character evidence or otherwise irrelevant. In Hinson, the
court considered whether training and education documents were relevant to
whether the defendant-physician had the degree of learning and skill
required by the standard of care. (Id. at 1118-1119.) The court
specifically focused on the physician’s duties, which include a duty to have
medical education, training and skill before practicing medicine. (Id. at
1119.) A breach of that duty does not, by itself, establish actionable
malpractice “i.e., one cannot recover from a person merely for lacking medical
knowledge unless that lack of medical knowledge caused injury to the
plaintiff.” (Id. at 1119-1120.) “Beyond showing that an individual
failed to complete his or her medical training or was denied certification to
practice medicine, details of one's medical education or training are not
relevant to show a breach of the standard of care [in a specific instance];
such evidence is essentially character evidence tending to show one's character
for skill, competence or negligence.” (Id. at 1120.) 
 
The defendant-physician duties
discussed in Hinson are substantially different from the duties at play
in the instant action. “Although hospitals do not practice medicine in the same
sense as physicians, they do provide facilities and services in connection with
the practice of medicine, and if they are negligent in doing so they can be
held liable.” (Leung v. Verdugo Hills Hospital (2012) 55 Cal.4th 291,
310.) “A hospital must provide procedures, policies, facilities, supplies, and
qualified personnel reasonably necessary for the treatment of its patients.” (Walker
v. Sonora Regional Medical Center (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 948, 960.) Plaintiffs
are not seeking to hold defendant Hospital liable for lacking medical knowledge
or training generally, but seek to hold the Hospital accountable for breaching
the above cited standard of care. The Hospital allegedly failed to select,
review and supervise their medical, nursing, assisting, technical, clerical and
administrative staff, including properly training such staff on the risks
associated with the postpartum unit. (FAC, ¶¶ 9-12, 29-34.) Whether the
Hospital properly trained or supervised the specific staff that treated
decedent would not tend to show the bad character of the Hospital or the
individual nurses. Instead, this would tend to show whether, in this specific
instance, the Hospital failed to provide adequate policies and qualified
personnel. Therefore, under the above RPDs, Defendants should produce the
actual materials that it contends show its nursing staff in this action was
adequately trained and competent. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED
as to RPD nos. 111-114.
 
Request Nos. 122-125, and 129-131: Staffing Documents
 
Generally, these document requests
relate to staffing documents for hospital personnel who treated Decedent on
March 14, 2020, and March 15, 2020. Generally, these staffing documents are relevant
and discoverable, as it would tend to show the quality of Decedent’s treatment.
Defendants concede that the staffing sheets for the postpartum unit on March 14
and March 15, 2020, should be produced. 
 
Defendants maintain their
objections to RPD nos. 122-123, and 129-130. They contend that nos. 122-123 seek
irrelevant documents and correspondence regarding how, generally, the staff
obtains their patient assignments. Indeed, these requests are not reasonably
calculated to the discovery of admissible evidence. Further the requests are overbroad
and unnecessarily burdensome.  They seek documents
on all patient assignments in the maternity unit during the relevant
period, not just Decedent’s assignment. This would only tend to show a pattern
or practice of staffing unrelated to decedent’s specific treatment. As to RPD
129-130, the court concurs that the requests are overbroad. These requests seek
the schedules of all hospital staff who provided care to decedent for the
entire year of 2020, rather than the relevant time period. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED as
to RPD nos. 122-123, 129-130, and GRANTED as to 124-125, and 131.
 
Request Nos. 132-142: Documents Showing Regulatory
Compliance
 
Defendants object to these requests
for similar reasons that they objected to nos. 111-114. These document requests
generally relate to state regulations that require hospitals to ensure that nurses
are not assigned to units unless they have first received orientation in that
area. The policies and procedures followed by the staff who treated decedent
would be relevant to this action, and the requests should be tailored with this
limitation in mind. Accordingly, the Court takes issue with the requests that are
disconnected from that specific staff, specifically RPD nos. 132-133, 135-136,
138-139. Each request documents without limitation, including staff that did
not treat decedent. The motion is DENIED as to RPD nos. 132-133, 135-136,
138-139, and GRANTED as to RPD nos. 134, 137, 140-142. 
 
Request Nos. 143-144: Security Swipe Data
 
            These document requests seek documents that track the
location of Wallach’s providers while she was hospitalized. The Court concurs
that this evidence would tend to show when and how often caretakers tended to Decedent.
Security data of the doctor and staff would show the whereabouts of the
providers while Decedent was hospitalized. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED
as to these RPDs.
 
Request Nos. 145-153: Call Light Data and Complaints
About Staffing
 
RPD no. 145 seeks all call light
audit logs at the Hospital from January 1, 2017, to March 31, 2020. RPD nos. 146-153
seek documents related to complaints from patients or nursing staff, including
call light response time, nursing strikes, understaffing and patient safety, from
Jan. 1, 2017, to July 1, 2020. The Court previously held that Plaintiffs could
not inquire into nursing strikes at PSJH, prior complaints of understaffing,
and patient safety complaints related to their care in post-partum unit. Consistent
with that protective order, Plaintiffs cannot seek documents related to
complaints regarding understaffing, patient complaints, or nursing strikes with
these requests. The call light audit logs and response time are of a similar
vein. Plaintiffs seek call light data and prior complaints to establish a
pattern and practice of understaffing, rather than any relevant fact pertaining
to the treatment of decedent. Therefore, it is not reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Accordingly, the motion is
DENIED as to RPD nos. 145-153.
 
Request Nos. 155: Excess Insurance Policies
 
Defendants fail to articulate why
their insurance policies are not discoverable beyond boilerplate and conclusory
objections of relevancy and privacy. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED as to
this request.
 
Request Nos. 160-164: DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion)
Training and Policies
 
Defendants state they have provided
a supplemental response and production. Plaintiffs do not address this issue in
reply. The Court will inquire with counsel if this request is moot.
 
Answers at Deposition- Topic 1/ RPD no. 2: Training
Documents 
 
Plaintiffs assert that Defendants
have not produced the training documents that its PMK reviewed and relied on
for their deposition. As discussed above, the training documents in effect
during the relevant time period are within the broad standard for discovery.
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED as to topic 1. 
 
Topic 2: Staffing Issues
 
Plaintiffs contend that Defendants
refused to allow Nurse Maldonado to answer questions related to the
relationship between staffing and training, or her participation in nursing
strikes related to understaffing concerns at PSJH. Consistent with the prior
protective order and the above rulings, this issue is not reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Accordingly, the motion is
DENIED as to this topic. 
 
The Court orders the further
deposition of Defendant’s PMK with the next 20 days, unless otherwise agreed to
by the parties.
 
As to further responses, they are
due within 20 days.
