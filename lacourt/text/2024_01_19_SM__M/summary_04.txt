And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorneys' fees, filed by Defendant Dulcita Love. The motion seeks to award attorneys' fees of $5,000.00, as provided in the lease agreement, for the prevailing party in the unlawful detainer action. The Judge finds that Defendant is entitled to attorneys' fees as the prevailing party, as Plaintiff did not meet the strict notice requirements of the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance. The Judge notes that the determination of reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court, and that the fee setting inquiry typically begins with the "lodestar" method, which calculates the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. The Judge grants the motion and awards attorneys' fees to Defendant at the contractual cap of $5,000.00.
