And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion for good faith determination in the case of Dutton, et al. v. Domanosvki, et al. The motion was filed by defendants Karen M. Martinez and Barry E. Cohen, APC, seeking an order determining that their settlement with plaintiffs James and Patricia Dutton was made in good faith. The motion is unopposed, and the Judge has found that the settlement was sufficient to meet the Tech-Bilt factors, which include a rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds, and the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants. The Judge has granted the motion and finds that the settlement was made in good faith, allowing the defendant to be dismissed from comparative indemnity claims if they have made such a request.
