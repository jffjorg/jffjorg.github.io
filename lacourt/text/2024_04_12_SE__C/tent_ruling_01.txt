Materials & Quilting, Inc., vs Esperanza Padilla, et al., Case No.
23NWCV00642
This is a
breach of contract action. Plaintiff’s Counsel Debra Grimaila moves ex parte to
withdraw her legal representation of Plaintiff Enriquez Materials &
Quilting, Inc. on the grounds that her working relationship with Plaintiff has
become so strained that she can no longer successfully prepare this case for
trial.  Trial is currently scheduled for August 20, 2024.  
The ex parte
application is GRANTED.  Plaintiff’s Counsel declares that she provided
notice of the ex parte application to Silvia Enriquez, the owner of Plaintiff
corporation, and Ms. Enriquez does not oppose Counsel’s withdrawal. (Grimaila
Decl., ¶¶ 3-5.) Plaintiff’s Counsel also provided notice to Defendant, and
although Counsel has not confirmed with Defendant directly, Counsel is informed
and believes that Defendant does not oppose the withdrawal. (Grimaila Decl., ¶
6.)
Plaintiff’s
Counsel to give Notice.
