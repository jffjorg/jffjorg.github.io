And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant City of Pico Rivera's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in a wrongful death case. The case stems from a crash on November 23, 2021, in which Decedent Craig McCue was killed while riding his motorcycle on Rooks Road in Pico Rivera, California. The Defendant claims that it did not own or control the K-rail where the crash occurred and that the Plaintiff has not established a triable issue of fact regarding liability.

However, the Judge found that the Defendant failed to meet its burden of showing that there are no triable issues of material fact. The Judge noted that the Defendant's lease agreement with the federal government granted it the duty to maintain Rooks Road, which includes the K-rails, and that the City's person most knowledgeable (PMK) testified that the City was responsible for the operation and maintenance of the roadway.

The Judge also rejected the Defendant's request for summary adjudication on four issues, finding that the issues do not completely dispose of a cause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty. The Judge concluded that the Plaintiff's cause of action survives on the basis of the K-rails and that the issues raised by the Defendant regarding the debris do not resolve the entire issue of duty or completely dispose of the Plaintiff's cause of action.

The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change if the parties submit or appear at the hearing on November 21, 2024.
