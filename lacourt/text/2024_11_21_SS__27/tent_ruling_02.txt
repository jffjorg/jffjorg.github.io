Defendant arguably also raises the issue of notice, but it does so within the
context of control, not as to whether the K-rail is a dangerous condition.  As to that notice, Defendant concedes that “[t]he
City was aware of the K-rails being on the side of Rooks Road. However, they do
not own the subject property; the federal government does.” (Motion at pg. 18.)
This acknowledgment establishes that Defendant had actual notice of the
K-rails’ presence. Again, its only argument is that it did not have control of
the K-rail.
