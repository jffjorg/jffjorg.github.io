The judge has granted the defendants' motions to compel the plaintiff to serve initial responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff failed to serve responses within the statutory deadline and did not file an opposition to the motion or provide any evidence that responses were served prior to the hearing. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to provide complete and verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days. Additionally, the judge has imposed sanctions of $1200 on the plaintiff and their counsel, payable to the defendants within 20 days, as the plaintiff acted without substantial justification. The parties are expected to submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person at the hearing to argue.
