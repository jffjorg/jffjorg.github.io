[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: DEFENDANT CITY OF
  LOS ANGELES’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS

I.                  
INTRODUCTION
On
August 23, 2022, Plaintiff Alicia Stephanie Clark filed a complaint against
Defendants City of Los Angeles, International Line Builders, Inc., MDU
Construction Services Group, Inc., and Maria V. Estrada Family Trust, alleging
causes of action for general negligence and premises liability. The complaint
alleges that on March 1, 2021, Plaintiff was walking out of Defendants’
business located at 2040 Marengo Street, Los Angeles, CA 90033, when she
tripped and fell into a pothole and was injured.
On
October 21, 2024, Defendant City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) filed this motion
for judgment on the pleadings. On November 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition. On November 15, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.
II.               
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Defendant requests the court
take judicial notice of (1) Plaintiff’s claim for damages, (2) Defendant’s
Rejection of Plaintiff’s claim, mailed on February 22, 2022 and (C) Plaintiff’s
complaint in this action, filed on August 23, 2022.   
The request is unopposed and
granted.  (Evid. Code § 452(c)-(d).)  The court notes it is not
taking judicial notice of the truth within the documents, but rather is taking
judicial notice of the filing and contents of the government claim.  (Gong
v. City of Rosemead (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 363, 369-70 n. 1; see also Fowler
v. Howell (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1746, 1752-53.)    
III.            
LEGAL STANDARD
A defendant may move
for judgment on the pleadings where the court has no
jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint or the complaint does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that
defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438 subd. (c)(1)(B).)  A motion for judgment on the pleadings has the same
function as a general demurrer but is made after the time for demurrer has
expired. Except as provided by statute, the rules governing demurrers apply. (Cloud
v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)  
In considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
courts consider whether properly pled factual allegations—assumed to be true
and liberally construed—are sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (Stone
Street Capital, LLC v. Cal. State Lottery Com’n (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 109,
116.) 
IV.            
DISCUSSION
Meet and Confer
The motion is accompanied by the declaration of Carol
Attarian, which establishes that the meet and confer requirements were met. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 439(a).)  
            Merits
Government Code § 945.5 provides, “No suit for damages may be maintained
against a public entity unless the claim has been presented to it.”   
Government Code § 911.2(a)
states, “[a] claim relating to a cause of action for death or for injury to
person or to personal property or growing crops shall be presented as provided
in Article 2 (commencing with Section 915) not later than six months after the
accrual of the cause of action.”  Government Code § 945.6 provides in
relevant part: 
(a) Except as provided in Sections 946.4 and 946.6 and
subject to subdivision (b), any suit brought against a public entity on a cause
of action for which a claim is required to be presented in accordance with
Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 900) and Chapter 2 (commencing with Section
910) of Part 3 of this division must be commenced: 
(1) If written notice is given in accordance with Section
913, not later than six months after the date such notice is personally
delivered or deposited in the mail. 
…  
“Government
Code § 945.6 is a statute of limitation.”  (Cole v. Los Angeles Unified
School Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 1, 3; see also Dowell v. Contra Costa
County (2013) 928 F.Supp.2d 1137, 1152 [“Under § 945.6, if the board
delivers written notice of its decision to the complainant, the complainant has
six months to file a civil suit … This functions as a statute of
limitations.”].)  “It is well established by case law that the six-month
limitation period in Government Code section 945.6 starts to run when the
notice of rejection has been either personally served or deposited in the
mail.”  (Cole, 177 Cal.App.3d at 4.)   
Here, Defendant avers that
Plaintiff presented her claim for damages on September 3, 2021, which was
rejected on February 22, 2022, and thus, Defendant contends that Plaintiff was
required to file her complaint by August 22, 2022, which is six months after
the rejection.  Defendant contends that because Plaintiff did not file the
complaint until August 23, 2022, one day later, the complaint is untimely and
barred by the six-month statute of limitations of Government Code §
945.6.   
The judicially noticeable
evidence establishes that Plaintiff presented a claim for injuries concerning
the underlying incident to Defendant, and that Defendant mailed a notice of
rejection on February 22, 2022.  (Request for Judicial Notice Exhs.
A-B.)  Consequently, Plaintiff was required to file her action not later
than six months after the notice of rejection was deposited in the mail. 
(Gov. Code § 945.6(a)(1); see also Cole v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist.
(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 [“It is well established by case law that the
six-month limitation period in Government Code section 945.6 starts to run when
the notice of rejection has been either personally served or deposited in the
mail and the time is not extended five additional days by Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1013.”].)   
However, the six-month limitation period of Government
Code § 945.6 means six calendar months, or 182 days, whichever is
longer.  (Gonzales v. County of Los Angeles (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d
601, 603.)  In this case, 182 days is longer than six calendar months. As
such, 182 days from February 22, 2022, is August 23, 2022, the very date the
complaint was filed. Thus, the complaint was timely filed.
