Spirit
Master Funding v. Look Cinemas II and Look Brands, 24STCV25331 


Tentative decision on applications
for right to attach orders:  granted




 
 



Plaintiff Spirit Master Funding X, LLC (“Spirit”) applies
for right to attach orders against Defendants Look Cinemas II, LLC (“Look
Cinemas”) and Look Brands LLC (“Look Brands”) in the amount of $1,361,737.46.
The court has read and considered the moving papers (no
opposition was filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Complaint 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint against Defendants Look
Cinemas and Look Brands on September 30, 2024 alleging claims for breach of contract
and breach of guaranty.  The Complaint
alleges in pertinent part as follows.  
On or about May 11, 2021, Plaintiff Spirit, as landlord, and
Look Cinemas, as tenant, entered into a written Master Lease Agreement (the
“Lease”), for Look Cinemas’ use of certain commercial space located at: (i)
8200 3rd Street, Downey, California; (ii)408, 410 South Myrtle Avenue,
Monrovia, California; and (iii) 340 Eureka Street, Redlands, California
(collectively, the “Premises”). 
Concurrently with Look Cinemas’ execution of the Lease,
Guarantor Look Brands guaranteed the full, faithful, and timely payment of rent
and performance of all the obligations that Look Cinemas owes Spirit under the
Lease (the “Guaranty”). 
Article 5 of the Lease provides for Base Monthly Rent due on
or before the first day of each calendar month during the Lease term. Articles
3, 5 and 6 of the Lease provide for additional sums due as rent for the
Premises, for common area operating costs, taxes and other expenses.  All rent and charges payable by Look Cinemas
to Plaintiff under the Lease for the three Premises listed above constitute a
single monetary obligation (hereinafter, “Rental”).  
Failure to pay Rental constitutes a default and material
breach of the Lease pursuant to Article 14.1 subdivision (a) and entitles
Plaintiff to monetary damages if Look Cinemas fails to cure the default within
five (5) days of written notice.
            Look
Cinemas breached the Lease by failing to pay the full rent, including Base
Monthly Rent for the months of January 2024 through May 2024 and September
2024, including late fees, currently totaling $1,154,374.44, as well as
property taxes totaling approximately $935,744.37.
 
2. Course of Proceedings
On September 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Complaint. 
Proofs of service on file show that Defendants were served
with the moving papers on October 23, 2024.
Defendants filed their Answer on November 12, 2024. 
 
B. Applicable Law
1. Attachment
Attachment is a
prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the defendant’s
assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the outcome of the
trial of the action.  See Whitehouse
v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et seq.)
that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v. Appellate
Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536.  See
Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1108,
1115.  As the attachment statutes are
purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner, (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 879, 882.
A writ of attachment
may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which
is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the
claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred
dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the
amount due may be clearly ascertained from the contract and calculated by
evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v.
Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41
(attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for lease of
commercial equipment).
All property within
California of a corporation, association, or partnership is subject to
attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
The plaintiff may
apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the order and
serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the application,
and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
The notice of the
application and the application may be made on Judicial Council forms (Optional
Forms AT-105, 115).  The application must
be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented
would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.  CCP §484.030.  
Where the defendant
is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  Where the defendant is a
partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to “all property
of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to
attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010”
is sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  A specific description of property is not
required for corporations and partnerships as they generally have no exempt
property.  Bank of America v. Salinas
Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
A defendant who
opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of opposition and
supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not later than five
court days prior to the date set for hearing. 
CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of
opposition may be made on a Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155).  
The plaintiff may
file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for the
hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
At the hearing, the
court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right to attach order
and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is exempt from
attachment.  The defendant may appear the
hearing.  CCP §484.050(h).  The court generally will evaluate the
attachment application based solely on the pleadings and supporting affidavits
without taking additional evidence.  Bank
of America, supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at 273.  A verified complaint may be used in lieu of
or in addition to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts.  CCP §482.040. 
The plaintiff has the burden of proof, and the court is not required to
accept as true any affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See Bank of America, supra, at
271, 273.
The court may issue
a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff shows all of
the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is one on which
an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the plaintiff has established
the probable validity of the claim (CCP §484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is
sought for no purpose other than the recovery on the subject claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater
than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
A claim has
“probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will
recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan
Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does not determine whether the
claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not
affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
Except in unlawful
detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the sum of (1)
the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff, and (2)
any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and any allowable
attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110. 
CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak Construction, (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must
be reduced by the sum of (1) the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has
in a money judgment against plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a
cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown would be subject to attachment
against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any security interest held by the
plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together with the amount by which the
acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the security interest) have
decreased that security interest’s value. 
CCP §483.015(b); see also CCP §483.010(b) (“an attachment may not be
issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property arising
from agreement, statute, or other rule of law…However, an attachment may be
issued where the claim was originally so secured but, without any act of the
plaintiff or the person to whom the security was given, the security has become
valueless or has decreased in value to less than the amount then owing on the
claim).  A defendant claiming that the
amount to be secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative
defense must make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an
attachment against the plaintiff.
Before the issuance
of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an undertaking to
pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful
attachment by the plaintiff in the action. 
CCP §489.210.  The undertaking
ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If
the defendant objects, the court may increase the amount of undertaking to the
amount determined as the probable recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP §489.220. 
The court also has inherent authority to increase the amount of the
undertaking sua sponte.  North
Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
C. Statement of Facts
            1. The Lease 
            In May 2021, Spirit entered into
the Lease with Look Cinemas, with a natural term expiration of June 30, 2036
for Look Cinemas’ use and occupancy of the Premises, which are certain retail
sales space located at: (i) 8200 3rd Street, Downey, California; (ii) 408, 410
South Myrtle Avenue, Monrovia, California; and (iii) 340 Eureka Street,
Redlands, California, where Look Cinemas would do business under the trade name
“Look Cinemas.”  Edwards Decl., ¶5, Ex.
1.  
 
            2.
The Guaranty  
            Concurrently
with Look Cinemas’ execution of the Lease, Guarantor Look Brands guaranteed the
full, faithful, and timely payment of rent and performance of all the
obligations that Look Cinemas owes Plaintiff under the Lease.  Edwards Decl., ¶6, Ex. 2. 
 
            3.
Obligations Under the Lease 
            Article
5 of the Lease obligates Look Cinemas to pay Base Monthly Rent due on or before
the first day of each calendar month during the Lease term.  Edwards Decl., ¶7.  Articles 3, 5, and 6 of the Lease provide for
additional sums due as rent for the Premises, for common area operating costs,
taxes and other expenses.  Edwards Decl.,
¶7.  All rent and charges payable by Look
Cinemas to Spirit under the Lease for the Premises constitute a single monetary
obligation of Rent.  Edwards Decl., ¶7,
Ex. 1.  
Pursuant to Section 14.8 of the Lease, Spirit is entitled to
an award of attorneys' fees, costs and expenses should it prevail on the
Complaint, in addition to the damages for unpaid Rent and accrued interest.  Edwards Decl., ¶7, Ex. 1.  
 
            4.
Possession of the Premises
            The Premises were
delivered to Look Cinemas following execution of the Lease and possession of
the Premises was delivered to Look Cinemas in or around May 2021.  Edwards Decl., ¶8.  After taking possession of the Premises, Look
Cinemas was required, among other things, to pay all Rent through the end of
the term of the Lease.  Edwards Decl.,
¶9, Ex. 1.  
At or before the time Look Cinemas took possession of the
Premises, Spirit began to and continued to perform all of its obligations
pursuant to the Lease, except as excused by law or the conduct of Look
Cinemas.  Edwards Decl., ¶10.  
 
            5.
Breach  
            Starting
in and after January 2024, Look Cinemas failed to pay all Base Monthly Rent for
the Premises as required by the Lease. 
Edwards Decl., ¶12.  Spirit then turned
this matter over to legal counsel. 
Edwards Decl., ¶13.  
            The
Lease states that in the event Look Cinemas breaches the Lease and fails to
timely cure, Spirit may terminate the Lease and recover damages from Look
Cinemas, including past due Rent. 
Edwards Decl., ¶14, Ex. 1.  
            Based
on a review of the Lease and accounting files, for January 2024 through March
2024, the Base Monthly Rent was $188,403.80 for each month.  Edwards Decl., ¶15.  For April 2024 and May 2024, the monthly Base
Monthly Rent was $188,403.60 for each month. 
Edwards Decl., ¶15.  Starting in
September 1, 2024, the Base Monthly Rent was $191,229.65 for each month.  Edwards Decl., ¶15.  The total past due Base Monthly Rent owed by
Look Cinemas is $1,324,477.90.  Edwards
Decl., ¶16.  Look Cinemas is not presently
entitled to any offsets against Spirit’s damages.  Edwards Decl., ¶17.  
            In
a contested case where the damages exclusive of costs are over $100,000, the
attorney's fees should be $5,270 plus 2% of the excess over $100,000.  Myers Decl., ¶3.  The attorneys’ fees would be $5,270.00 plus
2% of $1,324,477.90, which is $26,489.56. 
Myers Decl., ¶3.  The total sum of
attorneys’ fees thus equals $31,759.56. 
Myers Decl., ¶3.  
Additionally, Spirit may incur costs in the amount of $5,500
for filing, service fees, depositions, witness fees, and other costs in
connection with prosecuting this matter to trial.  Myers Decl., ¶4.  Spirit is seeking to attach an additional sum
of $37,259.56 for estimated attorney fees and costs.  Myers Decl., ¶5.  
Spirit has no security interest in any real property of Look
Cinemas for any amounts due under the Lease by virtue of any agreement, statute
or other rule of law.  Edwards Decl.,
¶11.  
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff
Spirit seeks right to attach orders against Defendants Look Cinemas and Look Brands in the amount of $1,361,737.46, which
includes estimated fees and costs of $31,759.56.  Defendants were properly served and no
opposition has been filed.
1. A Claim Based on a Contract and on Which Attachment
May Be Based 
            A writ of attachment may be issued
only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a
contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is
a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars
($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  
            Plaintiff’s claim is a claim for
money based upon a debt arising out of express contract in the Lease and
Guaranty and it exceeds $500.
             
            2. An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable  
            A claim is “readily ascertainable”
where the damages may be readily ascertained by reference to the contract and
the basis of the calculation appears to be reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004)
115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41.  The fact that the damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a
standard by which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by
which the damages can be determined by proof.  Id. (citations
omitted). 
Based on a review of the Lease and accounting files, for
January 2024 through March 2024, the Base Monthly Rent was $188,403.80 for each
month.  Edwards Decl., ¶15.  For April 2024 and May 2024, the monthly Base
Monthly Rent was $188,403.60 for each month. 
Edwards Decl., ¶15.  Starting in
September 1, 2024, the Base Monthly Rent was $191,229.65 for each month.  Edwards Decl., ¶15.  The total past due Base Monthly Rent owed by
Look Cinemas is $1,324,477.90.  Edwards
Decl., ¶16.    
Strict compliance is required with statutory requirements
for affidavits for attachment (Anaheim National Bank v. Kraemer, (1932)
120 Cal.App. 63, 65), and the court must apply the same evidentiary standard to
the declarations in an attachment hearing as to a case tried on oral
testimony.  VFS Financing, Inc. v. CHF
Express, LLC, (2009) (C.D. Cal.) 620 F.Supp.2d 1092, 1096-97.  The declarant must show personal knowledge of
the relevant facts, and such evidence must be admissible and not
objectionable.  Id.  For business records, evidence should be
presented to establish that the record was made in the regular course of
business, at or near the time of the act or event, and the custodian of records
or other qualified witness must identify the record and its mode of
preparation, as well as the sources of information and method and time of
preparation.  Id.
Spirit fails to provide a payment history or month-by-month
calculation to support its conclusions of Base Monthly Rent owed.  As Defendants fail to oppose, this defect is
waived.
Spirit seeks estimated attorney fees and costs.  It correctly notes, without referring to LASC
3.214(a), that in a contested case where the damages exclusive of costs are
over $100,000, the attorney's fees should be $5,270 plus 2% of the excess over
$100,000.  Myers Decl., ¶3.  The attorneys’ fees would be $5,270.00 plus
2% of $1,324,477.90, which is $26,489.56. 
Myers Decl., ¶3.  
Spirit also seeks estimated costs in the amount of $5,500
for filing, service fees, depositions, witness fees, and other costs in
connection with prosecuting this matter to trial.  Myers Decl., ¶4.  Spirit is seeking to attach an additional sum
of $37,259.56 for estimated attorney fees and costs.  Myers Decl., ¶5.  The total sum of attorneys’ fees thus equals
$31,759.56.  Myers Decl., ¶3.  
            The total amount of $1,361,737.46 is fixed and readily
ascertainable.
 
            3. Probability of Success 
            A claim has “probable validity”
where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will recover on that
claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  Kemp
Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th
1474, 1484.  The court does not determine whether the claim is actually
valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not affected by the
decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            In
May 2021, Spirit entered into the Lease with Look Cinemas, with a natural term
expiration of June 30, 2036 for Look Cinemas’ use and occupancy of the
Premises.  Edwards Decl., ¶5, Ex. 1.  Concurrently with Look Cinemas’ execution of
the Lease, Guarantor Look Brands guaranteed the obligations that Look Cinemas
owes Spirit under the Lease.  Edwards
Decl., ¶6, Ex. 2. 
            Article
5 of the Lease obligates Look Cinemas to pay Base Monthly Rent due on or before
the first day of each calendar month during the Lease term.  Edwards Decl., ¶7.  Articles 3, 5, and 6 of the Lease provide for
additional sums due as rent for the Premises, for common area operating costs,
taxes and other expenses.  Edwards Decl.,
¶7.  All rent and charges payable by Look
Cinemas to Spirit under the Lease for the Premises constitute a single monetary
obligation of Rent.  Edwards Decl., ¶7,
Ex. 1.  Pursuant to Section 14.8 of the
Lease, Spirit is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees, costs and expenses
should it prevail on the Complaint, in addition to the damages for unpaid Rent
and accrued interest.  Edwards Decl., ¶7,
Ex. 1.  
            The Premises were
delivered to Look Cinemas following execution of the Lease and possession of
the Premises was delivered to Look Cinemas in or around May 2021.  Edwards Decl., ¶8.  Starting in and after January 2024, Look
Cinemas failed to pay all Base Monthly Rent for the Premises as required by the
Lease.  Edwards Decl., ¶12.  Look Brands also failed to honor its
Guaranty.
            Spirit
has shown a probability of success.
 
4. Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose¿ 
            Attachment must not be sought for a
purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which attachment is based.¿
CCP §484.090(a)(3).  Spirit seeks
attachment for a proper purpose.
 
E. Conclusion
Plaintiff Spirit’s
applications for right to attach orders are granted in the amount of in the
amount of $1,361,737.46.  No writ shall issue against either Defendant
until a $10,000 bond is posted for that Defendant.
