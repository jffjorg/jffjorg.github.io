Petitioner also claims an amount to be determined for fees related to the
City’s ex parte application heard on December 10, 2024 but has not provided any
documentation for this amount.  See Reply
at 7.


[2] Petitioner further argues
that she is entitled to attorney fees under the DBL, which states that if a
court finds that a city’s “refusal to grant a requested density bonus,
incentive, or concession is in violation of this section [the DBL], the court
shall award the plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of suit.”  Govt. Code § 65915(d)(3).  Mot. at 5. 
Petitioner did not include the DBL as a basis for a fee award in its
notice of motion and this basis is waived.
