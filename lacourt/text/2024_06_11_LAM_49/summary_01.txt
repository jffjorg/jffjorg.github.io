And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiffs' Motion to Bifurcate the equitable and legal issues at trial. The Plaintiffs, Michael J. Finn and Rosanna C. Finn, own real property at 21110 Denker Ave and allege that the Defendants, Raidu Krishna and Sarda Krishna, failed to properly maintain the adjacent property, resulting in damage to the Plaintiffs' property. The Plaintiffs seek to bifurcate the trial to try the equitable claims first, including claims for quiet title, declaratory relief, and declaratory relief under the Good Neighbor Fence Act. The Judge finds that the equitable claims are primarily equitable in nature and that bifurcation is necessary to promote judicial economy. The Judge grants the motion and vacates the current trial date of July 24, 2024.
