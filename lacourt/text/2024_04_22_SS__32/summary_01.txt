And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to appear for a physical examination with Dr. Brian Grossman. The motion was unopposed and the court finds that the examination does not contain any diagnostic test or procedure that is painful, protracted, or intrusive. The court also denies the defendants' request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and/or his counsel of record. The plaintiff shall appear for an examination with Dr. Grossman within 30 days."
