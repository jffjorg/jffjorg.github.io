  - Judge: [Unknown]
Significant Statements:
  - "The court may impose...sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process."
  - "The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'"
  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'"
```
And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has denied the Defendants' motion for terminating sanctions, issue sanctions, and evidentiary sanctions. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the discovery order was not willful, as the Plaintiff did eventually serve the discovery responses on March 29, 2024. However, the Court does award the Defendants monetary sanctions in the amount of $360.00 to compensate for the delay in serving the discovery responses. The Court also orders the Plaintiff to pay the Defendants' attorney fees in the amount of $360.00.
