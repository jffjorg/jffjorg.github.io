The court has denied Plaintiff Jesus Carrasco's motion for trial preference, but has advanced the trial date to December 16, 2024. The court found that Plaintiff has not established that his health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing his interest in the litigation. However, considering Plaintiff's age and health issues, the court has advanced the trial date. The parties are ordered to work diligently to prepare the matter for trial, and there shall be no further continuance absent sufficient good cause.
