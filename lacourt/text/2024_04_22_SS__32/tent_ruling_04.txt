TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


April
  22, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV42445




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendants Nune Arakelyan and Ashot
  Mardanyan




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  Edward Keh 



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendants Nune Arakelyan and Ashot Mardanyan (“Defendants”)
move for terminating sanctions, or in the alternative, monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff Edward Keh (“Plaintiff”)
for failure to comply with the Court’s January 2, 2024 discovery order. Plaintiff
opposes and Defendants reply. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225,
1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra, 77
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating
sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and subsequently granting
default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen
(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the
plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating
various discovery statutes].)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants served discovery on Plaintiff on June 1, 2023. (Ash Decl. ¶
3.) On January 2, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ unopposed motions to
compel. Plaintiff was ordered to provide verified responses, without
objections, to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Demand for
Production of Documents, Set One within 30 days. (See Min. Order, 1/2/24.)
Defendant served notice of the orders electronically to Plaintiff’s counsel on January
4, 2024. 
 
On February 13, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion asserting
that they had not received responses. 
 
Plaintiff’s opposition asserts that responses were served on March 29,
2024. (Salinas Decl. ¶ 1.) Plaintiff’s counsel declares that it was difficult
to provide the discovery responses in a timely manner due to a “transitioning
of personnel and resources at the office.” (Id.) 
 
In reply, Defendants concede that responses were served after filing
this motion. (Reply, 3.) 
 
            Therefore, the Court finds there is
insufficient evidence to show that failure to comply was willful considering
that responses have now been served. The Court denies Defendants’ requests for
issue and evidentiary sanctions since Defendants requested the Court preclude
issues and evidence regarding Plaintiff’s injuries. (Motion, 7.) This would
have a similar effect as terminating Plaintiff’s case. Also, though Defendants
argue the monetary sanctions imposed in the January 2, 2024 order have not been
paid, there
is no authority for imposing sanctions for failure to pay sanctions. (See Newland
v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 615 [holding, “a terminating
sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery
sanction is never justified.”].) Sanctions orders are enforceable as money
judgments unless the court orders otherwise. Thus, the remedy to enforce
payment of monetary sanctions is to obtain and levy a writ of execution on
assets of the debtor. (Id. at 615.) 
 
However, the Court finds monetary sanctions are warranted. Plaintiff
offers no specific facts to explain why discovery responses were not served
despite the fact that Defendants’ counsel left messages for Plaintiff’s counsel
and sent a correspondence on January 19, 2024. (Ash Decl. ¶ 9–10, Exh. F.) Accordingly,
monetary sanctions are appropriate. However, the amount requested is excessive
given the type of motion. The Court awards sanctions in the amount of $360.00
(1.5 hours of attorney time at $200 hourly rate plus the filing fee).
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, Defendants’ motion for terminating, issue, and evidentiary
sanctions is DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff shall pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $360.00 to
counsel for Defendants.
 
Defendants shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
