Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to replace Plaintiff with his son, Kane Anthony Leyva, a minor, to assert a survival action. The judge found that Plaintiff did not satisfy the procedural requirements for making this motion, including failing to identify by page, paragraph, and line number where the changes exist, and not providing a declaration with the required information. Despite leave to amend being liberally granted, the court considered the delay in seeking the amendment, which may result in prejudice to the opposing party. The motion is denied.
