And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to set aside the default judgment entered against them under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The defendants claim that the default judgment was entered due to their excusable neglect, specifically that they were not properly served with a copy of the summons and complaint. However, the court finds that there is no showing of excusable neglect and that the defendants had a duty to consult a lawyer or take action to respond to the lawsuit. The court also notes that substitute service was properly used to serve the defendants and that they did not file a responsive pleading to the complaint. Therefore, the motion to set aside the default judgment is denied.
