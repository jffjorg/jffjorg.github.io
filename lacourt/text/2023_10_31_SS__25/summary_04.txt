And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that the moving papers fail to provide legal authority to support the argument made by the moving party. The Judge notes that the moving papers do not identify the elements of a cause of action for negligence or vicarious liability. The reply brief argues that the Plaintiff has not alleged a guaranty action, but the Plaintiff's SAC actually alleges a sole cause of action for negligence, not a guaranty action. The Judge will therefore assess whether the Plaintiff has stated a valid cause of action for negligence.
