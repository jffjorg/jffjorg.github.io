Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Precise
Roofing Company, Inc., and Charles Douglas (“Defendants”) for a breach of
contract dispute.               On March 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed
its proofs of service showing Defendants were served by substituted service
with a copy of the summons and complaint on February 16, 2023.  (Anis Decl.) 
On June 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amended proof of service as to Defendant
Charles Douglas. Defendants did not timely file a responsive pleading to
Plaintiff’s complaint.              On August 29, 2023, Plaintiff sought,
and the court entered its Request for Entry of Default as to the defendants. The
same day, Plaintiff submitted its default judgment package to the Court as to
both defendants.   On September 12,
2023, the court entered judgment against defendants.      On September 25,
2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to vacate default judgment.  Grounds for Motion  Defendants move to vacate the default judgment under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) on the grounds that the Default Judgment
was entered against the Defendants because of Defendant Charles Douglas’s excusable
neglect.  LEGAL STANDARD  “The
court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken…” (Code Civ. Pro., §473, subd. (b).) To qualify for
relief under section 473, the moving party must act
diligently in seeking relief and must submit affidavits or testimony
demonstrating a reasonable cause for the default. (Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 234.) While section 473
is remedial and should be liberally construed, the moving party has the burden
of showing that the default was entered through mistake, inadvertence, surprise,
or excusable neglect, which must be established by a preponderance of the
evidence; in the absence of such showing the default may not be set aside. (Goodson v. Bogerts, Inc.
(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 32, 38.) DISCUSSION  Defendants move to vacate the default judgment under CCP § 473(b) on the
grounds that  Default Judgment was
entered against the Defendants because of defendant Charles Douglas’s excusable
neglect. In support, Defendants advance the declaration of Charles Douglas. He
attests that he first learned of the lawsuit when he received a copy of the
summons and complaint around March 2023. (Decl. Douglas, ¶ 2.) He states that
he mistakenly believed that there was nothing he needed to do to respond to the
lawsuit other than show up at the trial. (Decl. Douglas, ¶ 3.)  The court finds
that there is no showing of excusable neglect to make an appearance in the
action. A defendant who has “no confidence in his ability to decipher legal
jargon” in a summons knows that he should consult a lawyer. (Goodson
v. Bogerts, Inc. (1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 32, 40.) If he neglects to
do so, he cannot plead ignorance of the contents of the summons. (Ibid.)
 The Court does not
find it persuasive that Charles Douglas was not properly served. A defendant
need not be personally served; under certain circumstances, applicable here, substitute
service is an acceptable method of service. (Code Civ. Pro., § 415.20.)

Thus, the Court denies the motion. CONCLUSION  
Defendants’ motion to vacate the default judgment under CCP § 473(b) is DENIED. Counsel for the Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
