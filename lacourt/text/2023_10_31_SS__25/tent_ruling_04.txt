moving papers cite to no legal authority to support this argument. Demurrer
at 5:18-26. “Contentions are waived when a party fails to support them with
reasoned argument and citations to authority.” Moulton Niguel Water Dist.
v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215. The moving papers
do not identify the elements of a cause of action for negligence or vicarious
liability. The reply brief asserts that Plaintiff has not alleged a guaranty
action. Reply at 2:3-8. However, Plaintiff’s SAC alleges a sole cause of
action for negligence and does not assert a cause of action for breach of
guaranty. The Court therefore does not see the relevance of such argument
raised in the reply brief. The Court, however, will still assess whether
Plaintiff has stated a valid cause of action for negligence.
