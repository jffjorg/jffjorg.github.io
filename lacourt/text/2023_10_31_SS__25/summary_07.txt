English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a motion to amend a judgment to add Versani, Inc. as a judgment debtor. The motion was filed by Cozi Capital, LLC, the plaintiff, against Headlight Factory, LLC, Lawrence Khachatourian, and Does 1 through 20. The plaintiff alleges that Headlight Factory breached a business loan contract in February 2019 and is seeking to add Versani, Inc. as a judgment debtor, citing evidence that the two entities share the same address, phone number, and CEO, and are in the same business of wholesale auto parts. The Judge grants the motion, finding that Versani, Inc. is the successor corporation to Headlight Factory and is therefore liable for its debts. The Judge also orders that the judgment debtors be enjoined from transferring their assets or income to other entities.
