And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Christian Carrillo's Motion to Compel Cross-Defendant Mohammed Tehrani's Responses to Plaintiff's Requests for Production. The Court orders Cross-Defendant to serve code-compliant responses to Plaintiff's Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, without objections, within thirty days of entry of this order. Additionally, the Court grants Plaintiff's Request for Monetary Sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,010, payable by Cross-Defendant and defense counsel to Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel within thirty days of entry of this order. The Court's reasoning is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure, which states that where there has been no timely response to a code-compliance demand, the demanding party must seek an order compelling a response. The Court also cites California Rules of Court rule 3.1348(a), which allows for the award of sanctions in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even if no opposition was filed.
