Here's a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, The Regents of the University of California, and a motion to strike a notice of errata filed by the plaintiff, Janis Hoffman. The defendant demurred to each claim alleged in the plaintiff's complaint, and the plaintiff filed a notice of errata to correct an error in the complaint.

The judge sustained the demurrer with 30 days' leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff must re-file the complaint with the necessary changes within 30 days. The judge also granted the motion to strike the notice of errata, meaning that the notice is no longer part of the case.

The judge's reasoning was that the plaintiff's allegations were insufficient to support a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress, and that the plaintiff's complaint was barred by the statute of limitations. The judge also found that the plaintiff's fraud claims were not adequately pleaded, and that the plaintiff's allegations of medical malpractice were not supported by the evidence.

The judge's ruling is tentative, meaning that it is subject to change after further consideration and argument by the parties.
