And here is an English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to vacate the renewal of the 1994 judgment or, alternatively, to stay the enforcement of the judgment. The defendants argue that the assignee, SMS Financial XI, LLC, lacks the capacity to renew the judgment and maintain an enforcement action because it is a terminated Arizona limited liability company that is not registered to do business in California and does not have a license as required by the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. The court finds that the assignee's status as a foreign limited liability company does not bar it from enforcing the judgment, and that the defendants were not properly served with the notice of renewal of judgment. The court also notes that the defendants' request for a stay of enforcement of the judgment is unnecessary because the court's disposition on the motion to vacate the renewal of judgment already determines whether the judgment can be enforced.
