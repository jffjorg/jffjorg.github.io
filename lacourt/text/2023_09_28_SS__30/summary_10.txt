And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Infinity Select Insurance Company's motion for leave to intervene in the lawsuit. The insurance company wants to join the case because the plaintiff, Dalila Garcia, intends to file a request for default judgment against the defendants, including Baz Mohammad Nomair, and the insurance company may be exposed to liability under Insurance Code section 11580. The judge found that the insurance company has an interest in the litigation and that its intervention will not enlarge the issues in the case, as it will assert the same defenses that would have been asserted by the insured defendants if they had participated in the defense of the matter. The insurance company must give notice of its intervention.
