And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Richard Garcia, has moved for a protective order to prevent the disclosure and distribution of any audio recordings and/or raw data of the plaintiff's neuropsychological examination to anyone except licensed and retained neuropsychology experts. The plaintiff, Emily Kwong, asserts that she has a right to audio record the mental examination and submit the raw data to her counsel for examination. The court has reviewed the relevant laws and regulations, including California Board of Psychology Laws and Regulations and Evidence Code ยง 721(a).

The court finds that the plaintiff's counsel is entitled to access to the audio recordings and raw data to protect the examinee's interests and ensure that the examination is conducted fairly. The court also finds that the defendant's concerns about test security are legitimate, but that a protective order limiting the dissemination of the audio recordings and raw data is sufficient to address these concerns.

Therefore, the court's tentative ruling is to deny the defendant's motion for a protective order and to order the moving party to give notice. The court's reasoning is based on the principles of fairness and transparency, as well as the need to protect the examinee's interests and ensure that the examination is conducted fairly.
