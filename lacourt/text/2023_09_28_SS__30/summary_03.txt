And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Richard Garcia, has moved for a protective order to prevent the disclosure and distribution of any audio recordings and/or raw data of the plaintiff's neuropsychological examination to anyone except licensed and retained neuropsychology experts. The plaintiff, Emily Kwong, asserts that she has a right to audio record the mental examination and submit the raw data to her counsel for examination. The court has reviewed the relevant laws and regulations, including California Board of Psychology Laws and Regulations and Evidence Code § 721(a).

The court finds that the plaintiff's counsel is entitled to access to the audio recordings and raw data to protect the examinee's interests and ensure that the examination is conducted fairly. The court also finds that the defendant's concerns about test security are legitimate, but that a protective order limiting the dissemination of the audio recordings and raw data is sufficient to address these concerns.

Therefore, the court's tentative ruling is to deny the defendant's motion for a protective order and to order the moving party to give notice. The court's reasoning is based on the principles of fairness and transparency, as well as the need to protect the examinee's interests and ensure that the examination is conducted fairly.

## English Summary

The Judge has tentatively decided to deny the Defendant's motion for a protective order regarding the disclosure of audio recordings and raw data from the Plaintiff's neuropsychological examination. 

The Defendant argued that allowing Plaintiff's counsel access to this information violated California law and would compromise the integrity of the examination. However, the Judge cited a previous case, Randy's Trucking, which found that a protective order can sufficiently safeguard test security while allowing for Plaintiff's counsel to review the materials.

The Judge emphasized the Plaintiff's right to access these materials under Evidence Code § 721(a), which allows for discovery and cross-examination of expert witnesses. The Judge also noted that a protective order limiting the dissemination of the information would adequately address the Defendant's concerns about misuse.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Emily Kwong vs. Richard Garcia, et al. The defendant has moved for a protective order to prevent the disclosure and distribution of audio recordings and raw data from Plaintiff's neuropsychological examination. The court has denied the defendant's motion, finding that Plaintiff's counsel needs access to the audio recordings and raw data for cross-examination purposes.

The court noted that the medical profession has a strong interest in protecting test security and guarding against unwarranted disclosures, but the defendant failed to show that a protective order limiting the dissemination of the audio recordings and raw data is insufficient to protect testing security. The court also found that allowing Plaintiff's counsel to examine the audio recordings and raw data will ensure that the examiner does not overstep the bounds set by the court for the mental examination, and that the context of the responses can be judged for purposes of trial.

The court cited several cases, including Randy's Trucking, Inc. v. Superior Court of Kern County, which held that a protective order limiting the dissemination of psychological tests or devices is sufficient to protect testing security. The court also noted that Plaintiff's counsel needs access to the raw data and audio recordings to effectively scrutinize the way the data was collected, determine if there are discrepancies, and cross-examine the neuropsychologist on the basis and reasons for the neuropsychologist's opinion.

Overall, the court's tentative ruling is that the defendant's motion for a protective order is denied, and that Plaintiff's counsel is entitled to access the audio recordings and raw data for cross-examination purposes.
