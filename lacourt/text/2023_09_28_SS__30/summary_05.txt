And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion by Plaintiff Grant Peter Yahiyayan to set aside the dismissal of the case. The motion was granted due to Plaintiff's counsel's mistaken belief that the case was stayed due to a bankruptcy filing. The Judge found that the failure to appear at the November 21, 2022 jury trial was due to counsel's mistake and inadvertence. As a result, the Judge granted the motion to set aside the dismissal. The Judge also declined to impose any penalties on Plaintiff or Plaintiff's attorney for failing to pay reasonable compensatory fees and costs to opposing parties, as Defendants did not oppose the motion despite being served with it.
