And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to continue the trial date, citing ongoing discovery as the reason. The trial will be calendared within 180 days, and the motion for summary judgment will be heard 45-60 days prior to the trial date. The moving party is required to give notice. The judge notes that the opposition has not shown good cause to continue the trial date, but the ongoing discovery justifies the continuance. The judge also reminds the parties that they have the right to have a timely filed motion for summary judgment heard.
