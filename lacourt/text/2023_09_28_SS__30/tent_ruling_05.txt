 Case Number:  21STCV19369    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  30 GRANT PETER YAHIAYAN vs BERALI CARRILLO, et al.Motion to Set Aside / Vacate the DismissalRuling:  The Motion to Set Aside / Vacate the Dismissal is granted.Discussion:  Plaintiff presents the declaration of his counsel, David Yerkanyan (“Yerkanyan”), who declares that: (1) his failure to attend the hearings on this matter were the result of inadvertence, surprise, mistake, or excusable neglect (Yerkanyan Decl., ¶ 1); (2) his failure was due to the belief that proceedings had been stayed given his client’s bankruptcy filing and the Notice of Stay filed (Id.); (3) on June 30, 2022, Plaintiff’s bankruptcy attorney John C. Lange, Esq., e-mailed him and notified him that Plaintiff’s civil action had been stayed (Id., ¶ 3 and Exhibit B); (4) defense counsel’s representation at the FSC that they had not made contact with him was inaccurate (Id., ¶ 2 and Exhibit A); (5) given his mistake and inadvertence in believing the case had been stayed, he informed his legal assistant to remove both the FSC and jury trial (Id., ¶ 6); and (6) he apologizes to the Court and counsel regarding his mistake and inadvertence (Id., ¶ 7).Initially, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s motion is timely as it was filed within six months after dismissal. Here, the Court finds that Plaintiff has made a showing that the failure to appear at the November 21, 2022 jury trial was due to counsel’s mistaken belief that the bankruptcy filing stayed this action. The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has made a showing warranting mandatory relief from dismissal pursuant to SJP Limited Partnership v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 136 Cal.App.4th 511, 516.As to the issue of payment of reasonable compensatory fees and costs to opposing parties, Defendants have filed an Answer. Defendants, however, did not oppose Plaintiff’s motion despite having been served with such motion. The Court exercises its discretion and declines to impose any penalties against Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s attorney pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 473(c).
