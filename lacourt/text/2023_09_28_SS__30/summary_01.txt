And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim of a Minor and has determined that the settlement is reasonable. The Court has also considered the fee request and finds that a 25% fee of the gross settlement is reasonable. However, the Court has not received the necessary information about the depositories where the funds will be deposited. The Court is continuing the hearing to allow the Petitioner to submit an amended form MC-350 with the missing information, specifically Attachment 18b(2). The Petitioner is required to give notice of the amended petition.
