And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a motion filed by AIDS Healthcare Foundation to compel the deposition of third-party Cynthia Cooks and for monetary sanctions. The court has sustained the defendant's evidentiary objection to the plaintiff's supplemental declaration and has not considered the declaration in making its ruling.

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel Cooks' deposition, ordering her to appear for and testify at a deposition to be taken by counsel for the defendant. The court has also ordered Cooks to produce documents responsive to the defendant's requests for production, numbers 1-8, that are in her possession, custody, or control.

The court has denied the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against Cooks, finding that the circumstances presented would make the imposition of sanctions unjust in light of the mixed results of the court's ruling. The court has also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendant.

The court has ordered the defendant to give notice of this ruling, and has set a future date for the deposition of Cooks.
