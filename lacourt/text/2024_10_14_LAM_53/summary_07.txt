And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to stay the action until the court rules on their motion to compel arbitration. The defendants had filed a motion to compel arbitration on September 16, 2024, which is set for hearing on May 12, 2025. The judge finds that the court's decision on this motion will impact the outcome of the current action, and therefore, the court should stay the action until the motion to compel arbitration is determined. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for limited arbitration-related discovery, finding that this request would be more appropriately addressed in connection with a noticed motion.
