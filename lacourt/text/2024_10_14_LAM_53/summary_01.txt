And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III regarding a motion to enforce a settlement agreement. The case, 19STCV20735, involves plaintiffs Ye Zhang and KYL Construction, Inc. against defendants Xiang Ling, Sumiko Abe, and KYL Construction, LLC. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on June 21, 2024, which provided for a payment of $50,000, with $30,000 to be paid within 21 days and $20,000 to be paid within 51 days. However, the defendants failed to make the required payments, and the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement.

The court finds that the plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to establish that the parties stipulated for the settlement of the case and that the defendants have failed to perform under the terms of the settlement agreement. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiffs' motion to enforce settlement agreement and enters judgment in their favor, ordering the defendants to pay the unpaid balance of $40,000, as well as attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $2,660.

The court also orders the plaintiffs to prepare and serve a proposed judgment within 10 days and sets an order to show cause re judgment for hearing on November 27, 2024.
