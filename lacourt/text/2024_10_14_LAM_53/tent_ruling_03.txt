MOVING PARTIES:              Plaintiffs Ye Zhang and KYL
Construction, Inc.                   
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Unopposed
Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement
The court considered the amended moving and reply papers filed in
connection with this motion.  No
opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Ye Zhang and KYL Construction, Inc. (“Plaintiffs”) filed
this action on June 13, 2019, against defendants Xiang Ling, Sumiko Abe, and
KYL Construction, LLC (“Defendants”). 
Thereafter, on June 10, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Settlement of
Entire Case, advising the court that the parties entered into a settlement of
this action.  (June 10, 2024 Notice of
Settlement, ¶ 1.) 
Plaintiffs now move the court for an order enforcing the terms of the
parties’ settlement agreement, entering judgment according to its terms, and
awarding to Plaintiffs $8,720 in attorney’s fees and $60 in costs. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides, in relevant part, the
following:¿ “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by
the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”¿ This statute “provides a
summary procedure to enforce a settlement agreement by entering judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”¿ (Hines v. Lukes (2008) 167
Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.)¿ “If the court determines that the parties entered
into an enforceable settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a formal
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”¿ (Ibid.)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
            Plaintiffs have submitted a copy of
the “Confidential Settlement Agreement and Release,” entered into by
Plaintiffs, on the one hand, and Defendants, on the other hand.[1]  (Azat Decl., Ex. D, Settlement.)  Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the
parties agreed to settle this action for the amount of $50,000, to be paid as
follows: (1) $30,000 within 21 days of the effective date (i.e., the date on
which all Plaintiffs executed the agreement), and (2) $20,000 within 51 days of
the effective date.  (Azat Decl., Ex. D,
Settlement, ¶ 3, subds. (a)(i), (a)(ii).) 
The agreement further provides that, should Defendants fail to make any
payment, the full remaining balance shall immediately become due and
payable.  (Azat Decl., Ex. D, Settlement,
¶ 3, subd. (a)(iii).)  Plaintiffs and
Defendants also agreed that the court would retain jurisdiction pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  (Azat
Decl., Ex. D, Settlement, ¶ 5.) 
            Thus, the court finds that
Plaintiffs have presented evidence establishing that they and Defendants
stipulated, in a writing signed outside of the presence of the court, for the
settlement of this case.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)  The court
further finds that Plaintiffs have presented evidence establishing that
Defendants have not performed under the terms of the parties’ settlement
agreement by failing to make all required payments within the time
required.  (Azat Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5
[defendant Xiang Ling made a single payment of $10,000 on July 3, 2024], 12 [no
further payments have been received].) 
            Defendants did not file an
opposition to this motion disputing their failure to comply with the settlement
agreement or establishing that they have since made all required payments.  The court notes that Defendants filed, on August
9, 2024, their “Motion to Extent the Payment Period Stipulated in the Settle
Agreement Which Signed on June 21, 2024 and New Payment Plan,” in which
Defendants appear to request that the court permit Defendants to make monthly
payments in the amount of $1,500 to plaintiff Ye Zhang.  (Def. Mot., p. 1:21-22.)  But (1) that motion is set for hearing on
December 17, 2024, and Defendants did not move the court, by ex parte
application or other appropriate motion, to advance the hearing on their motion
to be heard before or at the same time as Plaintiffs’ motion, and (2)
Defendants did not file an opposition to this motion requesting such
relief.  
            The court therefore finds that
Plaintiffs are entitled to an order entering judgment in their favor and
against Defendants pursuant to the terms of the parties’ Confidential
Settlement Agreement and Release.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §¿664.6, subd. (a).)  The
court further finds that Plaintiffs have shown that they incurred reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of 
$2,660 ((6.5 hours x $400 hourly rate) + $60 in filing fees) to enforce
the settlement agreement.  (Azat Decl.,
Ex. D, Settlement, ¶ 15 [“If any act is necessary to enforce or interpret the
terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs . . . .”]; Azat Decl., ¶¶ 11, 13.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiffs Ye Zhang
and KYL Construction, Inc.’s motion to enforce settlement agreement as follows.

            The court shall enter judgment in
favor of plaintiffs Ye Zhang and KYL Construction, Inc. and against defendants
Xiang Ling, Sumiko Abe, and KYL Construction, LLC in the total amount of $42,660,
consisting of (1) $40,000 damages for the unpaid balance owed on the parties’
Confidential Settlement Agreement and Release ($50,000 less the $10,000 paid),
(2) $2,600 in reasonable attorney’s fees, and (3) $60 in costs. 
            The court orders plaintiffs Ye Zhang
and KYL Construction, Inc. to prepare, serve, and lodge a proposed Judgment
(made on Judicial Council form JUD-100) consistent with this order within 10
days of the date of this ruling.
            The court sets an Order to Show
Cause re entry of judgment for hearing on November 27, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in
Department 53. 
            The court orders plaintiffs Ye Zhang
and KYL Construction, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
