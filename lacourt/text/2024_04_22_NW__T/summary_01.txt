The court has granted several of the Defendant's motions, including those regarding the mention of "sending a message" and the broader effects of the case. The court has also granted the Defendant's motion to exclude references to community safety and standards. However, the court has denied the Defendant's motion to exclude all references to insurance payments. The court has granted the Defendant's motion to exclude testimony regarding the community's safety standards, but has denied the motion to exclude all references to insurance payments. The court will not decide the issue in a vacuum and requires specific court orders that were violated or specific responses that were not responded to.
