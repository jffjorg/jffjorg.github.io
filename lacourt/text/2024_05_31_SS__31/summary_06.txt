And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date from August 16, 2024 to a later date to be determined. The defendants had filed a motion for summary judgment (MSJ) on April 30, 2024, and a trial court cannot refuse to hear a summary judgment motion filed within the time limits of CCP ยง 437c. The defendants filed their motion to continue trial on May 1, 2024, giving sufficient notice to all parties. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and the court has found that the defendants have established good cause for the continuance. The trial date is continued to a later date, and all discovery and expert cutoff dates are also continued.
