  DAVIS, JR., et al. vs SINGER VEHICLE DESIGN, et al.




PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE
  OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR


WESLEE DAVIS JR., Age
  9




TENTATIVE RULING:


DENY


The Court excuses the  personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear  by telephone or video conference call.    Plaintiffs have agreed to  settle their claims against Defendants for the total amount of $3,760,000, with  the entirety being apportioned to Weslee Davis Jr.  (“Claimant”). If the settlement is approved, $1,692,000 will be used for  attorneys’ fees, and $161,895.44 will be used for costs.  The net balance of $1,906,104.56 will be  divided, with $1,366,104.56 to be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity  and the remaining $540,000 to be transferred into a trust.   The Court has reviewed the  petition and proposed order filed on May 3, 2024. The Court has the following comments:  The revised trust       instrument attached to the 5/3/24 proposed order (order pdf at p.       10) is not the same as the prior proposed trust instrument attached       to the newest 5/3/24 petition (court's pdf at p. 121).  The new trust       instrument is not properly before the court. The trust instrument       generally meets the CRC rule 7.903(c) and LASC rule 4.116(b) requirements,       but some of those protections are stated as applying only until       plaintiff/beneficiary turns 18.  The terms either exist when the       court approves the trust instrument or they do not.  There is no       provision for them to lapse at age 18.  And looked at another way, any trust       instrument approved by the court for funding must have the terms required       by those rules, even if the trust is for the benefit of an adult.  So       there is no basis for making the terms apply only until       plaintiff/beneficiary turns 18.  This concern with the trust applies       to many terms, including court approval of trustee and attorney fees (Art.       Eight, Sec. 3.A., order pdf at p. 29); investment powers (Art. Eight, Sec.       3.E., order pdf at p. 30); loan/borrowing powers (Art. Eight, Sec. 3.F,       order pdf at p. 30); real estate powers (Art. Eight, Sec. 3.I., order pdf       at p. 31); etc.  The revised trust instrument requires the CRC rule       7.903(c) and LASC rule 4.116(b) required terms without limitation to the       period before beneficiary turns 18.     The trust instrument has       an excessive amount of typos throughout, as though the text was an OCR       character recognition scan from someone else's PDF then pasted into this       document without review or editing.  Many of the typos are critical,       and even fatal, such as:   the trust being        "irTevocable" (Art. one, Sec. C.5, order pdf at p. 17) the name of the trust        designated as "SHOUSHAN MOVSESIAN, Tmstee, or her Successor        in Trust ..." (Art. One, Sec. C.2, order pdf at p. 16) the certification of        the trust referring to it as "the WESLEE DAVIS, JR. MJNOR'S SETTLEMENT        TRUST" (certification at order pdf, p 37) that trustee "may        resign by giving thi11y (30) days' written notice ..."        (Art. Six, Section 1, order pdf at p. 24) just four words on one        of the pages, even though that is not the first or last page of an        article or section (order pdf at p. 27) the terms        "tmst," "trnst," and "tmstee" at many        places throughout the document.   and many more -        counsel should not take these as an exhaustive list of needed        edits.  This is especially concerning since trust specialist counsel        seeks $5,500 fees as part of this petition.         Petitioner must reserve a  new date and file a new petition curing the previously noted defects at least 9  court days before the continued hearing date.   Moving party is ordered to give  notice.
