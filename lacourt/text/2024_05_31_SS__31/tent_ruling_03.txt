BACKGROUND On February 28, 2020, Plaintiff Kathryn Crespin (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendant Kathryn Alverson (“Alverson”) and Does 1 to 50 for injuries arising from a motor vehicle incident.  On March 28, 2022, Alverson filed an Answer to Plaintiff’s complaint, and filed a cross-complaint against Roes 1 to 25 for (1) equitable indemnity, (2) contribution, (3) express indemnity, and (4) declaratory relief. On January 27, 2023, Alverson filed amendments to the cross-complaint, naming the City of Los Angeles as Roe 1 and Roberto Sandoval (“Sandoval “) as Roe 2.   Sandoval now demurs to Alverson’s cross-complaint in its entirety pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.010(d).  Alverson opposes the motion. As of May 23, 2024, no reply has been filed.  II. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE Sandoval embedded within the moving papers requests for judicial notice of various dates of when certain pleadings in this action were filed. The Court finds it unnecessary to take judicial notice of its own docket.   III. DEMURRER Procedural Requirement Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. (CCP § 430.41(a).)   The Court finds Sandoval fulfilled this requirement prior to filing its demurrer. (Hitch. Decl. ¶ 3).  Legal Standard A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings.  It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer, or cross-complaint).  (CCP §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true. (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].)  Discussion A party may demur to a complaint or cross-complaint on the ground that there is a defect of parties. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (d).) As used in Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (d), defect means the nonjoinder of parties. Here, Sandoval is not arguing that he is not a proper party because he has no interest in the subject of the action alleged in the complaint. Rather, the contention is that Sandoval could have been Roed in earlier as a cross-defendant and served earlier after having been Roed into the cross-complaint. Alverson filed an amendment to name Sandoval as Roe 2 on January 27, 2023, and served Sandoval with the cross-complaint approximately one year later on February 9, 2024. Sandoval acknowledges that he is presenting a demurrer and not a motion to dismiss, but simultaneously argues the Court should treat the analysis the same way as a motion to dismiss due to the delay in serving him.  A basic tenet of motion practice is that the notice of motion must state the grounds for the order being sought, and courts generally may consider only the grounds stated in the notice of motion. (Kinda v. Carpenter (2016) 203 Cal.Rptr.3d 183.) The Notice provides that Sandoval is demurring to the “entire cross-complaint for a defect or misjoinder of parties pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.010(d).” (Notice at p. 3, lines 5-6.) The Notice also states that the demurrer is “made on the grounds that Cross-complainant Alverson failed to property name and serve Cross-Defendant Roberto Sandoval by delaying service nearly 2 years after the filing of the cross-complaint.” (Id. at p. 2, lines 2-5.)  A demurrer is limited to the face of the pleading and all matters judicially noticeable. On its face, the Court finds no issue with the cross-complaint. Sandoval contends Alverson was not truly ignorant of his identity because he has lived at the address of the intersection where the collision occurred since 2011, and that there is no explanation as to why it took a year for Alverson to amend the complaint to name Sandoval as a cross-defendant. However, the ignorance of which Code of Civil Procedure section 474 speaks is actual ignorance, and a plaintiff will not be refused the right to use a Doe pleading even where the plaintiff's lack of actual knowledge is attributable to plaintiff's own negligence. (Grinnell Fire Prot. Sys. Co. v. Am. Sav. & Loan Assn. (1986) 183 Cal. App. 3d 352, 359.) In other words, even if cross-complainant Alverson could have potentially discovered Sandoval through a public records search, "there is no requirement placed upon a plaintiff to exercise reasonable diligence prior to filing the complaint to discover the defendant's identity or the facts giving him a cause of action against defendant.” (Dover v. Sadowinski (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 113, 116.) It is Sandoval’s burden to prove that Alverson knew of his identity and the facts giving rise to liability when Alverson filed her cross-complaint. (Fuller v. Tucker (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1163, 1173; see Banke and Segal (Rutter Group 2020 Update) Cal. Prac. Guide:  CPBT Statute of Limitations, ¶8:106.) The contention that Sandoval’s identity and ownership of the real property could have been discovered through a public record search falls short of meeting this burden. Taking as true the complaint’s allegations that the true names of cross-defendants were unknown, CCP § 474 is therefore satisfied and the Doe amendment appears proper on its face.  In terms of the contention that Alverson delayed in service of the cross-complaint, Sandoval provides no authority that this Court may treat an attack on a pleading in the same manner as a motion to dismiss. If Sandoval wishes to bring a motion to dismiss, then he should properly notice and file such a motion instead of embedding this request for relief within a motion both titled and stylized as a demurrer.  Further, Court is not persuaded that any delay in service of the cross-complaint is equivalent to an abandonment of Alverson’s claims against Sandoval, such that the equivalence of a terminating sanction should be imposed.   III.
