The motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant will be heard prior to trial. The court finds good cause to continue the trial date due to the defendant's timely filing of the motion for summary judgment and the lack of opposition from the plaintiff. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement on the new trial date. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
