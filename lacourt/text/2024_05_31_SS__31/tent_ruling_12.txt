BACKGROUND Plaintiff Pedro De Los Santos Ortega (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Southern California Edison Company, et al. for injuries arising from a motor vehicle v. bicycle collision. Trial is currently set for July 31, 2024.  Defendant Southern California Edison Company (“SCE”) requests the Court to continue the trial date and all related dates to February 25, 2024, or a date thereafter, in order for its motion for summary judgment (“MSJ”) to be heard prior to trial. As of May 7, 2024, no opposition has been filed.   II. MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL Here, there is good cause to continue the trial date. SCE filed its MSJ on April 15, 2024, and a trial court cannot refuse to hear a summary judgment motion filed within the time limits of CCP § 437c. (Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918. 919.) Furthermore, SCE filed this motion to continue trial on May 7, 2024, which is two and a half months before the current trial date as opposed to waiting until the eve of trial. There are no alternative means identified to address these issues, and there is otherwise no prejudice shown to any party if trial is continued, especially as no partoes opposed the motion. Therefore, SCE establish good cause for the continuance.   III.
