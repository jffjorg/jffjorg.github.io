And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge denies the plaintiff's motion to disqualify defense counsel Stephen A. Shapiro and his firm from representing the defendant in post-judgment collection matters. The plaintiff alleged that defense counsel breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with the defendant. The Judge finds that there is no evidence that the defendant is not aware of his legal options, and therefore, there has been no ethical breach or abuse for disqualification. The Court concludes that the plaintiff's motion is denied.
