And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike paragraph 2, lines 4-9 of the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by plaintiff Olegaria Canuz Ruiz De Gomez against defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA), Doe Manufacturer, and Does 1 through 20. The motion was filed by LACMTA, which argued that the allegations of negligent hiring and selection were improper and should be stricken from the complaint. The judge granted the motion in part, striking the language "was negligent in the selection and hiring of each and every other defendant as an agent and employee" (FAC at 2:5-6), without leave to amend. The judge also noted that California is a fact pleading jurisdiction, not a notice pleading jurisdiction like the federal courts.
