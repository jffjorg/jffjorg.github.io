Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication filed by Defendants Browning-Ferris Industries of California, Inc. and Republic Services, Inc. and Defendant Peter Pouwels. The Plaintiff, Grant Winfrey, has alleged sexual harassment and hostile work environment by Defendant Pouwels.

The Judge has denied the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication as to Plaintiff Winfrey's claims. The Judge found that the alleged events pled by Plaintiff Winfrey, including Defendant Pouwels' alleged sexual harassment and battery, are triable issues of material fact and cannot be decided as a matter of law.

The Judge also found that Defendant Pouwels did not meet his initial burden on his motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication, and the burden did not shift to Plaintiff Winfrey to raise a triable issue of material fact.

The Judge granted Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of certain court records and denied the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication as to Plaintiff Winfrey's claims.

The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and argument.
