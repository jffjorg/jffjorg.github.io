 Malcolm Harper v. Maximo Chavez
Tuesday, June
 4, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL
PLAINTIFF’S VERIFIED RESPONSES TO FORM AND SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES AND REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; REQUEST FOR IMPOSITION OF MONETARY SANCTIONS
 
      The complaint alleges
a claim for negligence arising from an automobile collision causing injury to
Plaintiff. On February 22, 2024, the Court granted counsel’s motion to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, who counsel attested had abandoned the case.
The order became effective the same day. Plaintiff is now self-represented. 
      Defendant served
written discovery on Plaintiff’s former counsel on November 16, 2023. Defendant
granted Plaintiff’s counsel several extensions to respond. Plaintiff’s counsel
withdrew without serving responses to the written discovery. 
      Defendant timely
served this motion on Plaintiff by mail. Plaintiff did not file an opposition. 
      Where a party
fails to timely respond to interrogatories and a document request, the court
has authority to compel a response. (Code Civ. Proc., §2030.290(b),
§2031.300(b).) Untimely responses result in a waiver of objections. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290(a), § 2031.300(a).
      The motion to
compel Plaintiff to respond to form interrogatories, special interrogatories,
and request for production of documents is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to
provide verified responses without objection to the form and special
interrogatories and request for production of documents within 10 days. 
      Imposition of
sanctions are warranted as Plaintiff has not shown substantial justification
for failing to respond to the discovery requests. The Court finds that defense
counsel’s hourly rate of $250 is reasonable. The Court permits one hour to
prepare this motion and one hour to appear. Plaintiff did not oppose the
motion, and Defendant did not file a reply brief. Accordingly, the court
imposes total sanctions of $500.00 ($250 x 2) against Plaintiff, Malcolm Harper,
payable to defense counsel within 10 days.
