And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

"Based on the information presented, I grant the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff's verified responses to form and special interrogatories and request for production of documents. I also impose monetary sanctions of $500.00 on the Plaintiff, payable to the defense counsel within 10 days. The Plaintiff failed to respond to the written discovery, and the Defendant granted the Plaintiff's counsel several extensions to respond. The Plaintiff's former counsel withdrew without serving responses to the written discovery. The Court finds that the defense counsel's hourly rate of $250 is reasonable and permits one hour to prepare this motion and one hour to appear. The Plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and the Defendant did not file a reply brief. The Court concludes that the Plaintiff has not shown substantial justification for failing to respond to the discovery requests, and therefore, the Court imposes the sanctions."
