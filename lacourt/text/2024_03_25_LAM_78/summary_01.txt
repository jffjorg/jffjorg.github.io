And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motions to compel discovery and deem requests for admissions admitted. The plaintiff, KRISTA HARVEY, moved to compel the defendant, FRANK HARVEY III, to respond to written discovery requests and to deem requests for admissions admitted. The court denied both motions as moot because the defendant has since served responses to the discovery requests.

The court granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $1,470, payable within 20 days. The court also granted the defendant's request for relief from waiver of objections, finding that the defendant's failure to serve timely responses was due to mistake, lack of sophistication, and emotional stress caused by the divorce.

The court notes that the defendant's failure to serve timely responses constitutes abuse of the discovery process and that the plaintiff's request for sanctions was excessive. The court awards $1,470 for three hours of attorney time at a rate of $450 per hour and filing fees.
