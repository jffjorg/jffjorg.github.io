Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production and special interrogatories filed by the defendant, United Airlines, Inc. The plaintiff, Andrew Risk, has failed to provide complete supplemental responses to the defendant's discovery requests for over one year, despite participating in an informal discovery conference (IDC). The judge has denied the motion in part and granted it in part.

The judge has ordered the parties to appear at a hearing on March 25, 2024, at which time the plaintiff must indicate whether he is seeking to recover health insurance costs/expenses incurred for the time he was insured under his ex-wife's health insurance plan. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to produce documents detailing the coverage of his replacement health insurance policy (Blue Shield) and his ex-wife's health insurance policy under which he was covered for a time (Blue Cross).

The judge has granted the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $3,660, payable within 20 days after the date of this order. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's claim that he is no longer seeking damages for out-of-pocket medical expenses incurred in relation to his claims against the defendant.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to provide notice of the sanctions. The rest of the motion to compel further responses is denied because the plaintiff provided complete supplemental responses to the defendant's special interrogatories and requests for production, though late.
