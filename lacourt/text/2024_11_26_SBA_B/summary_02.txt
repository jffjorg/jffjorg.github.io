And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by plaintiff's counsel, Mindy S. Bish, Esq., to be relieved as counsel. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw as long as it does not prejudice the client and does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court notes that the attorney-client relationship has been undermined by differences between the firm and the plaintiff, and that the firm has changed its name and the attorney of record has changed. The court finds it necessary for plaintiff's counsel to provide further details at the hearing. The judge also notes that the name change of the firm and the change of the attorney of record occurred prior to the filing of the motion to be relieved, which raises questions about why plaintiff's counsel is seeking to be relieved. The court is giving plaintiff's counsel an opportunity to provide further information at the hearing.
