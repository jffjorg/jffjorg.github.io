BACKGROUND
            On May 7, 2021, David Crockett and
Tamicka Oliver filed a complaint against PK3C, LLC for (1) breach of implied
warranty of habitability, (2) negligent maintenance of premises, (3)
maintenance of nuisance, (4) IIED, (5) NIED, (6) failure to disclose latent
defects, (7) negligent misrepresentation, (8) breach of contract, and (9) loss
of consortium.  Plaintiffs allege that on
March 1, 2016, plaintiffs entered into a written Residential Lease Agreement
with defendants.  At the time plaintiffs
took possession, the premises were uninhabitable and unfit for human occupation
in that the toilet and bathtub routinely backed up and water leaked from the
ceiling light fixture.  From the date
plaintiffs moved into the premises, they became increasingly aware of numerous
defects and dangerous conditions, including an incident occurring in January 2019
when the ceiling caved in about the bathtub/shower area and another incident on
November 21, 2020, when the bathroom ceiling caved in about the toilet
plaintiff was sitting and striking him in the head, neck, and upper body
thereby causing him serious bodily injury. 
They repeatedly notified the manager of the defects and dangerous
conditions, but defendants failed and refused to make the necessary and proper
repairs.
            On July 14, 2023, the Court denied
without prejudice plaintiffs’ motion to file a First Amended Complaint. 
            On September 27, 2023, the Court
granted plaintiffs’ motion to file a FAC.
            On October 3, 2023, plaintiffs filed
a FAC adding Yong Min Kim, Kae Soo Kim, Yong Mi Kim, Yong Son Kim, and Puk Ja
Kim as defendants and alter ego allegations.
            On February 21, 2024, plaintiffs
filed a SAC for (1) breach of implied warranty of habitability, (2) maintenance
of nuisance, (3) IIED, (4) NIED, (5) negligent misrepresentation, (6) breach of
contract, and (7) loss of consortium.
            On August 17, 2024, plaintiffs filed
an amendment designating Kang Won Lee as Doe 10.
LEGAL
AUTHORITY
CCP §418.10 states:  “(a) A defendant, on or before the last day
of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for
good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the
following purposes:
(1) To quash service of summons on
the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.
(2) To stay or dismiss the action
on the ground of inconvenient forum.
(3) To dismiss the action pursuant
to the applicable provisions of Chapter 1.5 (commencing with Section 583.110)
of Title 8.”  This section provides the
exclusive procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset.  Roy v. Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal.
App. 4th 337, 342.  Although defendant is
the moving party, the burden of proof is on plaintiff to defeat the motion by
establishing that jurisdictional grounds exist. 
Mihlon v. Superior Court (1985) 169 Cal. App. 3d 703, 710.
Under Evidence Code § 647, “[t]he
return of a process server registered pursuant to Chapter 16 (commencing with
Section 22350) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code upon process
or notice establishes a presumption, affecting the burden of producing
evidence, of the facts stated in the return.” 
Under Evidence Code § 604, “[t]he effect of a presumption affecting the
burden of producing evidence is to require the trier of fact to assume the
existence of the presumed fact unless and until evidence is introduced which
would support a finding of its nonexistence, in which case the trier of fact
shall determine the existence or nonexistence of the presumed fact from the
evidence and without regard to the presumption. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the drawing of any
inference that may be appropriate.”
DISCUSSION
            Defendants Kae Soo Kim, Yong Min
Kim, Yong Son Kim, and Yong Mi Kim request an order quashing the service of
summons on the ground for lack of proper service.
            Kae Soo Kim (identified as
“father”)
            The proof of service filed on April
17, 2024 indicates that defendant was personally served by a registered process
server at 2432 El Moreno Street, La Crescenta, on March 19, 2024.  He is described as in their 30s, Asian female,
135 lbs., 5’4” height.
            Kae Soo Kim states in his
declaration that he is an 89-year-old Asian man, approximately 6’ tall and
weighs 165 lbs.  He states that he is a
resident of Germany and lists his address in Duesseldorf and that he has lived
in Germany for approximately 55 years. 
He was not in California in March 2024, the La Crescenta house is not
his place of residence or work, and he was not personally served at the La
Crescenta address.
            Plaintiffs did not file an
opposition.  They did file an amended
proof of service on November 5, 2024 indicating that Kae Soo Kim was substitute
served on March 19, 2024, via “Jane Doe,” with the same description as stated
on the April 17, 2024 proof of service.
            The Court finds that defendant has
met his burden that he was not properly served. 
Plaintiffs have not met their burden of providing sufficient evidence to
show that defendant was properly served via substitute service at their dwelling
house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address.  
 
            Puk Ja Kim (identified as
“mother”)
The proof of service filed on April
17, 2024 indicates that defendant was substitute served by a registered process
server at 2432 El Moreno Street, La Crescenta, on March 19, 2024 via Kae Soo
Kim, 30s, Asian female, 135 lbs., 5’4”.
Defendants state that Puk Ja Kim is
deceased, having passed away in June 2017. 
See Kae Soo Kim decl.  Further,
the description of Kae Soo Kim is incorrect as he is an 89-year old male.
            Plaintiffs did not file an
opposition.  They did file an amended
proof of service on November 5, 2024 indicating that Puk Ja Kim was substitute
served on March 19, 2024, via “Jane Doe,” with the same description as stated
on the April 17, 2024 proof of service.
            Defendants have met their burden
that Puk Ja Kim was not properly served. 
The evidence indicates that she is deceased.  An action cannot be brought against her
individually.  See CCP §377.40.
 
            Yong Min Kim (identified as
son)
            The proof of service filed on April
17, 2024 indicates that defendant was personally served by a registered process
server at 2432 El Moreno Street, La Crescenta, on March 22, 2024.
The proof of service filed on May
8, 2024 indicates that defendant was substitute served at 2432 El Moreno
Street, La Crescenta on April 28, 2024 via Pok Ja Kim [which the Court notes is
purportedly deceased], described as 52, Asian female, 160 lbs., 5’6” height.
Yong Min Kim states in his
declaration that he is a current resident of Spain and that his address is in
Santa Cruz de Tenerife.  He states that
he has lived and worked in Spain for approximately four years and that he was
not in California in March 2024, and has not been to California since the start
of the Covid-19 pandemic.  He states that
the La Crescenta address is not his place of residence or work and that he was
not at the house on March 22, 2024 and was not personally served. 
Plaintiffs did not file an
opposition.  They did file an amended
proof of service on November 5, 2024 indicating that Yong Min Kim was
substitute served on March 19, 2024, via “Jane Doe,” 30s, Asian female, 135
lbs., 5’4”.
The Court finds that defendant has
met his burden that he was not properly served. 
Plaintiffs have not met their burden of providing sufficient evidence to
show that defendant was properly served via substitute service at their dwelling
house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address.  
 
            Yong Son Kim (identified as
“daughter”)
            The proof of service filed on April
17, 2024 indicates that defendant was personally served by a registered process
server at 2432 El Moreno Street, La Crescenta, on March 22, 2024.
            Yong Son Kim states in her
declaration that she is a current resident of Orange County and her current
address is on Lilly Avenue in Los Alamitos, and that the La Crescenta address
is not her place of residence or work or mailing address.  She also states that she was not at the La
Crescenta address on March 22, 2024 and was not personally served. 
            The Court finds that defendant has
rebutted the presumption that they were properly served.  Plaintiffs have not met their burden of
providing sufficient evidence to show that defendant was properly served via
substitute service at their dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place
of business, or usual mailing address.  
 
            Yong Mi Kim (identified as
“daughter”)
The proof of service filed on April
17, 2024 indicates that defendant was substitute served by a registered process
server at 2432 El Moreno Street, La Crescenta, on March 19, 2024, via Kae Soo
Kim, described as in their 30s, Asian female, 135 lbs., 5’4” height.
Defendant argues that “Kae Soo
Kim’s” description is incorrect as he is an 89-year old male.
Plaintiffs did not file an
opposition.  They did file an amended
proof of service indicating that Yong Mi Kim was substitute served on March 19,
2024, via “Jane Doe,” with the same description as stated on the April 17, 2024
proof of service.
There is no declaration from
defendant.  Also, it is unclear to the
Court as to whether Yong Mi Kim resides at the La Crescenta address.  The amended proof of service indicates that
she was substitute served by a “Jane Doe,” thus, defendant’s argument that the
first proof of service is defective because it gives a wrong description of Kae
Soo Kim is of little import.  
Thus, the Court finds that
defendant Yong Mi Kim has not met her burden of rebutting the presumption that
she was properly served.
Thus, the motion is GRANTED as to Kae
Soo Kim, Yong Min Kim, and Yong Son Kim. 
 The motion is DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE as to defendant Yong Mi Kim.
 
ORDER
The motion is GRANTED as to
defendants Kae Soo Kim, Yong Min Kim, and Yong Son Kim.  The proofs of service are QUASHED.   The motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE as to
defendant Yong Mi Kim.
Moving defendants are ordered to
give notice.
