And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for attorney's fees and costs, which was made under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1038. The defendant, City of Lomita, sought to recover $109,984.50 in attorney's fees and costs for defending against the plaintiff's lawsuit.

The plaintiff, Christy Andrews, was injured in an accident when a tree fell onto her while she was walking down the side of the road in Lomita. The plaintiff alleged that the city was liable for the accident because it had a duty to maintain the road and the tree.

The defendant argued that the plaintiff lacked good faith and reasonable cause in filing the lawsuit against it, and therefore, the defendant was entitled to recover attorney's fees and costs. The defendant pointed out that it had sent letters to the plaintiff's counsel stating that the lawsuit was frivolous and that the city did not own or control the tree.

The plaintiff argued that the lawsuit was maintained in good faith and with reasonable cause, and that there were ambiguities as to the city's ownership and control of the tree. The plaintiff also argued that the city's request for fees was unreasonable and unsupported.

The court found that the plaintiff did not lack good faith and reasonable cause in filing or maintaining the complaint against City of Lomita. The court noted that there were ambiguities as to the city's ownership and control of the tree, and that the city's own party witness testified that the tree was visibly not structurally sound. The court therefore denied the defendant's motion for attorney's fees and costs.
