And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to quash service of summons as to defendants Kae Soo Kim, Yong Min Kim, and Yong Son Kim. The court finds that these defendants were not properly served with the summons. The motion is denied without prejudice as to defendant Yong Mi Kim, as the court is unable to determine whether she was properly served.

The court's decision is based on the evidence presented, including the declarations of the defendants and the proofs of service. The court finds that the defendants have met their burden of showing that they were not properly served, and that the plaintiffs have not met their burden of showing that the defendants were properly served.

The court orders that the proofs of service be quashed as to defendants Kae Soo Kim, Yong Min Kim, and Yong Son Kim, and that the defendants be notified of the court's decision.
