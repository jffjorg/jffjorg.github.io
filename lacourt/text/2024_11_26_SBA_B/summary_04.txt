And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiff, Adam Garasad, in the case of unlawful detainer against the Defendant, Linda Veerkamp. The Plaintiff seeks to evict the Defendant from the property at 18320 Regina Avenue, Torrance, which the Plaintiff acquired at a trustee's sale. The Defendant failed to serve a notice to quit, and more than three days have elapsed since the notice was served. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has met his burden of showing that there is no defense to the cause of action for unlawful detainer, as he has proved each element of the cause of action under Civil Code section 1161a. The Defendant has not presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact, and the motion is granted.
