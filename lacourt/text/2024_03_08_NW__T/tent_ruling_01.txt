[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendant Lucky 8 Motors LLC’s Motion to
Compel Arbitration and Stay the Action is DENIED.   Defendant to respond to the complaint within
30 days.
Introduction 
Defendant Lucky 8 Motors LLC dba
Fusion Luxury Motors (Defendant) moved to compel arbitration and stay Plaintiff
Amir Shaker’s (Plaintiff) action. 
Discussion 
In deciding a motion to compel
arbitration, trial courts must decide first whether an enforceable arbitration
agreement exists between the parties, and then determine the second gateway
issue whether the claims are covered within the scope of the agreement.  (Hyundai Amco America, Inc. v. S3H, Inc.
(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 572, 577; Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118
Cal.App.4th 955, 961.)  The initial
burden of proving the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate is on the
moving party.  (Peng v. First Republic
Bank (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1468.) 
Once it is determined that an enforceable arbitration agreement exists,
the burden is on the “party opposing arbitration to demonstrate that an
arbitration clause cannot be interpreted to require arbitration of the
dispute.” (Buckhorn v. St. Jude Heritage Medical Group (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th
1401, 1406.)  
Defendant cited to the “Vehicle
Consignment and Sales Agreement” attached to the Complaint.  The alleged arbitration agreement
stated:  “Any claim made that cannot be
resolved shall be adjudicated by the American Arbitration Association.”  (Adam Grant Decl. par. 2, Exh. 2: Complaint,
Exh. A, pg. 3, par. 12, second sentence.) 
A plain reading of the provision shows that there was no express
reference to any binding arbitration. 
The Court finds the provision to be vague and ambiguous as to any
agreement to submit disputes to binding arbitration or even waive a right to a
jury trial.  The word “adjudicate” does
not equate to “binding arbitration.”  The
fact that the provision referenced the “American Arbitration Association” (AAA)
also does not clarify the word “adjudicate” because AAA provides several
services, one of which is mediation. 
Mediation is not binding arbitration. 
The arbitration provision’s reference to AAA adds to the vagueness and
ambiguity because AAA does not solely provide arbitration services.  Absent a clear agreement to submit disputes
to arbitration, courts will not infer that the right to a jury trial has been
waived.  (Adajar v. RWR Homes, Inc.
(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 563, 569; Titan Group, Inc. v. Sonoma Valley County
Sanitation Dist. (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 1122, 1129.)  Because the arbitration provision at issue is
vague and ambiguous, Defendant failed to meet their initial burden to show the
existence of an agreement to submit disputes to binding arbitration.  Because Defendant failed to meet their
initial burden, the burden did not shift to Plaintiff.  Defendant’s argument that an arbitration
agreement exists between the parties is unpersuasive.
The motion to compel arbitration
and stay the action is DENIED.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
