And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge in the case of 24VECV00042. The Defendant, Lucky 8 Motors LLC dba Fusion Luxury Motors, moved to compel arbitration and stay the action. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that the alleged arbitration agreement in the Vehicle Consignment and Sales Agreement is vague and ambiguous. The Judge notes that the agreement does not contain a clear reference to binding arbitration, and the use of the term "adjudicate" does not equate to "binding arbitration." The Judge also finds that the reference to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) adds to the vagueness and ambiguity of the agreement. Because the agreement is unclear, the Judge denies the motion to compel arbitration and stay the action, and orders the Defendant to respond to the complaint within 30 days.
