And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion filed by Universal Bank for an order for discharge and payment of attorneys' fees and costs in the interpleader action. The motion is unopposed, but the court denies it without prejudice due to the lack of service on all interested parties. The court finds that Universal Bank has established no interest in the funds and has deposited the disputed amount with the court. However, the court also notes that the defendants Porteous, Griffith, and Lewis were not served with the complaint or the motion, and their addresses and whereabouts are unknown. The court concludes that it is inappropriate to award attorneys' fees and costs to Universal Bank at this time.
