without Motion to Strike 
The Court considered the moving papers.
            The Court affirms its tentative
ruling issued on October 18, 2024. The ruling was as follows: 
 
The Court
SUSTAINS WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND Defendant’s demurrer to the
entirety of Plaintiff’s Complaint.
 
Background
            On
August 18, 2023, Plaintiff Ih Heen Chang, Aka Bess Chang filed a complaint
against Defendants Aegis Asset Backed Security, LLC erroneously also sued as
aka Aegis Funding, Inc. (“Aegis”), the Grace M. Chien Trust, Escrow Heights
Inc, Grace M. Chien, Jason Moore (“Moore”), Carrie Patrick, and Does 1 through
25. The Complaint alleges (1) breach of contract; (2) fraud; and (3) breach of
fiduciary duties. On August 19, 2024, Defendants filed a Reply regarding
Non-Opposition to Demurrer. On September 3, 2024, the Court continued the
hearing on the instant motion because of Defendants failure to comply with the
meet and confer requirement. (CCP §430.41.)
            On
October 4, 2024, in pro per Plaintiff filed a request for a continuance so that
her new attorney would be present for the meet and confer. On the same day,
Defendants filed a meet and confer declaration outlining Defense Counsel’s
efforts to meet and confer with in pro per plaintiff showing that Plaintiff
refused to meet until her attorney was present. On October 7, 2024, Plaintiff
re-filed the request for a continuance with the same argument. On October 10,
2024, Defendants filed their reply in support of the instant motion. As of
October 11, 2024, no opposition has been filed nor a substitution of
attorney.  
 
Legal
Standard
            When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor
v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
1216, 1228.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on
the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
            CCP
§430.41(a) states that, before filing a demurrer, the moving party must engage
in a specified meet and confer process with the party who filed the pleading at
issue for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached as to
the filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer/motion to strike.  “[T]he demurring party shall
meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an
agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the
demurrer.  If an amended complaint…is filed, the responding party shall
meet and confer again with the party who filed the amended pleading before a
demurrer to the amended pleading.” (emphasis added.) (CCP §430.41(a).) A
declaration setting forth such meet and confer efforts must accompany the
demurrer. (CCP § 430.41(a)(3).)

            The Court grants judicial notice pursuant
to California Evidence Code sections 451 and 452, but not of the facts stated

Discussion
Meet and Confer       
            The
Court ordered that the parties meet and confer at least nine (9) court days
before the October 18, 2024, continued hearing date, and that Defense counsel
provide the Court with a signed Declaration reflecting the meet and confer
efforts.  Here, Defense counsel submitted
the Declaration outlining his efforts to meet and confer with in pro per
Plaintiff who refused to meet without her new attorney. (Fink Decl. ¶¶ 10-14.) However,
Plaintiff has not filed a substitution of attorney and remains self-represented.
Thus, Defendants have satisfied the meet and confer requirement. 
 
Demurrer
             Defendants Aegis Asset Backed Security, LLC,
erroneously also sued as aka Aegis Funding, Inc. and Jason Moore (collectively,
“Defendants”), demur to the Complaint of Plaintiff IH Helen Chang, aka Bess
Chang on the grounds that (1) there is already another action pending between
Plaintiff and Aegis on essentially the same claims, (2) the Complaint
improperly names Moore, alleged to be the owner of Aegis, as a party, claiming
he was acting in the course and scope of his duties, and (3) the causes of
action fail to allege sufficient facts. 
 
            Plea
in Abatement 
            Moving
Defendants contend that there is another action pending between the same
parties in the California Court of
Appeals, 2nd District, Case No. B322264 Ih Heen Chang v. Aegis Asset Backed
Securities, LLC, et al., involving substantially the same causes of
action and the same parties as set forth in the 1st through 3rd
causes of action.” (Demurrer p.7.) Pursuant to CCP § 430.10(c), it is a
proper ground for demurrer where “[t]here is another action pending between the
same parties on the same cause of action.” The later-filed suit is “abated”
(stayed) pending resolution of the earlier action which, if concluded on the
merits will be res judicata and if not, the later action will proceed. (Ibid.)
The court can take judicial notice of the court files in determining the basis
for this ground. (See Bistawros v. Greenberg (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 189,
191-192.) As held in Colvig v. RKO General, Inc., (1965) 232
Cal.App.2d 56, 70-71: “In order to sustain the plea of another action pending
it is essential that it shall appear: (1) That both suits are predicated upon
the same cause of action; (2) that both suits are pending in the same
jurisdiction; and (3) that both suits are contested by the same parties. “A
plea in abatement pursuant to¿section 430.10, subdivision (c), may be made by
demurrer or answer when there is another action pending between the¿same
parties¿on the¿same cause of action.” (Plant Insulation Co.
v. Fibreboard Corp.¿(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781, 787.) 
            Here,
the prior action was brought in the Los Angeles Superior Court and is now
pending in front of the Second Appellate District on appeal. The First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) in the prior action, alleged five causes of action against
Aegis for Wrongful Foreclosure, Promissory Estoppel, Fraud, Negligent
Misrepresentation, and violation of Business & Professions Code § 17200. The
complaint for the current case alleges three causes of action for Breach of
Contract, Fraud, and Breach of Fiduciary Duties.  Although both cases arise out of the same alleged
breach of the Adequate Protection Order entered in Plaintiff’s bankruptcy, for
purposes of plea abatement, “the fact that the same evidence tends to prove
both causes is not enough if the causes of action are different.” (Conservatorship
of Pacheco, 224 Cal.App.3d at 176.)  Accordingly, the fact that the
cases are not “predicated upon the same cause of action” provides grounds to
overrule the instant demurrer as to the breach of contract and the breach of
fiduciary duty causes of action. (Id.) Moreover, as to the fraud
cause of action in both cases, James Moore and other parties were not included
in the prior action. Thus, abatement is not appropriate. 
            
Other Merits
            Just
as the Court in Herzberg v. County of Plumas found that plaintiffs who
“did not oppose the County's demurrer to this portion of their seventh cause of
action . . . abandoned the issue.” (Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005)
133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20.) Here, as of October 14, 2024, Plaintiff has not filed
any opposition and thus has abandoned the issues. 
            Nevertheless,
the Court will further analyze each cause of action. 
 
            Breach
of Contract 
            “To establish a cause of action for breach of contract,
the plaintiff must plead and prove (1) the existence of the contract, (2) the
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s
breach, and (4) resulting damages to the plaintiff.”  (Maxwell v.
Dolezal (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 93, 97-98 [internal citation omitted].) For
a written contract, the plaintiff may “plead the legal effect of the contract
rather than the price language.” (Ibid.) To “plead a contract by its
legal effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the substance of its relevant terms. This
is more difficult, for it requires a careful analysis of the instrument,
comprehensiveness in statement, and avoidance of legal conclusions.’ ” (McKell
v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.)  
            Here,
the Complaint alleges “Plaintiff and defendants entered into an Adequate
Protection Payment Plan on 08/12/2020.” (Complaint ¶ 52.) The
Complaint further alleges “Plaintiff has performed all conditions, covenants,
and promises on its part to be performed in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement, except any conditions, covenants, or promises that may have been
prevented or excused by the Defendants.” (Complaint ¶ 54.) The
Complaint also states, “Plaintiff CHANG exercised her contractual duty to make
monthly payments on time in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. . .Defendant
JASON MOORE, however, made Auction Trustee Sale on Plaintiff Chang's property
on 09/15/2020 without Chang's knowledge.” (Complaint ¶¶ 55-56.) The Complaint
states “Defendants' failure to fulfill the terms and conditions of the
contract, and failure to perform their obligations, as alleged, constituted a
breach of contract.” (Complaint ¶ 60.) 
            These
facts are conclusory and fail to provide sufficient facts to state a cause of
action for breach of contract. Moreover, Defendant presented evidence showing
that the parties had stipulated that the Adequate Protection Payment Plan was
no longer binding after the bankruptcy case was dismissed. (RJN Exhibits 6 at
p.5, ¶ 8 and 10 at p.8 of Exhibit A.) Here, the foreclosure occurred after the
bankruptcy case was dismissed and the Adequate Protection Plan was no longer
binding. (Complaint ¶ 34.) Notably, Plaintiff failed to file an opposition. 
            Thus,
the Court SUSTAINS WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to this cause of action.
 
            Fraud

            “The
elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Lazar v.
Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal. 4th 631, 638.) “[F]raud
must be pled specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not suffice. .
. .This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Lazar,
supra, 12 Cal. 4th at 645 [internal quotation marks and ellipses
omitted].) The law holds plaintiffs to a higher stand
where there is a corporate defendant. In that case plaintiff must “allege the
names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their
authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it
was said or written.” (Id. at p. 645; See also Wald v. TruSpeed
Motorcars, LLC (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 378 [applying the heightened
corporate pleading standing to an LLC].)
            Here,
the Complaint alleges “Plaintiff believed in said material factual
representations, which were made intentionally falsely, consciously, and
purposefully by defrauding her out of the home exemptions of $175.000.”
(Complaint ¶ 64.) The Complaint further alleges “Defendants' misrepresentations
were intentionally and knowingly false as they did not honor their promises.
Defendants intended Plaintiff to rely on their misrepresentation in order to
induce Plaintiff to enter into the Agreement. 
Plaintiff reasonably and justifiably relied on Defendants'
misrepresentation based upon said representations. (Complaint ¶¶ 67-69.) These
facts are conclusory and fail to satisfy the heightened corporate pleading
standing as Aegis is a corporate defendant.
            As
Plaintiff failed to file an opposition and the Court is therefore unaware of
Plaintiff’s ability to amend this cause of action, the Court SUSTAINS WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND. 

 
            Breach
of Fiduciary Duty 
            To
establish a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, plaintiff must plead
“(1) existence of a fiduciary duty; (2) breach of the fiduciary duty; and (3)
damage proximately caused by the breach.” (Gutierrez v. Girardi (2011)
194 Cal. App. 4th 925, 932.) A fiduciary relationship requires that a relation
existing between parties to a transaction wherein one of the parties is duty
bound to act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the other party.  (Wolf v. Superior Court (2003) 107
Cal.App.4th 25, 29 [internal citations omitted].) A relationship ordinarily
exists when “a con¿dence is reposed by one person in the integrity of another,
and . . . the party in whom the con¿dence is reposed, if he voluntarily accepts
or assumes to accept the con¿dence, can take no advantage from his acts
relating to the interest of the other party without the latter’s knowledge or
consent.’” (Ibid.)
            The
Complaint alleges, “All Defendants were Plaintiff's mortgage lenders in a
fiduciary relationship with each other. Defendants breached their fiduciary
duty of care when, they among other things, asked Plaintiff to trust them and
obtain loan from them, they promised to be open and honest when providing the
details of the loan terms and conditions in good faith.” (Complaint at ¶¶ 74,
76.) The Complaint further alleges “Defendants breached their duties of loyalty
and good faith by, among other things, intentionally violating federal mortgage
laws in an attempt to benefit themselves at the expense of Plaintiff.”
(Complaint at ¶ 77.) 
            For
the same reasons mentioned above, these facts fail to constitute a cause of
action for breach of fiduciary duty. 
            As
Plaintiff failed to file an opposition and the Court is therefore unaware of
Plaintiff’s ability to amend this cause of action, the Court SUSTAINS WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
            Accordingly,
the Court SUSTAINS WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND Defendant’s demurrer to the
entirety of Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
             
            It
is so ordered.
