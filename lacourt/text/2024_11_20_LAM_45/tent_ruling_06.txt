Background
            On
November 8, 2023, Plaintiffs Baird A. Brown, an individual (“Mr. Brown”) and as
sole owner of Baird Brown, a Professional Corporation (“BrownLaw”), and Ann
Brown filed a Complaint against defendants Donald G. Norris, an individual;
Donald G. Norris, a Law Corporation (“Norris Defendants”); Michelle Pak (“Ms.
Pak”), an individual; and Taurin Robinson (“Robinson”), an individual
(collectively, “Defendants”), and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, alleging causes
of action for (1) Elder Financial Abuse – CA Welf. & Inst. Code § 15600 et
seq; (2) Theft & Conversion – CA Penal Code § 496(c); (3) Unfair
Competition – CA Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq; (4) Breach of Fiduciary
Duty; and (5) Conspiracy.
            The
Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows: Ms. Pak, Mr. Brown’s former
office manager and Robinson, Mr. Brown’s former legal assistant conspired with
Norris Defendants to transfer Mr. Brown’s clients and his practice to Norris
Defendants. (Compl., ¶¶12-14.) Furthermore, defendants conspired to divert Mr.
Brown’s legal fees to Norris Defendants, and to substitute Norris Defendants as
counsel of record for many of Mr. Brown’s clients. (Id. at ¶16, 18.)
Additionally, defendants breached ethical responsibilities to timely send two
of Mr. Brown’s clients’ shares of their settlement funds, with Norris
Defendants, instead of Mr. Brown, receiving the attorney fees from the
settlements. (Id. at ¶17, 25.)
            On
January 12, 2024, Norris Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs;
Andrew M. White, an individual; Jonathan N. White, an individual
(“Cross-Defendants”), and ROES 1-10, inclusive, alleging causes of action for  (1) Conversion; (2) Violation of CA Penal
Code § 502; (3) Unfair Practices Act – CA Bus. & Prof. Code §17200 et seq;
(4) Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; and (5) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty.
            On
February 5, 2024, Ms. Pak filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs; Andrew M.
White, an individual; Jonathan N. White, an individual (“Cross-Defendants”),
and ROES 1-10, inclusive, alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract;
(2) Money Had and Received; (3) Common Count - Open Book Account; (4) Common
Count - Account Stated; (5) Conversion; (6) Unauthorized Access to Computer
Files and Documents (Violation of CA Penal Code § 502); (7) Violation of the
Unfair Practices Act – CA Bus. & Prof. Code §17200 et seq; (8) Battery; (9)
Assault; (10) Sexual Battery; (11) Sexual Harassment in Violation of FEHA,
Gov’t Code 12940, et seq; (12) Failure to Prevent Sexual Harassment in
Violation of FEHA, Gov’t Code Sec. 12940(k); (13) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress; and (14) Violations of the Elder And Dependent Adult Civil
Protection Act) (Wel. & Inst. § 15600, et seq.).
            On
August 13, 2024, Baird A. Brown and Baird Brown, a Professional Law Corporation
(together, “Plaintiffs”) filed the instant motion for summary adjudication (“MSA”)
on the issue of whether Ms. Pak owed a fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs.  
 On November 6, 2024, Ms. Pak filed an
opposition to the motion.
 
Legal
Standard
In reviewing a motion for summary
judgment, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues
framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the
opponent’s claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated
the existence of a triable, material factual issue.”  (Hinesley v.
Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) 
“A party may move for summary adjudication
as to one or more causes of action within an action, one or more affirmative
defenses, one or more claims for damages, or one or more issues of duty, if
that party contends that the cause of action has no merit or that there is no
affirmative defense thereto, or that there is no merit to an affirmative
defense as to any cause of action, or both, or that there is no merit to a
claim for damages . . . or that one or more defendants either owed or did not
owe a duty to the plaintiff or plaintiffs.  A motion for summary
adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of
action, an affirmative defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of
duty.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1).)  A motion for
summary adjudication shall proceed in all procedural respects as a motion for
summary judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(f)(2).)   
“[T]he initial burden is always on the
moving party to make a prima facia showing that there are no triable issues of
material fact.”  (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)  A defendant moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of
action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete
defense to the cause of action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2).)  A moving defendant need not conclusively negate an element of
plaintiff’s cause of action.  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 854.) 
To meet this burden of showing a cause of
action cannot be established, a defendant must show not only “that the
plaintiff does not possess needed evidence” but also that “the plaintiff
cannot reasonably obtain needed evidence.” (Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at p. 854.) It is insufficient for the defendant to merely point out
the absence of evidence.  (Gaggero v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th
884, 891.)  The defendant “must also produce evidence that the plaintiff
cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or her claim.”  (Ibid.)¿
The supporting evidence can be in the form of affidavits, declarations,
admissions, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and matters of which
judicial notice may be taken.  (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th
at p. 855.) 
“Once the defendant . . . has met that
burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue
of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense
thereto.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  The plaintiff
may not merely rely on allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a
triable issue of material fact exists, but instead, “shall set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the
cause of action.”  (Ibid.)  “If the plaintiff cannot do so,
summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical
Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
The court must “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve all
doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party,” including “all
inferences reasonably drawn therefrom.”  (Yanowitz v. L’Oreal USA, Inc.
(2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1037; Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
844-45.)  “On a summary judgment motion, the court must therefore consider
what inferences favoring the opposing party a factfinder could reasonably draw
from the evidence.  While viewing the evidence in this manner, the court
must bear in mind that its primary function is to identify issues rather than
to determine issues.  [Citation.]  Only when the inferences are
indisputable may the court decide the issues as a matter of law.  If the
evidence is in conflict, the factual issues must be resolved by trial.”  (Binder
v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839.)  
Further, “the trial court may not weigh
the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine whose version is more
likely true.  [Citation.]  Nor may the trial court grant summary
judgment based on the court’s evaluation of credibility. 
[Citation.]”  (Id. at p. 840; see also Weiss v. People ex
rel.  Department of Transportation (2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts
deciding motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not weigh the
evidence but must instead view it in the light most favorable to the opposing
party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that
party”].)   
Specifically for the instant motion, “[d]uty,
being a question of law, is particularly amenable to resolution by summary
judgment.” (Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Superior Court of L.A. Cnty.
(2018) 4 Cal.5th 607, 618.) “Whether a fiduciary duty exists is generally a
question of law.” (Hodges v. County of Placer (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 537,
546.)
  
Separate Statement

According to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(c)(2), when filing a motion for summary judgment,
the motion “must contain and be supported” by a “[s]eparate statement of
undisputed material facts in support of [moving party's] motion for
summary judgment or summary adjudication or both.” The Separate Statement in
support of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication “must be in the
two-column format . . . . The statement must state in numerical sequence the
undisputed material facts in the first column followed by the evidence that
establishes those undisputed facts in that same column. Citation to the
evidence in support of each material fact must include reference to the
exhibit, title, page, and line numbers.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(d)(3).)

             Along with the MSA, on August 13, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a separate statement that complied with California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1350. 
 
Objections

            Ms. Pak
submit objections to ¶¶ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 13 of the declaration of
Mr. Brown on the basis of Improper Opinion and Relevance. Each of Ms. Pak’s
objections to Mr. Brown’s declaration is overruled. 
 
Discussion
            Plaintiffs move for summary
adjudication on the question of whether Ms. Pak owed fiduciary duties,
including the Fiduciary Duty of Loyalty, to Plaintiffs during the period from
2015 to October 21, 2023, the date upon which Ms. Pak was terminated for cause.

            “A fiduciary relationship is any
relation existing between parties to a transaction wherein one of the parties
is in duty bound to act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the other
party.” (Wolf v. Superior Ct. (2003)107 Cal.App.4th 25, 29.) “A
fiduciary or confidential relationship can arise when confidence is reposed by
persons in the integrity of others, and if the latter voluntarily accepts or
assumes to accept the confidence, he or she may not act so as to take advantage
of the other's interest without that person's knowledge or consent.” (Pierce
v. Lyman (1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1101–02.) “The essence of a fiduciary
or confidential relationship is that the parties do not deal on equal terms,
because the person in whom trust and confidence is reposed and who accepts that
trust and confidence is in a superior position to exert unique influence over
the dependent party.” (Barbara A. v. John G. (1983) 45 Cal.App.3d 369,
383.)
“[B]efore a person can be charged with a fiduciary obligation, he must
either knowingly undertake to act on behalf and for the benefit of another, or
must enter into a relationship which imposes that undertaking as a matter of
law.” (Mattel, Inc. v. MGA Ent., Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2011)
 782 F.Supp.2d 911, 988.) 
            Plaintiffs argue that Ms. Pak, as a matter of law,
owed a fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs for the entire time that she worked for Mr.
Brown in a managerial role at BrownLaw. Plaintiffs state that since Ms. Pak
began working for BrownLaw in 2001, Mr. Brown began entrusting Ms. Pak with
more and more management and financial responsibilities, and by 2015, Ms. Pak
held the position of office manager of BrownLaw, which allowed her to be “in
charge of all nonlawyer aspects of BrownLaw’s business, client, and financial
operations.” (Brown Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) 
Mr. Brown entrusted Ms. Pak to the point of adding her as an approved
signatory to BrownLaw’s Client Trust Account at Bank America. (Id. at ¶
4; White Decl., Exhibit C.) According to Mr. Brown, some of the duties that Ms.
Pak acquired by 2015 as officer manager include: (1) Collecting and recording
all of BrownLaw’s receipts; (2) Assuring that all funds received on behalf of
BrownLaw clients were properly segregated into BrownLaw’s client trust account;
(3) Making timely disbursements to BrownLaw clients of each client’s share of
settlement payments received by BrownLaw; from 2015 to 2023, such disbursements
were routinely made by checks which Ms. Pak prepared and signed, drawn on the
BrownLaw client trust account; (4) Approving and then paying all the law firm’s
bills; (5) Preserving and maintaining BrownLaw’s client documents and client
files; (6) Supervising the collection and secure storage of client information,
including such confidential information as social security numbers, telephone
numbers, addresses, health and medical information, and other client
information; (7) Maintaining accurate records of all of BrownLaw’s financial
transactions; (8) Supervising all non-lawyer employees of BrownLaw, etc. (Brown
Decl., ¶ 5.) 
Because of Mr. Brown’s “total confidence” in Ms. Pak’s abilities, Mr.
Brown and Ms. Pak entered into an agreement where Ms. Pak’s compensation
mirrored that of Mr. Brown’s. (Id. at ¶ 10; White Decl., Exhibit F.)
Because of the breadth of Ms. Pak’s managing responsibilities, as well as the
“high level of trust and confidence” that Mr. Brown placed in Ms. Pak,
Plaintiffs argue that Ms. Pak, as a matter of law, owed a fiduciary duty to
Plaintiffs for the entirety of her employment in a managerial role at BrownLaw.
(Brown Decl., ¶ 10.) 
            Ms. Pak, on the other hand, argues
that she could not have owed a fiduciary duty to Mr. Brown and BrownLaw during
the operative time of 2015 to 2023, because her employment with BrownLaw ceased
in 2020. (Pak Decl., ¶ 3.) Further, Ms. Pak contends that, as a general matter,
she did not owe a fiduciary duty to Mr. Brown and BrownLaw because Ms. Pak was
a mere employee and “[i]n general, employment-type relationships are not
fiduciary relationships.” (O'Byrne v. Santa Monica-UCLA Med. Ctr. (2001)
94 Cal.App.4th 797, 811.) 
 
2015 to April 2020
Plaintiffs contend that Ms. Pak owed a fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs from
2015 to 2023 because of Ms. Pak’s role as a “long-term office manager of
[BrownLaw], with responsibilities and supervision over all aspects of the
firm’s business, finances, and operations.” (MSA, page 3.)
Plaintiffs first argue that “based on the breadth of her responsibilities
and the importance of her duties, Ms.Pak was effectively acting as BrownLaw’s ‘Chief
Operating Officer’ (or COO) while Mr. Brown was the 100% owner and ‘Chief
Executive Officer’ (or CEO) – even though BrownLaw did not use such formal
titles internally.” (MSA, page 7.) It is well known that an officer of a
corporation owes a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders (Singhania
v. Uttarwar (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 416, 426 [“California law clearly
recognizes that officers and directors owe a fiduciary duty to stockholders and
controlling stockholders owe a fiduciary duty to minority stockholders.”]; Small
v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 179, Tenzer v.
Superscope, Inc. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 18, 31; Jones v. H.F. Ahmanson &
Co. (1969) 1 Cal.3d 93, 109–110; Fisher v. Pennsylvania Life Co.
(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 506, 513.) However, while Plaintiffs contend that Ms. Pak
was “effectively acting” as BrownLaw’s COO, Plaintiffs have not provided any
evidence that Ms. Pak was indeed BrownLaw’s COO, as provided by BrownLaw’s
“articles or bylaws,” or that she was “chosen by the board” of directors. (Cal.
Corp. Code § 312(b).) Thus, while Ms. Pak may have been operating effectively
as BrownLaw’s COO, according to Plaintiffs, Ms. Pak would not be considered an
officer of BrownLaw for purposes of determining whether she owed a fiduciary
duty to Plaintiffs during the operative period. 
Though, while Ms. Pak contends she did owe a fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs
because she was not an officer of BrownLaw, “[u]nder California law, a
fiduciary duty exists where an employee participates in the management of a
corporation and exercises discretionary authority, while an employee who
exercises no management authority is not a fiduciary.” (WeRide Corp. v. Kun
Huang (N.D. Cal. 2019), 379 F.Supp.3d 834, 852.) “Every employee owes his
or her employer duties of undivided care and loyalty.” (Janken v. GM Hughes
Elecs. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 55, 74.) “California law does not authorize an
employee to transfer his loyalty to a competitor. During the term of
employment, an employer is entitled to its employees' ‘undivided loyalty.’” (Fowler
v. Varian Assocs., (1987), 196 Cal.App.3d 34, 41 [finding that a former
marketing manager of employer owed a fiduciary duty toward his former employer,
which was then breached, when the employee attempted to directly compete with
his former employer].)  “During the term
of employment, an employer is entitled to its employees' ‘undivided loyalty.’” (Stokes
v. Dole Nut Co. (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 285, 295 [finding that managerial or
supervisorial-level employees owed a fiduciary duty to their employer, which
was then breached when the employees attempted to directly compete with their
employer].)  
Further, even if the Court were to conclude that relationship between
Plaintiffs and Ms. Pak did not bestow a fiduciary duty onto Ms. Pak as a matter
of law, Plaintiffs has met their burden in establishing that, at least, a
confidential relationship between Plaintiffs and Ms. Pak existed. “Generally,
the existence of a confidential relationship is a question of fact for the jury
or the trial court,” so Plaintiffs “would have the burden of proving the
existence of a confidential relationship.” (Barbara A., supra, 145
Cal.App.3d at p. 383 (citing Rieger v. Rich (1958) 163 Cal.App.2d 651,
664; Wilson v. Sampson (1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 453, 459; Estate of
Llewellyn (1948) 83 Cal.App.2d 534, 562; Wilson v. Zorb (1936) 15
Cal.App.2d 526, 532).) 
“Under prevailing judicial opinion no presumption of a confidential
relationship arises from the bare fact that parties to a contract are employer
and employee; rather, additional ties must be brought out in order to create
the presumption of a confidential relationship between the two.” (Odorizzi
v. Bloomfield School Dist. (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 123, 129.)
Plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence to display that Plaintiffs
placed “trust and confidence” into Ms. Pak and that Ms. Pak “accepted that
trust and confidence” (Barbara A., supra, 45 Cal.App.3d at p. 383.)
Firstly, Mr. Brown entrusted Ms. Pak to the point of approving her as a
signatory to BrownLaw’s Client Trust Account at Bank of America to allow her to
make timely settlement disbursements to BrownLaw clients. (Brown Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5;
White Decl., Exhibit C.) Additionally, Plaintiffs provide that Ms. Pak
authorized six wire transfers totaling $653,500.00 to three different Mass Tort
client referral sources. (Brown Decl., ¶ 6; White Decl., Exhibit D.) This shows
that Ms. Pak was entrusted with a great amount of trust regarding the finances
of BrownLaw, specifically in terms of access to BrownLaw’s funds, and
constitutes “additional ties” to show that a confidential relationship existed.

The burden shifts. 
Ms. Pak fails to satisfy her burden in establishing that there is a
triable issue of fact regarding whether there was a confidential relationship
between her and Plaintiffs. While Ms. Pak claims that was only “nominally the
office manager,” she failed to provide affirmative evidence or material facts
that a confidential relationship did not exist at least from between 2015 to April
2020. To reiterate, the opposing party may not merely rely on “allegations or
denials” to show that a triable issue of material exists. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2).) 
Thus, the Court finds that there is not a
triable issue of fact regarding whether Ms. Pak owed Plaintiffs a fiduciary
duty during the time of 2015 to April 2020, as Ms. Pak failed to meet her
burden. However, the Court further analyzes the period after April 2020 below.     
 
Post-April 2020          
As stated above, Plaintiffs contend that Ms. Pak owed a fiduciary duty to
Plaintiffs from 2015 to 2023. For similar reasons as above, Plaintiffs have met
its burden in establishing that Ms. Pak owed a fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs
from 2015 to 2023 when, according to Plaintiffs, Ms. Pak was terminated. However,
Ms. Pak counters that she could not have owed a duty to Plaintiffs because she
was only the office manager from 2015 to April 2020.
"California law does permit an employee to seek other employment and
even to make some ‘preparations to compete’ before resigning.” (Fowler,
supra, 196 Cal.App.3d at p. 41 (citing Bancroft–Whitney Co. v. Glen
(1966) 64 Cal.2d 327, 346.) Thus, it follows that any fiduciary duty that an
employee may have for their employer would terminate once the employment
relationship ends. 
Here, Ms. Pak has established a triable issue of fact of whether her
employment with BrownLaw terminated. She provides that in 2019, Mr. Brown was
entangled in disciplinary proceedings with the State Bar, which resulted in Mr.
Brown entering a stipulation with the Bar that provided for Mr. Brown’s
suspension from the practice of law for one year. (Pak Decl., ¶ 6, Exhibit A.)
The Supreme Court adopted the State Bar proposal, and Mr. Brown was suspended
from the practice of law as of April 1, 2020. (Pak Decl., ¶ 7, Exhibit B.)
Included in the order was a requirement that Mr. Brown comply with California
Rules of Court, Rule 9.20, specifically to urge his clients to seek legal
advice elsewhere and to provide substitution of another attorney in Mr. Brown’s
pending court cases. (Pak Decl., ¶ 7, Exhibit B.) According to Ms. Pak, the
attorney that Mr. Brown recommended handling Mr. Brown’s cases while he was
suspended from the practice of law was Mr. Norris. (Pak Decl., ¶ 12, Exhibit
F.) 
Further, Ms. Pak provided a compensation agreement between herself and
Mr. Brown. (Pak Decl., ¶ 15 Exhibit G.) The agreement states that it will
terminate “when Brown and Pak are no longer providing services to Firm at a
level substantially the same as they now provide.” (Pak Decl., Exhibit G.)
Further, Ms. Pak declares that to her knowledge, Mr. Brown ceased practicing
law, and their employment relationship was terminated, per their agreement,
when Mr. Brown ceased practicing law. (Pak Decl., ¶ 18.) These facts are
sufficient in establishing a triable issue of fact of whether Ms. Pak’s
employment relationship did in fact terminate pursuant to Ms. Pak and Mr.
Brown’s agreement. (See Wolf v. Superior Ct. (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th
1343, 1359 [“Where, however, a conflict in the evidence exists, it must be
resolved in the trial court, as with any question of fact, before the court can
declare the meaning of the contract as a matter of law.”].) Because there is an
issue of fact regarding when the employment relationship between Ms. Pak and
Mr. Brown ended, there is a triable issue of fact regarding whether Ms. Pak
owed a fiduciary duty to Mr. Brown after April 2020, when he was suspended from
the practice of law. 


 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for summary
adjudication but only as to the period of 2015 to April 2020. The Court DENIES
the motion as to April 2020 to 2023. 
 
It is so
ordered.

considered the moving, opposition papers, and reply papers. The Court DENIES Cross-Defendant’s motion to bifurcate.  Background            On
November 8, 2023, Plaintiffs Baird A. Brown, an individual and as sole owner of
Baird Brown, a Professional Corporation, and Ann Brown (“Brown Plaintiffs”) filed
a Complaint against defendants Donald G. Norris, an individual; Donald G.
Norris, a Law Corporation (“Norris Defendants”); Michelle Pak (“Ms. Pak”), an
individual; and Taurin Robinson (“Robinson”), an individual (collectively,
“Defendants”), and DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, alleging causes of action for
(1) Elder Financial Abuse – CA Welf. & Inst. Code § 15600 et seq; (2) Theft
& Conversion – CA Penal Code § 496(c); (3) Unfair Competition – CA Bus.
& Prof. Code § 17200 et seq; (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; and (5)
Conspiracy.            The
Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows: Ms. Pak, Mr. Brown’s former
office manager and Robinson, Mr. Brown’s former legal assistant conspired with
Norris Defendants to transfer Mr. Brown’s clients and his practice to Norris
Defendants. (Compl., ¶¶12-14.) Furthermore, defendants conspired to divert Mr.
Brown’s legal fees to Norris Defendants, and to substitute Norris Defendants as
counsel of record for many of Mr. Brown’s clients. (Id. at ¶16, 18.)
Additionally, defendants breached ethical responsibilities to timely send two
of Mr. Brown’s clients’ shares of their settlement funds, with Norris
Defendants, instead of Mr. Brown, receiving the attorney fees from the
settlements. (Id. at ¶17, 25.)            On
January 12, 2024, Norris Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs;

October 21, 2024, Cross-Defendants Andrew M. White and Jonathan N. White filed
their second motion to bifurcate.  On November 6, 2024, Defendants/Cross-Complainants
Norris Defendants and Robinson filed an opposition. Also on November 6, 2024,
Ms. Pak filed her opposition.On November 13,
2024, Cross-Defendants filed a reply.   Legal
StandardCode of Civil Procedure section 1048
provides, “The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or
when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a
separate trial . . . of any separate issue or of any number of causes of action
or issues, preserving the right of trial by jury required by the Constitution
or a statute of this state or of the United States.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048,
subd. (b).) The objective behind a bifurcation of
liability from damages is to avoid “the waste of time and money caused by the
unnecessary trial of damage questions in cases where the liability issue is
resolved against the plaintiff." (Trickey v. Superior Court In and For
Sacramento County (1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 650, 653.) Bifurcation of claims or
issues is a matter within the court's discretion. (McLellan v. McLellan
(1972) 23 Cal. App. 3d 343, 353.)  Judicial
Notice             Norris Defendants and Robinson
request that the Court take judicial notice of the Order RE: Motion to
Bifurcate Trial that this Court rendered on August 5, 2024, as well as the
accompanying minute order. Pursuant to Evidence Code Section 452,
subdivision (d), which states that the court may take judicial notice of “[r]ecords
of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States
or of any state of the United States,” Norris Defendants and Robinson’s request
for judicial notice is granted.  Discussion            Cross-Defendants file the instant
motion on two grounds: (1) that the claims in the cross-complaints against
Cross-Defendants are specific to two incidents over a four-day period, and are
separate from the legal and factual issues among Brown Plaintiffs, Norris
Defendants and Ms. Pak, and (2) Cross-Defendants will be greatly prejudiced if
the limited and largely unrelated claims against them are tried simultaneously
with the separate dispute among Brown Plaintiffs, Norris Defendants, and Ms. Pak.            According to the Cross-Defendants,
the gravamen of this action is a dispute about client files that were kept,
maintained, and worked on at the office located at 3055 Wilshire Boulevard
(“subject property”). According to Cross-Defendants, both Norris Defendants’
and Ms. Pak’s cross-complaints arise from Cross-Defendants’ conduct on October
21, 2023 and October 24, 2023, which relate to Cross-Defendants’ investigation
of the client files at the office located at 3055 Wilshire Boulevard in their
sole capacity as counsel for Brown Plaintiffs. (White Decls., ¶ 3.)
Cross-Defendants contends because the claims in both cross-complaints arise
solely from the two incidents that relate only to evidence preservation, the
instant motion to bifurcate should be granted to ensure (1) that there is no
confusion by the trier of fact and (2) the economy
and efficiency of the action.   Section 1008            Norris Defendants and Robinson
contend that Cross-Defendants’ second motion to bifurcate fails on its face
because it does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure, Section 1008.            Code of Civil Procedure Section
1008, subdivision (b) states: “[a] party who originally made an application for
an order which was refused in whole or part, or granted conditionally or on
terms, may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or
different facts, circumstances, or law, in which case it shall be shown by
affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order
or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law
are claimed to be shown.”Here, Cross-Defendants have filed a second motion to bifurcate after this
Court denied its motion on August 5, 2024. However, the Court in its order
denied Cross-Defendants’ first motion to bifurcate without prejudice. (Aug. 5,
2024 Order.) Therefore, the Court retained authority to consider a following
motion to bifurcate brought by Cross-Defendants. Also, Cross-Defendants’ instant motion seeks solely to bifurcate the
trial of the claims against them from the separate dispute among Brown Plaintiffs,
Ms. Pak, and Norris Defendants, while Cross-Defendants’ first motion sought to bifurcate
the trial of the complaint from all cross-complaints. Therefore, the instant
motion would not be a renewal of the previous motion to bifurcate. Thus, the Court can consider the instant motion.  Bifurcation is
Not Appropriate            Here, as explained above, Brown
Plaintiff’s complaint alleges that Defendants conspired to transfer Mr. Brown’s
legal clients and cases to Mr. Norris. (Compl., ¶¶ 14-15.) Norris Defendants
and Ms. Pak then filed cross-complaints arising from Cross-Defendants’ conduct
on October 21, 2023 and October, 24, 2023, which included Cross-Defendants’
alleged unauthorized seizure, possession, and access to Norris Defendants’
confidential client case files. (Norris Cross-Compl ¶¶ 20-24; Pak Cross-Compl.,
¶¶ 32-38.) Ms. Pak further alleged assault and battery against Cross-Defendants
arising from the same alleged misconduct that occurred on October 21, 2023 and
October, 24, 2023 (Pak Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 32-38.)             Firstly, Cross-Defendants contend
that the Court should grant the instant motion to bifurcate as it will promote
judicial economy. Cross-Defendants contend that since all claims against them
arise solely from their conduct on October 21, 2023 and October, 24, 2023,
there will not be overlapping witnesses and information. Cross-Defendants
specifically state that the LAPD officers and security guard for Brown
Plaintiffs who were involved in the October 21, 2023 incident will not be
considered witnesses to the dispute among Brown Plaintiffs, Norris Defendants,
and Ms. Pak. However, according to Defendants, the LAPD officers and the
security guard will be witnesses to Defendants’ defense against Brown
Plaintiffs’ claims, including but not limited to “unclean hands.” Further, the
facts related to Norris Defendants’ and Ms. Pak’s cross-complaints against
Cross-Defendants (specifically the events that occurred on on October 21, 2023
and October, 24, 2023) are necessarily integrated into Brown Plaintiff’s
complaint against Ms. Pak and Norris Defendants. Thus, Cross-Defendants have
not sufficiently presented how the evidence related to their conduct on October
21, 2023 and October, 24, 2023 are unrelated to the dispute among Brown
Plaintiffs, Norris Defendants and Ms. Pak to the point where bifurcation would
be necessary.            Secondly, Cross-Defendants argue
that without bifurcating the claims against them, they will suffer extreme
prejudice as well as create significant confusion for the jury.
Cross-Defendants contend that in the absence of bifurcation, they will be
placed in the position as having to both prosecute Brown Plaintiff’s complaint
against Defendants, and defending the claims against them in Norris Defendants’
and Ms. Pak’s cross-complaints. However, the Court finds that the risk of
prejudice to Cross-Defendants would be mitigated by proper jury instructions. The
possibility of prejudice is not sufficiently probable to justify the inherent
inefficiency of consolidation.At this time, the Court finds that bifurcation is not necessary in this
action and would instead unnecessarily complicate the trial that will go
forward in this action. As such, the motion to bifurcate is denied. Cross-Defendants’ motion to bifurcate is DENIED.                It is so
ordered. Dated:
