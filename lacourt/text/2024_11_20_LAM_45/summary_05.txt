Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend the Complaint filed by Plaintiff IH Helen Chang, aka Bess Chang, against Defendants AEGIS Asset Backed Security, LLC, et al. The demurrer was raised on the grounds that there is already another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action, that the Complaint improperly names Jason Moore as a party, and that the causes of action fail to allege sufficient facts.

The Court finds that the Complaint does not state a cause of action for breach of contract, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty. The Plaintiff failed to file an opposition to the demurrer, and the Court is unaware of the Plaintiff's ability to amend the cause of action.

The Court grants judicial notice of certain documents, including notes, deeds, and court filings. The Court also sustains the demurrer without leave to amend on the grounds that the Complaint fails to plead specific facts and does not satisfy the heightened pleading standard for corporate defendants.

The Court's ruling is based on the following legal standards: California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง430.41, California Evidence Code sections 451 and 452, Business & Professions Code ยง 17200, and various court decisions.
