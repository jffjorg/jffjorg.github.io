Petition for Approval of Minor’s
Compromise
The Court considered the Petition.
            The Court GRANTS the Petition
for Approval of Minor’s Compromise filed by Petitioner Elida Gonzalez on behalf
of minor Claimant Eliseo Romero-Gonzalez.
 
Background
            On July 24, 2023, Plaintiffs Elida
Gonzalez, John Ever Gonzalez, Marco Antonio Gonzalez Gomez, Kimberly Yanira
Romero Gonzalez, Luz Esmeralda Romero, a minor, and Eliseo Romero-Gonzalez, a
minor, filed the instant action against Bronson Management LLC and Does 1
through 50 for (1) breach of warranty of habitability, (2) breach of covenant
of quiet enjoyment, (3) negligence, and (4) breach of contract.  The Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs have
been tenants of the residential property located at 212 South Union Ave, Unit
303, Los Angeles, CA 90026 (“Property”) from July 2020 to the present.  During the relevant times, Defendants were
responsible for management and maintenance of the Property.  According to Plaintiffs, Defendants failed to
provide habitable conditions due to their failure to repair conditions on the
Property and comply with numerous state and local law provisions.
            On August 4, 2023, Plaintiff Elida
Gonzalez was appointed as guardian ad litem of minors Luz Esmeralda Romero and
Eliseo Romero-Gonzalez.
            On October 6, 2023, Defendant
Bronson Management LLC filed an Answer to the Complaint.
            On October 22, 2024, Petitioner
Elida Gonzalez (“Petitioner”) filed a Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise on
behalf of minor Claimant Eliseo Romero-Gonzalez.  No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
Court
approval is required for all settlements
of a minor’s claim.  (Prob. Code §§ 3500,
3600, et seq.; CCP § 372.)  “‘[W]ithout trial court approval of the
proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement cannot be valid.  [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding
[on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’”  (Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)  A minor, like Claimant, “shall appear either
by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed
by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge
thereof, in each case.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 372, subd. (a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner may file a
declaration demonstrating that he or she has a right to compromise the minor’s
claim under California Probate Code section 3500. 
Regarding
the substance of the Petition, to obtain court approval of the settlement of a
minor’s claims, the petitioner must file a complete
and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’
[Citations.]”  (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249,
256; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  (Italics
added.)
Under Probate Code § 3505, if a petition
is unopposed, the Court must issue a decision on the petition at the conclusion
of the hearing.
