And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena served on HireRight LLC. The plaintiffs, Jacqueline Duclos, Sumoya Michael, and Jane Doe, allege they were assaulted and robbed at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2020 and are seeking discovery from HireRight LLC. The subpoena was served on December 27, 2023, but HireRight LLC did not appear for deposition on January 24, 2024. The judge has denied the motion to compel compliance with the subpoena without prejudice, citing improper service of the motion on HireRight LLC. The judge also notes that a deposition subpoena must be personally served on the non-party deponent unless the non-party deponent agrees to accept service by mail or electronic service.
