And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the Judge denies the Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment filed by the Defendant, City of Los Angeles, without prejudice. The motion was filed on January 5, 2024, seeking to set aside the default and default judgment entered against the City on October 5, 2023. The Judge notes that there appears to be a sufficient substantive basis to grant Defendant relief under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), as Defendant's counsel has shown that the failure to respond to the complaint was due to a mistake and that Defendant acted promptly in making the motion. However, the Judge finds a procedural defect with Defendant's motion, as Plaintiffs are representing themselves in pro per and are not subject to mandatory electronic service requirements. Therefore, the Court must deny the motion without prejudice.
