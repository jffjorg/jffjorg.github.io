And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Hyundai Motor America, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment against Michelle LaMarche, cross-complainant. The case arises from a motor vehicle accident on August 29, 2019, on the 60 Freeway. Hyundai contends that there is no merit to the causes of action for indemnity and contribution set forth in Defendant's Cross-Complaint against Hyundai. The judge found that Hyundai met its initial burden on summary judgment by presenting facts that show that Plaintiff cannot establish one or more elements of her causes of action for indemnity and contribution against Hyundai. The judge also found that Defendant failed to respond to some discovery requests and provided unverified responses to other requests, which further supports Hyundai's motion. As a result, the judge granted Hyundai's motion for summary judgment.
