 Case Number:  22STCV00771    Hearing Date:   February 29, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Quash filed by Specially  Appearing Defendants Angel  Plumbing Co. and Pedro Alberto Galeas. Order to Show Cause re Dismissal for Failure to File  Proof of Service   TENTATIVE The motion to quash is continued. The order to show cause is continued. BACKGROUND   On January 7, 2022,  Plaintiff Girolamo Rindone (“Plaintiff”) filed his complaint against Angel  Plumbing Co., Pedro Albert Galeas (“Galeas”), and Does 1 through 100, asserting  causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out  of an alleged automobile accident on January 8, 2020.   On October  17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service stating that Defendant Galeas was  served by substitute service on his wife at his home on October 13, 2023,  followed by mail service on October 17.   On November 17,  2023, counsel purporting to represent Defendant Galeas (specially appearing) filed  this motion to quash service.  As set  forth in the evidence supporting the motion, Defendant Galeas died on February  28, 2021.  (Feldman Decl., ¶ 7 & Exh.  C.)   No opposition has  been filed.   LEGAL STANDARD    C.C.P. §415.10 provides the requirements of  personal service of summons and the complaint as follows: “A summons may be  served by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to  the person to be served. Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete  at the time of such delivery.  The date  upon which personal delivery is made shall be entered on or affixed to the face  of the copy of the summons at the time of its delivery. However, service of a  summons without such date shall be valid and effective.” “When a defendant challenges the court’s  personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden  is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter  alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.’”  (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140  Cal.App.4th 403, 413.) Although the filing of a proof of service by a  registered process server creates a rebuttable presumption that service was  proper (see Evid. Code § 647), that presumption may be impeached by contrary  evidence submitted by a defendant. (See, e.g., Fernandes v. Singh (2017)  16 Cal.App.5th 932, 941 n.6.)   C.C.P. §418.10(a)(1) provides that, “A  defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any  further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a  notice of motion… To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of  jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  If service of summons is not properly and  validly effectuated by one or more of the approved methods, California courts  lack personal jurisdiction over the defendants, and any judicial actions taken  without such service violates principles of fundamental due process and is  therefore void. (Cnty. of San Diego v. Gorham (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th  1215, 1231.)   DISCUSSION    Defendant Galeas died on February 28, 2021.  (Feldman Decl., ¶ 7 & Exh. C.)   This raises a question that is not addressed  in the moving papers: under what authority does counsel bring this motion.  Defendant Galeas did not authorize the filing  of the motion (he has been dead for three years).  Counsel does not indicate in the motion that  he was authorized to file the motion by an administrator or personal representative  of Defendant Galeas’s estate or any other person or entity with legal authority  to act on behalf of the decedent or his estate.   Counsel states that “this matter was assigned to counsel to represent …  Galeas” but counsel does not state who had the authority to make, and who made,  such assignment.  (Id., ¶ 4.)   The Court will continue the matter so that  counsel purporting to represent Defendant Galeas may file a supplemental brief  on this issue.   The Court also notes that, in light of the  death of Defendant Galeas, Plaintiff must consider whether to proceed with this  action – and if so, how.  For example,  under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.41, a plaintiff may (in some  circumstances) proceed against a decedent’s personal representative or  successor in interest.  Alternatively,  under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.50 and Probate Code sections 550-554,  if the decedent was covered by insurance, a plaintiff may (in some  circumstances) proceed against the decedent’s “estate,” without joining a  personal representative or successor in interest, and serve the summons on the insurer.  There may well be other options as well.   CONCLUSION   The Court CONTINUES the motion to quash for  approximately 30 days. The Court CONTINUES the OSC for approximately  30 days.On the Court's own motion, the Hearing on Motion to Quash Service of Summons scheduled for 
02/29/2024, and Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to File Proof of Service
