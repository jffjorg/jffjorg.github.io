And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the physical examination of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is seeking recovery for physical injuries resulting from a vehicle accident on March 17, 2020. The defendant has served three demands for a physical examination, and the plaintiff has failed to comply with each demand. The court finds that the defendant has satisfied all substantive and procedural requirements for an order for a physical examination and that the plaintiff has not opposed the motion. As a result, the court grants the motion to compel and orders the plaintiff to appear for a physical examination with Dr. George Macer on March 12, 2024. The court also denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions.
