And here is the English summary:

The Judge, in a tentative ruling, grants the motion to consolidate the Bludso Action (Case No. 22STCV32013) and the County Action (Case No. 23STCV08177) for all purposes. The two cases arise from the same automobile accident on April 20, 2021, and involve the same defendants, Trust Y Inc. and Seungsan Baek. The Judge finds that there is good cause for consolidation, as both cases have common legal and factual issues, and the witnesses and evidence will overlap to a significant degree. The motion was filed on January 23, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The Judge notes that the procedural requirements for a motion to consolidate have been satisfied, and the case will be consolidated for all purposes.
