 Case Number:  21STCV37735    Hearing Date:   February 29, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Martin R. Berman.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
October 12, 2021, Plaintiff Jacob Jacobson, a
minor, by and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Phallon Fleck, filed his complaint
against Los Angeles Unified School District and Does 1 to 25 for  General Negligence and Premises Liability causes
of action arising from a tripping incident occurring on October 24, 2019.
On January 17, 2024, Martin R. Berman (“Counsel”) filed a motion to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff Jacob Jacobson, a minor, by and through his Guardian Ad
Litem, Phallon Fleck (“Plaintiff”). No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed the Notice and Declaration to be Relieved as Counsel. On the Declaration,
Counsel states there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Counsel
has confirmed Plaintiff’s last known address by sending documents to Plaintiff’s
Guardian Ad Litem’s email address. 
Counsel has not,
however, filed the proposed order, as required by Rule 3.1362.
In addition,
counsel fails to include OSC re Dismissal hearing date (October 8, 2024) in
item 5 of the Declaration. 
Finally, the
Court notes that the guardian ad litem for the minor plaintiff may not appear
or litigate this case in pro per. 
Accordingly, before granting a motion to be relieved, the Court would like
to obtain further information regarding whether, and if so how, the guardian ad
litem plans to proceed with the case.
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving counsel
is ordered to give notice.
