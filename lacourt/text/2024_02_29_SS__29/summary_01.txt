And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the Plaintiff, Bethany Estrada, and also grants the Defendant's request for sanctions in part. The motion to compel was filed after the Plaintiff failed to appear for her properly noticed deposition without service of a timely objection. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's failure to appear was unreasonable and orders the Plaintiff to attend her deposition on a date to be arranged by counsel that is no later than 21 days after notice. The Court also imposes a monetary sanction of $420 on the Plaintiff and her counsel, Ellis & Bakh, for their failure to comply with the discovery process.
