The tentative ruling by the judge denies the motion to consolidate two cases, Case No. 22STCV23900 (Rios Action) and Case No. 23CMCV00836 (Vega Campos Action), without prejudice. The cases arise out of the same automobile accident and involve the same or overlapping parties.

Therefore, the court must deny the motion to consolidate due to a procedural defect.
