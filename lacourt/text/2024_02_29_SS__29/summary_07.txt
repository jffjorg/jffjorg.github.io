And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling continues the motion to quash service of summons and the order to show cause for approximately 30 days. The court is concerned about the authority of the counsel purporting to represent Defendant Galeas, who died on February 28, 2021, and has not authorized the filing of the motion. The court orders the counsel to file a supplemental brief on this issue. The court also notes that the plaintiff may need to consider whether to proceed with the action, and if so, how, given the death of Defendant Galeas. The court continues the hearing on the motion to quash and the order to show cause to April 4, 2024, at 1:30 PM in Department 29 at the Spring Street Courthouse.
