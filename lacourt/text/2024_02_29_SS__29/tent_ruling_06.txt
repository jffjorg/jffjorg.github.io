 Case Number:  21STCV44157    Hearing Date:   February 29, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Compel the Independent Medical Examination of
Plaintiff filed by Defendant Ereka Mamasig. 
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On
December 2, 2021, Plaintiff Michelle Clyoine Sampson (“Plaintiff”) filed her
complaint asserting claims for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence against
Ereka Mamasig (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 60, arising out of a vehicle accident
on March 17, 2020.  Defendant filed an
answer on October 11, 2022.
On March
16, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with a demand for a physical examination
scheduled for April 18.  (Mosier Decl., ¶
4 & Exh. C.)  On March 29, Plaintiff
served a timely response demanding certain conditions for the examination.  (Id., ¶ 5 & Exh. D.)  Plaintiff did not show the examination on
April 18, 2023. (Id., ¶ 6.) On April 28, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff
with a second demand for a physical examination, this time scheduled for June
6.  (Id., ¶ 7 & Exh. E.) Plaintiff
again served a response demanding certain conditions.  (Id., ¶ 8 & Exh. F.)  Plaintiff appeared for the examination as
demanded, but the examiner “turned [Plaintiff] away” because she had not paid “the
late fees for her prior cancellation.”  (Id.,
¶ 9.)  
On August
30, 2023, Defendant Plaintiff with a third demand for a physical examination,
this time scheduled for October 10, 2023. (Id., ¶ 10 & Exh. G.)  On October 3, Plaintiff served an objection to
the date selected by Defendant for the examination; Plaintiff also stated in
the objection that she would “likely appear” for an examination “at a mutually
agreed place, date and time, but not on the date and time designated in the
current notice.”  (Id.¸¶ 12 &
Exh. H.)  Plaintiff did not appear for
the examination on October 10.  (Id.,
¶ 13.)
On
November 3, 2023, the Court granted the motion of Plaintiff’s counsel to be
relieved as counsel.  Plaintiff is now
representing herself in pro per.
On January
26, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel the physical examination of
Plaintiff.  Plaintiff was served with the
motion by UPS (sent on January 26) and was also personally served with the
motion on January 28.
No opposition
has been filed. 
Legal Standard
The Civil Discovery
Act authorizes discovery in the form of a physical or mental examination of a
party whose physical or mental condition is in controversy in the action. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2032.020, subd. (a).)  Code
of Civil Procedure section 2032.220 provides, in pertinent part:
(a)  In any case in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal
injuries, any defendant may demand one physical examination of the plaintiff,
if both of the following conditions are satisfied:
 
(1)  The examination does not include any diagnostic test or procedure that is
painful, protracted, or intrusive.
 
(2)  The examination is conducted at a location within 75 miles of the
residence of the examinee.
 
(b)  A defendant may make a demand under this article without leave of court
….
 
(c)  
A demand under
subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and
nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any,
of the physician who will perform the examination.
 
(d)  A physical examination demanded under subdivision (a) shall be scheduled
for a date that is at least 30 days after service of the demand ….
Within 20 days of service of a demand for a physical
examination, the plaintiff to whom the demand is directed must respond in
writing and state that the plaintiff “will comply with the demand as stated,
will comply with the demand as specifically modified by the plaintiff, or will
refuse, for reasons specified in the response, to submit to the demanded
physical examination.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2032.230, subd. (a).)  Failure to serve
a timely response waives any objection to the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240, subd. (a).)
If a plaintiff fails to comply, the defendant may
move for an order compelling plaintiff to appear at and submit to a physical
examination. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240, subd. (b), and § 2032.250, subd.
(a).)  The motion “shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2032.250, subd. (a).)
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel compliance
with a demand for a physical examination, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.250, subd. (b).)
Discussion
Defendant
has satisfied all of the substantive and procedural requirements for an order for
a physical examination of Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff seeks recovery for physical injuries.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 38.)  Defendant served a proper demand for a
physical examination, and Plaintiff failed to comply. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2032.240, subd. (b), and § 2032.250, subd. (a).)  Defendant submitted an adequate meet and confer
declaration.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.250,
subd. (a).)
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion to compel is GRANTED.
The
Court DENIES Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.  The applicable section of the Civil Discovery
Act, section 2032.250, subdivision (b), provides for sanctions against a party
who unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel compliance with a demand for a
physical examination, but here Plaintiff has not opposed the motion.  
Defendant
cites Code of Civil Procedure Sections 2023.010 and 2023.240 in support of the
sanctions request, but, as Justice Moor recently explained, these sections do not
independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse
of discovery … without regard to any other provision of the Discovery
Act.”  (City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.) Moreover,
trial courts do not have inherent authority to award attorney’s fees as a
monetary sanction for alleged discovery abuse. 
(Id. at pp. 510-511.)  (The
Court is aware that the California Supreme Court has granted review of the City
of Los Angeles case.  The order
granting review, filed on January 25, 2023, states that pending review, the
appellate opinion “may be cited,” including “for its persuasive value.”  The Court finds the reasoning of Justice Moor
to be persuasive.)
Conclusion
The Court
GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel the physical examination of Plaintiff. 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff to appear for a physical examination with Dr. George
Macer, on March 12, 2024, at 1:00 p.m., at 3633 Long Beach Boulevard, Long
Beach, California 90807.
The
Court DENIES Defendant’s request for sanctions.
Moving
Party is ORDERED to give notice.
