And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling continues the hearing on the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories. The motion is set for hearing on February 29, 2024. However, the court must resolve two threshold issues before considering the merits of the discovery motion. First, the court needs an order substituting the Plaintiff's successor-in-interest as the plaintiff, as the original Plaintiff, Jarrett Townsend, died on September 21, 2023. The court requires a motion for substitution, supported by a declaration with all necessary information, and an application for appointment of a guardian ad litem if the successor-in-interest is a minor. Second, the court notes that Defendants' counsel did not receive proper notice of the advanced date for the Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) and recommends that the successor-in-interest schedule a new IDC prior to the continued hearing date. The court continues the hearing on the motion to compel to May 30, 2024, and orders the Plaintiff's counsel to file an appropriate motion for substitution and schedule a new IDC.
