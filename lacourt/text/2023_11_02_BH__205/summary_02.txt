The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants, granting their motion for summary judgment. The case is a breach of contract action brought by plaintiff David Godley against defendants Jonathan Bodnar and Apollo Eleven, Inc. The defendants argue that plaintiff cannot prove a breach of contract because there is no contract between plaintiff and either defendant. The judge agrees, finding that plaintiff failed to attach any contract to his complaint and that defendant Bodnar attests that there is no contract between Godley and either defendant. Additionally, plaintiff is deemed to have admitted that there is no contract between Godley and either defendant by failing to respond to defendants' requests for admissions. The judge concludes that because plaintiff cannot show there is a contract, there can be no breach of contract claim.
