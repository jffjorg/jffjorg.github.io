And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Negative Asset L.P. to the complaint filed by Plaintiff 7th Street Associates Inc. The demurrer argues that the complaint is barred by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 because there is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action. The judge agrees with the demurrer and sustains it without leave to amend. The judge also grants the request for judicial notice of the earlier filed action, Negative Asset Case, and stays the current action pending resolution of the earlier filed action. The judge sets a case management conference for February 29, 2024, to determine the status of the earlier filed action.
