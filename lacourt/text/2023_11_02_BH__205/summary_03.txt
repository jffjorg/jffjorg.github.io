And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to vacate the entry of default in a trade secrets case. The Plaintiff, Network Experts, claims that the Defendant, Mostafa Karbalei Ahmad Baboli, and his entity defendants, Beverly Hills IT Services and Beverly Hills IT, misappropriated trade secrets and poached clients. The Plaintiff served the defendants by substitute service, but they failed to respond to the complaint. The Court has determined that the substitute service was improper and that the default should be vacated as to Baboli, but denied the motion to vacate as to the entity defendants. The Court has also denied the motion to vacate the entry of default as to the entity defendants, as they failed to demonstrate excusable neglect or mistake in failing to respond to the complaint.
