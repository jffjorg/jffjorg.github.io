And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to grant Skanska's motion to stay the action pending arbitration. The action is related to a construction contract between Skanska and Stice, and Stice is seeking payment for the work performed. Skanska argues that the subcontract provision requires Stice to stay the action pending the resolution of the dispute between Skanska and CHA, the owner of the project. Stice argues that the provision is unenforceable and that it has a right to pursue its claim independently. The Judge finds that the provision is a pass-through provision, not a pay-when-paid provision, and grants Skanska's motion to stay the action pending arbitration. The arbitration is scheduled to commence on September 29, 2025.
