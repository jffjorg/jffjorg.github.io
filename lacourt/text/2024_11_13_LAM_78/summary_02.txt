The Honorable Judge Michelle C. Kim has issued a tentative ruling in the case of SCOTTSDALE PROPERTIES, LLC vs. VINCENT MEHDIZADEH, et al. (Case No. 23STCV29610). The case involves a demurrer filed by defendants Pineapple Ventures, Inc., Neu-Ventures, Inc., Pineapple Consolidated, Inc., Total Accountability Ventures, Inc., Supreme Compliance, Inc., and Maximum Yield, Inc. (collectively, "Pineapple Defendants"). The demurrer was originally set to be heard on June 10, 2024, but was continued to August 15, 2024.

The Judge notes that no proof of service of the demurrer has been filed by Pineapple Defendants, and that they have failed to respond to Plaintiff's counsel's email regarding lack of service. As a result, the Judge is overruling the demurrer and granting Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint. The Judge also orders Pineapple Defendants to file an answer to the amended complaint within 10 days of its service.

The parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading the tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court by the hearing date.
