And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for trial preference filed by plaintiff Anthony J. Sparano, who is 80 years old and experiencing age-related medical issues. The plaintiff has a substantial interest in the action and his health is such that trial preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing his interest in the litigation. The judge has deferred setting a trial date until after arbitration has concluded, which is currently set for May 9, 2025. The judge has also ordered a status conference for May 9, 2025 to set a trial date.
