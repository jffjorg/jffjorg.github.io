  Case No.:  23STCV11085
  Hearing Date:  January 17, 2025
 
     [Tentative] order RE:
DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES
  UNDER CCP SECTION 425.16(C) 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff Paula M.
Heil filed this action for malicious prosecution and slander of title against
Defendants Andrei V. Serpik and Michael D. Anderson. The complaint alleged
malicious prosecution and slander of title. 

            On September 30, 2024, this Court
granted Defendant Serpik’s Special Motion To Strike (Anti-SLAPP) pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure, Section 425.16 (the “Anti-SLAPP Motion”).
            On November 25, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant motion for attorney fees. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A special motion to strike under CCP
section 425.16 — the anti-SLAPP statute — allows a defendant to seek early
dismissal of a lawsuit that qualifies as a SLAPP, that is, a strategic lawsuit
against public participation.  (Nygard, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 1027, 1035.)  With exceptions
not applicable here, a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall
be entitled to recover his or her attorney’s fees and costs.  (CCP § 425.16(c).)  
Under the anti-SLAPP statute, a defendant
may recover attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with the special
motion to strike, not the entire suit.  (Lafayette Morehouse, Inc. v. Chronicle
Publishing Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1383.)  Further, the award of attorney fees and costs
must be reasonable.  (Robertson v. Rodriguez (1995) 36
Cal.App.4th 347, 362.)  In determining
the amount of the award, courts follow the lodestar method by multiplying the
number of hours reasonably expended by the reasonable hourly rate prevailing in
the community for similar work.  (569 East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry
Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 432.)  As such, Defendants are thus entitled to  reasonable fees.  
DISCUSSION
            Defendants move pursuant to CCP
section 425.16(c) for attorney fees in the amount of $41,525.00 and costs of $638.05.  
A.    Entitlement to Fees and Costs
With exceptions not applicable here, “a
prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover
his or her attorney’s fees and costs.” 
(CCP § 425.16(c).)  Because
Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion was successful, they are entitled to attorney
fees and costs under CCP section 425.16(c).
B.
Reasonableness of Fees 
1.
Reasonableness of Hourly Rates
The hourly rates claimed by Defendant’s attorneys
are as follows: (1) Ilia Serpik $550.00 per hour.    
“In determining hourly rates, the court
must look to the ‘prevailing market rates in the relevant community.’”  (Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 100.)  In making this determination, “[t]he court
may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market.”  (Ibid.) 

The Court finds that $450.00 per hour is
the reasonable hourly rate in this case. 
2.
Reasonableness of Number of Hours Billed
The total number of billable hours claimed
by Defendant’s attorneys are as follows: 
(1) Ilia Serpik 75.5 hours.
Plaintiff claims that the number of hours
billed is unreasonable.  
The Court finds that the reasonable hours
spent by Defendants’ attorneys in this matter are  60 hours. 
In making this determination, the court found that some of the billing
was excessive, especially for attorneys as experienced as Defendant’s’ counsel.

C. Costs.
Defendant request costs in the amount of $638.05.  
Plaintiff does not dispute these costs.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing reasons,
Defendant’s motion for attorney fees and costs is GRANTED.  The Court awards $27,000.00 in attorney fees
and $638.05 in costs.
