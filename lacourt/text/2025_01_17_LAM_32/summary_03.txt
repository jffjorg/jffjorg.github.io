And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions to seal records filed by both parties in a lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed by plaintiff Heather Toomes against defendant UHC of California for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The complaint alleges that defendant wrongfully refused to authorize a needed surgery for plaintiff based on surgery guidelines that were biased and financially-driven.

The judge has granted defendant's motion to seal certain records because defendant has an overriding interest in confidentiality, which would be prejudiced without sealing. The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored because it is limited to specific exhibits containing confidential information.

The judge has also granted plaintiff's motion to seal certain records because plaintiff has an overriding interest in protecting her personal privacy and medical records, which would be prejudiced without sealing. The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored because it is limited to plaintiff's medical records and specific exhibits containing references to plaintiff's personal identifying information and medical condition.
