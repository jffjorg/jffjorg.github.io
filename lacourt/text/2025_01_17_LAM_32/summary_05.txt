And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the defendant's responses to the plaintiff's form interrogatories and has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses. The defendant has provided responses that address the four categories under 17.1, including the number of the request, the facts upon which the defendant based its response, the names and addresses of the persons who have knowledge of those facts, and the documents and other tangible things that support the defendant's response. The court finds that the defendant's responses are code compliant and that the defendant's verification is valid. The court also finds that the plaintiff's belief that there should be more or different facts or documents does not warrant a further response. The court concludes that the plaintiff's motion to compel is denied and that both sides acted with substantial justification, so sanctions are denied.
