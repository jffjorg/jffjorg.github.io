HEATHER TOOMES,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
UHC OF CALIFORNIA, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV18404
  Hearing Date:  January 17, 2025
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion to seal records (CRS#
  1844) 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 3, 2023, Plaintiff Heather
Toomes filed this action against Defendant UHC of California, asserting causes
of action for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing. The complaint alleges that Defendant wrongfully refused
to authorize a needed surgery for Plaintiff based on surgery guidelines that
were biased and financially-driven. 
            On October 31, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant motion to seal certain records filed in association with its motion
for summary judgment. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.
LEGAL STANDARD
“Unless confidentiality is required by
law, court records are presumed to be open.” (Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule
2.550(c).) “The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if it
expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that
the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The
proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist
to achieve the overriding interest.” (Id., Rule 2.550(d).) “A record
must not be filed under seal without a court order.” (Id., Rule
2.551(a).)  
DISCUSSION
            “[P]rotection of trade secrets,
protection of information within the attorney-client privilege, and enforcement
of binding contractual obligations not to disclose” have been considered
“overriding interests.” (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1222, fn. 46.) 
            Defendant’s associate general
counsel avers that the documents at issue “include highly sensitive commercial
information that reveal, among other things, a confidential contract with a
third party, United’s confidential and proprietary business records, and
documents reflecting internal strategy.” (Johnson Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant “maintains
its competitive position in negotiations with employers and other plan sponsors
by keeping the negotiated terms of their plans confidential.” (Id., ¶
5.) “Documents that contain detailed internal communications, strategies, and
bases for decisions about coverage can be leveraged by competitors and abused
by members.” (Id., ¶ 8.) 
            These facts demonstrate that
Defendant has an overriding interest in confidentiality which would be
prejudiced without sealing. The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored because
the request is limited to the specific exhibits containing confidential information.
The Court sees no less restrictive means to protect Defendant’s privacy
interest. Thus, sealing is warranted. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to seal is
GRANTED.

“Unless confidentiality is required by

expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest

DISCUSSION 
            Individuals “unquestionably have a
legitimate expectation of privacy in their addresses and telephone numbers.” (Puerto
v. Superior Court (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1252.) “Courts have
frequently recognized that individuals have a substantial interest in the
privacy of their home.” (Ibid.) “It is well established that the
right to privacy extends to medical records . . . which may contain matters of
great sensitivity going to the core of the concerns for the privacy of
information about an individual.” (Grafilo v. Soorani (2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 497, 507, internal citations omitted.) 
            Plaintiff moves to seal certain
exhibits and evidence filed in support of Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment because they reveal her personal information or details about her
medical condition. This demonstrates an overriding interest which would be
prejudiced without sealing. (See Oiye v. Fox (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th
1036, 1070 [medical records are “presumptively private,” and it is “obvious”
that a litigant “would be personally embarrassed to have her medical records
copied into court records”].)  
            The proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored because it is limited to Plaintiff’s medical records and the specific
exhibits containing references to Plaintiff’s personal identifying information
and medical condition. The Court sees no less restrictive means to protect Plaintiff’s
privacy interest. Thus, sealing is warranted. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to seal is
GRANTED.
