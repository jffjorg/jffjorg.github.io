BACKGROUND
 
On August 11,
2020, Plaintiff Gabriela Martinez filed this employment lawsuit against
Defendants Tax Leaders of America, LLC (“Tax Leaders”) and Mario Sanchez
(“Sanchez”) alleging causes of action for:
C/A 1: Sexual
Harassment 
C/A 2: Wrongful
Termination 
C/A 3: Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
C/A 4:
Failure to Prevent Harassment
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. Plaintiff
began working for Tax Leaders on or about December 5, 2018 as a receptionist.
About four months after Plaintiff began her employment with Tax Leaders, Sanchez,
a principal of Tax Leaders and Plaintiff’s direct supervisor, began asking
Plaintiff to go out with him and making other sexual advances towards her.
Plaintiff opposed these sexual advances but Sanchez continued to increase his
sexual advances. On or about January 31, 2020 Plaintiff was constructively
terminated due to Sanchez’s alleged sexual harassment. 
 
On March 3,
2023, the Court entered Judgment for Plaintiff and against Defendants in the
sum of $40,000 plus costs and attorney’s fees in the sum of $2,460.00.
 
On March 8,
2024, Plaintiff (now Judgment Creditor) filed the instant Application and Order
for Appearance and Examination — Enforcement of Judgment against Defendants (now
Judgment Debtors). 
 
No opposition or other response
has been filed.
 
On May 9, 2024, the Court held a
hearing on Plaintiff’s instant application as to Defendant Mario Sanchez.
Defendant Sanchez failed to appear. A bench warrant was ordered and held until
June 10, 2024. Bail was set in the amount of $5,000. The hearing on Plaintiff’s
instant application as to Mario Sanchez was continued to June 10, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard 
 
“The judgment
creditor may apply to the proper court for an order requiring the judgment
debtor to appear before the court, or before a referee appointed by the court,
at a time and place specified in the order, to furnish information to aid in
enforcement of the money judgment.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd. (a).) 
 
“If the
judgment creditor has not caused the judgment debtor to be examined under this
section during the preceding 120 days, the court shall make the order upon ex
parte application of the judgment creditor.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd.
(b).) 
 
“If the
judgment creditor has caused the judgment debtor to be examined under this
section during the preceding 120 days, the court shall make the order if the
judgment creditor by affidavit or otherwise shows good cause for the order. The
application shall be made on noticed motion if the court so directs or a court
rule so requires. Otherwise, it may be made ex parte.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
708.110, subd. (c).) 
 
“The judgment
creditor shall personally serve a copy of the order on the judgment debtor not
less than 10 days before the date set for the examination. Service shall be
made in the manner specified in Section 415.10. Service of the order creates a
lien on the personal property of the judgment debtor for a period of one year
from the date of the order unless extended or sooner terminated by the court.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd. (d).) 
 
“The order
shall contain the following statement in 14-point boldface type if printed or
in capital letters if typed: ‘NOTICE TO JUDGMENT DEBTOR. If you fail to appear
at the time and place specified in this order, you may be subject to arrest and
punishment for contempt of court and the court may make an order requiring you
to pay the reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the judgment creditor in this
proceeding.’” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd. (e).)
 
B.     Discussion
 
Judgment Creditor applies for an
order for Judgment Debtor to appear for examination. (Application, Items 1.a.,
4, 5.a.) The Application form used is Judicial Council Form AT-138/EJ-125, and
it includes the statutorily-required notice. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 708.110, subd. (e).) Judgment Creditor has a judgment against Judgment
Debtor, and Judgment Creditor has not applied to have Judgment Debtor appear
within the last 120 days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
The Court GRANTS Judgment Creditor’s
Application and Order for Appearance and Examination — Enforcement of Judgment
against Judgment Debtor.  
 
Judgment Creditor shall file proof
of service no less than 72 hours in advance of the next hearing.  ¿ 
 
 
C.    
Conclusion

 
Judgment Creditor’s
Application and Order for Appearance and Examination — Enforcement of Judgment
against Judgment Debtor is GRANTED.  
 
Judgment Creditor shall
file proof of service no less than 72 hours in advance of the next hearing.
