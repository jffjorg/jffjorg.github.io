 Hearing Date:  August 19, 2024
 Calendar Number:  4



 
 
 
Plaintiff Credit Corp Solutions, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) seeks
default judgment against Defendant Angie Grigorian (“Defendant”).
 
Plaintiff requests:
 
(1) money judgment
in the amount of $184,590.03, consisting of:
            
            (A) $184,066.03 in damages; and
 
            (B) $524.00 in costs.
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is GRANTED.
 
Background
 
This is a debt collection action. 
 
Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) issued a credit account to
Defendant. Defendant made use of the credit account and defaulted in making
required payments. The date of the last payment was May 25, 2021. Citibank,
N.A. transferred its interest in the credit account to Plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on January 5, 2024, raising
claims for (1) account stated; and (2) open book account.
 
Default was entered against Defendant on July 16, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7);
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (Molen
v. Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief.
             
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
The Proof of Service filed on January 22, 2024 indicates
that Defendant was served on January 15, 2024 at 821 Palm Place, Montebello,
California 90640, via substitute service on John Doe, a co-resident.
 
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
On July 16, 2024, Plaintiff requested the dismissal of the
Doe defendants. The Court hereby grants Plaintiff’s request.
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Nathalia A. Aguirre aver to the non-military status of Defendant.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in the
Declaration of Aliyah Huerta in support of default judgment. Plaintiff
adequately pleads its causes of action.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
Huerta avers that the balance on Defendant’s account at
charge-off was $184,066.03. (Huerta Decl. ¶ 11.) This was, of course, the
amount requested in the complaint based on Citibank records that were also
attached to the complaint.
 
There is an arguable hearsay problem, however – Huerta
relies on business records of Citibank which were later acquired by Plaintiff
in order to establish this fact. (Huerta Decl. ¶¶ 3-6.) Huerta provides
declarations that appear to state that the records are business records of
Plaintiff for hearsay purposes. (Huerta Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.) However, these are records
of Citibank, which has not provided its own declaration.
 
In the context of this default proceeding the Court accepts
Plaintiff’s evidence as admissible and credits Plaintiff’s testimony.  There is a reasonable legal position that
these are not hearsay statements at all. 
Credit card statements of the sort at issue here are created
mechanically and automatically.  Hearsay
applies to out of court statements, which can be made by a person and not a
machine.  (See Evidence Code § 1200
[defining hearsay evidence as evidence “of a statement that was made other than
by a witness while testifying.”].)  Plaintiff
has authenticated the documents as Citibank documents that served as the basis
for Plaintiff’s decision to buy the debt. (Huerta Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.)  Federal law required Citibank to send
Defendant these monthly statements. 
(Huerta Decl. ¶ 6.)  The documents
appear to be in the form of a normal credit card statement.  Moreover, they were attached to the complaint
and Defendant had the opportunity to contest them if Defendant had appeared in
this case.  
 
For all these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff has
provided adequate evidence of its damages.
 
 
Interest
 
Plaintiff does not seek interest.
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Nathalia A. Aguirre avers that Plaintiff expended $524.00 in
costs.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
            Plaintiff
does not request attorney’s fees.
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
            Plaintiff
provides a proposed form of judgment consistent with the above.
 
 
Submission of the Written Agreement
 
            The
Court’s record does not appear to reflect that the original agreements have
been submitted. The Court requests that Plaintiff submit the original loan
agreements or aver as to whether the original documents have been lost or
destroyed.
 
Statement of Damages
 
Plaintiff does not need to submit a statement of damages
because this is not a personal injury or wrongful death case.
