And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Credit Corp Solutions, Inc. (assignee of Citibank) versus Angie Grigorian. The plaintiff is seeking a default judgment against the defendant in the amount of $184,590.03, which includes $184,066.03 in damages and $524.00 in costs.

The court has accepted the plaintiff's evidence as admissible and has credited the plaintiff's testimony. The court has also found that the plaintiff has provided adequate evidence of its damages, despite a potential hearsay issue with the credit card statements.

The court has granted the plaintiff's request for default judgment and has also granted the plaintiff's request to dismiss the Doe defendants. The court has requested that the plaintiff submit the original loan agreements or avow to whether the original documents have been lost or destroyed.

The court has also noted that the plaintiff does not need to submit a statement of damages because this is not a personal injury or wrongful death case. The court's final ruling is subject to change based on any objections or further submissions from the parties.
