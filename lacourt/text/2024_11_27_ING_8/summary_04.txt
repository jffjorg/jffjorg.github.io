And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge rules that the demurrer filed by Southern California Edison Company (SCE) is sustained without leave to amend. The demurrer was filed against the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by 3Sheets, LLC dba Easton Gym Company (Plaintiff). The SAC alleges causes of action for Common Counts and General Negligence against SCE and others.

The Judge found that Plaintiff's claims are barred by Public Utility Code section 1759, which prohibits courts from reviewing, reversing, correcting, or annulling orders or decisions of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) or interfering with the PUC's performance of its official duties.

The Judge concluded that Plaintiff is a customer of SCE, as defined by SCE's Tariff Rule 1, because it paid SCE's service bills, and therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case. The Judge granted SCE's request for judicial notice of the PUC's Tariff Rule 10 and 5, which govern the procedures for customers to dispute their Edison bills.

The Judge noted that Plaintiff's opposition brief concedes that SCE's Tariff Rule provides a mechanism to resolve billing disputes with SCE customers before the PUC, but argues that the Commission was not set up to resolve claims by non-customers of SCE. However, the Judge found that Plaintiff's allegations against SCE require application of its Tariff rule 10 and rule 5, and therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case.
