And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. The plaintiff, Carlo A. Coppola, filed the original complaint against Luxe H2O, Incorporated on February 9, 2022, alleging negligence, breach of contract, and breach of express warranty. The plaintiff has since filed two amended complaints, with the most recent one seeking to add additional latent defects and damages related to electrical work performed by Luxe. The judge has determined that the motion should be granted because the additional issues were only recently identified and not known to the plaintiff at the time of the filing of the previous complaints. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file the third amended complaint on or before December 6, 2024, and Luxe has until year-end to file its responsive pleading.
