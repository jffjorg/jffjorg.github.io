APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF POSSESSION

Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 23CHCV03144

 
Motion
filed: 10/23/23
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A. (“BMO Bank” or
“Plaintiff”)
RESPONDING PARTY: None
NOTICE: OK¿¿¿ 
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order granting Plaintiff’s Application for Writ of Possession against Defendant
Salvador Medina. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The Application
for Writ of Possession is GRANTED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an alleged breach of contract.
Plaintiff BMO Bank seeks a writ of possession against Defendants Medina Truck
& Transportation, Inc. (“MT&T”) and personal guarantor Salvador Medina
(“Medina”) (collectively, “Defendants”) for one 2023 Peterbilt tractor. 
 
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff initiated the action against
Defendants, and Does 1-20. The Complaint alleges: (1) Breach of Written
Agreement; (2) Breach of Continuing Guaranty; (3) Claim and Delivery; and (4)
Conversion.
 
On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Application for Writ
of Possession against Defendant Medina (the “Application”), and a separate
Application for Writ of Possession against MT&T.
 
 
On November 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed two separate
documents of Proof of Substituted Service, demonstrating substituted service of
the summons, complaint, applications for writ of possession, and supporting
documents on Defendants by leaving the papers with Christina Medina,
co-occupant, on October 30, 2023, and mailing a copy of papers to Defendants on
November 3, 2023. 
 
On December 13, 2023, MT&T filed its Motion to Quash
Summons and Complaint. Subsequently, on December 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
Amended Proof of Substituted Service as to Defendant MT&T.
 
            On
December 26, 2023, Defendant Medina filed his Demurrer to the Complaint. 
 
            On May 17,
2024, the Court continued the hearing on the instant Application to May 30,
2024, to be heard concurrently with Defendant Medina’s Demurrer.
 
No Oppositions to the Application for Writ of Possession have
been received by the Court. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Per Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010, subdivision
(b), “[u]pon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the
plaintiff may apply pursuant to this chapter for a writ of possession by filing
a written application for the writ with the court in which the action is
brought.” 
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b), the
application must be submitted under oath and include: 
 
(1) A
showing of the basis of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is
entitled to possession of the property claimed. If the basis of the plaintiff's
claim is a written instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be attached. 
 
(2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the
manner in which the defendant came into possession of the property, and,
according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of
the reason for the detention. 
 
(3) A
particular description of the property and a statement of its value. 
 
(4) A
statement, according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the
plaintiff, of the location of the property and, if the property, or some part
of it, is within a private place which may have to be entered to take
possession, a showing that there is probable cause to believe that such
property is located there. 
 
(5) A
statement that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine,
pursuant to a statute; or seized under an execution against the property of the
plaintiff; or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from such seizure. 
 
Before the hearing on the
Writ of Possession, the Defendant must be served with (1) a copy of the summons
and complaint; (2) a Notice of Application and Hearing; and (3) a copy of the
application and any affidavit in support thereof.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
512.030.) If the defendant has not appeared
in the action, the writ and other papers must be served in the same manner as
is acceptable for a service of summons. (Id. § 512.030, subd. (b).)
 
“The writ will be issued if the court finds that the
plaintiff's claim is probably valid and the other requirements for issuing the
writ are established.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.040, subd. (b).)  “A
claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 511.090.)   
 
Prior to the issuance of a writ of possession, the
Plaintiff must file an undertaking “in an amount not less than twice the value
of the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 515.010, subd. (a).)   
 
A.   
Notice
 
As a preliminary issue,
Plaintiff must demonstrate that the Court has jurisdiction over Defendant
MT&T in this case. Records indicate that MT&T filed a Motion to Quash
Service on December 13, 2023, challenging that service was not properly effected
upon defendant MT&T.
 
“[O]nce a defendant files a
motion to quash the burden is on the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of
the evidence the validity of the service and the court’s jurisdiction over the
defendant.” (Bolkiah v. Superior Court of L.A. County (1999) 74
Cal.App.4th 984, 991.)
 
Here, in response to Motion
to Quash, Plaintiff submitted an Amended Proof of Service on December 20, 2023.
This document explicitly states that the substituted service was made to Defendant
Medina, individual and as the registered agent for service for MT&T, at the
address located at 14661 Chatsworth Dr., Mission Hills, CA 91345 (2023/12/20
Proof of Service). This address matches Defendant Medina’s contact address (Id.
at p. 4.)
 
As analyzed in detail in the
Court’s separate ruling on the Motion to Quash, the Court has concluded that
Plaintiff’s service of process, including the Application, is effective and
valid. (2024/5/17 Minute Order.) 
 
Furthermore, Defendants do
not contest the service upon Medina. 
 
Consequently, the Court
determines that the notice requirements under Code of Civil Procedure section
512.030 have been
satisfied. 
 
B.    
Basis of
Plaintiff’s Claim
 
Plaintiff’s declarant
demonstrates sufficient personal knowledge of BMO Bank’s records as a custodian
of these records. (Schrepel Decl. ¶ 1.) Plaintiff submits evidence that on
January 24, 2023, Defendant MT&T and BMO Bank entered into a loan and
security agreement to obtain a loan for one 2023 Peterbilt tractor at issue. (Schrepel
Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. “1.”) Additionally, Defendant Medina also executed in writing a
Continuing Guaranty. (Schrepel Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. “2.”) Here, Plaintiff presents
copies of Loan and Security Agreement and the Continuing Guaranty, as exhibits
to the declaration. (Id. Ex. “1” and “2.”)
 
            Schrepel asserts that Defendants have
defaulted under the terms of the agreements, with the accelerated balances now
including a principal of $222,511.88 (Schrepel Decl. ¶ 12), unpaid interest of
$4,693.92 based on non-default rate of 8.63% per annum through the date of
acceleration on June 29, 2023 (Id. ¶ 14), and interest continue to
accrue at the default rate of 18% per annum until the date of judgment. (Id.
¶ 15.) Pursuant to the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement, Plaintiff is
entitled to immediate possession of the equipment described therein. (Id.
¶ 18.) Plaintiff has made demand upon Defendants for the return of the
collateral, 2023
Peterbilt tractor, however, it is still wrongfully retained by Defendants.
(Id., ¶ 24.)
 
            Defendant Medina does not oppose the
Application. The only objection to the pleading from Medina is his Demurrer as
to the Third and Fourth Cause of Action. As the Court has overruled the
demurrer, Plaintiff’s factual allegations remain uncontested and
uncontradicted.
 
            Based on
the above records, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has sufficiently
demonstrated the basis of its claim.
 
C.   
Wrongful
Detention
 
In accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 512.010(b)(2), the Application must include “a showing that
the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the manner in which
the defendant came into possession of the property, and, according to the best
knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the reason for the
detention.”
 
Plaintiff presents that MT&T
breached the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement on April 1, 2023, by
failing to make monthly loan payments. (Schrepel Decl. ¶ 10.) Additionally,
MT&T has failed and continues to fail to make any subsequent payments. (Ibid.)
Under the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement and Continuing Guaranty,
Plaintiff has the right to repossess the equipment in the event of default.
(Schrepel Decl. ¶ 19, Ex. “1.”) Plaintiff asserts that Defendant MT&T and
Medina wrongfully detained the equipment after defaulting on the agreement. (Id.
¶ 20.)
 
Consequently, the Court finds
that Plaintiff has met its burden in establishing Medina’s wrongful detention.
 
D.   
Description
and Value of Property
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 512.010, subdivision (b)(3), the Application must include a
particular description of the property and a statement of its value.
 
Plaintiff has fulfilled this
requirement by providing an explicit description of the equipment, including
its make, model, model year, and VIN number, along with its value. (Schrepel
Decl. ¶¶ 6, 29). 
 
Consequently, Plaintiff adheres
to the mandates of Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010 subdivision (b)(3).
 
E.    
Statutory
Statements
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 512.010 subdivisions (b)(4) and (5), the application must
include: 
 
“(4) A statement, according to
the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the location
of the property and, if the property, or some part of it, is within a private
place which may have to be entered to take possession, a showing that there is
probable cause to believe that such property is located there.
 
(5) A statement that the property
has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to a statute; or
seized under an execution against the property of the plaintiff; or, if so
seized, that it is by statute exempt from such seizure.”
 
Here,
Plaintiff has provided a statement that the equipment has not been taken for a
tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to statute and has not been seized under an
execution against the Plaintiff’s property. (Schrepel Decl. ¶ 25.)
 
Furthermore,
Plaintiff states that “Plaintiff is informed and believes that the COLLATERAL
is currently located at: a. 12000 Paxton St., Sylmar, CA 91342; b. 14661
Chatsworth Dr., Mission Hills, CA 91345; or Such other location known to
Defendants.” (Id. ¶ 22.) 
 
Notably,
records indicate that the address at 14661 Chatsworth Dr. serves as both the
principal business address of MT&T and the residential address of Defendant
Medina. (12/20/23 Proof of Service.) Consequently, the Court finds that the
objective circumstances support the probable cause of the current location of
the equipment. 
 
Therefore,
the requirements for statutory statements are satisfied.
 
F.    
Undertaking
 
According to Code of Civil
Procedure section 515.010, an undertaking must be filed before the writ issues
in the amount of “not less than twice the value of the defendant’s interest in
the property.”  However, if “the court
finds that the defendant has no interest in the property, the court “shall
waive the requirement of ... undertaking[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 515.010, subd.
(b).) 
 
Here, Plaintiff provides evidence
showing that the amount owing on the equipment surpasses its market value, indicating
that Defendants possess no equity in the equipment. (Schrepel Decl. ¶¶ 29, 30.)

 
Accordingly, based on this
specific circumstance, the requirement for undertaking should be waived
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 515.010 subdivision (b).
 
G.    Turn
Over Order
 
Plaintiff also seeks an
order directing the Defendants to turn over the equipment to Plaintiff,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.070. (Mem. at p. 7.)
Additionally, Plaintiff’s Notice of Application on Form CD-110 gave notice that
the court may issue a turnover order. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 512.070 provides, “If a writ of possession is issued, the court may also issue
an order directing the defendant to transfer possession of the property to the
plaintiff. Such order shall contain a notice to the defendant that failure to
turn over possession of such property to plaintiff may subject the defendant to
being held in contempt of court.”
 
Given that
the requirements for issuance of the writ of possession are satisfied as to
MT&T, the Court GRANTS the request to issue a turnover order against Medina.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
GRANTS the Application for Writ of Possession against Defendant Medina. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Application
for Writ of Possession and a turnover order against Salvador Medina is GRANTED.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice. __________________________________________________________________________________

DEMURRER

Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 23CHCV03144

 
Motion
filed: 12/26/23
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Salvador Medina (the “Demurring
Defendant” or “Medina”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff BMO Bank N.A. (“Plaintiff”
or “BMO Bank”)
NOTICE: OK 
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court granting Medina’s demurrer to the Third and Fourth Cause
of Action in the Complaint.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The demurrer
is OVERRULED. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an alleged breach of contract.
 
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff initiated the action against
Defendants, and Does 1-20. The Complaint alleges: (1) Breach of Written
Agreement; (2) Breach of Continuing Guaranty; (3) Claim and Delivery; and (4)
Conversion.
 
On December 26, 2023, Medina filed the instant Demurrer to
the Complaint (the “Demurrer”).
 
On May 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed its Opposition. 
 
No Reply papers have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v.
Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A general demurrer is
proper, and typically used, where the plaintiff fails to allege “facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e); Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 1004.)
 
“The sufficiency of a cause of action is
evaluated by presuming all of the material factual allegations in the complaint
are true.” (Aubry v. TriCity Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal 4th 962, 966 –
967 (Aubry).) In ruling on a demurrer, a court may consider facts that
are properly subject to judicial notice. (Arroyo v. Plosay, 225 Cal.
App. 4th 279.) In ruling on a demurrer, the allegations of the complaint must
be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.
(Glennen v. Allergan, Inc. (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 1, 6.) Nevertheless,
while "[a] demurrer admits all facts properly pleaded, [it does] not
[admit] contentions, deductions or conclusions of law or fact." (George
v. Automobile Club of Southern California (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1112,
1120, 135.) Additionally, “[a] complaint otherwise good on its face is subject
to demurrer when facts judicially noticed render it defective.” (Evans v.
City of Berkeley (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1, 6.)
 
“It is error for a trial court to
sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any
possible legal theory. (Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn. (1972) 7
Cal.3d 94, 103.) And it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without
leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any
defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)” Aubry, supra, 2 Cal. 4th
at 967.)
 
A.               
Meet and
Confer
 
A
party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with
the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)
A failure to meet and confer does not constitute grounds to sustain or overrule
a demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(4).)
 
Medina filed his declaration
regarding his compliance with the meet and confer requirements (form CIV-140).
However, the declaration does not specify whether the meet the confer was
conducted by either telephone or in person, as mandated under Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.41 subdivision (a).
 
Consequently, the Court
finds that the requirements for meet and confer have not been fully satisfied.
 
B.                
Third Cause
of Action – Claim and Delivery
 
Medina argues that the
Continuing Guaranty is governed under Illinois state law, as it states, “This
Guaranty is subject to and governed by the laws of the State of Illinois
(without regard to the conflicts of law principles of such state), regardless
of the location of Guarantor or the Company.” (Dem., at p. 5.) Medina further
maintains that Claim and Delivery is subject to demurrer as it is neither a
part of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) or Illinois state law. (Id., at p.
6.)
 
In response, BMO Bank
contends that Illinois’ Replevin cause of action is virtually the same as
California’s claim and delivery cause of action. (Opp’n., at p. 4.) BMO Bank
also argues that the claim is supported by California Civil Procedure section
627, and California Commercial Code section 9609, which is modeled after UCC §
9-609, in addition to the remedies stipulated under the choice of law
provision. (Id., at p. 3.)
 
1)     
Choice of Law
 
“California law recognizes a strong public policy favoring
enforcement of choice-of-law provisions[.]” (Colaco v. Cavotec SA (2018)
25 Cal.App.5th 1172, 1177.) California courts enforce choice of law provisions,
subject to two qualifications. (Nedlloyd Lines B.V. v. Superior Court
(1992) 3 Cal.4th 459, 465.) More specifically:  
 
If the
parties state their intention in an express choice-of-law clause, California
courts ordinarily will enforce the parties’ stated intention unless (1) the
chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or their
transaction, and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties’ choice, or
(2) the chosen state’s law is contrary to a fundamental policy of the state
whose law otherwise would apply, and the latter state has a materially greater
interest in the matter than does the chosen state.  
 
(Frontier Oil Corp. v. RLI Ins. Co. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1436, 1451, fn. 7 [citing Nedlloyd Lines B.V. v. Superior Court
(1992) 3 Cal.4th 459].) 
 
Here, the
Complaint provides a copy of the Continuing Guaranty agreement between
Plaintiff and Medina. (Compl., Ex. “2.”) As the Continuing Guaranty expressly
states, “This Guaranty shall be governed by and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to its
conflict of laws provisions, and each Guarantor submits to personal
jurisdiction in the State of Illinois,” the next step is to analyze whether the
provision fails bases on the above qualifications. 
 
Here, neither party contests
or provides factual showing that the chosen state Illinois has no substantial
relationship to them. Nor do they argue that Illinois’s law is contrary to a
fundamental policy of California. 
 
Consequently, the Court
proceeds to analyze whether these factual pleadings under the cause of action are
subject to demurrer, operating under the assumption that Illinois law applies
to this case.
 
2)     
Illinois Replevin
Claim
 
Replevin is a strict
statutory proceeding, and the statute must be followed precisely. Universal Credit Co. v. Antonsen (1940) 374 Ill. 194, 200; Jim's Furniture Mart, Inc. v.
Harris (1976) 42 Ill.App.3d 488, 490.) “Section 19–101 of the Code
of Civil Procedure (the Code) provides that, ‘[w]henever any goods or chattels
have been wrongfully distrained, or otherwise wrongfully taken or are
wrongfully detained, an action for replevin
may be brought for the recovery of such goods or chattels, by the owner or
person entitled to their possession.’” (Carool v. Curry (2009) 392
Ill.App.3d 511, 514.) In a replevin
action, the plaintiff bears the burden to “allege and prove that he [or she] is
lawfully entitled to possession of the property, that the defendant wrongfully
detains the property and refuses to deliver the possession of the property to
the plaintiff.” International Harvester Credit Corp. v.
Helland (1985) 130 Ill.App.3d 836, 838, citing Hanaman v. Davis (1959) 20 Ill.App.2d 111, 155.)
 
Here,
the Complaint alleges that BMO Bank is entitled to immediate possession of the
collateral vehicle pursuant to the terms of the agreement and default.
Furthermore, it substantiates that the collateral vehicle is wrongfully
retained by both Defendants. (Compl., ¶¶ 22-30.) Consequently, even if the heading of “Claim and Delivery” is challenged
as unavailable by the Demurring Defendant, as the Demurring Defendant argues,
the Court nevertheless finds that Plaintiff’s factual pleadings have
sufficiently stated elements of the cause of action for Replevin under Illinois
law. 
 
Based on the above, and following the reviewing
standard that a demurrer
“tests only whether, as a matter of law, the properly pleaded facts in the
complaint state a cause of action under any legal theory” (Olson v.
Hornbrook Community Services Dist. (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 502, 522)
(Underlines added), the Court OVERRULES the Demurrer as to the Third Cause of Action.
 
C.               
Fourth Cause
of Action – Conversion
 
Medina argues that Article 9
of the UCC, stipulated in the Continuing Guaranty as the governing law,
displaces common law remedies such as the Fourth Cause of Action for
Conversion. (Dem., at p. 7.) To support this argument, Medina cites Mellon
Investor Services, LLC v. Longwood Country Garden Centers, Inc. (2008) 263
Fed.Appx.277, 283 (Mellon), claiming, “[T]he applicable UCC provision in
Article 8 provide a comprehensive remedial scheme regarding the rights and
obligations of those persons and entities involved in the wrongful registration
of transfers of securities.” (Dem., at p. 7.) 
 
However, the Court observes
that Medina has misinterpreted the ruling in Mellon, which actually
rejects the argument Medina cites and holds that “the U.C.C. does not displace
Mellon’s equitable and common law tort claims.” (Id., at p. 278.) Thus,
Medina’s assertion that Article 9 of the UCC displaces common law tort claims
for conversion is incorrect.
 
Therefore, the Court
OVERRULES the Demurrer as to the Fourth Cause of Action.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court OVERRULES the
Demurrer.
            
CONCLUSION
            
Defendant
Salvador Medina’s Demurrer is OVERRULED. 
 
Defendant
Salvador Medina is ordered to file and serve his Answer to the Complaint within
20 days.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
