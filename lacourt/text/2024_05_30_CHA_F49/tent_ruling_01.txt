Motion
filed: 3/21/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Sabrina Goodrum (“Plaintiff”
or “Goodrum”)
RESPONDING PARTY: American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“Defendant”
or “AHM”)


NOTICE: OK¿¿ 
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court to compel Defendant to produce supplemental responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents (“RFP”), Set One,  Nos. 1-3, 7, 9, 12-14, 17-23, 28-29, 32-33,
36-37, 40-41, 46-47, 49-50, 63-68, 74, 79-80, 83-84, 89, 91-92, 111-114, and
125-130. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is DENIED. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff filed this Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”)
lawsuit over alleged defects in her 2019 Honda Pilot (the “Subject Vehicle”),
which was manufactured by Defendant AHM. Plaintiff alleges that she leased the
Subject Vehicle on April 1, 2019, entering into a warranty contract with AHM.
 
On July 27, 2023, Plaintiff initiated the action against
Defendant, and Does 1 through 10. The Complaint alleges four causes of action:
(1) Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil Code section 1793.2; (2) Violation of
Subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1793.2, (3) Violation of Subdivision
(a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2, and (4) Breach of Implied Warranty of
Merchantability (Civ. Code, §§ 1791.1; 1794; 1795.5) Subsequently, AHM filed its
Answer to the Complaint on August 30, 2023.
 
On March 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFP, Set One (the “Motion”).
Subsequently, on May 16, 2024, AHM filed its Opposition, and Plaintiff replied
on May 22, 2024. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that …
[a] statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete[;] … [a]
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive[;
or] … [a]n objection in the response is without merit or too
general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd., (a).)
 
A.   
Procedural
Requirements
 
1.     
Timeliness
 
A motion to compel further responses to requests for production
must be brought within 45 days of service of the verified response,
supplemental verified response, or on a date to which the propounding and
responding parties have agreed to in writing; otherwise, the propounding party
waives the right to compel further responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (c); but see Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 134-136 [suggesting that the 45-day deadline does
not apply to (i.e., it does not begin to run with service of) objections-only
responses; it only applies to responses that are required to be verified].)
 
“[T]he time within which to make a motion to compel
production of documents is mandatory and jurisdictional just as it is for
motions to compel further answers to interrogatories.”  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) The 45-day deadline “is ‘jurisdictional’ in the sense
that it renders the court without authority to rule on motions to compel other
than to deny them.”  (Ibid.) 
            
Here, Plaintiff attests that
Defendant’s responses to the RFP, Set One, were served on February 2, 2024, with
Defendant’s electronic verification following on February 6, 2024. (Theophil
Decl. ¶¶ 18-19.)  The service of verification
establishes the deadline for Plaintiff to file a motion to compel further as
March 26, 2024, calculated based on a 45-day period with an extension of two
court days per Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision (a)(3),
accounting for the method of electronic service.
 
            Therefore,
the Court finds the Motion is filed timely as it was filed prior to the
established deadline.
 
2.     
Meet and Confer
 
“A motion [to compel further responses to requests for production]
shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b)(1).) 
 
Here, Plaintiff has satisfied the
meet and confer requirement. (Theophil Decl. ¶¶ 24-29.)
 
3.     
Separate
Statement
 
The California
Rules of Court rule 3.1345 (a)(3) explicitly states that “Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses to
such a request must be accompanied by a separate statement. The motions that
require a separate statement include a motion: ... (3) To compel further
responses to a demand for inspection of documents or tangible things[.]”
 
Here, Plaintiff has fulfilled
the requirement by concurrently filing a separate statement with the Motion. 
 
B.    
Motion to
Compel Further Responses 
 
1)     
AHM’s
Initial Responses (RFP Nos. 1-3, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17, 33, 83-84, 89, 91-92,
111-112, and 127-128)
 
i.                   
RFP
Nos. 1-2, and 91
 
Here,
AHM’s responses to RFP Nos. 1 and 2, state, in pertinent part, “Pursuant to
section 2031.280, AHM will produce the non-confidential Warranty History. Also pursuant
to section 2031.280, AHM will produce the Warranty Registration and
confidential Warranty History, which contain information that is confidential,
commercially sensitive, proprietary, and/or trade secret, pursuant to the entry
of an appropriate protective order.” 
 
AHM’s
response to RFP No. 91 states, in pertinent part, “Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.280, the following documents applicable to the SUBJECT
VEHICLE during Plaintiff’s ownership will be produced: its guideline documents
titled “Lemon Law Inquiries,” “Early Warning,” and “Attorney Involved,” which
are confidential and contain proprietary, trade secret, and commercially
sensitive information, and will be produced pursuant to the protective order in
this case.” (See Plaintiff’s and AHM’s Separate Statement.)
 
Here,
the case record reflects a Stipulation and Protective Order was filed and
granted on April 16, 2024, satisfying the conditions for AHM to produce documents
labeled as “confidential, commercially sensitive, proprietary, and/or trade
secret” as agreed in its responses. Moreover, although Plaintiff challenges
AHM’s objections, she does not address whether the documents AHM agreed to
produce are insufficient. Thus, the Court deems the Motion, as it pertains to
RFP Nos. 1, 2, and 91, to be moot.
 
Therefore,
the Court DENIES the Motion as to RFP Nos. 1-2, and 91 for the reasons stated
above.
 
i.                   
RFP
Nos. 3, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17, 33, 83-84, 89, 92, and 111-112
 
Here,
AHM’s responses to the above-listed RFP Nos. state, in pertinent part, that
“AHM has made a diligent search and reasonable inquiry in an effort to comply
with this request and has located no documents responsive to this request and
no responsive documents have ever existed.” (See Plaintiff’s and AHM’s Separate
Statement.)
 
            The
Court finds AHM’s responses in compliance with Code the Civil Procedure section
2031.230, which specifies, in the relevant part, “A representation of
inability to comply with the particular demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent search and a reasonable
inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that demand. This statement
shall also specify whether the inability to comply is because the particular
item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost,
misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession,
custody, or control of the responding party.”
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion as to RFP Nos. 3, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17, 33, 83-84,
89, 92, and 111-112.
 
2)     
Moving
Party’s Showing of Good Cause (RFP Nos. 13, 18-23, 28, 32, 40, 46, 63, 65- 68,
79, and 113-114)
 
A motion to compel further
responses to requests for production shall “set forth specific facts showing
good cause”. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd., (b)(1).) To establish “good
cause,” the moving party must show (1) the items demanded are relevant to the
subject matter and (2) specific facts justify the discovery of the requested
items (e.g., why such information is necessary for trial preparation or to
prevent surprise at trial). (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd., (b)(1); see Glenfed
Develop. Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117
(Glenfed).) If “good cause” is shown by the moving party, the burden is then on
the responding party to justify any objections made to document disclosure. (Kirkland
v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)
 
i.                   
RFP
No. 13, 18-23, 28, 32, 40, 46, 63, 65-68, 79, and 113-114.
 
Plaintiff
argues that RFP No. 13 seeks documents pertaining to the Subjective Vehicle,
thus, they are indisputably relevant to Plaintiff’s SBA claims. (Mot. at p. 8.)
Additionally, Plaintiff contends that the RFP Nos. 18-21, 28, 32, 40, 46, 63,
65-68, and 79 request documents and information concerning the Defects of Honda
vehicles equipped with the same climate control system and electrical
architecture as the Subject Vehicle. (Mot. at p. 8.) Furthermore, Plaintiff
states that RFP Nos. 113-114 consists of documents and information showing AHM’s
communications with any governmental agencies and third-party suppliers
regarding the Defects of the Honda vehicles equipped with the same climate
control system and electrical architecture as the Subject Vehicle. Plaintiff
argues that such communications will be relevant to the finding of AHM’s
knowledge of the defects. (Mot. at p. 10.)
 
In
its Opposition, AHM argues that all of the above-listed RFP Nos. seek
irrelevant information, as neither the “Electrical Defect(s)” nor the “Climate
Control Defect(s)” were presented to AHM’s authorized repair facilities. Without
Plaintiff’s showing that a nonconformity exists, or that AHM failed to repair a
substantially impairing nonconformity within a reasonable number of attempts,
the RFP requests are irrelevant to Plaintiff’s SBA claim. (Opp’n, at p.7.)
 
Moreover,
AHM maintains that the Subject Vehicle’s repair history, as relied upon by
Plaintiff in her Motion, shows none of her concerns fall within the definitions
of these two defects set in the RFP, Set One. (Opp’n. at p. 11.)
 
In
Reply, Plaintiff seeks to substantiate her claim by submitting a supplemental
declaration from her counsel Naquia Brown. Plaintiff also refers to Hannah
Theophil’s declaration, concurrently filed with the Motion, which incorporates
the relevant repair orders. (Reply, at p. 2, Theophil Decl. ¶¶ 4-7, Ex. “1.”)
 
The
RFP, Set One, provides the following definitions: 
 
“The term “CLIMATE CONTROL DEFECT(S)” shall mean one
or more defect(s)
within the climate control system of the HONDA Pilot
vehicles equipped with the same climate
control system as the SUBJECT VEHICLE that can result in the
(1) lack of cold and/or hot air,
(2) intermittent cold/hot air, (3) uneven air distribution,
(4) noises coming from the climate
control system; as well as, any other similar concerns
identified in the repair history for the
SUBJECT VEHICLE.”
 
“The term “ELECTRICAL DEFECT(S)” shall
mean one or more defect(s)
within
the electrical architecture of the HONDA Pilot vehicles equipped with the same
electrical
architecture as the SUBJECT VEHICLE that can result in (1) loss of power, (2)
battery
draining, (3) lights dimming or flickering, (4) power windows, doors or locks
not
working,
(5) failure to start, (6) malfunctioning of the instrument cluster, (7)
malfunction or
failure
of the auto start-stop feature (8) malfunction or failure of the engine
stop-start (ESS)
feature
(9) malfunctioning or failure of the fuses, modules, and/or relays; as well as,
any other
similar concerns identified in the
repair history for the SUBJECT VEHICLE.”
 
(Theophil Decl. Ex. “4.”)
 
The
Court notes that these definitions are relatively broad and unsupported by the
factual evidence presented in Plaintiff’s pleadings. For example, the attached
repair orders do not indicate specific repairs related to any of the defects as
defined in the above definition for Electric Defects or Climate Control
Defects. (Theophil Decl. Ex. “1.’) Moreover, these repair receipts instead corroborate
the showing that only two recalls (19-096 and 20-047) were performed, that Plaintiff
complained that the outer handle cover for the left rear door needed repair,
and that the technician could not duplicate Plaintiff’s abnormal smell concern
from the AC. (Theophil Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.) The Court observes an inconsistency when
the declaration seeks support from an exhibit that does not provide it.
 
Consequently,
to meet the threshold burden of showing good cause, Plaintiff relies solely on
a conclusion of fact, which states, “Indeed, Plaintiff presented the Subject
Vehicle on no less than two (2) separate occasions with concerns related to
Climate Control Defects and Electrical Defects. In response, the dealership
performed various repairs attempting to fix the Defects. However, none of the
repairs have fixed the Defects.” (Theophil Decl. ¶ 7.) 
 
The
Court finds this assertion alone does not establish “good cause,”
requiring (1) that the items demanded are relevant to the subject matter, and
(2) specific facts justifying the discovery of the requested items (e.g., why
such information is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent surprise at
trial). (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd., (b)(1); see also Glenfed,
supra, 53 Cal.App.4th at 1117.) As the moving party fails to meet the threshold
hold, it is unnecessary for the Court to consider the validity of the
objections raised by the opposing party.
 
Therefore,
the Court DENIES the Motion as to the above-listed RFP Nos. on the basis that
Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden in setting forth specific facts
showing good cause.
 
3)     
Relief
Requested but Argument Omitted (RFP Nos. 29, 36-37, 41, 47, 49-50, 64, 74, 80, 125-126,
and 129-130)
 
Plaintiff does not present any legal arguments concerning
the above-listed RFP Nos.
 
Accordingly, the Court does not consider the Motion as to
RFP Nos. 29, 36-37, 41,
47, 49-50, 64, 74, 80, 125-126, and 129-130.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production, Set One, is DENIED.
 
Moving party
to give notice.
