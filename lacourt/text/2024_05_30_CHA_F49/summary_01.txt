```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. The Court found that the Plaintiff failed to meet the threshold burden of showing good cause, requiring specific facts justifying the discovery of the requested items. The Court also found that the Plaintiff's assertion that the requested information is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial was not supported by the factual evidence presented in the pleadings.
