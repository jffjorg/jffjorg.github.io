And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on James's unopposed motion for sanctions against Rowley and Rowley's counsel. James argues that Rowley is continuing to pursue litigation after signing a settlement agreement, and that this is in bad faith. The judge previously ruled that James is not a signatory or third-party beneficiary to the settlement agreement, and therefore has no right to enforce it. As a result, Rowley is within his rights to continue pursuing litigation against James. The judge denies James's motion for sanctions, finding no basis for the court to sanction Rowley or his counsel.
