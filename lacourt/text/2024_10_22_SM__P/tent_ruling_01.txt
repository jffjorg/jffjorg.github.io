Rowley v. James, Case no. 21SMCV00336
Hearing date October 22, 2024
Defendant
James’s Motion for Sanctions
James
moved 8/22/2024 for sanctions against Rowley and Rowley’s counsel for continuing
litigation after settlement. The motion is unopposed. 
James
asserts Rowley continues to pursue litigation despite having signed a
settlement agreement of which James was a beneficiary. James argues the settlement
agreement bars all further claims related to the property at issue. James
further argues continued litigation is in bad faith, and Rowley and his counsel
should be subject to sanctions.
The
court previously ruled James was neither a signatory nor third party
beneficiary to the signed settlement agreement. Min. Order 9/18/2024. The court
stated “As James is not a party to the agreement, he cannot enforce it under
§664.6. Johnson v. Department of Corrections (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1700,
1708. Further, there is no evidence that he is a third-party beneficiary.” Id.

As
James is not a party to the settlement, there was no release from claims
against him. Rowley is within his rights to continue to pursue litigation
against James. There is no basis for the court to sanction Rowley or Rowley’s
counsel. DENIED.
