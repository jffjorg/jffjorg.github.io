And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Burke, to the plaintiff's complaint for unlawful detainer. The plaintiff, Playa Villas Malibu, alleges that the defendant failed to pay rent and has failed to comply with a three-day notice to pay rent or quit. The defendant argues that the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support the claim and that the plaintiff failed to include information required under the California Tenant Protection Act (TPA) in the notice to terminate tenancy. The defendant also argues that the plaintiff failed to plead actual knowledge as required under Los Angeles' Just Cause Ordinance (JCO) and did not serve the Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD) with notice.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint is sufficient to survive a demurrer. The judge has found that the plaintiff alleged all necessary elements under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(2), including a landlord-tenant relationship, default on payment of rent, service of a three-day notice, non-compliance with the notice, and continued possession. The judge has also found that the plaintiff alleged full compliance with the JCO and attached proof of service on LAHD.

The judge has also considered the defendant's arguments regarding the alleged defects in the plaintiff's verification of the complaint. The judge has found that the plaintiff's verification of the complaint is sufficient, as it was signed by Daniel Kidder, the plaintiff's director of community management services, and that the plaintiff alleged substantial compliance with California Code of Civil Procedure section 1166.

The defendant is ordered to answer the complaint within 5 days.
