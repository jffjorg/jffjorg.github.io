Playa Villas Malibu v. Burke, Case
no. 24SMCV04157
Hearing date October 22, 2024
Defendants’
Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint
Defendant
tenants, in pro per, demur in this unlawful detainer failure to pay rent
case under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§4301.10 and 1170.
“The
function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as
a matter of law.” Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004)
118 Cal.App.4th 1413, 1420. A complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather
than evidentiary facts” Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42
Cal.4th 531, 550, but plaintiff must allege essential facts “with reasonable
precision and with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the] defendant with
the nature, source and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim. Doheny Park
Terrace Homeowners Ass’n., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099.
Per
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1161(2) plaintiff must allege: (1) a landlord-tenant
relationship; (2) default on payment of rent; (3) service of a three day notice
to pay rent or quit; (4) non-compliance with the notice; and (5) continued
possession. Plaintiff filed a Judicial Council Form Complaint Unlawful Detainer
and alleged all necessary elements under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1161(2). See
Compl. generally.
Defendants
argue the complaint states the subject property is not subject to the Cal.
Tenant Protection Act (“TPA”) under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1946.2(G). Compl.
para. 7. Defendants assert plaintiff failed to include information required
under the TPA in its notice to terminate tenancy. 
Plaintiff
argues this is not an issue for demurrer, and plaintiff alleged defendants are
exempt from the TPA. Id. As the court must accept all facts alleged as
true for purposes of demurrer, this is sufficient to survive demurrer.
Defendants
next argue plaintiff failed to plead actual knowledge as required under Los
Angeles’ Just Cause Ordinance (“JCO”) and did not serve the Los Angeles Housing
Department (“LAHD”) with notice. 
Plaintiff
alleged full compliance with the JCO (Compl. para. 16) and attached proof of
service on LAHD (Compl. ex. 2). This is sufficient to survive demurrer.
Defendants
finally argue plaintiff is an LLC, so the complaint must be verified by a
managing member. Plaintiff argues a motion to strike under Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§435 is the exclusive method to challenge a verification to a complaint. Perlman
v. Municipal Court (1979) 99 Cal. App. 3d 568; CEB: California
Landlord-Tenant Practice (Second Ed.), §10.45. Plaintiff further argues a
verification is not an element of a cause of action for unlawful detainer, so failure
to verify a complaint does not render it subject to a demurrer. See Butterfield
v. Graves (1902) 138 Cal. 155.
Unlawful
detainer complaints are required to be verified. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1166. Plaintiff’s
complaint is verified by Daniel Kidder, plaintiff’s director of community
management services. Compl. p. 6. Plaintiff asserts an affidavit of
verification by an agent of a party is sufficient. City of Los Angeles v.
Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1925) 196 Cal. 445; H.G.
Bittleston Law & Collection Agency v. Howard (1916) 172 Cal. 357. 
Substantial
compliance with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1166 is sufficient. People v. Superior
Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 464, 469-71. Further, absent an allegation of
bad faith, a claim of inadequate verification is without merit. Frio v.
Superior Court (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1480. Additionally, demurrer is not
the proper means to challenge an allegedly defective verification. 
OVERRULED.
