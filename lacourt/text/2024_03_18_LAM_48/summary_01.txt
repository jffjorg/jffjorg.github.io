```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Fiesta Express, Inc., denied him full and equal access to its website, which is a place of public accommodation. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's actions violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and seeks damages and attorney fees. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has not shown that the defendant's actions were intentional, and that the plaintiff's claims are based on a website that is not a place of public accommodation. The judge has scheduled an order to show cause for dismissal with prejudice for failure to state a claim and failure to obtain default judgment.
