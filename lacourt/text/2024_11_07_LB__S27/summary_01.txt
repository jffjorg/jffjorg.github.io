And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the City of Long Beach's motion to appoint a receiver to take over operation of the Princess Inn, a motel and retail business that has been operating without a license and in violation of numerous court orders. The judge has found that the City has shown a heightened need for the appointment of a receiver due to Defendant Daksha Patel's continued operation of the hotel despite multiple court orders and criminal penalties. The judge has granted the motion and will issue an order appointing a receiver to take over the hotel's operation. The receiver will have the power to manage the hotel, collect rents and income, and make necessary repairs and improvements. The judge has also granted the City's request to permit the receiver to encumber the property to secure the costs of the receivership. The judge will sign the proposed order at the conclusion of the hearing.
