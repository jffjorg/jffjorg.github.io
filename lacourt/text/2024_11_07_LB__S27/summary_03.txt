The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by the defendants. The motion is denied as to SoCal Tow & Impound, LLC and Sean Robert Gowers dba SoCal Tow & Impound, as they are in default and therefore cannot participate in the proceedings. The motion is also denied as to Does 1-3, as they have been named and served, and as to SG Industries, as it was served via substitute service. Additionally, the motion is denied on its merits, as the declaration filed by the defendants lacks specificity to overcome the presumption of validity of the proofs of service. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the ruling, and parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
