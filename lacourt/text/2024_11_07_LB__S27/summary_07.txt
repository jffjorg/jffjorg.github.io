Fernandez 2002 Trust, in its entirety without leave to amend as to the Trust. The demurrer is sustained in its entirety with sixty (60) days' leave to amend as to the remaining defendants. The motion to strike is denied as moot. The Court grants the plaintiff, Luis M. Falcon, sixty days' leave to amend his complaint.
