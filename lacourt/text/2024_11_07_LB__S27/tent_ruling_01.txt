  Case Number:  18LBCV00013    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2024    Dept:  S27 
Background Facts

Plaintiff, the City of Long Beach filed this action against Defendants,
Jayantibhai, Pravin, Dipak, and Daksha Patel for public nuisance and nuisance
per se.  Plaintiff filed its complaint on
10/15/18.  Plaintiff alleges Defendants
have been unlawfully running a motel and retail business knows as the Princess
Inn from 2004 forward.  The property is a
nuisance due to illegal drug use, drug sales, and prostitution, all of which
the City has ordered Defendants to cease. 
 
 
The Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants from
continuing to engage in the subject behavior. 
Thereafter, Plaintiff sought a contempt order against Defendant, Daksha
Patel based on her violation of the injunction. 
The Court found Defendant in contempt in October of 2020, but failed to
sign a judgment based on the findings. 
On 6/17/21, the Court signed the contempt judgment.  Ultimately, after trial, the Court issued a
permanent injunction precluding Defendants from operating the subject
hotel.    
 

Motion for Appointment of a Receiver

a.     Request for Relief
Plaintiff contends Defendants continue to operate the subject hotel in
violation of the injunction issued against them, without a license, and despite
multiple criminal penalties.  Plaintiff
seeks an order appointing a receiver to take over operation of the hotel.  Plaintiff seeks an order that, in the event
the receiver cannot meet the costs of the receivership from the hotel’s
receipts, he be permitted to mortgage the hotel and his lien be senior to all
other liens on the property.  
 
b.    
Opposition
Plaintiff served the moving papers on Defendants and all lien
holders.  Any opposition to the motion
was due on or before 10/25/24.  No party
has filed timely opposition to the motion, and the Court will not consider
late-filed opposition papers.  
 
c.    
Law
Governing Post-Judgment Appointment of a Receiver
Appointment of a prejudgment receiver is a harsh and time-consuming
remedy. Statutes, case law, and court rules require the party requesting a
prejudgment receiver to show that the appointment is genuinely necessary, and
that no lesser remedy (e.g., attachment, claim and delivery, lis pendens or
injunction) would adequately protect the party's property interest. The court
must carefully weigh the need for a receiver against the hardship and expense
involved.  See generally, Samuels v.
Sup.Ct. (Hoffman) (1969) 276 CA2d 264, 270, 81 CR 216, 220;  Hoover v. Galbraith (1972) 7 C3d 519, 528,
102 CR 733, 738;  Morand v. Sup.Ct.
(Morris) (1974) 38 CA3d 347, 351, 113 CR 281, 283.
Enforcement agencies, tenants and tenant associations may seek
receiverships for substandard buildings, provided the owner has been afforded a
reasonable opportunity to correct the cited violations. Appointed receivers
may, among other things, take control of substandard property, manage the
buildings, pay expenses, collect all rents and income for rehabilitation
purposes and repairs and, with court approval, secure debts and any monies owed
for the receiver's compensation with a real property lien.  See  Health
& Saf.C. § 17980.7;  County of Sonoma
v. Quail (2020) 56 CA5th 657, 671-672, 270 CR3d 1, 11;  City of Chula Vista v. Gutierrez (2012) 207
CA4th 681, 687, 143 CR3d 689, 693.
 
A receiver may be appointed to help enforce a judgment.  See CCP §§ 708.610-708.630, CCP §§ 86(a)(8),
564(b)(3), (4);  Medipro Med. Staffing
LLC v. Certified Nursing Registry, Inc. (2021) 60 CA5th 622, 627, 274 CR3d 797,
800; Gold v. Gold Realty Co. (2003) 114 CA4th 791, 804, 8 CR3d 118, 127-128.
 
Courts “have substantial discretion to authorize a receiver to borrow
money to fund the preservation and management of property in the receivership
estate, particularly where … the estate does not produce income. In that
circumstance, the receiver may ask the court to authorize the issuance of a
receiver's certificate to the lender as security for money loaned to the
estate. Typically, such a receivership certificate will have priority over all
other liens—even preexisting liens.”  City
of Sierra Madre v. SunTrust Mortg., Inc. (2019) 32 CA5th 648, 657-658, 244 CR3d
118, 125;  County of Sonoma v. Quail
(2020) 56 CA5th 657, 675, 270 CR3d 1, 13-14.
 
d.    
Analysis
Plaintiff provides substantial evidence that Defendant continues to
operate the Princess Inn despite not having a business license, despite a prior
contempt order for her ongoing conduct, despite both a preliminary AND a
permanent injunction, and despite criminal penalties.  Plaintiff has therefore clearly satisfied the
requirement that it show a heightened need for appointment of a post-judgment
receiver.  
 
Plaintiff has provided a proposed order appointing a receiver.  The proposed order specifies the powers and
immunities that apply to the receiver. 
The Court has reviewed the proposed order and finds it is acceptable in
scope.  The Court will not repeat the
proposed order verbatim in this ruling, but incorporates it by reference.  The Court will sign the proposed order at the
conclusion of the hearing.
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff seeks an order permitting the receiver
to encumber the property for the purpose of carrying out the receivership
duties.  In light of the circumstances,
because the moving papers were served on all senior lienholders, and in keeping
with the above authority, that request is also granted.  
 
e.    
Conclusion
The motion is granted.  The Court
will issue the order proposed by Plaintiff upon completion of the hearing.  
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
