And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for attorneys' fees brought by defendants Albert N. Amador, Jr., Margaret Amador, Danielle Whitney Moore, and Keller Williams Realty L.A. Harbor. The motion was filed in connection with the defendants' anti-SLAPP motion, which was filed in response to plaintiff Jacqueline Monique Rivera's claims for quiet title and related claims arising out of the sale of the subject property.

The Judge found that the defendants adequately established that the lawsuit against them is based on protected activity, and therefore shifted the burden to the plaintiff to show a probability of success on the merits. Since the plaintiff did not oppose the original anti-SLAPP motion, the Judge determined that the plaintiff failed to meet this burden and granted the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees in the amount of $20,700.34.

The Judge also ordered defendants to give notice and provided instructions for parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling, as well as those who do not plan to submit.
