And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiffs to amend their complaint to add a claim for retaliatory eviction. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiffs delayed in filing the motion and that the proposed amended complaint does not relate back to the original complaint. The judge notes that the court has discretion to grant or deny the motion and that judicial policy favors resolution of all disputes between the parties. The judge concludes that the motion for leave to amend is granted, as the delay in filing the motion has caused minimal prejudice to the defendant and the prejudice can be cured through a brief trial continuance. The judge also notes that the relation-back issue is not a material concern in this case, as the defendant has not argued that the claim would be barred by the statute of limitations.
