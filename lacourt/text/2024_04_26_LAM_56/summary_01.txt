  - Although Defendant claims that he works from home and rarely comes to the office, this is insufficient to show that this was not Defendant's "dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address."

And here is the English text summarizing the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Andrei Serpik's motion to quash service of summons. The Court finds that the proof of service by registered process server Behrouz Sarbarziha is sufficient to establish the presumption that service was proper as to Defendant. The Court also finds that Defendant fails to rebut the presumption as he does not provide any evidence establishing that 6100 Center Dr. Ste 1100 Los Angeles, California 90045 is not his address or place of business. The Court declines to rule on Plaintiff's evidentiary objections as Plaintiff failed to file them separately. The Court denies Defendant's motion to quash and orders Plaintiff Paula M. Heil to give notice of this ruling.
