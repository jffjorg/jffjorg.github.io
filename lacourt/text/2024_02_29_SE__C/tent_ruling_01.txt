K&M MEAT COMPANY, INC. 
CASE NO.:  20STCV22420
HEARING:  02/29/24
 
#1
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce Settlement is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
Opposing Party to give Notice. 
 
On July 26, 2023, Defendant K&M MEAT COMPANY, INC. (“Defendant”)
delivered a CCP §998 Offer to Compromise (“Offer”) for $60,000.00 to Plaintiff
BERNARDO SCHAFFER (“Plaintiff”). (Quincey Decl., ¶2.) On August 16, 2023,
Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s CCP §998 Offer. (Id. ¶3.) On August 22, 2023,
Plaintiff filed his written acceptance of Defendant’s CCP §998 Offer. (“Acceptance”)
(Id. ¶4.) On August 25, 2024, this Court granted Defendant’s pending Motion for
Reconsideration of its Motion for Summary Judgment and its Motion for Summary
Judgment. (Id. ¶5.) On August 28, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff by email its
withdrawal and revocation of its Offer. 
 
In Opposition, Defendant argues that its Offer was never
accepted because Plaintiff failed to satisfy the conditions stated therein. 
 
The Terms of the Agreement can be summarized as follows:
Defendant agrees to pay Plaintiff $60,000.00 in exchange for a dismissal with
prejudice of the Complaint as to K&M Meat Company, Inc., Felix Goldberg
Trustee of the Felix Goldberg Trust, and Felix Goldberg; each party shall bear
their own fees and costs; Plaintiff will satisfy any and all liens out of the
proceeds paid to him, including the workers’ compensation lien asserted by
Falls Lake Fire and Casualty Company, Plaintiff will provide proof to Defendant
that any workers’ compensation, MediCal or Medicare liens have been satisfied;
Plaintiff will release Defendants from and against any claims now asserted or
alleged in the instant action or damages arising out of the claims now asserted
or alleged in the instant action, etc. (See e.g. Quincey Decl., ¶1, Ex. A.) 
 
“Section 998, subdivision (b)(2) states that the offer must
be accepted within 30 days or it is deemed withdrawn….” (Gray v. Stewart
(2202) 97 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1398.) Here, Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s Offer
within 30 days. The Court has reviewed the terms of the Offer and finds that
any such conditions stated therein are not expressly termed as conditions for
acceptance. Rather, as argued by Plaintiff, the conditions cited by Defendant
in support of their Opposition are terms of the Offer which Plaintiff must
satisfy after acceptance. The Offer constitutes a fully executed Settlement
Agreement between the parties. To date, no notice of Settlement has been filed
with the Court. 
 
Defendant additionally argues that Plaintiff did not fulfill
his obligations under the Agreement to warrant enforcement at this time.
Specifically, Defendant contends that Plaintiff still has not dismissed this
action and released K&M and Mr. Goldberg. 
 
Under CCP §664.6, “If parties to a pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Id.) “The court retains jurisdiction to enforce a settlement
under the statute even after a dismissal, but only if the parties requested
such retention of jurisdiction before the dismissal. Such a request may be made
either in a writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.” (Hines
v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.) Here, although there is no 664.6
clause in the Agreement, no Notice of Settlement was ever filed, and no
dismissal was ever entered. Therefore, the Court never lost jurisdiction over
this case, and can properly grant relief under 664.6. 
 
Although a judge hearing a section 664.6 motion may receive
evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter the terms of a settlement
agreement as a judgment, nothing in section 664.6 authorizes a judge to create
the material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the
parties themselves have previously agreed upon. (Weddington Productions,
Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793,810.) A settlement agreement is
interpreted according to the same principles as any other written agreement (Leeman
v. Adams Extract & Spice, LLC (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1374.) It
must be interpreted to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties as it
existed at the time, insofar as that intent can be ascertained and is lawful. (Id.)
Pursuant to CCP §664.6, the Court has authority to enforce the terms of a
settlement agreement only when the agreement is sufficiently definitive to
enable the trial court to give it an exact meaning. (Weddington v. Flick
(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 812.) 
 
The Agreement states that Defendant offers to compromise the
pending action as to Plaintiff for the sum of $60,000.00 in exchange for a
dismissal with prejudice of the Complaint as to K&M Meat Company, Inc.
Felix Goldbert Trustee of the Felix Goldbert Trust, and Felix Goldberg. The
Agreement is silent as to whether payment of $60,000 or a dismissal with
prejudice is to occur first. 
 
The Motion is DENIED without prejudice. Neither party has substantially
performed under the terms of the Settlement Agreement.
