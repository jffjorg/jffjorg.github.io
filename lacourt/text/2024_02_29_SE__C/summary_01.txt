```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement without prejudice. The agreement was a compromise between the parties, where the defendant offered $60,000.00 in exchange for a dismissal with prejudice of the complaint. The plaintiff accepted the offer, but the defendant later withdrew and revoked it. The judge found that the parties had not substantially performed under the terms of the settlement agreement, and therefore, the motion was denied. The judge also noted that the parties did not request retention of jurisdiction over the case, which would have allowed the court to enforce the settlement even after a dismissal.
