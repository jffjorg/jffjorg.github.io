Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the ex parte application of PHILADELPHIA INDEMNITY INSURANCE COMPANY to appoint a discovery referee to preside over oral depositions and resolve outstanding discovery conflicts. The judge also grants the motion to continue the trial date from March 11, 2024 to March 26, 2024 due to the need for additional discovery and the preferential trial setting.

The judge finds that a majority of the factors favoring reference are present, including the preferential trial setting, the number of depositions remaining, and the need for a discovery referee to address improper conduct during depositions.

The judge orders the parties to meet and confer to agree on a stipulated discovery referee and to prepare a stipulated formal order for the Court. If the parties cannot agree, each side must submit a list of three potential referees and the Court will appoint one.

The judge also orders that the referee's fees will be borne equally by the parties, pending the report and recommendation as to which party should be responsible for those fees.
