Defendant’s unopposed Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition is GRANTED.

 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of February 26, 2024. 
 
Trial is set for February 4, 2025. Plaintiff CARMEN MADRID is ORDERED to appear for a deposition by
no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the issuance of this Order. The
date may be extended by agreement of the parties. 
 
A party may obtain discovery by taking oral depositions. (CCP
§2025.010.) CCP §2025.450, which governs motions to compel deposition, provides
that “[i]f, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action…without
having served a valid objection under §2025.410, fails to appear for
examination…the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the
deponent’s attendance and testimony.” (CCP §2025.450(a).) 
 
This Motion is unopposed. 
 
The Court finds that Defendant adequately complied with the meet and
confer requirement. 
 
The motion is GRANTED. Defendant is entitled to take Plaintiff’s
deposition, and Plaintiff does not substantively oppose being deposed. 
 
If [the] motion is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction…in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP
§2025.450(g)(2).) 
 
Reasonable sanctions in favor of Defendant are granted as requested as
follows: Plaintiff and their counsel are ORDERED to pay Defendant and his
counsel of record reasonable sanctions in the amount of $1,000.00 no later than 30 days from the date of the Court’s
issuance of this Order. This date may be extended by agreement of the
parties.
