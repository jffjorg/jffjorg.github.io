And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the motion for distribution of funds to Thursday, March 7, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. The moving parties (AAA Solar Electric, Inc., Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company, and Safety National Casualty Corp.) have filed a supplemental reply indicating that the judgment has been paid in full and actually overpaid by the moving parties. The court is not inclined to order the plaintiff (WNG Construction JV, Inc.) to execute and file a full acknowledgement and satisfaction of judgment. Instead, the court is giving the parties an opportunity to informally resolve the remaining issues without court intervention or permitting WNG to respond to the arguments/issues raised in the supplemental reply with respect to any potential overpayment by the moving parties and the release of Swiss with respect to the bond. WNG may file a supplemental opposition, limited to these issues, by no later than Tuesday, March 5, 2024.
