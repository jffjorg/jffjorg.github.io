The

after this Motion was filed, the Judgment has been paid in full, and has
actually been overpaid by the Moving Parties. 
 
This

opportunity to informally resolve the remaining issues without Court
intervention, and/or to permit Plaintiff WNG CONSTRUCTION JV, INC. (“WNG”) the
opportunity to respond to the arguments/issues raised in the Supplemental Reply
with respect to any potential overpayment by the Moving Parties and the release
of Swiss with respect to the bond. WNG may file a Supplemental Opposition,
limited to these issues, by no later than Tuesday, March 5, 2024.

Court is not inclined to order WNG to execute and file a full acknowledgement
and satisfaction of Judgment. This request should be made separately via
regularly noticed motion.
