And here is a summary in English text:

The Honorable Olivia Rosales has issued a tentative ruling in the case of C ORTIZ v. SOLIMAN (Case No. 23NWCV00392). The Plaintiff has moved to strike the Defendant's Answer to the Complaint. However, the Defendant filed a First Amended Answer on February 13, 2024, which makes the Motion to Strike moot. The deadline for the Defendant's Opposition to the Motion to Strike was February 15, 2024, but it was not filed. Therefore, the Motion to Strike is placed OFF-CALENDAR as MOOT, and the opposing party is notified.
