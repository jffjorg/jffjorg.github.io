In this tentative ruling, the Court grants Plaintiff C. Thorn's unopposed motion to set aside the default judgment entered against Defendant Donald Alfred Plonowski, individually and as Trustee of the Donald and Carolyn Plonowski Family Trust, on April 17, 2023. The Plaintiff's counsel discovered additional defendants after default was entered and cannot file an amended complaint while the default is pending. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has shown adequate grounds to allow them to amend the pleading to add additional defendants to the action, citing the liberality associated with Motions to Set Aside Defaults and the policy of hearing cases on their merits. The Court orders the Plaintiff to file the Proposed First Amended Complaint within five court days and serve it within 30 days of the date that the First Amended Complaint is filed.
