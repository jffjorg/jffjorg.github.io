And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Geraldine Angel, filed a complaint against the defendant, Genevieve Angel Dial, alleging a prolonged pattern of repeated and malicious conduct. However, the plaintiff's complaint did not contain a specific statement of damages, which is a requirement under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11. Additionally, the default was improperly entered before the plaintiff served the statement of damages, which is also a violation of the code. Furthermore, the defendant's answer is a nullity because she did not move to set aside the default before filing her answer. Therefore, the court cannot grant the plaintiff's request for default judgment in the amount of $258,170.26.
