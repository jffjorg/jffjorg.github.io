ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“The relief
granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in
the complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11, or in the statement
provided for by Section 425.115; but in any other case, the court may grant the
plaintiff any relief consistent with the case made by the complaint and
embraced within the issue. The court may impose liability, regardless of
whether the theory upon which liability is sought to be imposed involves legal
or equitable principles.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a).)
 
“When a complaint
is filed in an action to recover damages for personal injury or wrongful death,
the defendant may at any time request a statement setting forth the nature and
amount of damages being sought. The request shall be served upon the plaintiff,
who shall serve a responsive statement as to the damages within 15 days. In the
event that a response is not served, the defendant, on notice to the plaintiff,
may petition the court in which the action is pending to order the plaintiff to
serve a responsive statement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11, subd. (b).)
 
“If no request is
made for the statement referred to in subdivision (b), the plaintiff shall
serve the statement on the defendant before a default may be taken.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 425.11, subd. (c).)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
There appear to be three issues here. 
 
First, Plaintiff’s Complaint does not contain
any specific statement of damages. Furthermore, Plaintiff moved for entry of
default before serving her CIV-050, Statement of Damages on Defendant.
Together, this violated Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11, subdivision
(c). Thus, default was improperly entered on November 27, 2023. 
 
Second, although default was improperly
entered on November 27, 2023, Defendant did not move to set aside and/or vacate
the default. Instead, Defendant filed her Answer, even though the entry of
default terminated her right to do so until the default had been set aside or
default judgment entered. (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984)
155 Cal.Ap.3d 381, 385–386, citations omitted.) Thus, Defendant’s Answer is a
nullity. 
 
Finally, Plaintiff requests default judgment
in the amount of $258,170.26. However, the Court cannot grant default judgment
when: (1) default was improperly entered; and (2) the statement of damages was
served after default was entered. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Default Judgment is
DENIED without prejudice.
