The judge found that Lynda Patrick has a substantial interest in the action and that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The judge also advanced the hearing on defendant 29350 LLC's motion for summary judgment to February 10, 2025, to ensure that both sides have a timely opportunity to present their case. The trial date is now set for March 11, 2025.
