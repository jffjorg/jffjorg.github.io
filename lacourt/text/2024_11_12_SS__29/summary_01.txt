And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendants' motion for an order directing nonparty witness Rockpoint Funding, LLC to comply with a deposition subpoena. The motion is denied as untimely, as it was not filed within the 15-day deadline before the trial date. Even if the Court were to disregard the procedural defects, the motion would still be denied due to a lack of diligence by the Defendants in seeking this discovery. The request for monetary sanctions by Rockpoint is also denied, as the Court finds that the Defendants did not act in bad faith or without substantial justification. The Court notes that the deposition subpoena was issued on September 5, 2024, and served on September 10, 2024, and that the parties have been aware of the discovery deadlines and the need to file motions in a timely manner.
