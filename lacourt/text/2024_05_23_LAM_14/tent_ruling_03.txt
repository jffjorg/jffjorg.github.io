the alleged wrongful termination of Plaintiff by Defendants.

            Trial is
not yet set.

            Attorney Annie M. Ellis now applies
on behalf of attorney Sydnie A. Shimkus to appear as counsel pro hac vice for
Defendants. 
 
Decision
 
             The application is granted.  
 
Discussion 
Ms. Shimkus attests to her
residence address and her office address, which are both in Texas.
(Verified Application ¶ 2.) She attests to all the
courts she has been admitted to (with dates of admission) and that she is in
good standing with the State Bar of Texas and not currently suspended or
disbarred from practice in any court. (Id. at ¶¶ 3-4; Notice of Errata
Ex. “A.”) Ms. Shimkus submits the name and address of the active California
State Bar member with whom the applicant is associated. (Id. at ¶ 1.) She
also attests to the title of each court and action in which she has
appeared pro hac vice in California in the preceding two years. (Id. at
¶ 5.) Further, the requisite fee was sent to the State Bar of California, and
the Notice of Hearing and the instant application were served on all interested
parties and on the State Bar of California. (Id. at ¶ 6; POS.)
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Ms. Shimkus establishes that she satisfied
the requirements to appear as counsel
pro hac vice pursuant to CRC, Rule 9.40.

Accordingly, the application is
GRANTED.
