And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion for attorney fees in the reduced amount of $48,301.00. The court finds that the hourly rate of Counsel Murphy is excessive and reduces it to $550 per hour. The court also finds that the hours worked by Counsel Murphy are reasonable. The court denies the request for a lodestar multiplier of 1.25. The court concludes that Plaintiffs are entitled to attorney fees and costs in this action.
