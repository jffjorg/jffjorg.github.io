  Case Number:  22STCV35313    Hearing Date:   May 23, 2024    Dept:  14 Lopez v. Barker ManagementRelevant Case Background
 
Plaintiffs in case no. 22 STCV
35313 submitted an application to rent an apartment at a complex managed by
Defendant. As part of the application process, they agreed to allow Defendant
to run a credit check. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant used the information
provided to perform a complete background and general character investigation,
and that Defendants failed to provide Plaintiffs with the results of the
investigation, in violation of a state statute known as the Investigative
Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (“ICRAA”).
 
On November 4, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed their Complaint for (1) Violations of ICRAA, (2) Invasion of Privacy, and
(3) Declaratory Relief against Defendants Barker Management, Inc. (“Barker”)
and DOES 1-10.
 
On November 21, 2023, this court
consolidated the instant action with case nos. 23 STCV 02018, 23 STCV 02225, 23
STCV 02517, 23 STCV 03307, 23 STCV 03800, and 23 STCV 04467, for all purposes.
To avoid confusion, the procedural history in these consolidates cases are not
included herein. 
 
            On November
22, 2023, Barker filed its answer to the complaint in the instant action.
 
            On December
5, 2023, this court granted the motion for summary adjudication filed by
Plaintiffs in the instant action on the first cause of action for violations of
ICRAA.
 
            On February
7, 2024, Barker “served an offer to compromise for $12,500 as each of the
Plaintiffs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 998 and offered to pay
Plaintiffs’ statutory costs, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred to
the date of the offer,” which was accepted by Plaintiffs on March 12, 2024.
(Murphy Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. 1.) 
 
            On March
25, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Memorandum of Costs requesting, $1,383.74 in costs
and stated that the request for attorney fees would be made by a noticed
motion. Defendant did not file a motion to tax costs in response to this
filing. 
 
            On April
29, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion for attorney fees pursuant to Civil
Code, § 1786.50(a)(2) and Barker’s offer to compromise. 
 
Trial is remains set for December
16, 2024 in this action and the other consolidated actions.
 
Instant Motion
 
Plaintiffs now moves this court, per Civil Code § 1786.50(a)(2) and
Barker’s offer to compromise, to award them attorney fees in the amount of
$77,460.50, consisting of $56,622.50 in attorney fees, $5,346.00 in paralegal
fees, and a multiplier of 1.25, i.e. $15,492.00. Additionally, Plaintiffs seek
the court to approve costs in the amount of $1,383.74.
 
Decision
 
The motion is GRANTED in the reduced amount of to $48,301.00.
Also, because Barker did not file a motion to tax costs, the costs identified
in Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Costs are unchallenged. Thus, Plaintiffs are
permitted to recover $1,383.74, in addition to the awarded attorney fees. 
 
 
Evidentiary
Objections
 
            Plaintiffs object to the supplement
filings submitted by Barker on May 15, 2024. This court sustains these
objections on the ground that the they were untimely filed three days beyond
the statutory deadline set forth under Code of Civil Procedure § 1005, and
Plaintiffs have been prejudiced as a result because they are unable to
meaningfully respond to the additional arguments and evidence presented in
Barker’s supplemental filings. 
 
Governing
Standard/Statute
 
            Generally, each party bears his or her own
attorney fees. (Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society
(1975) 421 U.S. 240, 247.) Moreover, "[i]t is well settled that a party is
not entitled to attorney fees except where authorized by statute or by
contract." (Anger v. Borden (1951) 38 Cal. 2d 136, 145; Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10); see also Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1717
[attorney’s fees authorized where provided for in contract between parties]. 
 
            Civil Code §
1786.50(a)(2) states that in any action brought under ICRAA, a successful plaintiff
is due “the costs of any action together with reasonable attorney’s fees as
determined by the court.”  
 
Discussion 
 
            As a
preliminary matter, it is undisputed that Plaintiffs are the prevailing party
in this matter because they prevailed on the first cause of action for
violation under ICRAA. Additionally, based on Barker’s offer to compromise, it
agreed to pay Plaintiffs’ attorney fees. (See Murphy Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. 1.) Thus,
the only issue before this court is whether the requested attorney fees are
reasonable. 
 
            Reasonableness
of Attorney Fees
 
            Here,
Plaintiffs seeks attorney fees in the
amount of $77,460.50, consisting of $56,622.50 in attorney fees, $5,346.00 in
paralegal fees, and a multiplier of 1.25, i.e. $15,492.00.
 
The fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. A
computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award. The
lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors
specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the
legal services provided. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25,
49.)¿Such an approach anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective
determination of the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount
awarded is not arbitrary. (Id. at 48, n.23.) After the trial court has
performed the lodestar calculations, it shall consider whether the total award
so calculated under all of the circumstances of the case is more than a
reasonable amount and, if so, shall reduce the award so that it is a reasonable
figure.¿(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-96.)¿ 
 
The factors considered in
determining the modification of the lodestar include the nature and difficulty
of the litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill required and
employed to handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure, and
other circumstances in the case. (EnPalm, LLC v. Teitler Family Trust
(2008) 162 Cal. App. 4th 770, 774 (emphasis in original).) A negative modifier
was appropriate when duplicative work had been performed. (Thayer v. Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.) 
 
A.   
Reasonableness of Hourly Rate
 
Here, Plaintiffs’ counsel, Glenn A.
Murphy attests that his hourly rate is $725 and that he has been practicing law
since 2008 as the founder of Litigation Advocacy Group with a focus on civil
rights, mass torts, and complex civil litigation. (Murphy Decl. ¶¶ 2-4.)
Additionally, Counsel Murphy attests that his prior hourly billing rate of $650
was approved as reasonable and contends that his rates are far below what other
attorney’s charge at large firms. (Id. at ¶¶ 7-8, Exh. 3.) Furthermore,
Counsel Murphy relies on the metric provided by the 2014 National Law Journal
Billing Survey and the 2023 Real Rate Report that his rates are reasonable. (Id.
at ¶¶ 9-11, Exhs. 4-5.) Also, Counsel Murphy attests that his paralegal’s
hourly rate is $220. (Id. at ¶ 4.) 
 
While this court does not take
issue with the paralegal’s hourly rate, it does find that Counsel Murphy’s rate
is excessive. In determining whether Counsel Murphy’s rate is reasonable, the
court examines “[The rate] prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PCLM
Group, supra, 22 Cal.4th at 1095.) In this regard, Counsel Murphy’s
reliance on what the hourly rates charged by large firms in Los Angeles and the
data presented in the 2014 National Law Journal Billing Survey and the 2023
Real Rate Report are unpersuasive because they do not reflect the prevailing
rates in the Los Angeles community for ICRAA litigation. While other superior
courts have approved Counsel Murphy’s rates in the past, this court is not
bound by those decisions. Thus, the Court determines that a fee rate of $550
per hour is reasonable based on Counsel Murphy’s years of practice and the
nature of this litigation.
Accordingly, because this court
does not find Counsel Murphy’s hourly rate of $725 to be reasonable, it is
reduced to $550. The hourly rate of $220 for his paralegal is deemed
reasonable. 
 
B.   
Reasonableness of Hours Worked
 
Counsel Murphy attests that he
expended 78.1 hours and that his paralegal expended 24.3 hours in prosecuting
this case. (Murphy Decl. ¶¶ 13; Exh. 6.) He assert that these hours were
necessary because Barker contested several issues that were necessary to
substantiate Plaintiffs’ claim for violation of the ICRAA. (Id. at ¶¶
13-14.)
 
In opposition, Barker argues that
the hours expended by Counsel Murphy are not reasonable for several reasons. The
court shall address each in turn. 
 
1.    
Duplicative Work
 
First, it argues that Counsel
Murphy has he engaged in overlitigation and in excessive, duplicative billing.
In this regard, Barker asserts that the hours billed for the summary
adjudication motion amount to duplicative billing because the same issue had
been address in similar motions in other related cases. (Opposition at pp.
5-6.) Additionally, Barker points out that the submitted time-entries include
an entry of .5 hours is not properly billed to this action because it pertains
to a related case. (Id. at pg. 6; Hawatmeh Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, 9-10.) Also,
Barker points to many time-entries over the course of this action that also
applied to identical work performed in related actions. (Id. at pp.
6-7.) In this regard, between Counsel Murphy and his paralegal, Barker contends
that they have included 10.3 hours in duplicative work. 
 
In reply, Plaintiffs argue that the
purported duplicative work was reasonable and the time entries represent the
actual time it took to complete the work. (Reply at pp. 6-8.) 
 
While it is appropriate to reduce
work based on duplicative or inefficient work (Morris v. Hyundai Motor America¿(2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 38), this court
disagrees that the time-entries identified by Barker are based on duplicative
work. While the work conducted by Counsel Murphy across the various related
actions are bound to be similar, it is evident from the billing records that
the repetition of work across these actions are not duplicative. The fact that
Counsel Murphy has recorded such low time entries for such tasks supports this
conclusion. 
 
Accordingly, the Court declines to reduce the hours expended because the
work performed is not duplicative. 
 
2.    
Incivility
 
Next, Barker argues that the requested attorney fees should be reduced
because Counsel Murphy has been personally invested in litigation this matter
in order to incur further legal. fees(Opposition at pg. 8, relying on Karton
v. Ari Design & Construction, Inc. (2021) 6 Cal.App.5th 734.) Barker
asserts that Counsel Murphy has acted in an unprofessional and uncivil manner
throughout this litigation in order to over-litigate this action. (Ibid.;
Hawatmeh Decl. ¶ 11.)
 
In reply, Plaintiffs argues that
Barker’s reliance on Karton is misplaced because it is distinguishable
from the present action. (Reply at pp. 9-10.) In Karton, the personal
embroilment concerned a self-represented attorney who was litigating a case
involving his own house. (Karton, supra, 61 Cal.App.5th at pg.
740.) Whereas in this case, Plaintiffs argue that Counsel Murphy does not have
a personal state in this action. (Id. at pg. 10.) Additionally,
Plaintiffs argue that any instance of incivility was attributable to the
defense. (Id. at pp. 8-9.)
 
While Counsel Murphy may have a
personal incentive to litigate this action due to the statutory attorney fees
provision of the ICRAA, suggesting that this incentive warrants a finding of
personal embroilment would lead to unwanted results. After all, it would
inhibit plaintiffs attorneys from zealously advocating for their clients, who
would normally be unable to afford an attorney to vindicate their rights. This
would be contrary to the legislative intent behind such statutory attorney fee
provisions. (See Reynolds v. Ford Motor Company (2000) 47 Cal.App.5th
1105, 1111-1112 [“our Legislature has provided injured consumers strong
encouragement to seek legal redress in a situation in which a lawsuit might not
otherwise have been economically feasible.”].) Additionally, this court
admonishes the parties for any uncivil conduct that may be occurring. 
 
Accordingly, the court declines to
reduce the lodestar award based on the claim of personal embroilment or
incivility. 
 
3.    
Requested
Fees are Disproportionate to the Recovery Obtained
 
Lastly, Barker argues that the
requested lodestar award should be reduced because the amount of fees requested
is disproportionate to the recovery obtained. (Opposition at pp. 8-9.) However,
this argument is not persuasive because, in cases involving a fee-shifting
statute, attorney fees are tied to the actual work performed and not to the
amount of recovery. (See Drouin v. Fleetwood Ent., Inc. (1985) 163
Cal.App.3d 486, 493; Civ. Code, § 1786.50(a).) Therefore, this argument is
rejected. 
 
Accordingly, based on the reduced
rates stated above and the actually hours worked, the lodestar award amounts to
$48,301.00.
 
C.   
Request for Lodestar Multiplier
 
Relevant factors to determine
whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1) the novelty and difficulty of
the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.¿(Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)¿ 
 
Here, Plaintiffs argue that a
lodestar multiplier of 1.25 is appropriate because the questions presented in
this action were novel and difficult, required the need for high-level skill,
and representation was taken on a contingent basis. (Motion at pp. 11-14.)
 
However, under the circumstances,
this court finds that a multiplier is not warranted for the following reasons.
First, the risk due to contingent nature of representation was largely
mitigated by the statutory right to attorneys’ fees in ICRAA causes of
action. Second, while Plaintiffs obtained a slight premium on the civil
penalty on their ICRAA violations claim, Plaintiffs failed to obtain punitive
damages, or to succeed on their invasion of privacy cause of action, mitigating
the extraordinary nature of Plaintiffs’ eventual award. The extra $2,500 each
plaintiff received does not represent extraordinary skills that would justify a
multiplier. 
 
Accordingly, the request for a
lodestar multiplier is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, this court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled the
attorney fees in this action. Even though this court finds that the hours
performed by Counsel Murphy are reasonable, his hourly rate is excessive based
on the nature of this case. Therefore, based on the reduced rates stated above
and the actual hours worked, the lodestar award amounts to $48,301.00.
Furthermore, the nature of this case does not warranted the requested
multiplier of 1.25.
 
The motion is GRANTED in the
reduced amount of to $48,301.00. Also, because Barker did not file
a motion to tax costs, the costs identified in Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Costs
are unchallenged. Thus, they are permitted to recover $1,383.74, in addition to
the awarded attorney fees.
