And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication of the defendants' first affirmative defenses. The defendants claimed that the transfer of 16% interest in the Las Flores Property was made in good faith, but the judge finds that the plaintiff has satisfied its burden of showing that the defendants cannot establish the elements of the good faith transferee defense. The judge notes that the defendants' attempts to reverse prior admissions and create a triable issue of fact are impermissible, and that the admission of facts contrary to prior testimony does not constitute substantial evidence of the existence of a triable issue of fact. The judge also declines to consider the defendants' "Amended and Corrected Response[s]" to the plaintiff's request for admission of facts, as they were served without leave of court. As a result, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication as to the defendants' first affirmative defenses.
