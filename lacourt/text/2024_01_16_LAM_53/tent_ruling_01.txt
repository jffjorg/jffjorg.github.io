[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
petition to approve compromise of claim on
  behalf of minor claimant fatima guadalupe garcia diaz
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff and petitioner
Graciela Diaz    
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Petition to Approve Compromise of Claim on
Behalf of Minor Claimant Fatima Guadalupe Garcia Diaz
The court considered the moving papers filed in connection with this petition.  No opposition papers were filed.  
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs
filed the operative Third Amended Complaint in this action on July 31, 2023,
alleging four causes of action for (1) breach of the implied warranty of
habitability, (2) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, (3) negligence,
and (4) violation of Civil Code section 1942.4 against defendant Uranus LLC
(“Defendant”). 
Plaintiff
and petitioner Graciela Diaz (“Petitioner”) seeks court approval of the
settlement made on behalf of minor claimant Fatima Guadalupe Garcia Diaz.  Defendant has agreed to pay a total of
$225,000 to settle this action, of which $2,500.01 is allocated to minor
claimant.  (Pet., MC-350, ¶¶ 10-11;
Pet., MC-350, Attachment 11.)  Of the
$2,500.01 allocated to the minor claimant, $559.11 will be paid to counsel for
attorney’s fees and $263.56 will be paid for legal costs.  (Pet., MC-350, ¶¶ 13, 16.)  The remaining $1,677.34 will be deposited
into a blocked account with Pacific Premier Bank, subject to withdrawal only on
authorization of the court.  (Pet.,
MC-350, ¶¶ 10, 16, 18, subd. (b)(1).) 
LEGAL STANDARD
The
compromise of a minor’s disputed claim for damages is valid only after it has
been approved, upon the filing of a petition, by the court.¿ (Prob. Code, §
3500.)¿ The petition must be verified by the petitioner, must contain a full
disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise, and must be prepared on judicial council form MC-350.¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿ 
DISCUSSION
The
court has reviewed the petition and finds the settlement to be fair and
reasonable, and in the best interests of minor claimant Fatima Guadalupe Garcia
Diaz. 
The
court finds that the declaration of Christofer Chapman is sufficient to support
the the $559.11 (representing approximately 25 percent of the $2,500.01
settlement) request for attorney’s fees. 
The
court therefore grants plaintiff and petitioner Graciela Diaz’s petition
to approve the compromise of claim on behalf of minor claimant Fatima Guadalupe
Garcia Diaz. 
The court sets an Order to
Show Cause re: filing Receipt and Acknowledgement of Order for the Deposit of
Money into Blocked Account for hearing on April 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., in
Department 53. 
The court orders plaintiff and
petitioner Graciela Diaz to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  January 16, 2024
