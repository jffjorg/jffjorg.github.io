Motion

The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with each
motion.
 
MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION AND
ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENT PRODUCTION OF PLAINTIFF CATALINA HARB
Defendant Hyundai Motor America (“Defendant”) moves the court for an
order compelling plaintiff Catalina Harb (“C. Harb”) to appear for deposition
and to produce the documents described in the Amended Notice of Deposition at
deposition. 
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . .
fails to appear for examination . . ., the party giving the notice may move for
an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
First, the court grants Defendant’s motion to compel plaintiff C. Harb
to appear for and testify at a deposition to be taken by Defendant’s
counsel.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
Defendant served C. Harb with its Amended Notice of Deposition on
April 11, 2023, noticing the deposition of C. Harb for April 25, 2023.  (Aliviado Decl., Ex. C, PDF p. 88 [Amended
Notice of Deposition as to plaintiff C. Harb].) 
Thereafter, on April 21, 2023, C. Harb served objections to the Amended Notice
of Deposition and stated that C. Harb was unavailable on that date.  (Aliviado Decl., ¶ 11; Aliviado Decl., Ex. D,
PDF pp. 109-134 [C. Harb’s objections].) 
However, counsel did not provide the dates on which C. Harb would be
available for deposition until December 20, 2023, nearly eight months after
Defendant noticed the deposition and after the pending motion was filed.  (Aliviado Decl., ¶¶ 12-13, 15; Stoliker
Decl., ¶ 7 [counsel for plaintiffs provided three dates for deposition on
December 20, 2023, by email].)  
Thus, the court finds that Defendant has shown good cause to order C.
Harb to appear for and testify at deposition.
Second, the court denies Defendant’s motion to compel plaintiff C.
Harb to produce at deposition the documents described in the Amended Notice of
Deposition because (1) Defendant did not file a separate statement providing
“all the information necessary to understand each discovery request” at issue
in the Amended Notice of Deposition, and (2) Defendant did not “set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the production of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.”  (Cal. Rules of Ct.,
rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(5) [“The motions that require a separate statement include
a motion: [¶¶] (5) To compel . . . the production of documents or tangible
things at a deposition”]; Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1).) 
MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION AND
ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENT PRODUCTION OF PLAINTIFF SOLEI HARB
Defendant moves the court for an order compelling plaintiff Solei Harb
(“S. Harb”) to appear for deposition and to produce the documents described in
the Amended Notice of Deposition at deposition.
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . .
fails to appear for examination . . ., the party giving the notice may move for
an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
First, the court grants Defendant’s motion to compel plaintiff S. Harb
to appear for and testify at a deposition to be taken by Defendant’s
counsel.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
            Defendant served on S. Harb its
Amended Notice of Deposition on April 11, 2023, noticing S. Harb’s deposition
for April 25, 2023.  (Aliviado Decl., Ex.
C, PDF p. 98 [Amended Notice of Deposition as to plaintiff S. Harb].)  Thereafter, S. Harb served objections to the
Amended Notice of Deposition, stating that S. Harb and/or counsel for S. Harb were
unavailable on the noticed date. 
(Aliviado Decl., Ex. D, PDF pp. 136-161 [S. Harb’s objections].)  Although counsel for S. Harb provided dates
for deposition, counsel did not do so until December 20, 2023, approximately
eight months after S. Harb’s deposition was noticed and after this motion was
filed.  (Stoliker Decl., ¶ 7
[counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel with three dates on which S. Harb would be
available for deposition on December 20, 2023].)  
Thus, the court finds that Defendant has shown good cause to order S.
Harb to appear for and testify at deposition.
Second, the court denies Defendant’s motion to compel plaintiff S.
Harb to produce at deposition the documents described in the Amended Notice of
Deposition because (1) Defendant did not file a separate statement providing
“all the information necessary to understand each discovery request” at issue
in the Amended Notice of Deposition, and (2) Defendant did not “set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the production of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.”  (Cal. Rules of Ct.,
rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(5); Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1).)
