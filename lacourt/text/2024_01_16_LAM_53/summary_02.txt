And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part defendant Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel deposition and accompanying document production of plaintiff Catalina Harb and plaintiff Solei Harb. The judge orders each plaintiff to appear for and testify at a deposition to be taken by defendant's counsel, to be conducted by a videoconference platform selected by defendant, within 15 days of the date of this order. The judge also denies defendant's motion to compel document production because defendant did not file a separate statement providing information necessary to understand each discovery request and did not provide specific facts showing good cause for document production. The judge orders defendant to give notice of this ruling.
