[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
motion to be relieved as counsel for
  popchest, inc.



 
MOVING PARTY:                Al Mohajerian              
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Popchest, Inc.
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Al Mohajerian (“Counsel”)
moves to be relieved as counsel of record for Popchest, Inc. (“Popchest”).[1] 
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For
a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284,
subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice
of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on
the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-053)).¿ 
The court
finds that Counsel has not complied with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362.  Although Counsel filed, on
December 27, 2023, the notice of motion and motion directed to Popchest on Judicial Council form MC-051, Counsel
did not file (1) a declaration made on the mandatory “Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel” form (Judicial Council form MC-052),
or (2) a proposed “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel –
Civil,” made on Judicial Council form MC-053. 
(Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1362, subds. (c), (e).)  Further, although Counsel has filed a proof
of service of the supporting declaration (which was not made on the Judicial
Council Form) on Popchest, the proof of service
does not state that the “Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
– Civil” was served on Popchest.  (MC-051, Ex. A, p. 2.)  Counsel also did not submit (1) a declaration
on the proper form stating that the service address for Popchest is current, or (2) a proof of service
showing that all other parties who have appeared in this action were served
with the pending motion.  (Cal. Rules of
Ct., rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
The court
exercises its discretion to continue the hearing on Counsel’s motion to be
relieved as counsel for Popchest in order to give Counsel
an opportunity to file all the papers required by California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362.  
The court
orders that the hearing on Al Mohajerian’s motion to be relieved as counsel for
Popchest, Inc. is continued to February 28, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department
53. 
The court
orders Al Mohajerian (1) to serve on Popchest, Inc., and all other parties who
have appeared in this action, the “Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel – Civil” filed with the court on December 27, 2023, (2) to file with
the court and to serve on Popchest, Inc., and all other parties who have
appeared in this action, a declaration in support of this motion made on the mandatory
“Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel” form (Judicial
Council form MC-052), (3) to file with the court and to serve on Popchest, Inc.,
and all other parties who have appeared in this action, a completed
proposed order relieving counsel, prepared on the mandatory “Order Granting
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel” form (Judicial Council form
MC-053), and (4) to file with the court a proof of service of (i) the “Notice
of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” (MC-051), (ii) the
“Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel”
(MC-052), (iii) the “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel,” (MC-053), and (iv) a notice of this ruling, on Popchest, Inc. and all other
parties who have appeared in this action, by no later than January 26, 2024.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  January 16, 2024
