```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to declare the Defendant's 998 Offer invalid. The 998 Offer, which was made by the Defendant, stated that the Defendant would pay $22,736.02 in damages, plus incidental and consequential damages, if the Plaintiff accepted the offer. The Plaintiff rejected the offer and then was awarded $10,882.47 in damages by the jury. The Plaintiff argued that the 998 Offer was invalid because it was not sufficiently specific, but the judge found that the language of the offer was adequate because it allowed the Plaintiff to evaluate the worth of the offer. The judge also distinguished this case from the case of Duff v. Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC, in which the Court of Appeal found that a 998 Offer that provided for payment of a higher amount if certain conditions were met was invalid. The judge concluded that the 998 Offer in this case was valid and that the Plaintiff had failed to prove that it was invalid.
