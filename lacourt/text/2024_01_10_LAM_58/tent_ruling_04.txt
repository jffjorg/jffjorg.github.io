 
             In this Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
action, Plaintiff Dayna
Campbell (Plaintiff) alleged two causes of action: (1) breach of express
warranty; and (2) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.  Prior to trial, Defendant BMW of North
America, LLC (Defendant or BMW) served an offer of compromise upon Plaintiff under
Code of Civil Procedure section 998 (998 Offer).
 
            Following trial, the jury found no
breach of the express warranty, but did find a breach of the implied warranty
and awarded Plaintiff $10,882.47.  The
verdict was less than the 998 Offer.
 
            Plaintiff moved
for a new trial on the grounds that the damages awarded were inadequate and the
verdict was the result of juror misconduct. The Court denied the motion. 
 
            Defendant moved
for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the grounds the jury award was not
supported by evidence. The Court also denied this motion.  
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for an order that Defendant’s (998 Offer) was invalid. Defendant
opposes the motion. 
 
The Court denies the motion. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
moves for a court order finding Defendant’s 998 Offer invalid on the grounds
that it was insufficiently specific and unconditional.

 
            “As a
general rule, the prevailing party in a civil lawsuit is entitled to recover
its costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032.) However, under Code of Civil Procedure section
998, “if the plaintiffs reject a defendant's offer to compromise and then fail
to win a more favorable judgment, the plaintiffs cannot recover their postoffer
costs and must pay the costs the defendant incurred after the offer.” (Chen
v. Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th
117, 121.) 
 
To be considered a valid offer under
Code of Civil Procedure section 998, however, the offer must be unconditional,
although it may include nonmonetary terms and conditions. (Barella v.
Exchange Bank (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 793, 799.) The offer must be
sufficiently specific to allow the recipient to meaningfully evaluate it and
make a reasoned decision whether to accept it. (Taing v. Johnson Scaffolding
Co. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 579, 585.) Finally, the offeree must be able to
clearly evaluate the worth of the offer, which is determined at the time the
offeree receives it. (Duff v. Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC
(2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 491, 500; Barella, supra, 84 Cal.App.4th at p.
801.) 
 
The burden is on the offering party
to demonstrate that the offer is valid under section 998. (Barella, supra,
84 Cal.App.4th at 799.) An ambiguity in the offer is in interpreted “against
its proponent.” (Ignacio v. Caracciolo (2016) 2
Cal.App.5th 81, 86.)
 
In moving for relief, Plaintiff relies
heavily on the holding in Duff v. Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC
(2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 491.
 
In Duff, the manufacturer,
Jaguar, issued a 998 offer to the plaintiff, Duff, “that Jaguar
would repurchase the vehicle for $28,430.80 or greater than that amount if Duff
‘provide[d] documentation to show the amount is more than $28,430.80.’” (Duff
v. Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 491, 496.) The 998 Offer also obligated Jaguar
to pay Duff's costs, expenses, and attorney fees under section 1794,
subdivision (d) as determined by agreement or noticed motion; in accepting the
offer, Duff would have to dismiss the complaint against Jaguar with prejudice. (Id.) Duff did not accept,
and then was awarded nominal damages of $1 after a bench trial. (Id.)
 
The Court of Appeal affirmed the
trial court’s finding that that the 998 was “not sufficiently specific” because
the 998 offer “provided that Jaguar would repurchase the vehicle for $28,430.80
or greater than that amount if Duff ‘provide[d] documentation to show the
amount is more than $28,430.80.’” (Duff, supra, 74 Cal.App.5th at p.
496.) The Court of Appeal explained that the offer “presents somewhat of a
moving target,” and it did not allow for a clear determination of what would
constitute a greater recovery at trial. (Id. at p. 500.) The Court of
Appeal rejected Jaguar’s argument “that at the very least, its offer provided a
floor to which the court could compare what Duff received at trial.” (Duff,
supra, 74 Cal.App.5th 500.)
            
Here, Plaintiff argues that that Defendant’s
998 Offer suffers from the same lack of specificity as the offer in Duff.
Specifically, the 998 Offer contained the following relevant terms:
 
“The judgment is to be in the amount
of $22,736.02. This amount consists of the down payment of $1,500.00, plus
$21,569.40 for the monthly payments made under plaintiff’s lease for the
Subject Vehicle, plus $657.00 for the disposition fees, minus a mileage offset
of $990.38 (5,009 miles), as set forth by Civil Code section 1793.2. Defendant
also intended to pay Plaintiff’s incidental and
consequential damages. Plaintiff is invited to submit an itemization of all incidental and consequential damages
to Defendant together with proof of same.” (Wirtz Decl., Ex. 1
[emphasis in original].) 
 
            In
opposition, Defendant argues the terms were sufficiently clear and
unconditional. Defendant argues that Duff is distinguishable by arguing that
here, the 998 Offer did not provide a floor that could increase. Rather, the $22,736.02 amount was the total
amount that Defendant was offering, noting that this was the “judgment.” That
is, the opposition argues that there was no offer to pay any “higher amount”
(unlike in Duff). 
 
The 998 Offer language is adequate because
it is sufficiently specific to allow Plaintiff to evaluate the worth of the offer.
 The language in the offer that Plaintiff
highlights does not vitiate the $22,736.02 offer or create an alternative offer.  Unlike Duff, Defendant here did not
offer a choice of $22,736.02, “or greater than that amount.”  BMW did not propose, as the court in Duff
found, “a moving target.” (Duff, supra,74 Cal.App.5th at p.
500.) The sentence that begins, “Defendant also intended” is irrelevant to the calculation
of the offer. And the remaining portion, inviting Plaintiff to itemize other
elements of damages, is nothing more than an invitation to make a counteroffer,
which does not abrogate the offer itself.
 
Conclusion
 
Accordingly, the motion to declare Defendant’s
998 Offer invalid is denied.
