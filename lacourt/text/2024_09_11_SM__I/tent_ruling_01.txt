  Case Number:  21SMCV01405    Hearing Date:   September 11, 2024    Dept:  I The application is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  There is no showing that proper notice was
given.  The declaration states that
notice was given on September 10, 2024, but it does not state the time of day
when notice was given—something that matters under the rules.  The matter may be brought again if notice is
given.  The court notes that the gist of
the application is that Aghchay believes that there was no good cause for
counsel’s withdrawal from representation. 
Aghchay states that on the day of the hearing, he was in the courthouse
and was sitting outside the courtroom on the bench waiting to be called.  When he came back inside the courtroom, he
learned that the case had already been called. 
The court does not know whether Aghchay had checked in with court staff
that morning, but likely he did not because if he had, it is likely the court
would have been so informed.  The court
has sympathy for the situation, but sitting outside the courtroom is not
sufficient generally speaking.  It is a
litigant’s duty to be in court when the matter is called or to alert someone
who is in the court that the litigant is right outside.  That said, upon proper notice the court would
be inclined to at least consider the situation. 
The court warns Aghchay, though, that if the court were to delve into
the merits of the motion to be relieved, it might require him or his counsel to
disclose what would otherwise be privileged information to the court, albeit in
camera.
