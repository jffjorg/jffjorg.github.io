And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the effect of a new trial order on the existing judgment in this case. The defendant, Rav-Noy, is willing to forego additional relief and accept the existing judgment based on the court's equitable determinations. However, the deadline to file a notice of appeal is tomorrow, and Rav-Noy may need to appeal even though he does not believe it is necessary. The judge is unsure about the precise effect of an appeal on the current case and will discuss this with the parties. The court will either need to enter a new judgment today or Rav-Noy will need to file an appeal. The judge will also consider whether the court can continue to finalize the equitable portion of the case and enter a judgment based on that, even if the jury issues are appealed.
