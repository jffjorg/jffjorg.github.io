And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying an application for relief from counsel's withdrawal, without prejudice. The application was denied due to a lack of proper notice. The declaration submitted by Aghchay stated that notice was given on September 10, 2024, but did not specify the time of day. The court notes that Aghchay was sitting outside the courtroom waiting to be called, but this is not sufficient to excuse his absence. The court has sympathy for the situation, but it is the litigant's duty to be in court when the matter is called or to alert someone who is in the court. The court warns Aghchay that if the application is brought again with proper notice, it will consider the situation. However, the court may require Aghchay or his counsel to disclose privileged information in camera if the court were to delve into the merits of the motion.
