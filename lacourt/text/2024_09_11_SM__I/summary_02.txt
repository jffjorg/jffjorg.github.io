And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to compel arbitration is stricken without prejudice to renewal in a proper motion. The judge is disappointed in the parties' behavior, citing that the defendant brought the motion without properly addressing the waiver argument in the moving papers, and the plaintiff filed an untimely opposition without providing proper context. The judge notes that the parties' behavior is unacceptable and that they will need to improve their motion practice going forward. The judge encourages the parties to file a proper and timely opposition to the motion to compel arbitration, and a reply that does not rely on new evidence.
