The Judge's tentative ruling states that the demurrer hearing is moot due to the filing of the First Amended Complaint on August 28, 2024. As a result, there will be no hearing on September 11, 2024. The court calculates that the amended complaint was timely filed, and orders that it be deemed filed as of today. The defendants will have the time allowed by law to respond to the amended complaint, with the time beginning to run from today. The demurrer hearing set for September 25, 2024 is also vacated. The Judge notes that this is the plaintiff's second chance to state a cause of action, not the first.
