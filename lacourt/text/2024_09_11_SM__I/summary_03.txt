And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiff to file an amended complaint that adds a new cause of action for fraud by omission and a new party, the dealer. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the new cause of action is doomed to fail and that the new party will have rights, including the right to re-take the plaintiff's deposition. The judge finds neither argument persuasive and grants the motion for leave to amend. The plaintiff will have 5 court days to file an amended complaint, and the defendant will have time to answer or respond. The judge also sets discovery guidelines for the case, noting that the parties will need to "meet and confer" to resolve disputes and that the defendant will need to produce information about the vehicle in question, but not necessarily about other vehicles.
