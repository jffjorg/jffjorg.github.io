  Case Number:  23PSCV02758    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Joe  Casanova, et al. v. Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., et al.  Defendant  Covina Volkswagen’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint  TENTATIVE  RULING The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer with leave to amend. Plaintiffs  must file and serve an amended complaint within 20 days of the Court’s order.               Defendant Covina Volkswagen is ordered  to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND This is a lemon law case. On September 8, 2023, plaintiffs Joe Casanova  and Blanca Ramirez (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed this action against defendants  Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (VW), Covina Volkswagen (collectively, Defendants),  and Does 1 through 10, alleging causes of action for violation of subdivisions  (D), (B), and (A)(3) of Civil Code section 1793.2, breach of the implied  warranty of merchantability, and negligent repair.  On November 13, 2023, Defendant Covina Volkswagen filed a demurrer  to the fifth cause of cause for negligent repair. On January 9, 2024, Plaintiff  opposed the demurrer. On January 16, 2024, Covina Volkswagen replied.  LEGAL  STANDARD             A  demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other  pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content  of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., §  422.10; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,  994.) It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of  the complaint; and for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in  the complaint are assumed to be true. (Id.)   A  demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the  pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially  noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,  supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be  considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,  881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting  demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal  v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [error to consider  contents of release not part of court record].)   A  demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete  or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc.  v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of  the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are  incorporated by reference into the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.  Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s  Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as  surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”])   A demurrer  can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner  v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of  Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108  Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)   DISCUSSION Meet and Confer Per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a),  Covina Volkswagen was required to meet and confer telephonically or in person  before bringing this demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The  Court finds Covina Volkswagen’s meet-and-confer efforts to be sufficient.  (Gamino Decl., ¶¶ 2-6.)  Analysis To state a cause of action based in negligence, the  plaintiff must plead  facts showing that the defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty, the defendant  breached the duty, and the breach caused the plaintiff’s damages or injuries. (Romero  v. Los Angeles Rams (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 562, 567.) “[W]here a purchaser's expectations in a sale are  frustrated because the product he bought is not working properly, his remedy is  said to be in contract alone, for he has suffered only ‘economic’ losses.” (Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.  4th 979, 988, internal quotation marks omitted.)  Defendant Covina Volkswagen demurs to the fifth cause of action  for negligent repair on the grounds that it fails to allege facts sufficient to  constitute a cause of action and that it is barred by the economic loss rule.  Covina Volkswagen contends the complaint contains vague, conclusory allegations  and otherwise fails to state any amount of damages at issue. Covina Volkswagen  further contends that Plaintiffs failed to allege any damages other than  economic losses and that they do not allege any physical injuries or damage to  other property as a result of the alleged negligence.  The Court does not find that the economic loss rule necessarily  bars Plaintiffs’ claim for negligent repair. The “component exception” to the  economic loss rule provides that “the economic loss rule does not necessarily  bar recovery in tort for damage that a defective product (e.g., a window)  causes to other portions of a larger product (e.g., a house) into which the  former has been incorporated.” (Jimenez v. Superior Ct.  (2002) 29 Cal.4th 473, 483.) The complaint alleges that the defects complained  of “substantially impair the use, value, or safety of the Vehicle.” (Compl., ¶  14.) The Court therefore finds that the component exception to the economic  loss rule may apply here.  Covina Volkswagen’s discussion regarding Plaintiffs’  citation to North American Chemical Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59  Cal.App.4th 764 is unpersuasive and unavailing. First, Covina Volkswagen cites only  unpublished federal district court opinions as purportedly undermining North  American Chemical Co., which are not binding on this Court. (See Haberbush  v. Charles & Dorothy Cummins Family Limited Partnership (2006) 139  Cal.App.4th 1630, 1635 fn. 16.)[1] Second, Covina Volkswagen’s citation to Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc.,  supra, 34 Cal.4th 979 is also unavailing. The Supreme Court in Robinson  Helicopter Co., Inc. addressed the Jimenez case extensively, but it  does not address the component exception articulated by the Supreme Court in Jimenez.  (Id., supra, 34 Cal.4th at pp. 357-358.)  Nevertheless, the Court does agree with Covina Volkswagen that the  complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for  negligent repair. The allegations of the complaint are conclusory and almost  completely devoid of detail as to what Defendant Covina Volkswagen allegedly  did or did not do in connection with attempting to repair the subject vehicle.  (See Compl., ¶¶ 55-59.) The complaint does not allege the total number of  repairs attempted, the dates when Plaintiffs took the subject vehicle to Covina  Volkswagen to attempt repairs, what repairs Covina Volkswagen attempted, what Covina  Volkswagen did that was allegedly wrong, or how Covina Volkswagen allegedly  caused any damages to the subject vehicle. The Court finds these allegations to  be lacking in detail.               Based on the foregoing, the Court SUSTAINS the  demurrer to the fifth cause of action with leave to amend.  CONCLUSION The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer with leave to amend. Plaintiffs  must file and serve an amended complaint within 20 days of the Court’s order.
