Summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Covina Volkswagen to the complaint alleging lemon law violations. The Court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that Plaintiffs must file and serve an amended complaint within 20 days of the Court's order. The Court finds that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for negligent repair, as it lacks detail on what Covina Volkswagen allegedly did or did not do to repair the vehicle. The Court also finds that the component exception to the economic loss rule may apply, allowing Plaintiffs to recover damages for economic losses.
