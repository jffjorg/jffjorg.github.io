And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is tentatively granting the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendants, Korca, Inc. and Dongguk Kim. The plaintiff is seeking a money judgment in the amount of $203,768.77, consisting of damages in the amount of $199,800.00, late fees and costs in the amount of $843.77, litigation costs in the amount of $1,275.00, and attorney's fees in the amount of $1,850.00.

The judge notes that the complaint states a claim for the requested relief and that the defendants have defaulted on the contract and guaranty. However, the judge is requesting a representation on the record from the plaintiff regarding whether it would have to reimburse the Small Business Administration (SBA) for the guaranty payout if it recovers the full amount of the loan from the defendants.

The judge is also granting the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees in the amount of $1,850.00, which is permissible given that the judgment is greater than $100,000. The judge is tentatively approving the plaintiff's proposed form of judgment, but notes that it will require some degree of revision due to the issues discussed under damages.

The judge is denying the plaintiff's request for interest on the default judgment, as the complaint did not include a demand for interest. The judge is also not requiring the plaintiff to submit the original written agreement, as the court does not discern any practical need for a clerk's note across the face of the writing.
