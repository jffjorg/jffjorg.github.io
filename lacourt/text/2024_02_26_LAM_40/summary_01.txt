  - "The purpose of discovery sanctions is to protect the interests of the party entitled to[, but denied[, discovery]], not to punish[] the non-compliant party or to put the prevailing party in a better position than he would have had if he had obtained the discovery sought."

  - "Proportionality is critical when it comes to terminating sanctions because they altogether deny the non-compliant party a hearing on the merits and thus implicate due process." (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604)
