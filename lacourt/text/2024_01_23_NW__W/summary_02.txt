Summary in English:

The Tentative Ruling denies the demurrer filed by Plaintiff Hovig Nargizian to Defendant Ford Motor Company's Answer and Affirmative Defenses. The court finds that Defendant's affirmative defenses 1-21 adequately state facts to constitute a defense and are certain, despite Plaintiff's argument that they are uncertain and lack specificity. The court notes that some vagueness may exist in a defendant's answer if the answer gives sufficient notice to enable the plaintiff to prepare to meet the defense. The court also discourages plaintiffs from bringing demurrers to answers, especially in routine litigation, as they can be viewed as making-work and intended to drive up fees and costs on both sides without any useful purpose in advancing the goals of litigation.
