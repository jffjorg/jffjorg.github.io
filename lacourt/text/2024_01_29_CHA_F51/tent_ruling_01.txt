Defendant further requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff  in the combined amount of $4,640.00.   TENTATIVE RULING: Unopposed motions are granted. Plaintiff  is ordered to provide objection-free responses to Defendant’s first set of  discovery requests within 10 days. Defendant’s Requests for Admission, Set One,  are deemed admitted. The Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff in the  amount of $550.00.   BACKGROUND   This is a medical malpractice  action in which Plaintiff alleges that on 2/2/22 and 2/9/22, Defendant treated  him with a drug that rendered his left hand “badly maimed.” On 1/27/23, Plaintiff filed his  complaint against Defendant, alleging a sole cause of action for Medical  Malpractice. On 3/8/23, Defendant filed his answer thereto.   On 3/8/23, Defendant served the subject discovery requests  on Plaintiff. On 11/3/23, Defendant filed the instant motions to compel  Plaintiff’s responses thereto. No oppositions have been filed to date.   ANALYSIS   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to a request for production of documents if the  responding party fails to serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ.  Proc. §§ 2031.300, subd. (b); 2031.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding  party who fails to serve a timely response “waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to interrogatories if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd.  (b); 2030.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings  under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order deeming the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters  specified in the requests be deemed admitted if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2033.280, subd.  (b); 2033.250, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any objection to the requests, including one based on  privilege or on the protection for work product” unless the Court grants it  relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall  make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for  admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a  proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial  compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id. at subd. (c).)   Here, as Defendant served the  subject discovery requests on Plaintiff by mail on 3/8/23, the last day for Plaintiff  to respond was 4/12/23. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1013, subd. (a).) On 6/26/23, Defendant granted Plaintiff  a one-month extension to provide responses to the subject discovery requests.  (Ex. C to Decl. of Paul M. Corson.) To date, Plaintiff has not provided  responses to Defendant’s discovery requests. (Corson Decl. ¶ 8.) The Court notes that Plaintiff  has failed to oppose the instant motions. Accordingly, the Court grants the  instant unopposed motions to compel Plaintiff to provide responses to the  subject discovery requests.   Sanctions    “It is mandatory that the court  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)  on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests  for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd.  (c).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one  engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that  conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred  by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd.  (a).)   In granting the instant motions, the  Court finds it reasonable to award Defendant sanctions against Plaintiff, a  self-represented litigant, in the total amount of $550.00.          CONCLUSION    The unopposed motions are granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to provide objection-free responses to Defendant’s first  set of discovery requests within 10 days. Defendant’s Requests for Admission,  Set One, are deemed admitted. The Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff in  the amount of $550.00.
