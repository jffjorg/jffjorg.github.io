And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion for attorney fees filed by David Joe, the plaintiff, for $155,071.14 in post-arbitration attorney fees incurred as a result of opposing the motion to vacate the arbitration award. The court finds that there is no basis for statutory or contractual recovery of attorney fees under Labor Code section 218.5, as the claim does not arise from a wage-based claim. The court follows the authority from Kirby v. Immoos Fire Protection, Inc. and Ling v. P.F. Chang's China Bistro, Inc., which hold that California law only allows for statutory recovery of attorney fees in the arbitration context, absent a written agreement, when strictly based on an unpaid wage claim. The court also declines to consider the extensive dedicated argument and support regarding the reasonableness of the amount requested given the lack of any basis of recovery.
