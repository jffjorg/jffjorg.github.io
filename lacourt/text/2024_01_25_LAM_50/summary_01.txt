And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies as moot Petitioner's motions to compel responses to Special Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories, and Demands for Production of Documents. However, the Court grants Petitioner's requests for sanctions, ordering Respondent and/or Respondent's attorney of record to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,284.95 to Petitioner. The Court finds that Respondent has failed to respond to discovery requests, despite being ordered to do so, and that Petitioner has demonstrated good cause for the requested sanctions. The Court also notes that the amount of $761.65, claimed by Petitioner as the costs of preparation and making of each motion, is reasonable.
