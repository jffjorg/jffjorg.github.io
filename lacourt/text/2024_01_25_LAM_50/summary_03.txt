And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the motion for summary judgment brought by the County of Los Angeles, due to the voluminous number of evidentiary objections (78) filed by the defendant. The judge has ordered the parties to engage in a meet and confer process to resolve and eliminate the objections, with the goal of reducing the objections to just a few that pertain to material evidence regarding material issues. The parties must file a joint statement with the remaining objections and have a hearing on the objections, where the judge will review the remaining objections and set a date for the hearing on the motion.
