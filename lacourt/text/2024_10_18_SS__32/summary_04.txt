And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is about a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories propounded by Plaintiff Mikhael Dean against Defendants Moda Apartments, Moda at Monrovia Station, and Legacy Partners, LLC. The motion is based on the fact that the dog that attacked Plaintiff was housed in unit 410 and Plaintiff seeks the identity and contact information of past tenants on the fourth floor and neighboring unit 410 to determine if they witnessed the dog's dangerous behavior.

Defendant opposes the motion based on the right of privacy, arguing that releasing the contact information could risk damaging its reputation and goodwill with its tenants. The Court notes that Plaintiff has provided no facts to suggest that any of these tenants witnessed the dog's dangerous propensities and provided notice to Defendants.

The Court denies the motion to compel further responses, finding that Plaintiff acted with substantial justification and declines to award sanctions. The Court also notes that the motion is procedurally defective since the parties did not participate in an informal discovery conference pursuant to the Court's Eighth Amended Standing Order.
