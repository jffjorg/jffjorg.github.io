And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 21STCV11356, a motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions filed by the Defendant City of Los Angeles against the Plaintiff Christina Almeida. The motion was filed because the Plaintiff failed to comply with a discovery order issued on August 12, 2024, and failed to appear for a deposition on August 22, 2024. The Judge has granted the motion in part, ordering the Plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions to the Defendant City's counsel in the amount of $575. The Judge has also denied the request for terminating sanctions, finding that they are too drastic a remedy at this time. The Judge has ordered the Defendant City to provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service.
