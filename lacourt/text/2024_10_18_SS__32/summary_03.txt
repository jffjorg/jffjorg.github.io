And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition for minors compromise filed by Petitioner Arturo Encinas on behalf of Claimant Arthur Encinas, age 8. The court denies the petition without prejudice for several reasons. Firstly, the records provided do not confirm that Claimant is fully recovered from the rear-end motor vehicle accident, and Petitioner must provide further medical records or evidence of recovery. Secondly, Claimant's settlement should not be included in 11b(5) as it pertains to "persons other than claimant". Finally, Petitioner's request for reimbursement of medical expenses and attorney fees is denied due to lack of proof of these payments.

The court grants Petitioner's request for $1,875 in attorney fees, representing 25% of the gross settlement. The court also notes that if medical provider liens described in the petition need to be paid, item 8a(3) of the proposed order should be completed. Petitioner is required to give notice and file proof of service of the denial of the petition.
