Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant The Hertz Corporation's motion for summary judgment or alternative summary adjudication. The Court finds that the Graves Amendment precludes liability based on the facts presented, which show that the vehicle involved in the accident was rented by Inga Astsaturyan, but not returned, and that Edler was not an employee of The Hertz Corporation at the time of the accident. The Court also finds that The Hertz Corporation had no knowledge of Edler operating the vehicle and that there is no triable issue of fact regarding Defendant's individual negligence. As a result, the motion for summary judgment is granted.
