And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion by Plaintiffs Rafael Reyna and Christel Reyna to seal the settlement amounts referenced in their petition to approve a compromise. The motion was filed on behalf of Rafael Reyna, who is disabled and subject to a conservatorship. The settlement was reached through mediation, and the defendant demanded that the settlement amounts be kept confidential. The Judge found that there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the records, and that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored. However, the Judge conditionally granted the motion pending the lodging of unredacted copies with the Court.
