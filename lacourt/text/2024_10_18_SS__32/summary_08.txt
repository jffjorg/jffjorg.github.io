And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Defendant Phoebe Kwan to compel Plaintiff Mac Caprini to respond to discovery requests and to impose monetary and/or evidentiary sanctions. The motion was filed on September 23, 2024, and the Plaintiff failed to respond. The Defendant seeks to compel the Plaintiff's responses to the discovery requests, which were served on April 18, 2024. The Judge finds that the notice of motion is defective because it does not state that the Defendant is seeking to compel the Plaintiff's responses to discovery in the first paragraph. The Judge also notes that the motion is brought under the wrong statute and that multiple discovery motions were combined into one motion. Therefore, the motion is denied. The Defendant must provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service.
