  Case Number:  SC126845    Hearing Date:   January 17, 2025    Dept:  200 LOS ANGELES  SUPERIOR COURT  WEST DISTRICT -  BEVERLY HILLS COURTHOUSE   DEPT. 200   Lackey, et al. v.  Zohoury, et al., Case No. SC126845   TENTATIVE RULING  ON OBJECTIONS OF DEFENDANTS TO ENTRY OF AMENDED JUDGMENT Hearing Date: January  17, 2025, 8:30 a.m.    BACKGROUND / CONTENTIONS            On September  23, 2024, the Court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against  Defendants in the total sum of $19,796,939.00. The judgment was based on a jury  verdict wherein Plaintiffs prevailed on each cause of action. The judgment  represented an award of compensatory damages, penalties and punitive damages  (after a finding of oppression, fraud or malice). The verdict set forth differing  amounts as to each of the seven plaintiffs for compensatory damages comprised  of past economic loss and past non-economic loss and emotional distress, as  well as for penalties. The total compensatory damages and penalties for all  seven plaintiffs was a total of $5,789,959. In addition, the verdict awarded  each plaintiff the same amount in punitive damages as against Zohoury and Rahimi  (respectively in the sums of $714,286 and $1,285,714) (i.e., each plaintiff  received $2 million in punitive damages) (for a total of $14 million), and as  against SBZ and SIDMA, both in the sum of $500.00 (i.e., each plaintiff received  $1,000 in punitive damages) (for a total of $7,000).             On November  25, 2024, the Court filed its ruling denying Defendants’ motion for judgment  notwithstanding the verdict and conditionally granting the motion for new trial  on damages and penalties subject to a remittitur for an amended judgment in the  total amount of $9,000,000 as against defendants Zohoury and Rahimi, of which  amount defendants SBZ and SIDMA were liable for $4,501,000. The Court ruled  further that the proposed amended judgment would be divided between the  different plaintiffs in the same proportion as the judgment.             On December  11, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their consent to the remittitur for an amended  judgment The Court then denied the motion for new trial.            On December  11, 2024, Plaintiffs also lodged a proposed amended judgment.            On December  20, 2024, Defendants filed a Notice of Errata: re Objections to the proposed  amended judgment, attached their corrected objections filed the same date.  Defendants requested oral argument on the objections pursuant to Rule 3.1590(j)  of the Rules of Court. Defendants contended the amended judgment was for a  total sum of $9,975,060.97, not $9 million. They also contended that the  punitive damage award should not be joint and several where this was not part  of the verdict.            On December 23,  2024, the Court set a hearing on the objections at the above-referenced date,  concurrent with a hearing on a motion for attorneys’ fees and to tax costs.            On January  6, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a Response to Defendants’ objections. Plaintiffs  argue that Defendants are seeking the Court to make substantive rulings  concerning, for example, economic and relocation damages, where the time for  the Court to make such rulings has now passed, as opposed to making objections  to the form of the judgment. Specifically, they contend that Defendants are improperly  trying to seek a determination that only statutory damages were awarded so they  can then argue on the appeal that punitive damages are duplicative. Plaintiffs also  indicate they do not know how Defendants calculated the proposed amended  judgment would be for $9,975,060.97.            On January  10, 2025, Defendants filed a Reply to the Response to their Objections. They  indicate that the parties need input from the Court as to how allocate the amounts  within the reduced $9 million total that only the Court can provide. Their  principal points are that the sub-totals add up to no more than $9 million and  that there be no allocation for relocation damages or economic damages that  they argue was wholly comprised of relocation damages) where the Court ruled  previously that relocation damages were not recoverable. That said, they also -  like Plaintiffs - take the position that the Court is now without jurisdiction  to make further rulings except to ensure the judgment clearly sets forth its  intent in issuing the remittitur. (Manson v. Iver & York, et al.  (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 43, Rochlin v. Pat Johnson Mfg.  (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1227, 1238)            On January  13, 2025, Plaintiffs submitted an alternative amended judgment. This still  breaks down the final recovery by way of making an allocation as between economic  and non-economic losses and in turn makes a further allocation as between compensatory  damages and punitive damages, omitting the penalties.     DISCUSSION              The Court’s  intent in its remittitur, if not stated sufficiently clearly, was for total  compensatory damages and or penalties to be $4.5 million as against the four  defendants that were part of this trial and punitive damages as against Zohoury  and Rahimi to be $4.5 million and as against SBZ and SIDMA to be $1,000 (for a  total of $9 million.) [1]  As set forth below, the Court has taken the following steps to make the amended  judgment consistent with the terms of the remittitur:            First, the  Court determined the respective percentage interests each plaintiff had in the  total amount of compensatory damages and penalties in the judgment and applied  those percentages to the $4.5 million.[2] In  its remittitur, the Court did not differentiate as between the different  components or types of compensatory damages and penalties given the various  issues identified in the rulings on the JNOV motion and motion for new trial. As  permitted in a remittitur, the Court instead determined an award that attempted  to be a “fair and reasonable” amount consistent with the evidence and various  theories of relief. The Court no longer has jurisdiction to make further rulings  as concerns the substantive issues in the motions.             Second, the Court  divided by seven the $4.5 million in punitive damages against Zohoury and Rahimi  and separately $1,000 as against SBZ and SIDMA.[3] The  Court then divided those amounts against Zohoury and Rahimi by their respective  proportionate shares (35.7% and 64.3%) from the judgment. The Court concurs  that liability for these amounts is not joint and several, consistent  with the verdict, except as to the awards against SBZ and SIDMA.            The Court  does not know why Plaintiffs submitted a proposed amended judgment for  $9,975,060.97 but in any event the amounts set forth below total $9 million. In  addition, the way in which Plaintiffs have calculated economic and non-economic  losses and punitive damages (and omitting penalties) - in both proposed amended  judgments - is inconsistent with what the Court had intended. Again, the Court  made no such rulings in the remittitur. Plaintiffs’ citations to the ruling  concerned analysis of the original judgment and issues therewith, based on  comparison of different parts of that judgment, as contrasted to the absence of  any such breakdown in the remittitur. The Court determined that a conditional  revised amount was a better way to assess the amount of liability instead of  having a new trial that would have made those legal determinations. Finally,  the Court did not here determine proportionate shares of the total judgment –  but only reduces the compensatory damages / penalties part to $4.5 million -- as  that was the only part where Plaintiffs’ recoveries differed between them. The  Court did not wholly omit penalties, nor make the allocation between  compensatory and punitive damages that Plaintiffs propose in their judgment. Nonetheless,  the Court agrees that since each Plaintiff received the same amount in punitive  damages, that amount could instead be simply reduced to $4.5 million (not what  Plaintiffs suggest) and divided as set forth above.    CONCLUSION            The  objections are sustained in part and overruled in part, as discussed above.            Plaintiffs  shall submit a further revised amended judgment for a total of $9,000,000 that  provides in relevant part as follows:   Tom Lackey:  Compensatory damages / penalties jointly and severally against  all four defendants: $652,500 Punitive damages against Zohoury: $229,500   Punitive damages against Rahimi: $413,357.14 Punitive damages against SBZ: $71.42 Punitive damages against SIDMA: $71.42   Sergio Camacho:  Compensatory damages / penalties jointly and severally  against all four defendants: $661,500 Punitive damages against Zohoury: $229,500   Punitive damages against Rahimi: $413,357.14 Punitive damages against SBZ: $71.42 Punitive damages against SIDMA: $71.42   Chris Crosby:  Compensatory damages / penalties jointly and severally  against all four defendants: $747,000 Punitive damages against Zohoury: $229,500   Punitive damages against Rahimi: $413,357.14 Punitive damages against SBZ: $71.42 Punitive damages against SIDMA: $71.42   Marianne Pillarella:  Compensatory damages / penalties jointly and severally  against all four defendants: $805,500 Punitive damages against Zohoury: $229,500   Punitive damages against Rahimi: $413,357.14    Punitive damages against SBZ: $71.42 Punitive damages against SIDMA: $71.42   Bernard Yin:  Compensatory damages / penalties jointly and severally  against all four defendants: $544,500 Punitive damages against Zohoury: $229,500   Punitive damages against Rahimi: $413,357.14 Punitive damages against SBZ: $71.42 Punitive damages against SIDMA: $71.42   Rebecca Ramirez:  Compensatory damages / penalties jointly and severally  against all four defendants: $477,000 Punitive damages against Zohoury: $229,500   Punitive damages against Rahimi: $413,357.14 Punitive damages against SBZ: $71.42 Punitive damages against SIDMA: $71.42   Linda Delp, as successor to Paul Campbell:  Compensatory damages / penalties jointly and severally  against all four defendants: $612,000 Punitive damages against Zohoury: $229,500   Punitive damages against Rahimi: $413,357.14 Punitive damages against SBZ: $71.48 Punitive damages against SIDMA: $71.48            There shall  be no further opportunity to object to an amended judgment inclusive of these  awards.
