And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a fee motion filed by the plaintiffs. The ruling states that the plaintiffs are entitled to fees under the harassment ordinance and under the leases, despite the defendants' objections to the amended judgment. The judge notes that the original judgment was in favor of the plaintiffs in a higher amount than the amended judgment, and that the court has denied the defendants' motion for new trial, which was based in part on the claim that the statutory relocation award was invalid. The judge also finds that the Campbell lease is authentic, despite the defendants' objections, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to fees under the lease provision. The ruling cites the case of Hjelm v. Prometheus Real Estate Group (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1155 in support of its decision.
