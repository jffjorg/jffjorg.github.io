And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the objections of the defendants to the entry of the amended judgment. The original judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants in the total sum of $19,796,939.00. The remittitur reduced the total compensatory damages and penalties to $4,500,000 and punitive damages to $9,000,000. The proposed amended judgment differs from the remittitur in its breakdown of the damages and penalties.

The judge has taken steps to make the amended judgment consistent with the terms of the remittitur. The judge has determined the respective percentage interests each plaintiff had in the total amount of compensatory damages and penalties in the judgment and applied those percentages to the $4,500,000. The judge has also divided the punitive damages against Zohoury and Rahimi by their respective proportionate shares.

The judge has sustained the objections in part and overruled them in part. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to submit a further revised amended judgment that provides for the allocation of the damages and penalties as set forth in the tentative ruling. The judge has also specified that there shall be no further opportunity to object to the amended judgment.
