And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents from the defendant, FCA US LLC. The plaintiff, Hung Dao, alleges that FCA US LLC failed to repair or repurchase a 2021 Jeep Wrangler, which he purchased under a warranty contract. The defendant has already been ordered to produce certain documents, and the court finds that the defendant has acted with substantial justification in producing additional responses. The court also denies the plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with discovery responses, as the defendant has already produced over 900 pages of documents, including policies and procedures related to warranty claims and customer assistance. Finally, the court declines to impose monetary sanctions on either party.
