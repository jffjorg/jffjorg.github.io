And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories (set one) from the defendant. The motion seeks to identify each denial of a material allegation and each special or affirmative defense in the defendant's pleadings. The defendant argued that the motion should be denied due to various reasons, including the plaintiff's failure to meet and confer, seeking improper legal conclusions from a lay person, failing to address the merits of the defendant's initial responses, and failing to provide clarifications. The judge finds that the defendant did not substantively oppose the motion and agrees to further supplement its response. The judge orders the defendant to provide further responses within 30 days and grants sanctions in the amount of $1,330.00 to be paid by the defendant within 90 days.
