Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant THE PACIFIC SOUTHWEST
DISTRICT OF THE LUTHERAN CHURCH-MISSOURI SYNOD’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Form Interrogatories (set one) is GRANTED. 
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
This is a quiet title action filed by
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant THE PACIFIC SOUTHWEST DISTRICT OF THE LUTHERAN CHURCH
– MISSOURI SYNOD (“Plaintiff”) seeking to determine the ownership of church
property used by Defendant/Cross-Complainant PEACE LUTHERAN CHURCH, INC. OF
SOUTH GATE CALIFORNIA (“Peace Lutheran”). Plaintiff contends that it now owns
the property pursuant to Defendant’s constitution because Defendant’s
congregation no longer exists. Defendant and Chastity Carvel filed
Cross-Complaints alleging that Plaintiff’s lawsuit is improper. 
 
Plaintiff now moves to compel Defendant CHASTITY
CARVEL’s (“Defendant”)  further responses to Form Interrogatories (set
one) No. 15.1, which states: Identify each denial of a material allegation and
each special or affirmative defense in your pleadings and for each: (a) state
all facts upon which you base the denial or special or affirmative defense; (b)
state the names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have
knowledge of those facts; and (c) identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible
things that support your denial or special or affirmative defense, and state
the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON who has each DOCUMENT. 
 
Defendant
responds with objections and the following statement: “See Answer to cross
complaint filed by this Defendant in this action.” (SS 2:19-20.) 
 
Defendant’s
Opposition was due by April 19, 2024. (CCP §1005(b).) In an untimely Opposition
filed without leave of Court on April 26, 2024 Defendant argues that this
Motion should be denied because Plaintiff failed to meet and confer; Plaintiff
seeks improper legal conclusions from a lay person; Plaintiff failed to address
the merits of Defendant’s initial responses; and because Plaintiff failed to
provide clarifications requested by Defendant. Defendant maintains that she was
unable to supplement her response to FI 15.1 until the definition of “incident
was provided to Defendant by Plaintiff on April 23, 2024. (Opp. 7:4-10.)
Further, Defendant includes a supplemental response to FI 15.1 within the body
of her untimely Opposition. 
 
The Motion
is GRANTED. FI 15.1 asks Defendant to identify each material allegation or
affirmative defense in her pleading and to state the facts on which the
allegations are based, as well as identify corresponding witnesses and
documents. Defendant filed an Answer May 25, 2024 and is required to respond to
this interrogatory. Moreover, Defendant does not substantively oppose the
Motion and agrees to further supplement her response. 
 
Defendant
CARVEL is ORDERED to provide further responses within 30 days from the date of
the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may be extended by agreement of
the parties.
 
Reasonable
sanctions are GRANTED in favor of the Moving Party in the amount requested of
$1,330.00, payable by Defendant Carvel within 90 days from the date of the
Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may be extended by agreement of the
parties.
