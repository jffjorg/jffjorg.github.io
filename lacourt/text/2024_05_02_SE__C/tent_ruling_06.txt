Defendants’ Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is SUSTAINED
with 30 days leave to amend in part and OVERRULED in part. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This wage-claim action was filed by Plaintiffs DAVID
ESPINOZA; OSCAR APARICIO; and RAMON GONZALEZ on July 25, 2023. 
 
The operative Complaint alleges that “[t]his is a wage and
hour action arising out of Defendant OMNI LOGISTICS, LLC’s (‘Defendant’)
misclassification of Plaintiffs… as independent contractors, failure to pay
wages owed, failure to provide accurate wage statements, and failure to
reimburse for necessary business expenses.” (Complaint ¶1.) 
 
Plaintiffs assert the following causes of action: 
 
(1) Unpaid
Wages; 
(2) Failure
to Provide Accurate Wage Statements; 
(3) Failure
to Reimburse for Necessary Business Expenses; 
(4) Violation
of Bus. & Prof. Code §17200
 
Defendant OMNI LOGISTICS, LLC (“Defendant”) generally demurs
to Plaintiffs’ third and fourth causes of action. 
 
Third Cause of Action – Failure to Reimburse for
Necessary Business Expenses
 
Defendant argues that the Complaint lacks sufficient factual
allegations to support Plaintiffs’ third cause of action. 
 
The elements of Labor Code §2802(a) are: “(1) the employee
made expenditures or incurred losses; (2) the expenditures or losses were
incurred in direct consequence of the employee’s discharge of his or her
duties, or obedience to the directions of the employer; and (3) expenditures or
losses were necessary.” (Cassady v. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP
(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 220, 230.) 
 
As argued by Defendant, Plaintiffs’ allegations with respect
to this cause of action are factually devoid. Statutory causes of action must
be pled with factual particularity. (Lopez v. Southern California Rapid
Transit District (1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 795.) 
 
The demurrer to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED with
30 days leave to amend. 
 
Fourth Cause of Action – Violation of Bus. & Prof.
Code §17200
 
Defendant argues that an employee may not seek a restitution
award under the UCL for unpaid wages because of the existence of another
adequate remedy. 
 
As argued by Plaintiffs in Opposition, pursuant to Cortez
v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 163, 177-178,
the wage and hour violations alleged are a sufficient bases to support a UCL
claim. 
 
The demurrer to the fourth cause of action is OVERRULED.
