 Case Number:  24NWCP00058    Hearing Date:   May 2, 2024    Dept:  C CITY OF SOUTH GATE v. DE LA CRUZ
CASE NO.:  24NWCP00058 
HEARING:  05/02/24
 
#7
 
Defendant/Respondent DE LA CRUZ’s motion to quash service of
summons and petition for appointment of receiver is DENIED. 
 
Opposing Party to give Notice. 
 
Once a defendant moves to quash service of process on
jurisdictional grounds, the plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating
facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction. (Vons Companies, Inc. v.
Seabest Food, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 449.) In order to gain
jurisdiction over a party that party must be properly served with the summons
and complaint. 
 
Here, Plaintiff/Petitioner filed a proof of service on March
14, 2024 showing service by substituted service by a registered process server
on March 1, 2024. The proof of service supports a presumption of valid service.
(Cal. Ev. Code §647.) 
 
Here, Defendant (in pro per) submits a declaration under
penalty of perjury stating that he “was not served any papers in regard of this
case.” (De La Cruz Decl., 3:8.)  Defendant
maintains that he did not learn about this action until after seeking aid from
the Clerk’s office to use the Court computer.  
 
Based on the evidence presented, the Court finds that
Defendant has failed to present substantial evidence to rebut the presumption
of valid service.  “Evidence Code section
647 provides that a registered process server’s declaration of service
establishes a presumption that the facts stated in the declaration are true.” (Rodriguez
v. Cho (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742, 750.) 
 
The Motion is DENIED.
