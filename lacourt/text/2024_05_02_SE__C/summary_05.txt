Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is continuing the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories set one to July 11, 2024. The plaintiff filed a lemon law action on December 29, 2022, and is seeking to compel the defendant's further responses. The defendant argues that they were unable to participate in meet and confer attempts due to COVID-19. The judge is not persuaded that the counsel have exhausted their meet and confer obligations. The judge orders the counsel to further meet and confer on the issues outlined in the subject motions. If the issues are not resolved informally, the counsel may appear and argue the merits on the continued hearing date. The judge also orders the counsel to submit a joint statement outlining the remaining disputed issues by July 1, 2024.
