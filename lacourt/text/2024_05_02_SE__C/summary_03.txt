And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the defendant, MED (DE), LLC. The first motion, to compel plaintiff DAVID LOPEZ's responses to special interrogatories, is deemed moot as the plaintiff has withdrawn the motion. The second motion, to compel plaintiff DEBBIE SHANNON's responses to form interrogatories, is granted. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide verified responses without objection by a certain deadline. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not opposed the motion and that the defendant has shown that the interrogatories were properly served and that no responses have been provided.
