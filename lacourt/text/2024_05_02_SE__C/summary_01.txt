This tentative ruling is about a breach of contract action between Cargo Express Group, Inc. and Eagle Freight LLC (plaintiffs) and Milestone Equipment Company LLC and Milestone Chassis Company LLC (defendants). The plaintiffs applied for the appointment of a discovery referee to hear the defendants' motion to quash deposition and motion for protective order. However, the court denied the application, finding that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate a need for an ex parte ruling. The court also advanced the hearing date from September 24, 2024 to July 11, 2024, and ordered the parties to file and serve opposition and reply briefs in compliance with the new hearing date.
