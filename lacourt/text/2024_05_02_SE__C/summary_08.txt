And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and petition for appointment of receiver. The defendant claims not to have received any papers in regard to the case, but the plaintiff has presented evidence of valid service, including a proof of service showing that the defendant was served by a registered process server on March 1, 2024. The court finds that the defendant has failed to present substantial evidence to rebut the presumption of valid service. The motion is denied.
