HEARING:  05/02/24
 
#3
 
Levik
Yarian Esq. and Matadores Accident & Injury Lawyers, APC’s unopposed motion
to withdraw as counsel of record for Plaintiff SERGIO DE LA CRUZ is GRANTED.  
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Opposition filed as of April 29, 2024. 
 
The
Court finds that Counsel has met the procedural requirements, including proper notice
to the client at the last known residence or business address of the
client.  C.R.C. 3.1362.
 
Here,
Counsel’s declaration indicates that there has been a breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship. Where the issue (or conflict) is between the
lawyer and client(s), without implicating other parties, the court can rely on
counsel’s sworn declaration absent any reason to doubt the representations. 
 
There
is an undisputed breakdown in attorney-client communications. It does not
appear that Attorney Yarian’s continued representation would serve the
interests of justice. The motion to withdraw is GRANTED.
