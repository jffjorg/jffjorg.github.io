BACKGROUND
On May 30, 2023, plaintiff SMBD
Investments, LP filed a complaint against Coco’s Restaurants, LLC, Shari’s
Management Corporation, and Fri-M, LLC for breach of lease and account stated.
On August 7, 2023, defendants filed
an answer.
On June 18, 2024, the Court granted
defense counsel’s motions to be relieved as counsel.
On July 11, 2024, plaintiff filed a
notice of settlement.
On August 15, 2024, plaintiff filed
an amendment designating Shari’s CP, LLC as Doe 1.
On August 21, 2024, judgment
pursuant to stipulation was entered.
On October 22, 2024, plaintiffs
filed a memorandum of costs for $3,906.81.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
CCP §1032(b) states:  “Except as otherwise expressly provided by
statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs
in any action or proceeding.” 
CCP §1033.5(a)(10)(B)-(C) provides
that attorney’s fees are recoverable as costs when authorized by “statute” or
“law.”
Civil
Code §1717 states:  “(a) In any action on
a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney's fees and
costs, which are incurred to enforce the provisions of that contract, shall be
awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party
who is determined to be the prevailing party, whether he or she is the party
specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s
fees.”
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff
SMBD Investments, LP requests attorney’s fees in the amount of $11,093.19, if
the Court grants plaintiff’s memorandum of costs in the amount of $3,906.81, so
that the total costs and fees not exceed $15,000. 
The Court
entered judgment pursuant to stipulation on August 21, 2024 in the amount of
$151,105.80 plus attorney’s fees.  It
orders that attorneys’ fees may be sought pursuant to paragraph 6 of the
Stipulation and Rule of Court 3.1702. 
Paragraph 6 states, “If Plaintiff elects to have a money judgment
entered in this action, the judgment shall be in the amount of: 1) $151,108.50,
less any payments previously received by plaintiff from Defendants; and 2)
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred by plaintiff in this matter, not
to exceed $15,000.00.”
Plaintiff
argues that it is the prevailing party and that it is entitled to attorney’s
fees and costs not to exceed $15,000, pursuant to the stipulation and
judgment.  Plaintiff further contends
that the amount requested is reasonable. 
See Richard P. Keavney decl., and Exhibit 2 showing statement of account
totaling $11,325 ($300/hr. x 27.75 hrs.).
The Court
rules as follows:  The Court finds that as
stated in the judgment, plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees.  The Court awards $11,093.19 in attorney’s
fees.
 
ORDER
The motion is GRANTED.
The Court awards $11,093.19 in
attorney’s fees in favor of plaintiff and against defendants.
