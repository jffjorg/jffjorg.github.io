BACKGROUND
            On
August 7, 2023, Plaintiff Beatriz Watt (“Plaintiff”) commenced this action against
Defendant Heidi Emke aka Heidi Linde Emkeme (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 to 10,
alleging causes of action for (1) Motor Vehicle and (2) General Negligence.
 
            On
January 16, 2024, Defendant filed her Answer. 
 
            On
April 17, 2024, Defendant filed Motions to Compel Form Interrogatories (Set
One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), Request for Production (Set One), and
Motion to Deem Request for Admissions Admitted. The matters were unopposed and
came for hearing on May 29, 2024. This Court granted all four motions and
imposed sanctions against Plaintiff. Plaintiff was ordered to provide
objection-free responses and pay a total of $2,246.60 in sanctions within 20
days.
 
            On
August 8, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion for terminating sanctions
and dismissal of the action. On September 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed an untimely
opposition that was not reviewed by the Court. On September 9, 2024, when the case
was called for hearing the Court continued the matter until September 16, 2024,
so that the Court could consider the opposition.     
 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Code of Civil Procedure Section
2023.030 provides that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing
any particular discovery method..., the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose...
[monetary, evidence, and terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process....” Code of Civil Procedure
Section 2023.010 provides that “[m]issues of the discovery process include, but
are not limited to, the following:... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.... (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery....”
 
“The trial court may order a
terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the
circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were
willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and
informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (quoting Lang v. Hachman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246).) “Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores,
supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 (citation omitted).)  
 
“Under this standard, trial courts
have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully
disobeyed one or more discovery orders.” (Id. (citing Lang, supra,
77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244- 1246); see, e.g., Collisson X Kaplan v.
Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating sanctions
imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce
discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal App
3d 481, 491 (disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCucchen (1997)
16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4) (terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for
failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery
statutes).)  
 
DISCUSSION
            Defendant moves for an order terminating
sanctions and to dismiss this lawsuit on the grounds that Plaintiff has
unreasonably and unjustifiably refused to obey discovery statutes and the
Court’s orders regarding discovery. 
 
            Here, Defendant served discovery
requests on January 15, 2024 on Plaintiff. (Labat Decl., ¶2.) Defendant
contends Plaintiff failed to provide responses or request any discovery
extensions. (Id. at ¶3.) Further, Defendant contends she made good faith
attempts to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel from February 22, 2024
through April 17, 2024, which were futile. Subsequently, Defendant filed three
motions to compel responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), Request for
Production (Set One), and a motion to deem Request for Admissions Admitted. All
four motions were granted on May 29, 2024 and Plaintiff was ordered to provide
objection-free responses and pay $2,246.60 in sanctions within 20 days. (Ex.
A.) Defendant argues she has neither received the court-ordered discovery
responses nor the $2,246.60 in sanctions. 
 
            The
Court finds that Plaintiff has engaged in conduct that is an abuse of the
discovery process. First, Plaintiff failed to serve any discovery responses,
which gave rise to the underlying motions to compel and deem request for
admissions admitted. Next, Plaintiff failed to file a timely opposition to the
underlying motions to compel and deem request for admissions admitted. Now,
Plaintiff has failed to timely oppose the present motion or offered any acceptable
explanation for the failure to obey the prior court orders regarding discovery.
A such, Plaintiff has shown she is disinterested in prosecuting this case. However,
punishing the client is not the appropriate response for Plaintiff’s counsel’s
failures. 
 
            This
Court is ordering Plaintiff’s counsel R. Christopher Harshman to pay the previously
ordered sanctions plus an additional $750 to defense counsel. All discovery
responses without objection and sanctions are due by 4:00 pm on September 20,
2024. Any additional failure by Plaintiff’s counsel will result in contempt proceedings
and if appropriate notification to the State Bar.             Therefore,
Defendant Heidi Emke aka Heidi Linde Emkeme’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions
and Dismissal of Action is DENIED in part.

Moving
party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
