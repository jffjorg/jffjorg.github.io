LEGAL STANDARD
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section
437c(p)(1), a plaintiff or cross-complainant has the initial burden on summary
judgment or adjudication of showing that there is no defense to a cause of
action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling
the party to judgment on that cause of action. Once that burden is met, the
burden shifts to the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a triable issue
of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense
thereto.
 
On a motion for summary judgment, the moving
party’s supporting documents are strictly construed and those of his opponent
liberally construed, and doubts as to the propriety of summary judgment should
be resolved against granting the motion. (D’Amico v. Board of Medical
Examiners (1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 21; Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839.)
 
Furthermore, on summary judgment, the issues
are defined by the pleadings. (See Physicians Comm. For Responsible Medicine
v. McDonald’s Corp. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 554, 568 [“the issues framed by
the pleadings are the only issues a motion for summary judgment must
address.”]; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d
367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., ITD., v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994)
29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472; Bostrom v. County of San Bernardino (1995) 35
Cal. App. 4th 1654, 1663; 580 Folsom Assocs. v. Prometheus Dev. Co.
(1990) 223 Cal. App. 3d 1, 14, 18 [burden to address theories “reasonably
contemplated by the opponent’s pleading”]; Melican v. Regents of Univ. of
Cal. (2007) 151 Cal. App. 4th 168, 182 [not requiring party to negate an
unstated claim].)
 
Courts cannot decide summary judgment or
adjudication motions based upon credibility. (AARTS Prods., Inc. v. Crocker
Nat’l Bank (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1064 [“[T]he role of the court in
summary judgment proceedings is not to weigh the evidence, but to determine
whether there exists a triable issue of material fact.”]; Habitat Trust for
Wildlife, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cucamonga (2009) 175 Cal. App. 4th 1306,
1342.) That said, the affidavits and declarations of the moving party are
strictly construed and those of the opponent are liberally constructed. (Howe
v. Pioneer Mfg Co. (1968) 262 Cal. App. 2d 330, 336-37.) 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Statement
of Facts
 
First
Cause of Action
 
In
or around June 1992, Defendant opened an American Express Account (“Account 1”).
(Plaintiff’s Undisputed Material Facts “UMF” #1.) The use of Account 1 was
governed by a Cardmember Agreement. (UMF #2.) American Express sent a copy of
the original Cardmember Agreement to Defendant along with the physical credit
card and updated the terms and conditions periodically, sending the updated
agreements to its cardmembers. (UMF #3.) By retaining and using Account 1,
Defendant agreed to be bound by the current terms and conditions of the
Cardmember Agreement. (UMF #4.) Defendant utilized Account 1 for obtaining
credit and purchasing goods and services. (UMF #5.) American Express maintained
an open book account for Account 1 through monthly billing statements, which
itemized all transactions, including purchases, advances, fees, interest, and
payments. (UMF #8.) The statements were generated every month, stored
internally by American Express, and mailed to Defendant. (UMF #8.) Defendant
had a period of sixty (60) days to dispute any billing errors in writing, but
there are no unresolved disputes, and Account 1 is accurate as stated. (UMF #9,
#10.) The current outstanding balance on Account 1 is $64,992.44, as per the
Cardmember Agreement and the latest statement. (UMF #11.)
 
Second
Cause of Action
 
In
or around November 1993, Defendant opened another American Express Account
(“Account 2”). (UMF #12.) The terms and conditions for Account 2 were also
governed by a Cardmember Agreement. (UMF #13.) American Express sent the
original Cardmember Agreement and the credit card to the Defendant and
periodically provided updates to the agreement’s terms. (UMF #14.) By retaining
and using Account 2, Defendant agreed to comply with the updated terms and
conditions. (P’s UMF #15.) Defendant used Account 2 for credit transactions and
payment for goods and services. (UMF #16.) American Express maintained Account
2 through monthly billing statements that detailed all transactions, fees,
interest, and payments. (UMF #19.) These statements were generated monthly,
stored internally by American Express, and mailed to the Defendant. (UMF #19.) Defendant
was allowed sixty (60) days to contest any billing discrepancies, but no
disputes remain unresolved, and Account 2 is accurate. (UMF #20, #21.) The
outstanding balance on Account 2 is $22,109.59, as specified in the Cardmember
Agreement and the most recent statement. (UMF #22.)
 
Analysis
 
            Account Stated
 
Plaintiff
argues that an account stated exists between the parties. An “account stated”
is an agreement that confirms the correctness of an account’s balance and the
indebtedness of one party to another, based on previous transactions. (Trafton
v. Youngblood (1968) 68 Cal.2d 17, 25.) Plaintiff contends that such an
agreement was implied because Defendant did not dispute any of the monthly
billing statements sent for both accounts. (UMFs #1-22.) The Cardmember
Agreement, which was sent to Defendant along with the credit card, governs the
terms of both accounts. (UMF #2, 3, 13, 14.) Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s
continued use of the card is an implied acceptance of these terms. (UMF #3-4,
14-15.) As Defendant did not object to the statements within the 60-day period
provided for disputes, Plaintiff argues that the accounts are correct and
undisputed, thus establishing an account stated. (UMF #9, 20.)
 
 
Open
Book Account
 
Plaintiff
claims that an open book account exists between the parties. Under California
law, a “book account” is a detailed statement kept in a reasonably permanent
form, which constitutes the principal record of transactions between a debtor
and creditor. (Code Civ. Proc., § 337a.) Plaintiff maintains that American
Express’s business records, including monthly billing statements generated and
stored on its internal network, meet the criteria of a book account. (UMF #8,
19.) These records were kept in an electronic format, which is considered
sufficient to establish a book account. (Costerisan v. DeLong (1967) 251
Cal.App.2d 768, 770-771.) As there are no unresolved disputes regarding the
accounts Plaintiff argues that Defendant is liable under the Complaint. (UMF
#10, 21.)
 
Quantum
Meruit
 
Plaintiff
contends that it is entitled to recovery under the principle of quantum meruit,
which allows for compensation whenever one party has received a benefit at the
expense of another that should, in equity and good conscience, be returned. (Mains
v. City Title Ins. Co. (1949) 34 Cal. 2d 580, 586.) Here, Defendant
requested and was issued two American Express credit cards, used to make
purchases and obtain credit. (UMF #1-5, 12-16.) Plaintiff states that Defendant
has failed to pay the balance due on either account, which represents the
reasonable value of the services provided by American Express. (UMF #8-11,
19-22.)
 
            Defendant fails to provide any
opposition. The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied its burden in showing
that there is no triable issue of fact as to the claims in the complaint.
Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish that an account stated
exists, as Defendant did not dispute the billing statements within the allowed
time frame, and an open book account is properly maintained by Plaintiff in
accordance with legal standards. Additionally, Plaintiff has demonstrated
entitlement to recover under the principle of quantum meruit due to Defendant’s
use of the credit card services and failure to pay the outstanding balances. 
 
Therefore,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment.
