And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and dismissal of the action in part. The defendant filed the motion after the plaintiff failed to comply with discovery orders and failed to pay sanctions imposed by the court. The court found that the plaintiff's conduct was an abuse of the discovery process and ordered the plaintiff's counsel to pay an additional $750 in sanctions. The court also ordered the plaintiff to provide all discovery responses without objection by September 20, 2024. If the plaintiff fails to comply with the court's order, the court may impose contempt proceedings and notify the State Bar.
