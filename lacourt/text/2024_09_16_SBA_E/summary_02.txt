Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in the case of American Express National Bank v. Denise Phillips, et al. The plaintiff, American Express National Bank, had filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that there were no material facts in dispute and that the defendant, Denise Phillips, was liable for the outstanding balances on two American Express credit accounts.

The defendant had failed to file opposition to the motion, and the judge found that the plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence to establish its claims. The evidence showed that the defendant had opened two American Express accounts and had used them to make credit transactions and purchases. The defendant had received monthly billing statements from American Express, but had failed to dispute any of the statements within the allowed time frame.

The judge found that an "account stated" existed between the parties, meaning that the defendant had agreed to the correctness of the account balances. The judge also found that an "open book account" was properly maintained by American Express, which constituted the primary record of transactions between the parties.

Finally, the judge found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover under the principle of quantum meruit, which allows for compensation for services rendered when one party has failed to pay for them. The judge granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, effectively ending the case.
