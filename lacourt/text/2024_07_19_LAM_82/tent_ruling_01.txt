[Tentative] Order Overruling Demurrer
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
            Petitioner
California Policy Center, Inc. (“Petitioner”) filed this petition under the
California Public Records Act (“CPRA”). 
Petitioner seeks records from the Los Angeles Unified School District
(“Respondent” or the “LAUSD”) and alleges that “after years of providing the
requested information to Petitioner without objection, [the LAUSD] has
wrongfully denied this same information on the basis of exemptions and case law
that do not apply to these requests.” 
(Petition for Writ of Mandate (“Pet.”) ¶ 2.)  Respondent demurs to the petition, arguing
that its compliance with the CPRA may be determined, conclusively, from the
face of the petition.  The court
disagrees and overrules the demurrer.  
 
BACKGROUND 
 
A.             
Petitioner’s CPRA Requests
 
             Petitioner seeks to
enforce its right to public records pursuant to two CPRA requests.  The first request was made on June 1, 2023
(“June 2023 request” or the “first request”). 
The second request was made on September 5, 2023 (“September 2023 request”
or the “second request”). 
 
In the first request, Petitioner
requested that Respondent produce the following records: (A) The total number
of payers into each and every collective bargaining unit or professional
association for May 2023; and (B) The total number of people covered by a union
collective bargaining agreement for May 2023. 
(Id. ¶ 7 & Exh. A.)  Respondent’s
counsel denied the first request on August 4, 2023, stating in pertinent part: 
 
Please be advised that the District does not have a
responsive record that contains all of items requested. With respect to your
request that the District create a spreadsheet with this information, please be
advised that the District has no duty to create records that do not exist…. Haynie
v. Superior Court (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1061, 1073–1075 …. Moreover, none of
information requested will be made available to you because it is exempt from
disclosure under the CPRA and case law. (Gov. Code, §§ 7927.705 and 7928.405; Freedom
Foundation v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 47….)
 
(Id. Exh. J)  In a responsive letter dated September 5,
2023, Petitioner explained—with respect to the June 2023 Request—that Petitioner
“has been making this request to LAUSD for approximately five years” and
“[t]his is the first time LAUSD has advised that this document was created by
LAUSD in response to CPC’s records.”  (Id.
Exh. K.)  
 
            Petitioner
sent the second request on September 5, 2023, which modified the first
request.  Petitioner sought the following
records:
 
1.    
A copy of each contract / MOU or
other evidence of an agreement with any and all collective bargaining unit /
professional management association that are currently in effect for the months
of May, June, July and August 2023; and 
 
2.    
Any documents that set forth the
number of employees of each bargaining unit / association for which LAUSD is
paying dues to each unit/association for each pay period for the months of May,
June, July and August 2023; and / or 
 
3.    
Any documents that set forth or
evidence the total amount paid by LAUSD to each unit / association for each pay
period for the months of May, June, July and August 2023.
 
(Id. ¶ 14, Exh. K.)
 
On or about September 15, 2023,
Respondent produced certain responsive, non-exempt records and denied the
remainder of the first request.  In a
letter, Respondent’s counsel explained:
 
This most recent request [the June 2023 Request] is similar
to prior requests received by Los Angeles Unified School District (“District”).
In the past, the District created documents to respond to these similar
requests because there was no single document that existed containing the
requested information. In the past, the District created this document to
provide your client with what was believed at the time to be public
information. Since the publication of Freedom Foundation v. Superior Court
(2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 47, this information has been deemed exempt from
disclosure. Furthermore, your assumption that the District altered an existing
document is both unfounded and untrue.

Please note that
the responsive, non-exempt, information that you seek can be found at the
following link:

Please be advised that the District does not have a
responsive record that contains all of items of the remaining requests. With
respect to your request that the District create a spreadsheet with this
information, please be advised that the District has no duty to create records
that do not exist…. Haynie v. Superior Court (2015) 26 Cal.4th 1061 ….
Moreover, none of information requested will be made available to you because
it is exempt from disclosure under the CPRA and case law.  (Gov. Code, §§ 7927.705 and 7928.405; Freedom Foundation v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 47….)
 
(Id. ¶ 16, Exh. L.)  
 
LEGAL STANDARD  
 
A.             
California Public Records Act 
 
Pursuant to the CPRA, Gov. Code § 7921.000, et
seq., individual citizens have a right to access government records.  In enacting the CPRA, the California
Legislature declared that “access to information concerning the conduct of the
people’s business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this
state.”  (Gov. Code, § 7921.000; see also
County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2012)
211 Cal.App.4th 57, 63.)   Significantly,
Article
1, Section 3(b) of the Constitution affirms that “[t]he people have the right
of access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business.”  The Constitution mandates that the CPRA be
“broadly construed,” while any statute “that limits the right of access” must
be “narrowly construed.”  (See Nat’l
Lawyers Guild v. City of Hayward (2020) 9 Cal.5th 488, 507.)  
 
To establish an agency has a duty to disclose
under the CPRA, the petitioner must establish that the record qualifies as a
“public record” and the record is “in the possession of the agency.”  (See Anderson-Barker v Sup.Ct. (2019)
31 Cal.App.5th 528, 538.)  However,
exemptions under the CPRA must be narrowly construed and the agency bears the
burden of showing that a specific exemption applies.  (Sacramento
County Employees’ Retirement System v. Superior Court (2013) 195
Cal.App.4th 440, 453.)  “Because the agency has full
knowledge of the contents of the withheld records and the requester has only
the agency’s affidavits and descriptions of the documents, its affidavits must
be specific enough to give the requester ‘a meaningful opportunity to contest’
the withholding of the documents.”  (ACLU of Northern Cal. v. Sup.Ct. (2011) 202
Cal.App.4th 55, 83, citation omitted.)
 
B.             
Demurrer 
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the
grounds for a demurrer must appear on the face of the pleading or from
judicially noticeable matters. (Code Civil Proc. § 430.30, subd. (a); Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “We assume the truth of the
allegations in the complaint, but do not assume the truth of contentions,
deductions, or conclusions of law.”  (California Logistics, Inc. v.
State (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 242, 247.)  “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters.”  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  The
allegations in the petition must be liberally construed in favor of Petitioner
on demurrer.  (See Mobil Oil Corp. v
Exxon Corp. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 942, 947.)  “A demurrer must dispose of an entire
cause of action to be sustained.”  (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 


 
DISCUSSION 
 
            A.        Petitioner’s Allegations Are Sufficient
for Pleading Purposes 
 
            Respondent demurs to
the petition because “the requested records do not exist, and the law is clear
that the District need not create them.” 
(Respondent’s Memorandum of Points & Authorities at 2:2-3.)  According to Respondent, Petitioner has
“acknowledged” and “admitted” that “there are no responsive records to the
remaining requests.”  (Id. at
5:11-17.)  Respondent’s counsel
mischaracterizes the petition.  The
petition alleged that the LAUSD took that position.  (See pet. ¶ 16 & Exh. L.)  The petition does not “acknowledge” or
“admit” that the LAUSD’s position is true. 
For example, Petitioner
attached to Respondent’s letters, dated August 4, 2023, and September 15, 2023,
in which Respondent’s counsel asserted that “the District does
not have a responsive record that contains all of items requested.”  (Pet. Exh. J, L.)  By attaching these letters to the petition,
Petitioner admitted only that Respondent’s counsel made factual assertions
about Respondent’s search for responsive records, not that the assertions were
true.  
            
            In
fact, the
petition alleges that Respondent has not complied with the CPRA in several
ways.  Petitioner
alleges that Respondent did not perform an adequate search for records
responsive to the June 2023 and September 2023 Requests and seeks a writ
directing Respondent “to perform a proper search for responsive documents and
to disclose all responsive records.” 
(See Pet. ¶¶ 17,
48, 52.)  Petitioner further contends
that Respondent improperly relied on Freedom Foundation and Government
Code section 7928.410 to withhold responsive records, including because, unlike
in Freedom Foundation, the requested information is not contained in a
“custom report” used for labor negotiations and because Respondent possesses
the “raw data” that Petitioner requested. 
(Id. ¶¶ 3-4, 42-43.)  This
is sufficient at the pleading stage.      
 
Respondent
relies on Haynie v. Superior Court (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1061, 1075, which
held that an agency does not have a duty under the CPRA to prepare a list of
potentially responsive records with the agency’s “initial response.”  The petition does not seek an order
compelling Respondent to prepare a list of potentially responsive records with
its “initial response.”  Haynie does
not address the circumstances in which an agency may be ordered by a trial
court, after a trial on a CPRA petition, to produce public records that contain
“raw data” requested by a CPRA requestor. 
“An opinion is not authority for propositions not
considered.’”  (People v. Knoller (2007)
41 Cal.4th 139, 154-55.)  Under the CPRA, “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall
be available for inspection by any person requesting the record after deletion
of the portions that are exempted by law.” 
(Gov. Code § 7922.525(b); see also Freedom Foundation v. Superior
Court
(2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 47, 57-59 [discussing circumstances in which requested
information may be reasonably segregable and disclosable under the CPRA].)  Thus, depending on the facts
proven at trial regarding the nature of Respondent’s records, it is possible
that Petitioner could show that Respondent has a duty to disclose “reasonably
segregable portion[s]” of public records that contain the information that
Petitioner seeks.  
 
Finally, a public agency also has a legal duty to “assist[] the
requester in formulating reasonable requests, because of the [agency’s]
superior knowledge about the contents of its records” and the “the agency is
obligated to make reasonable efforts toward clarification and production.”  (Community Youth Athletic Center v. City
of National City (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1418.  A public agency shall, among other things, “[a]ssist the member of the public to
identify records and information that are responsive to the request or to the
purpose of the request, if stated” and “[p]rovide suggestions for overcoming
any practical basis for denying access to the records or information
sought.”  (Gov.
Code § 7922.600(a).)  Here, Petitioner
alleges that Respondent has “fail[ed] to cooperate and assist CPC with its
Public Records Act request under Government Code section 7922.600” and it seeks
a writ directing Respondent “to assist Petitioner in identifying responsive
documents as required under Government Code section 7922.600.”  (Pet. ¶¶ 48.c and 52.e.)  The court cannot resolve that issue on
demurrer.  
 
B.        Respondent does not
Demonstrate that all Responsive Records are Exempt 
 
Respondent contends that “any potentially
responsive record is, indeed, otherwise exempt from disclosure as explicitly
mandated by Government Code section 7928.410 and affirmed in Freedom
Foundation v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 47.”  (Respondent’s
Memorandum of Points & Authorities at 6:12-14.)  CPRA exemptions must be narrowly construed
and the agency bears the burden of showing that a specific exemption
applies.  (Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System v. Superior Court
(2013) 195 Cal.App.4th 440, 453.)  Respondent
fails to establish a CPRA exemption based solely on the allegations in the
pleadings.  Simply, the court cannot
determine whether an exemption applies to part, or all, of a requested public
record without more evidence about the nature of the withheld records.  The court acknowledges that the petition
alleges that, prior to June 2023, Respondent has produced similar information
requested by Petitioner in response to prior CPRA requests.  (See Reply 3:1-17 and 5:25-27; see also Pet.
¶¶ 2-3 and Exh. B-E.)  The court requires
a full evidentiary record to resolve the issue of exemptions.  
 
Moreover, the
extent to which Freedom Foundation and Government Code section 7928.410
apply to the records requested by Petitioner is a disputed factual and legal
issue that must be decided at trial.  Freedom
Foundation concerned Government Code section 6254 (renumbered as section
7928.405), which exempts records relating to the collective bargaining process
that reveal a state agency’s “deliberative processes, impressions, evaluations,
opinions, recommendations, meeting minutes, research, work products, theory, or
strategy, or that provide instruction, advice, or training to employees who do
not have full collective bargaining and representation rights . . . .”  (Gov. Code § 7928.405(a).)  Government Code section 7928.410 provides an
identical exemption with respect to local agencies.  (See Gov. Code § 7928.410(a).)  On the face of the request, the court cannot
determine whether any responsive records necessarily fall within the scope of
this exemption.  Indeed, in Freedom
Foundation, the court was able to resolve the issue only after a hearing on
the merits.

            Based upon the foregoing, the court
orders as follows:
 
            1.         The
demurrer is overruled.
