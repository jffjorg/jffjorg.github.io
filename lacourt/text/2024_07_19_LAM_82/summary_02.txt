And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Julia Silva's special motion to dismiss, or "anti-SLAPP" motion, which argues that her communications with Petitioner, a cannabis business, were related to her representation of the City of Baldwin Park in connection with a federal lawsuit and potential litigation. The judge found that Silva's communications, including a "counter-settlement demand letter" and a "cease-and-desist letter", were protected by the anti-SLAPP statute because they were made in connection with a judicial proceeding or other official proceeding authorized by law. The judge also found that Silva demonstrates a likelihood of success on the merits because Petitioner seeks relief against the City, not Silva, and there is no basis to obtain relief against Silva in her individual capacity.
