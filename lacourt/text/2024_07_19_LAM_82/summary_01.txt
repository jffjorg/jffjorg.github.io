And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is overruled. The LAUSD has argued that the requested records do not exist and that it does not have a duty to create them. However, the Judge finds that the allegations in the petition are sufficient to state a claim and that the LAUSD has not demonstrated that all responsive records are exempt from disclosure.

The Judge notes that the LAUSD has a legal duty to assist the requester in formulating reasonable requests and to provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records. The Judge also finds that the LAUSD has failed to cooperate and assist the petitioner in identifying responsive documents as required under Government Code section 7922.600.

The Judge concludes that the case should proceed to trial to determine whether the LAUSD has a duty to disclose the requested records and whether any exemptions apply. The Judge sets a trial date and orders the parties to file their briefs in advance of trial.
