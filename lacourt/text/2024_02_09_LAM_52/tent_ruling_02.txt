 Case Number:  23STCV20205    Hearing Date:   February 9, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default Money Judgment; Order to Show
Cause Re: Why Plaintiff Should Not Pay $150 in Sanctions Under Rule 3.110(h)
            Plaintiff Foothill Capital Group, LLC brings an
unlawful detainer action against defendant Alvaro M Luna aka Alvaro Ramiro
Montesinos Luna.  
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.110(h) provides, “When a default is entered, the party
who requested the entry of default must obtain a default judgment against the
defaulting party within 45 days after the default was entered, unless the court
has granted an extension of time.  The
court may issue an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed if
that party fails to obtain entry of judgment against a defaulting party or to
request an extension of time to apply for a default judgment within that time.”  
On
January 5, 2024, the court held a hearing on the order to show cause re: entry
of default money judgment.  The court found
plaintiff had not timely applied for a default judgment for the money demanded
in its complaint.  Plaintiff still has
not done so.  Plaintiff also did not
request an extension of time to apply for default judgment.
The
court further ordered plaintiff to show cause why it should not pay $150 in
sanctions under California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(h).  Plaintiff did not timely respond to the order
to show cause.  “Responsive papers to an
order to show cause issued under this rule must be filed and served at least 5
calendar days before the hearing.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.110(i).)  The
court finds sanctions are appropriate.  
The court issues $150 in sanctions against
plaintiff Foothill Capital Group, LLC under California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(h).
The order to show cause re: entry of default money judgment
is hereby continued to March 15, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
