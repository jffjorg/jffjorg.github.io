And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling discusses the function of IP addresses and whether a website operator is considered an electronic communications service provider. The ruling notes that IP addresses are essential to Internet technology and are used to identify computers on the Internet. The Judge also references various court cases that have addressed the use of IP addresses, including Nat'l Cable & Telecomm. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Svcs. and United States v. Yu.

The Judge concludes that a website operator is indeed an electronic communications service provider, as they obtain IP addresses of users accessing their website. The Judge rejects the Plaintiff's argument that the Defendant is not an electronic communications service provider, citing the broad definition of "electronic communications" in the Pen. Code.

The ruling also notes that IP address information, by itself, cannot identify a particular person, and that website operators gather IP address information for various purposes, including evaluating usage patterns and troubleshooting problems.
