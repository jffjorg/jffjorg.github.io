 Hearing Date:  January 21, 2025
 Calendar Number:  4



 
 
 
Plaintiff Shawnette Snowden (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order
approving the settlement in this Private Attorney General Act (“PAGA”) case.
 
The Court requests that Plaintiff provide a concise
memorandum of costs showing the costs that have been expended thus far so that
it can determine their reasonableness.
 
Additionally, the Court reduces the services award to
Plaintiff from $10,000.00 to $5,000.00.
 
The Court is tentatively prepared to approve the settlement
once these issues are resolved.
 
Background
 
On November 28, 2022, Plaintiff served Defendant and Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”) with a
Notice of Violations and draft complaint specifying the PAGA claims raised
against Defendant in this action. The 65-day waiting period on Plaintiff’s
right to file a PAGA action passed. LWDA has not notified Plaintiff that it
intended or intends to investigate the claims in the PAGA notice.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on February 22, 2023 as a class
action. The Complaint claims for (1) unfair competition; (2) failure to pay
minimum wages; (3) failure to pay overtime wages; (4) failure to provide
required meal periods; (5) failure to provide required rest periods; (6)
failure to reimburse employees for required expenses; (7) failure to provide
wages when due; (8) failure to provide accurate itemized statements; (9)
failure to provide gratuities; and (10) violation of PAGA.
 
Defendant subsequently produced an arbitration which
purportedly barred Plaintiff’s class action claims. Plaintiff filed a request
for dismissal of the class action claims.
 
On June 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed the First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”), raising a single cause of action for civil penalties under
PAGA.
 
On May 2, 2024, the parties participated in an all-day
mediation presided over by Steve Mehta. (Lapuyade Decl. ¶ 14.) In advance of
the mediation, Defendant produced the total number of Aggrieved Employees and
pay periods, the employ employee handbooks, and a 52% sample of the Aggrieved
Employees time and payroll data. (Lapuyade Decl. ¶ 15.)
 
The mediation resulted in the settlement of the PAGA claims
(the “Settlement”). (Lapuyade Decl. ¶ 16.) The settlement was the result of
arm’s-length negotiations with the assistance of the mediator. (Lapuyade Decl.
¶ 16.)
 
On December 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for
approval of the Settlement.
 
Legal Standard
 
Settlement
 
The PAGA is “a procedural
statute allowing an aggrieved employee to recover civil penalties—for Labor
Code violations—that otherwise would be sought by state labor law enforcement
agencies.” (Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court
(2009) 46 Cal.4th 993, 1003.)  The statute provides a mechanism for
private enforcement of Labor Code violations for the public benefit. (See Arias
v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 986; Ochoa-Hernandez v. Cjaders Foods, Inc. (N.D.Cal. 2010) 2010 WL 1340777, at
p. *4.)   
 
To incentivize employees to
bring PAGA actions, the statute provides aggrieved employees 25 percent of the
recovered civil penalties. (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (i).) The remaining 75 percent
is distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”) “for
enforcement of labor laws and education of employers and employees about their
rights and responsibilities under [the Labor Code].” (Id.) 
In reviewing the terms of a
settlement agreement, courts determine whether the settlement is fair,
reasonable, and adequate to all concerned, and not the product of fraud,
collusion, or overreaching. (Reed v. United Teachers Los Angeles (2012)
208 Cal.App.4th 322, 337; Nordstrom Commission Cases (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 576, 581.) Although a PAGA plaintiff need not satisfy class action
requirements (see Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 975),
general principles applicable to class action settlements apply equally in this
context. 
In the context of a class
action settlement, courts consider various factors including whether (1) the
settlement is the result of arm’s length bargaining, (2) investigation and
discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently,
(3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation, and (4) the percentage of
objectors is small. (Nordstrom, supra, 186 Cal.App.4th at 581; Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224,
245.) The final factor is not
applicable to PAGA. (See Arias, supra 46 Cal.4th at p. 984
[rejecting the argument that representative actions under PAGA violate the due
process rights of “nonparty aggrieved employees who are not given notice of,
and an opportunity to be heard”].) “Because many of the factors used to evaluate
class action settlements bear on a settlement's fairness—including the strength
of the plaintiff's case, the risk, the stage of the proceeding, the complexity
and likely duration of further litigation, and the settlement amount—these
factors can be useful in evaluating the fairness of a PAGA settlement.” (Moniz
v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 77.) Furthermore, “a trial
court should … determine whether [the settlement] is fair, reasonable, and
adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor law violations,
deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.” (Ibid.)
In considering the amount of
settlement, courts must be mindful that compromise is inherent and necessary in
the settlement process. (Wershba, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at 250.) 
 
A proposed PAGA settlement must be submitted to LWDA
at the same time that it is submitted to the court for review and
approval.  (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)
 
Attorney’s Fees Under Settlement
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.769(b) requires that
“[a]ny agreement… with respect to the payment of attorney fees or the
submission of an application for the approval of attorney fees must be set
forth in full in any application for approval of the dismissal or settlement of
an action that has been certified as a class action.” Despite any agreement by
the parties to the contrary, “the court ha[s] an independent right and
responsibility to review the attorney fee provision of the settlement agreement
and award only so much as it determined reasonable.” (Garabedian v. Los
Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 123, 128.)
 
Discussion
 
Notice to LWDA
 
Plaintiff has submitted the proposed settlement to LWDA and
will submit a copy of the Court’s judgment and order approving the settlement
within 10 days of each. (Lapuyade Decl. ¶ 18.)
 
Fairness of Settlement
 
 
The Settlement is intended to release the PAGA claims of the
Aggrieved Employees, Plaintiff, the LWDA, and the State of California. This is
only a settlement of the PAGA claims for civil penalties and is not a class
settlement. The Settlement does not release any individual wage claims that the
Aggrieved Employees may have.
 
The PAGA settlement covers roughly 132 employees for the
period of November 28, 2021 to June 1, 2024 (the “PAGA Period”).
 
The parties reached the settlement after a full day’s
mediation as well as follow-up negotiations. As discussed above, Plaintiff
obtained substantial informal discovery in advance of the mediation, including
the pay records for over half of the Aggrieved Employees.
 
The gross settlement amount is $135,000.00. (Lapuyade Decl.
¶ 19.) Based on the data and information provided in mediation, Plaintiff
estimated that Defendant’s theoretical maximum PAGA liability exposure is
approximately $640,500.00, or $961,200.00 if the Court were to allow Plaintiff
to stack both Labor Code penalties and civil PAGA penalties. (Lapuyade Decl. ¶¶
20-21.) Given the costs and risks of litigation, as well as the Court’s
statutory power to reduce PAGA awards where the full penalty would be unjust
(Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (e)(2)), the gross settlement amount represents a
fair compromise of the PAGA claims.
 
The Settlement provides for a 33.33 percent attorney fee of
$45,000.00 and litigation costs not to exceed $20,000.00. (Lapuyade Decl., Ex.
1 (“Settlement”) at § 3.2.1.) $6,000.00 of the gross amount is allocated to claims
administration costs. (Settlement at § 3.2.2.) The Settlement also provides for
a $10,000.00 service award to be provided to Plaintiff. (Settlement at § 3.2.)
If the Court approves a lower amount, the remainder will be retained by the
settlement administrator for distribution.
 
After these deductions, it is estimated that the remaining
amount will be $54,00.00 (the “PAGA Penalties Payment”). 
 
            Of
the PAGA Penalties payment, 75 percent shall be paid to the LWDA. (Settlement
at § 1.12.) The remaining 25 percent shall be paid to the Aggrieved Employees
on a pro rata basis according to the number of pay periods each Aggrieved
Employee worked during the PAGA Period. (Settlement at § 1.13.)
 
            Plaintiff’s
lodestar value for attorney’s fees is $31,122.00. Thus, the fee award is
relatively close to the lodestar. Plaintiff provides the billing records of her
attorneys in this matter. (Zakay Decl., Ex. 2.) Plaintiff also provides a “firm
resume” setting forth her attorneys’ experience. (Zakay Decl., Ex. 1.) The
Court finds the attorney fee to be reasonable.
 
It is unclear exactly what figure in costs Plaintiff’s attorneys
expect to claim. Plaintiff variously states that cost figures of $13,881.63 and
$16,065.00. In any event, this figure is not final, because there are expected
to be some additional costs that accrue. This costs figure appears unusually
large. The Court requests that Plaintiff provide a concise memorandum of the
costs expended thus far so that the Court can determine their reasonableness. 
 
            The
$10,000.00 service award to Plaintiff is too large given the scope of this
litigation and the size of the gross settlement. The Court reduces this amount
to $5,000.00.
