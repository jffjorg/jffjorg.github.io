And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling of Judge [name] is regarding the motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Laurie Jimenez in a libel case brought by Plaintiff Rick Geissler. The Court grants the motion to compel, but orders that the deposition of Nichole Geissler, Plaintiff's daughter and Defendant's niece, should be completed first. The parties are encouraged to work out the dates for the deposition, and if they cannot, the Court will select the dates. The Court does not award sanctions. The case revolves around a text message sent by Defendant to David Kueffer alleging that Plaintiff molested his children, which Plaintiff claims is false and has damaged his family relationships. The Defendant failed to appear for her deposition, and the parties have engaged in meet and confer efforts regarding the deposition. The Court finds that both parties share some fault in the delay, but ultimately grants the motion to compel with the condition that Nichole's deposition be completed first.
