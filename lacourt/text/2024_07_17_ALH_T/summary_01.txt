And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel further verified responses to form interrogatories, set three, No. 17.1. The plaintiff failed to provide substantive responses to requests for admissions (RFAs) nos. 23-24 and merely repeated allegations from the complaint and asserted boilerplate objections to RFAs nos. 25-28. The plaintiff also failed to oppose the motion. The judge finds it reasonable to impose monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel in the amount of $840 for 4 hours of work incurred or anticipated at an hourly rate of $195, plus a $60 filing fee. The plaintiff must provide further code-compliant verified responses within 20 days, and the plaintiff and plaintiff's counsel must pay the monetary sanctions within the same timeframe.
