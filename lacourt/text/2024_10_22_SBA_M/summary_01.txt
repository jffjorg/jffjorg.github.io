And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a series of motions filed by Plaintiff Rachel Perez. The motions seek to deem several requests for admissions admitted, as well as to compel responses to discovery requests and to impose sanctions on the defendants for their failure to respond.

The judge denies Plaintiff's motions to deem the requests for admissions admitted, finding that the defendants have served verified responses to the requests.

The judge also denies Plaintiff's motions to compel responses to discovery requests, finding that the motions are moot since the defendants have already served responses.

However, the judge denies Plaintiff's requests for monetary sanctions, finding that the notices of motion failed to comply with the relevant statute and that self-represented litigants cannot recover attorney fees as discovery sanctions.

The judge orders Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
