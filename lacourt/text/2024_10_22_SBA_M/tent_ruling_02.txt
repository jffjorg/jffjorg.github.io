ABM Industry
Group, LLC’s Demurrer to Complaint     
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING

ABM Industry Group, LLC’s Demurrer to Complaint is overruled.

 
Background 
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on August 9, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff slipped and fell at the premises of
Defendants. Plaintiff alleges causes of action for negligence and premises
liability.
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendant filed a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41. (Decl., Dane W. Schrader, ¶¶ 2-3.)
 
Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of
action.”  (Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) 
"Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer." 
(Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure §
430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
            Defendant’s
demurrer to the Complaint is overruled.  Plaintiff
states facts sufficient to state the causes of action and the causes of action
are not uncertain. 
            “To
state a cause of action for negligence, a plaintiff must allege (1) the
defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care, (2) the defendant breached that
duty, and (3) the breach proximately caused the plaintiff's damages or
injuries.” Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (2013) 221
Cal.App.4th 49, 62. The elements of a cause of action for premises liability
are the same as those for negligence. Accordingly, the plaintiff must prove,
legal duty to use due care, a breach of such legal duty, and the breach as the
proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.” Jones v. Awad (2019)
39 Cal.App.5th 1200, 1207 (internal citations and quotations omitted).
 
            Plaintiff
has alleged facts to meet all the elements of the causes of action including
the existence of a duty of care, breach of the duty, causation, and damages.
(Complaint, pages 4-5.) Defendant argues that particular facts such as the
specific location of the fall and the substance which caused Plaintiff to fall
must be pled. However, Plaintiff is only required to allege general and not
specific facts to state causes of action for negligence and premises liability.
The allegations are sufficiently stated in a manner to allow Defendant the
opportunity to respond. 
 
            “Demurrers for uncertainty under
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) (sic)
are disfavored. A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.
A demurrer for uncertainty should be overruled when the
facts as to which the complaint is uncertain are presumptively within the
defendant's knowledge.” Chen v. Berenjian (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th
811, 822 (internal citations and quotations omitted).  The facts that Defendant seeks can easily be
obtained in the discovery process. 
 
As to Defendant’s
argument that it is not a public entity, Defendant relies on facts outside the
scope of the pleadings to which no judicial notice was sought. In addition, the
second cause of action does not merely rely on Count 3 but upon other facts set
forth in that cause of action.
 
            Therefore,
Defendant’s demurrer is overruled.
 
Defendant is ordered
to file and serve an Answer within 10 days of this date. 
 
Plaintiff is ordered
to give notice of this ruling.
