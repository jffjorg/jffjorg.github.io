  Case No.:  20STCV17625 
 
 
  Hearing Date:  April 25, 2024 
 
[TENTATIVE] order RE: 
Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file motion for
  summary judgment  



 
Procedural
Background 
This is an action for employment retaliation. The First
Amended Complaint (FAC) alleges that Plaintiffs Chad Jensen and Michael
Neaderbaomer (Plaintiffs) are police officers for the City of Pomona, who were
retaliated against by their superiors following indictments for use of
excessive force, notwithstanding later being acquitted of these charges. 
The Complaint was filed on May 8, 2020. A demurrer was
sustained with leave to amend as to the original complaint on October 15, 2020,
and the FAC was filed on October 30, 2020, alleging four causes of action:
1.     Retaliation
(Lab. Code § 1102.5)
2.     Violation
of Gov. Code § 3300
3.     Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
4.     Declaratory
Relief
On April 19, 2021, the court overruled Pomona’s demurrer to
the second and third causes of action, and denied its motion to strike.
Defendant Oliveieri’s and Cooper’s demurrers and motions to strike were
sustained and granted without leave to amend, and an order of dismissal was
entered as to these Defendants. On May 7, 2021, following supplemental
briefing, Pomona’s demurrer was sustained as to the fourth cause of action for
declaratory relief.
On July 29, 2022, this court denied Pomona’s motion for
summary judgment.
On August 9, 2022, this court denied Plaintiff’s motion to disqualify
Defendant’s counsel.
On March 8, 2023, this court continued trial in this matter
pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, but concluded that the parties had
not shown good cause to continue discovery or other deadlines related to the
trial. In the same order, the court stated that any party wishing to file a
motion for summary relief would have to file the motion in relation to the
then-current August 21, 2023 trial date. Trial was continued to November 6,
2023.
On June 5, 2023, this court granted in part Pomona’s motion
to bifurcate, directing that the jury would hear all actions and issue only an
advisory verdict on the second cause of action, which the court would then
consider.
From October 31, 2023, to the present, trial was continued
based on the parties’ stipulation and for various defects in the parties’ long
cause submission packets.
Plaintiff filed a motion for summary adjudication on
February 15, 2024. On February 29, 2024, this court noted that the motion was
tardy in relation to the earlier trial date set for August 21, 2023, and
ordered supplemental briefing on whether Plaintiff could be granted leave to
file the motion.
Plaintiffs filed their brief on March 15, 2024. Defendant
filed its brief on March 29, 2024. 
 
Legal
Standard  
(2)
Notice of the motion and supporting papers shall be served on all other parties
to the action at least 75 days before the time appointed for hearing. If the
notice is served by mail, the required 75-day period of notice shall be
increased by 5 days if the place of address is within the State of California,
10 days if the place of address is outside the State of California but within
the United States, and 20 days if the place of address is outside the United
States. If the notice is served by facsimile transmission, express mail, or
another method of delivery providing for overnight delivery, the required
75-day period of notice shall be increased by two court days.
(3)
The motion shall be heard no later than 30 days before the date of trial,
unless the court for good cause orders otherwise. The filing of the motion
shall not extend the time within which a party must otherwise file a responsive
pleading.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (a)(2), (3).) 
The present motion addresses the
second of these subsections, and whether Plaintiffs’ motion for summary
adjudication, filed on February 15, 2024, long after the initial August 21,
2023 trial date, is timely brought, and whether good cause for its filing is
required or has been shown. 
Discussion
Plaintiffs motion cannot be denied by
reference to the August 21, 2023 trial date, which has since been continued.
Although the summary judgment statute requires the motion to be heard “no later
than 30 days before the date of trial” (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (a)(3)),
“the 30–day time limit on summary judgment hearings should be calculated based
on the trial date in existence when the motion is noticed regardless of whether
that date is the original trial date or not.” (Green v. Bristol Myers Co.
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 604, 609.)
Defendant argues that the trial date in effect at the time
Plaintiffs’ noticed their motion was November 6, 2023, meaning their motion was
untimely. (Opposition at pp. 7–8.) It is true that at the time Plaintiffs filed
their notice of motion on February 15, 2024, the previous trial date of
November 6, 2023, had come and gone, held in abeyance by the necessity of the
parties’ preparation of long-cause packets which required repeated alteration.
But this does not bar Plaintiffs’ motion. November 6, 2023, passed without the
commencement of trial, and at the time Plaintiffs’ filed their motion, there
was no possibility that trial could begin or end within the time previously
allotted by the court. At the time Plaintiffs’ filed their motion, there was,
essentially, no trial date. 
Further actions by the court have obviated whatever technical
impediments might have attached to the timing of Plaintiffs’ motion. Since that
motion was filed, the court on April 8, 2024, held a trial setting conference,
setting the trial date for April 21, 2025. The motion, now set for hearing on
August 23, 2024, is timely in relation to this trial date.
Defendant argues that because this case was ready for trial, and
inadvertently delayed, Plaintiffs cannot avail themselves of the new trial date
in bringing their motion. (Opposition at pp. 7–8.) But Defendant presents no
authority to support this contention, and the authority that exists holds to
the contrary: “Because petitioners' motion for summary judgment was filed
within the time limits set by section 437c, they have a right to have their
motion heard before the start of trial.” (Cole v. Superior Court (2022)
87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.) 
Defendant further argues that Plaintiff’s motion, which addresses
the second cause of action under Government Code § 3300, is already set for a
bench trial, and involves factual matters ill-suited for summary disposition.
(Opposition at pp. 8–9, 11–13.) But Defendant offers no authority for the
proposition that a timely-filed motion for summary adjudication can be denied
on a preliminary determination as to its merits. Any such determination is
properly made at the hearing on the motion.
Defendant finally argues that if Plaintiff is permitted to bring a
motion for summary adjudication, it should be permitted to file a second motion
— its prior motion was denied on July 29, 2022 —  based on “newly discovered facts or
circumstances or a change of law.” (Opposition at p. 13.) Defendant argues that
because Plaintiffs have retired, they are no longer entitled to equitable
relief, and must now prove malice to receive relief under Government Code §
3309.5, subd. (e). (Opposition at p. 13.)
            Defendant’s
brief, one-paragraph argument in its opposition briefing is insufficient for
the court to make any determination as to whether another motion for summary judgment
is justified based on newly discovered circumstances. Defendant must make a
motion. 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s motion for summary
adjudication is timely and may proceed as scheduled.
