```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's demurrer to the second cause of action for fraud in the First Amended Cross-Complaint is overruled. The plaintiff had argued that the fraud claim was pleaded with insufficient particularity and that the defendant was engaged in impermissible claim-splitting across multiple litigations. The judge found that the fraud claim had been sufficiently pleaded with particularity and that the defendant had added contextual allegations to the claim. The judge also found that the plaintiff's arguments about the defendant's alleged fraud did not warrant the dismissal of the claim. Therefore, the demurrer was overruled.
