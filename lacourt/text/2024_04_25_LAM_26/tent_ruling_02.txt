 Case Number:  22STCV13647    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  26 ELIEZER APPEL V. MARK A. LIKER, M.D.Hearing Date:             April  25, 2024 Moving Party:             Cross-Defendant  Eliezer Appel Responding Party:      Cross-Complainant  Mark A. Liker   (1)   Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant’s Demurrer  to First Amended Cross-Complaint  The Demurrer is OVERRULED. Background On April 25,  2022, Plaintiff Eliezer Appel (“Plaintiff”) filed the operative Complaint against Defendants Mark A. Liker, M.D.,  Airlux Aircraft, Inc., and LG Aviation Inc. (“Defendants”) asserting three causes of  action: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Quantum Meruit, and (3) Express and Implied Indemnity.             Defendant  Liker filed a cross-complaint on May 27, 2022, alleging two causes of action  against Plaintiff for breach of fiduciary duty and fraud. On June 23, 2023,  this court overruled Appel’s demurrer to the first cause of action for breach  of fiduciary duty, and sustained the demurrer as to the second cause of action  for fraud, with leave to amend.             Liker  filed an amended cross-complaint on July 13, 2023, alleging the same causes of  action. Appel filed the present demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint  (FAXC) on August 7, 2023. Liker filed an opposition on February 1, 2024.    Allegations of the  FAXC The FAXC alleges  as follows. From 2018 through 2020, Appel advised Liker on many legal matters.  (FAXC ¶ 7.) Appel convinced Liker to transfer title to certain real property to  shell companies owned by Appel, in order to shield them from liability. (FAXC  ¶¶ 9–11.) Appel similarly convinced Liker to transfer more than $400,000 to a  company owned by Appel’s associate. (FAXC ¶ 17.) When Liker demanded his property  back, Appel refused to return it, claiming that Liker owed him money. (FAXC ¶  26.) Although Liker was able to obtain title to his real property again through  negotiations with the officer of the shell company, Appel directed the  encumbrance of the property with a loan secured by a deed of trust. (FAXC ¶¶  36–37.) The property has since been subject to a notice of default on the loan.  (FAXC ¶ 39.)  Legal Standard A demurrer should be sustained only where  the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code  Civ. Pro., §§ 430.30, et seq.) In  particular, as is relevant here, a court should sustain a demurrer if a  complaint does not allege facts that are legally sufficient to constitute a  cause of action. (See id. § 430.10, subd. (e).) As the Supreme  Court held in Blank v. Kirwan (1985)  39 Cal.3d 311: “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly  pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. . . .  Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a  whole and its parts in their context.” (Id. at p. 318; see also Hahn.  v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 [“A demurrer tests the pleadings  alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only  where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”)  “In determining whether the complaint is  sufficient as against the demurrer … if on consideration of all the facts  stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of the  court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the facts  may not be clearly stated.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193  Cal.App.2d 636, 639.) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly  construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because  ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v.  Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Such demurrers “are  disfavored, and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a  defendant cannot reasonably respond.” (Mahan  v. Charles W. Chan Insurance Agency, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848.) A demurrer should not be sustained without  leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of  action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can  be cured by amendment. (Schifando v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 31  Cal.4th at p. 1081.) The demurrer also may be sustained without leave to amend  where the nature of the defects and previous unsuccessful attempts to plead  render it probable plaintiff cannot state a cause of action. (Krawitz v.  Rusch (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 957, 967.) Discussion Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant  Eliezer Appel (Appel) demurs to the second cause of action for fraud in the  First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC) of Mark Liker (Liker). Appel argues that  the fraud claim is pleaded with insufficient particularity, and further that  Liker is engaged in impermissible claim-splitting across multiple litigations,  and that his claims here should be abated. (Demurrer at pp. 2–9.) The second  argument will be addressed first. “Under the statutory plea in abatement, the  pendency of another earlier action growing out of the same transaction and  between the same parties is a ground for abatement of the second action.. A  statutory plea in abatement requires that the prior pending action be between  the same parties on the same cause of action.” (People ex rel.  Garamendi v. American Autoplan, Inc. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 770,  internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted.)  There is no  cause to abate any claim alleged by Liker here. Appel raises three other cases  which he contends concern the same parties and claims. (Demurrer at pp. 8–9.)  Yet in the first — 20CHCV00631, Liker v. Cochran, Inc.— Appel is not a  party. In the second — 20VECV01388, Liker v. Appel — both Appel and  Liker are parties, but the case concerns neither the real property nor the  trust funds at issue in the present case. (See 20VECV01388, 8/30/2023  Second Amended Complaint.) And in the third — 21CHCV00316, lucy Holdings v.  Krupe Industries — Liker is not a party. Thus the conditions for abatement  are not met. This leaves  Appel’s argument as to fraud. The elements of fraud are: (1) misrepresentation  or concealment, (2) knowledge of its falsity, (3) intent to defraud, (4)  justifiable reliance and (5) resulting damage. (Gil v. Bank of America, Nat.  Ass'n (2006) 138 Cal. App. 4th 1371, 1381; Barbara A. v. John G. (1983)  145 C.A.3d 369, 376.)  Fraud causes of action must be pleaded with  particularity, meaning that the plaintiff must allege “how, when, where, to  whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12  Cal.4th 631, 645.) Against a corporate employer, a plaintiff must plead “the  names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their  authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it  was said or written.” (Id. at p. 645.) This Court  previously sustained Appel’s demurrer to the fraud claim on the grounds that it  lacked particularity, specifically as to the context of the alleged  misrepresentations. (See 6/23/2023 Order.) Appel here argues that the  FAXC has failed to fix the defect, and does not allege: (1) how Appel controls  the shell companies identified in the FAXC that took ownership of the real  property at issue; (2) what representations Appel made about his relationship with  the companies; (3) what Liker understood Appel to mean by “asset protection”  with respect to the transfers at issue; (4) how Liker could transfer more than  $400,000 to a 1031 exchange account; (5) how Appel exercised control over the  trust funds after the transfer; (6) what Liker means when he claims that he  transferred his property to the “effective ownership” of Appel; and  (7) how Appel managed to use the transferred  funds to his own benefit. (Demurrer at pp. 4–7.) None of the  above omissions materially impacts the fraud claim or warrants its dismissal.  Since the ruling on the prior demurrer, Liker has added contextual allegations  to the claim, specifying that Appel made the representations to Liker through  direct statements in meetings in Los Angeles. (FAXC ¶ 51.) Liker has thus  offered the necessary how, when, where, to whom, and by what means these  representations were made. He is not required to offer greater specificity as  to the precise internal mechanics of Appel’s alleged fraud, and it would be  impractical to require a plaintiff to allege the same. (See Tenet Healthsystem Desert, Inc. v. Blue  Cross of California (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 821, 837-38 [“[L]ess specificity  is required of a complaint when “ ‘it appears from the nature of the  allegations that the defendant must necessarily possess full information  concerning the facts of the controversy.”].)             The  demurrer is therefore OVERRULED.              Moving  party to give notice.   Dated:  April 25, 2024   _______________________ Yolanda Orozco Judge of the  Superior Court
