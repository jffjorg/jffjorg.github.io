Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Ricardo Sanchez regarding the second amended cross-complaint of Cain Sanchez, David Sanchez, and Yans Holding LLC. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend as to the second cause of action for breach of contract asserted by Yans Holding LLC, and as to the fifth and seventh causes of action. The motion to strike is denied.

The court finds that the plaintiff, Ricardo Sanchez, has stated a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation, and therefore punitive damages are available. The motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages is denied.

The court concludes that the plaintiff has stated a cause of action for breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, quiet title, declaratory relief, TRO and injunction, accounting, constructive trust, and breach of fiduciary duty, and the demurrer is overruled as to all other causes of action.
