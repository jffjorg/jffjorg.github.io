[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
CROSS-DEFENDANT’S DEMURRER AND MOTION TO STRIKE
  PORTIONS OF THE SECOND AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT 
 



 
Procedural
Background 
 
On
November 22, 2022, Plaintiff Ricardo Sanchez (“Ricardo”)1 filed the instant breach of
contract and quiet title action against Defendants Cain Sanchez Jr. (“Cain”),
Dependable Pallet Logistic, Inc. (“DPL”), Yong Yu Sanchez (“Yong Yu”), and Yans
Holding LLC (“Yans”) (collectively “Defendants”).  The complaint asserts
eleven causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Covenant of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Quiet Title, (4) Declaratory Relief, (5) TRO
and Injunction, (6) Accounting, (7) Constructive Trust, (8) Breach of Contract,
(9) Breach of Contract, (10) Failure to Pay Wages, and (11) Failure to Pay
Overtime Wages. 
On
February 7, 2023, Cross-Complaints David Sanchez, Cain, and Yans (collectively
“Cross-Complainants”) filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendant
Ricardo.  On February 22, 2023, Cross-Complainants filed the operative
first amended cross-complaint (“FACC”) against Cross-Defendant Ricardo. 
The FACC asserts seven causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach
of Contract, (3) Conversion, (4) Fraud, (5) Constructive Trust, (6) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, and (7) Accounting. 
On
September 11, 2023, this court sustained the demurrer of Cross-Defendant
Ricardo to Cain and Yans’ FACC, with leave to amend.
Cain
and Yans filed a second amended cross-complaint (SACC) on October 6, 2023,
alleging eight causes of action, omitting the prior cause of action for
conversion and adding a third cause of action for breach of contract and a
fourth cause of action for specific performance. 
Ricardo
filed the present demurrer and motion to strike the SACC on November 16, 2023.
Cain and Yans filed oppositions on April 11, 2024. Ricardo filed replies on
April 18,2 024. 
 
Allegations
of the Operative Complaints 
 
The
complaint alleges that: 
 
Ricardo
owned 16119 Glenhope Drive, La Puente, California 91744-4119 (“Subject
Property”) until 2016 when it was subject to a non-judicial foreclosure. 
(Complaint ¶¶ 1, 12.)  On August 24, 2016, Ricardo re-acquired title for
the Subject Property for $374,500.00.  (Id. ¶ 12.)  To fund
the repurchase of the Subject Property, Ricardo borrowed $286,000.00 from his
nephew, Cain.  (Id. ¶ 12.)   
Ricardo
entered into an oral agreement where Ricardo would repay Cain by refinancing
the Subject Property.  (Id. ¶ 13.)  Ricardo was then informed
that he would need to hold title of the Subject Property for at least six
months before he could refinance.  (Id. ¶ 13.)  Ricardo
offered to provide a deed of trust in favor of Cain to secure the loan, but
Cain requested and Ricardo agreed that Ricardo would transfer title of the
Subject Property to Cain and Cain would refinance – taking the loaned amount of
$286,000.00 – and then transfer title back to Ricardo with Ricardo paying
monthly loan payments.  (Id. ¶ 13.)  Pursuant to this
agreement, Ricardo transferred title of the Subject Property to Cain on
September 2, 2016.  (Id. ¶ 13.) 
Thereafter,
Cain breached the agreement by refinancing the Subject Property and taking
$330,000 in cash instead of the loaned amount of $286,000.00.  (Id.
¶ 14.)  Cain further breached the agreement by refinancing the Subject
Property – taking another $175,000.000 in cash – leaving liens in excess of
$461,000.00 against the Subject Property.  (Id. ¶ 16.)  Cain
then transferred title to the Subject Property to Defendant Yans.  (Id.
¶ 17.)   
On
August 1, 2022, Cain demanded that Ricardo obtain a loan to repurchase back the
Subject Property which Ricardo attempted to do but was thwarted by Cain
refusing to co-sign on the loan.  (Id. ¶ 18.)  During this
time Plaintiff Ricardo was making monthly loan payments of $2,000.00 to
Defendant Yong Yu.  (Id. ¶ 14.) 
Defendants
Cain and Yong Yu hired Ricardo to work on properties that they own from 2016
through August 2018 but failed to pay Ricardo for the labor and materials
used.  (Id. ¶ 20.)  Defendant Cain through Defendant DPL hired
Ricardo to perform construction repairs and maintenance services from March 1,
2019 through November 17, 2022, but failed to pay Ricardo.  (Id. ¶¶
20-21.)   
 
The
FACC alleges that: 
 
Cross-Complainants
Cain and Yans rented the Subject Property to Ricardo for $2,000 per
month.  (FACC ¶ 7.)  Ricardo failed to pay the rent for the Subject
Property from September 2018 to February 2021 for a total sum of $60,000. 
(FACC ¶ 9.) 
In
August 2018, Ricardo “was arrested in Morris Township, Pennsylvania with ‘bulk’
heroin and cash.”  (FACC ¶ 8.)  Cross-Complainant Cain loaned a total
of $58,350 to Ricardo for bail, legal fees, and other expenses related to the
arrest.  (FACC ¶ 8.) 
In
March 2017, Ricardo and Cain entered into a venture to build a vacation home in
Nayarit, Mexico (“Mexico Property”).  (FACC ¶ 10.)  Cain paid $43,000
for the Mexico Property but as Ricardo had time to travel and supervise the
project the Mexico Property was put in Ricardo’s name.  (FACC ¶ 10.) 
In May 2017, to fund the venture, Cross-Complainant David – Cross-Defendant
Ricardo’s brother – agreed to share the cost of building and furnishing the
Mexico Property spending a total sum of $260,000.  (FACC ¶ 11.) 
Ricardo was offered to invest as well but refused and left the Mexico Property
project turning over management to Ricardo’s brother Jesus Sanchez who lives
near the Mexico Property.  (FACC ¶ 11.) 
“The
Mexico Property has been utilized as an Airbnb. On or about November 2022,
Cross-Defendant [Ricardo] maliciously and fraudulently took over control of the
Mexico Property refusing to allow Cross-Complainants access to the Airbnb
account, which is under [Ricardo]’s name, and he has not allowed access to the
Mexico Property. Cross-Complainants were forced to pay approximately $6,000 for
a new vacation property for renters that were not able to use the Mexico
Property for their vacation and had to cancel other reservations in a sum
according to proof.”  (FACC ¶ 12.) 
 
Legal
Standard  
 
Demurrer
Standard¿ 
 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear
on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading
that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal 3d 311,
318.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered (i.e., no “speaking
demurrers”). (Ion Equipment Corp. v. Nelson¿(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881.) 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally
and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dep’t of Water &
Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.)  In a demurrer proceeding,
the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal. App. 4th
968, 994.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters.  Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear
on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.”¿ (SKF Farms v.
Superior Ct. (1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”¿ (Hahn, supra,
147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿ 
 
Motion
to Strike Standard 
 
Motions to strike are used to reach defects or objections to
pleadings that are not challengeable by demurrer (i.e., words, phrases, prayer
for damages, etc.).  (See CCP §§ 435-437.)  A party may file a
motion to strike in whole or in part within the time allowed to respond to a
pleading.  However, if a party serves and files a motion to strike without
demurring to the complaint, the time to answer is extended.  (CCP §§
435(b)(1), 435(c).) 
A motion to strike lies only where the pleading has
irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in
conformity with laws.  (CCP § 436.)  The grounds for moving to strike
must appear on the face of the pleadings or by way of judicial notice. 
(CCP § 437.) 
 
Meet
and Confer Requirement  
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41, subdivision (a) requires
that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party
shall meet and confer¿in person or by telephone¿with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an
agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the
demurrer.” The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the
date the responsive pleading is due and if they are unable to meet the
demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension.¿ (CCP §
430.41(a)(2).)¿ The demurring party must also file and serve a declaration
detailing the meet and confer efforts.¿ (Id.¿at (a)(3).)¿ If an amended
pleading is filed, the parties must meet and confer again before a demurrer may
be filed to the amended pleading.¿ (Id.¿at (a).)  There is a
similar meet and confer requirement for motions to strike.  (CCP §
435.5.) 
Cross-Defendant Ricardo has satisfied the meet and confer
requirement.  (Ford Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)  
 
Discussion
- Demurrer 
 
First,
Second, and Third Causes of Action — Breach of Contract
 
As with his prior demurrer to the FACC, Cross-Defendant Ricardo
contends that the first, second, and newly-added third causes of action for
breach of contract fail because Cross-Complainants (1) failed to attach the
contracts or plead them verbatim, and (2) failed to allege whether the
contracts are written, oral, or implied. 
“The¿elements¿of¿a¿cause¿of¿action¿for¿breach¿of¿contract¿are:
‘(1) the¿contract, (2)¿plaintiff's¿performance¿or¿excuse¿for¿nonperformance,
(3)¿defendant's¿breach, and (4) the¿resulting¿damages¿to¿plaintiff.’”  (Coles
v. Glaser¿(2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 384, 391 [internal citations
omitted].)  “A contract is an agreement to do or not to do a certain
thing.”  (Civ. Code, § 1549.)  The essential elements of a contract
are parties capable of contracting; their consent; a lawful object; and a
sufficient cause or consideration.  (Civ. Code, § 1550.) “To state a cause
of action for breach of contract, it is absolutely essential to plead the terms
of the contract either in haec verba or according to legal effect.” (Progressive
West Ins. Co. v. Yolo County Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 263,
270, Fn. 1.) 
Further,
a demurrer lies if “[i]n an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.”  (CCP § 430.10(g).)   
The
SACC includes allegations not previously included in the FACC regarding the
specific terms and nature of the agreements that rectify the defects identified
in the court’s prior order. Unlike the FACC, the SACC alleges that the 2018
loan agreement was oral. (SACC ¶ 18.) Similar allegations are included for the
second and third contract actions. (SACC ¶¶ 24, 31.) 
The
SACC further alleges, unlike the prior pleading, the time agreed for Ricardo’s
performance. He was to pay the 2018 loan agreement “once he started working.”
(SACC ¶ 20.) Moreover, the SACC includes previously omitted allegations
regarding the term of the lease (commencing January 2016) and the term for
which rent is due: September 2018 to February 2021, on a month-to-month basis.
(SACC ¶¶ 7, 24.) 
The
third cause of action also pleads sufficient facts to describe the legal effect
of the agreement. It is alleged that the agreement was entered in March 2017,
that the agreement was oral, and that in exchange for Cross-Complainant Cain
providing the funds to buy the property, Ricardo would hold nominal title to
the property and supervise its construction and rental for their mutual
benefit. (SACC ¶¶ 31–32.) However, despite declaring his intention to withdraw
from the venture in August 2018 (SACC ¶¶ 34–36, Ricardo has taken control of
the Airbnb profile and account associated with the property, depriving
Cross-Complainants of use of the property. (SACC ¶ 38.) The terms of the
alleged contracts are set forth with sufficient particularity and are not
uncertain.
However,
Ricardo has identified a defect with the second cause of action (related to the
lease agreement) as alleged by Cross-Complainant Yans Holding, LLC.
Specifically, although the SACC alleges that the lease was created in January
2016 between Ricardo, Cain, and Yans, the business records on file with the
California Secretary of State indicate that Yans was not created as a company
until October 12, 2021.[1]
Cain and Yans in opposition contend that Cain transferred title to Yans, and
apparently thereafter assumed ownership of the month-to-month lease.
(Opposition at p. 5.) But this fact is not alleged in the SACC. It is alleged
in Ricardo’s Complaint that Cain transferred the property to Yans at some
unspecified time, but it is not clear whether this act occurred during the
period for which Cain and Yans claim rent is due. (Complaint ¶ 17.) It would
indeed appear that this is impossible, since Cross-Complainants claim that the
period of unpaid rent is from September 2018 to February 2021, and Yans was not
created until October 2021. (RJN Exh. 
            Accordingly, the demurrer is
SUSTAINED without leave to amend as to the second cause of action for breach of
contract asserted by Yans Holding LLC, and otherwise OVERRULED as to the first,
second, and third causes of action for breach of contract.
Moreover,
because Ricardo’s arguments as to the fourth cause of action for specific
performance and eighth cause of action for accounting are derivative of the
arguments addressed to the third cause of action, the demurrer is likewise
OVERRULED as to the fourth and eighth causes of action. (Demurrer at pp. 13,
16.)
 
Fifth Cause
of Action — Fraud 
 
As
with the previous demurrer to the cross-complaint, Cross-Defendant Ricardo
asserts that the fourth cause of action is not alleged with sufficient
specificity. 
“The
elements of fraud are (a) a misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c)
intent to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting
damage.”  (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th
289, 294.)  “Fraud allegations ‘involve a serious attack on character’ and
therefore are pleaded with specificity.  [Citation.]  General and
conclusory allegations are insufficient.  [Citation.]  The particularity
requirement demands that a plaintiff plead facts which ‘‘‘show how, when,
where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.’’’ 
[Citation.]”  (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th
1462, 1469.)  “[E]ach element must be pleaded with specificity. 
[Citations.]”  (Daniels v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (2016)
246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1166 disapproved of on other grounds by¿Sheen
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.¿(2022) 12 Cal.5th 905.) 
The
SACC has rectified the lack of specificity contained in the prior pleading. The
time, means, location, and content of the representations are alleged with
specificity — namely, that Ricardo orally promised on August 4, 2018, at For
Mia Sabor in Fontana, to transfer title to the property back to
Cross-Complainants. (SACC ¶ 55.) Cross-Complainants relied on this promise by
investing $260,000 in the development of the property. (SACC ¶ 56.)
The
demurrer is therefore OVERRULED as to the fifth cause of action for fraud.
 
Seventh
Cause of Action: Breach of Fiduciary Duty 
 
Ricardo
contends that the seventh cause of action fails because the SACC fails to
allege a fiduciary relationship. 
“‘The
elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are: (1) the
existence of a fiduciary duty; (2) the breach of that duty; and (3) damage
proximately caused by that breach.’”  (IIG Wireless, Inc. v. Yi
(2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 630, 646, [internal citation omitted].)  A fiduciary
duty is founded upon a special relationship imposed by law or under
circumstances in which “confidence is reposed by persons in the integrity of
others” who voluntarily accept the confidence. (Tri-Growth Centre City, Ltd.
v. Silldorf, Burdman, Duignan & Eisenberg (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1139,
1150; see CACI 4100, et seq.) 
“‘[B]efore
a person can be charged with a fiduciary obligation, he must either knowingly
undertake to act on behalf and for the benefit of another, or must enter into a
relationship which 
imposes that
undertaking as a matter of law.’” (City of Hope Nat'l Med. Ctr. v. Genentech
(2008) 43 Cal.4th 375, 386.)  Facts giving rise to a confidential,
fiduciary or trustee relationship must be pled, and a “bare allegation that
defendants assumed a fiduciary relationship” is a conclusion. (Zumbrun v.
Univ. of So. Cal. (1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 1, 13.) 
            This court previously sustained the
demurrer to this claim in the FACC on the grounds that the sole basis for the
existence of the fiduciary relationship was the familial tie between Ricardo
and Cross-Complainants.  (Zumbrun v.
University of Southern California¿(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 1, 13, [“The mere
placing of a trust in another person does not create a fiduciary
relationship.”].)  
The SACC, however, includes facts that
sufficiently allege a fiduciary relationship based on the parties’
participation in a joint venture and Ricardo’s holding of property that
beneficially belonged to Cross-Complainants. “The key factor in the existence
of a fiduciary relationship lies in control by a person over the property of
another.”  (Vai v. Bank of America National Trust & Savings Ass'n
(1961) 56 Cal.2d 329, 338.) Moreover, “partners or joint venturers have a fiduciary duty
to act with the highest good faith towards each
other regarding affairs of the
partnership or joint venture.” (Pellegrini v. Weiss (2008)
165 Cal.App.4th 515, 524.) The SACC alleges that Ricardo’s actions with respect
to the Mexico property were taken with respect to a proposed business to be run
by Ricardo with capital from Cross-Complainants for their mutual benefit. (SACC
¶¶ 8, 31.) These facts are sufficient to state the existence of a fiduciary
relationship.
The demurrer is therefore OVERRULED as to the seventh cause of
action for breach of fiduciary duty.
 
Fifth and
Seventh Causes of Action: Constructive Trust and Accounting 
Cross-Defendant
Ricardo contends that the fifth and seventh causes of action fail as derivative
claims. 
“[A]
cause of action for accounting need only state facts showing the existence of
the relationship which requires an accounting and the statement that some
balance is due the plaintiff.”  (Brea v. McGlashan¿(1934) 3
Cal.App.2d 454, 460.)  “ ‘Equitable principles govern [accounting
actions], and the plaintiff must show the legal remedy is inadequate.’”  (Green
Valley Landowners Assn. v. City of Vallejo¿(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 425,
442.) 
A
constructive trust “is not an independent cause of action but merely a type of
remedy for some categories of underlying wrong.”  (Glue-Fold, Inc. v.
Slautterback Corp. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023, Fn. 3.)  Both a
claim for constructive trust and for accounting are “equitable forms of
remedies are dependent upon a substantive basis for liability[.]”  (Ibid.) 
 
Here, as the FACC has been sustained as to all of the substantive claims, the
claims for equitable relief do not have a basis.  Accordingly, Cross-Defendant
Ricardo’s demurrer to the fifth and seventh causes of action is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend. 
 
Discussion
-Motion to Strike 
 
Ricardo
seeks to strike the prayer for punitive damages alleged in the SACC, on the
grounds that insufficient facts are pleaded to support it. (Motion at pp. 6–8.)
Punitive
damages are allowed in non-contract cases when a defendant is guilty of
“oppression, fraud, or malice . . . .” (Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (a).) The terms
are defined as:

“Malice”
     means conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the
     plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with
     a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.
“Oppression”
     means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust
     hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights.
“Fraud”
     means an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a
     material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the
     defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or
     otherwise causing injury.

(Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (c).)
Something more than the mere commission of a tort is
always required for punitive damages. (Taylor
v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 894.) Proof of negligence, gross
negligence, or recklessness is insufficient to warrant an award of punitive
damages. (Dawes v. Sup.Ct. (Mardian)
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 82, 88–89.) Punitive damages may be recovered in an
action for negligence or other nonintentional torts if the plaintiff pleads and
proves that the defendant acted with the state of mind described as “conscious
disregard” of the potential dangers to others. (Pfeifer v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299.)
When malice is based on a defendant’s conscious disregard of Plaintiff’s
rights, the conduct must be both despicable and willful. (College Hospital v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 794, 713 (“College Hospital”).)
As discussed above, the SACC contains sufficient
facts to state a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation. Because
punitive damages are available upon a showing of fraud, sufficient facts are
here alleged to state a prayer for punitive damages under Civil Code § 3294.
The motion to strike is therefore DENIED.
 
CONCLUSIONS
AND ORDER 
Cross-Defendant
Ricardo Sanchez’s Demurrer to the Second Amended Cross-Complaint of Cain
Sanchez, David Sanchez, and Yans Holding LLC, is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend as to the second cause of action for breach of contract, asserted by
Cross-Complainant Yans Holding, LLC, and as to the fifth and seventh causes of
action. The demurrer is otherwise OVERRULED, and the motion to strike is
DENIED.
