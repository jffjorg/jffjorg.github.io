The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by YI MAO to each of the six causes of action asserted by SHARON WEI in her cross-complaint. The Court has overruled the demurrer to the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Causes of Action, finding that Wei's claims are adequately pleaded and not uncertain. The Court has sustained the demurrer to the Fifth and Sixth Causes of Action, finding that they are defective and requiring amendment.

The First, Second, and Third Causes of Action allege breach of oral contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, respectively. The Court finds that these claims are adequately pleaded and not uncertain.

The Fourth Cause of Action is a common count for open book account, which the Court finds is adequately pleaded.

The Fifth Cause of Action seeks an accounting, which the Court finds is defective and requires amendment.

The Sixth Cause of Action seeks declaratory relief regarding the ownership of the Alice Property, which the Court finds is also defective and requires amendment.

The Court has given Mao 20 days' leave to amend the demurrer to the Fifth and Sixth Causes of Action.
