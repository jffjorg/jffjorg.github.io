And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Xia Lu's motion to strike the answer filed by Defendants Junyi Zhou, Xiaoyan Chen, and Elite Asian Art Auction, LLC. The Plaintiff claims that the Defendants' answer was untimely, as they were served on March 13, 2024, and the answer was filed on July 31, 2024, more than 30 days later. However, the Court finds that the Defendants were not personally served with the summons and complaint and did not become aware of the action until July 31, 2024. As a result, the Court denies the Plaintiff's motion to strike, finding that the untimeliness of the answer was due to the Plaintiff's failure to serve the Defendants with the summons and complaint.
