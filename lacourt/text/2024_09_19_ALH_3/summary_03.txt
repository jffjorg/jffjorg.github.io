And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for leave to amend the complaint filed by Lucinda Sky, the plaintiff. The plaintiff had filed the motion and several ex parte applications seeking an extension of time to amend the complaint. The judge has ruled that the request for leave to file an amended complaint is moot, as the plaintiff has already amended the complaint on August 23, 2024. Additionally, the judge has ruled that the remainder of the motion, which seeks assistance from CalVCB, is also moot, as CalVCB is no longer a named defendant in the action. The judge has also stated that, even if CalVCB were a defendant, the plaintiff provides no authority for the Court to grant requests for various forms of assistance. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court by September 19, 2024, to indicate their intention to submit on the tentative.
