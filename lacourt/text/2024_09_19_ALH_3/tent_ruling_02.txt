On March 4, 2024, plaintiff Xia Lu
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Junyi Zhou (“Zhou”), Xiaoyan
Chen (“Chen”), Shalom K. Braunstein (“Braunstein”), and Elite Asian Art
Auction, LLC (“Elite Auction”). 
On April 29, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed
Braunstein from this action. 
On July 31, 2024, Zhou and Chen
(collectively, “Defendants”) filed an answer. 
On August 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed this
motion to strike Defendants’ answer as untimely. Plaintiff claims that
Defendants were served on March 13, 2024, therefore Defendants’ answer had to
be filed within 30 days of being served. 
At the time Defendants filed their
answer on July 31, 2024, no default had yet been entered against them.
Furthermore, in opposition, Defendants explain that they did not become aware
of this action until July 31, 2024, and immediately filed an answer the same
day. (Defs. Decl., ¶¶ 3-5.) Defendants declare that they were not personally
served with the summons and complaint and were not aware of Plaintiff’s prior unsuccessful
attempts to enter default against them on April 22 and June 3, 2024. (Id.,
¶¶ 3, 7-8.) 
In light of these facts, the Court
DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to strike. Although Defendants’ answer was untimely,
the inability to file an answer earlier appears to be due to Plaintiff’s failure
to serve them with the summons and complaint.

this 19th
