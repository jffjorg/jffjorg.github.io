I.      INTRODUCTION
          
On February 22, 2023, plaintiff Yi Mao (“Mao”) filed this action against
defendants Sharon Wei (“Wei”), Yi Zhang Zhou, 161 Alice St. Arcadia LLC, and
9416 Broadway LLC asserting causes of action for breach of contract, breach of
fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting the breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unjust
enrichment, and constructive trust. Plaintiff alleged he owned interests in
property located at 161 Alice Street in Arcadia, California (the “Alice
Property”) and 9416 Broadway in Temple City, California.
          On
May 29, 2024, Wei filed a cross-complaint against Mao asserting six causes of
action. Wei seeks an accounting and declaratory relief and asserts three claims
for breach of oral contract and one claim for open book account. 
On July 15,
2024, Mao filed a demurrer to each of Wei’s causes of action on the grounds
that they failed to allege sufficient facts and, in addition, the breach of
oral contract claims were uncertain. 
Wei filed an
opposition brief on September 6, 2024. 
          Mao filed a reply brief on September
12, 2024. 
II.     LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer may be brought if
insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the
pleadings and will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its
face. (City of Atascadero v. Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. We accept the factual
allegations of the complaint as true and also consider matters which may be
judicially noticed. [Citation.]” (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials
Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged in the pleading are
deemed to be true, however improbable they may be”].) Allegations are to be
liberally construed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) In construing the allegations,
the court is to give effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or
limit inconsistent general or conclusory allegations. (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd
764, 769.) 
A demurrer may also be brought on the
grounds that the pleading is uncertain. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).)
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in
some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s
of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Where the complaint
contains substantial factual allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of
the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be
overruled or plaintiff will be given leave to amend. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135,
139, fn. 2.) 
III.    DISCUSSION
A.  
First,
Second, and Third Causes of Action
The essential elements of a claim of
breach of contract are the contract, plaintiff's performance or excuse for
nonperformance, defendant's breach, and the resulting damages to plaintiff. (Maxwell
v. Dolezal (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 93, 97-98.) 
For her first cause of action for
breach of oral contract, Wei alleges that in or around 2019 to 2022, she paid
renovation costs for three residential units located at 9422, 9426, and 9428
Broadway, Temple City, and spent $133,788.50, for which Mao agreed to reimburse
her. (Cross-Compl., p. 3.) Wei alleges that Mao breached this contract in or
around January 2023 by failing to pay her. 
For her second cause of action for
breach of oral contract, Wei alleges that she provided property management
services for a project located at 9913 Lower Azusa Rd., Temple City, CA 91780,
which was developed into a 5-unit condominium project. Wei alleges that the
project started in January 2013 and the properties were completed in 2018 and
sold in 2019 for $3,995,000. Wei was allegedly supposed to receive 20% of the
net profit (a total of $240,000) and the parties “agreed to defer [payment]
during the pandemic” while working together on other projects. Wei was supposed
to be paid after an accounting but in January 2023, Mao refused to provide an
accounting and refused to pay her.
For Wei’s Third Cause of Action, Wei
alleges that in 2015, she gave Mao one million RMB to invest in Canada on her
behalf. (Cross-Compl., p. 5.) In 2023, Wei asked Mao to return her investment
to her but Mao has failed to do so.
Wei’s claims are all adequately pleaded
because she alleges the existence of the oral contracts, her performance of her
obligations under the contracts, Mao’s breaches of these contracts, and her
resulting damages. Also, the claims are not so uncertain that any ambiguities
cannot be resolved through the discovery process. 
Furthermore, although Mao argues that
the contract claims are barred by the statute of frauds because “it was not to
be performed within a year” (Demurrer, p. 9), the statute of frauds only
applies to contracts which “cannot possibly be performed within one year.” (White
Lighting Co. v. Wolfson (1968) 68 Cal.2d 336, 343-344.) 
Therefore, Mao’s demurrer to the First,
Second, and Third Causes of Action is OVERRULED. 
B.  
Fourth
Cause of Action
Wei’s Fourth Cause of Action is a
common count. “A common count is not a specific cause of action ...; rather, it
is a simplified form of pleading normally used to aver the existence of various
forms of monetary indebtedness ....” (McBride v. Boughton (2004) 123
Cal.App.4th 379, 394. The only essential allegations of a common count are (1)
a statement of indebtedness in a certain sum; (2) consideration—e.g., goods
sold, work done, etc.; and (3) nonpayment. (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460.) 
Here, Wei alleges that “[d]uring the
time that [she] was managing properties for Mao and otherwise they were
conducting cross-border financial transactions, Wei and Mao agreed that Mao
(who is a CPA) would be maintaining an open book account so that the parties
could properly account for funds.”
Mao argues that Wei’s common count
fails because it is based on her second and third causes of action for breach
of contract, which Mao contends are subject to demurrer. As stated above, the
Court disagrees with Mao’s characterization of Wei’s contract claims as
inadequate. Accordingly, Mao’s demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action is
OVERRULED. 
C.  
Fifth
Cause of Action
Wei’s Fifth Cause of Action is for an
accounting. A cause of action for an accounting requires a showing that a
relationship exists between the plaintiff and defendant that requires an
accounting, and that some balance is due the plaintiff that can only be
ascertained by an accounting. (Teselle v. McLoughlin (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 156, 179.) 
          Wei alleges
the following sentence in her Cross-Complaint: “Because of the extensive
business dealings between Mao and Wei, a complete accounting of their mutual
dealings should be conducted by the Court.” (Cross-Compl., p. 7.) This lone
sentence does not set forth facts showing the relationship between Wei and Mao.
Wei’s claim of “extensive business dealings” is too conclusory to show that a
relationship between them exists which necessitates an accounting. Also, Wei
fails to allege that she is owed some balance which may only be ascertained by
an accounting. 
          Mao’s
demurrer to the Fifth Cause of Action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. 
D.  Sixth Cause of Action
Wei seeks a declaration as to her and
Mao’s respective interests in the Alice Property. (Cross-Compl., p. 7.) Wei alleges
that Mao is asserting sole ownership of the Alice Property even though Wei is
the sole borrower on a $720,000 loan which she took out “on” the Alice
Property. 
Mao argues that Wei cannot seek
declaratory relief because she fails to plead the existence of any controversy
over the Alice Property. Wei opposes the demurrer and argues that a controversy
plainly exists between Mao and Wei regarding the ownership of the Alice
Property if Mao is seeking to quiet title on the Alice Property and asserting
sole ownership. However, although Wei alleges that she took out a mortgage to
purchase the Alice Property and she is the only obligor on that loan, Wei does
not allege what her rights to the Alice Property are, or that she is the sole
owner of the property, nor does she allege the basis for her assertion that she
has any ownership interest in the property short of sole ownership. Therefore,
Wei has not sufficiently alleged that there is a controversy for which
declaratory relief is appropriate. 
The demurrer to the Sixth Cause of
Action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. 
IV.    CONCLUSION
Mao’s demurrer to the Fifth and Sixth
Causes of Action is SUSTAINED with 20 days’ leave to amend. 
Mao’s demurrer to the First, Second,
Third, and Fourth Causes of Action is OVERRULED. 
Moving party to give notice.
