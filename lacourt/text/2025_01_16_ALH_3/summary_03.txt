And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling states that the motion to quash the summons filed by defendant Nicole Canale is moot because the plaintiff has already dismissed Canale from the lawsuit. The motion was filed on November 7, 2024, and the request to dismiss Canale was filed on January 14, 2025. The dismissal was entered on January 15, 2025. As a result, the court finds that the motion is no longer relevant and will not be considered. The parties are advised to submit their intentions to the court by email and to assume that opposing parties may still appear at the hearing to argue the matter.
