TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


April
  23, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


20STCV42377




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant David Lievanos




OPPOSING PARTY:


None
  



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendant David Lievanos (“Defendant”) moves for terminating sanctions
(or in the alternative, evidentiary or issue sanctions) against Plaintiff
Miguel Salinas in pro per (“Plaintiff”) for failure to comply with the Court’s
discovery order.[1] No
opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225,
1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra,
77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622
[terminating sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and
subsequently granting default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with
one court order to produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins.
Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia
v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions
imposed against the plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and
for violating various discovery statutes].) 

 
DISCUSSION
 
This
case arises from a motor vehicle accident. On June 26, 2023, Defendant served a
notice of taking Plaintiff’s deposition on his then-counsel. (Fenton Decl. ¶ 2,
Exh. A.) Deposition was set for August 3, 2023. On July 18, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s then-counsel’s motion to be relieved. That same day, former
counsel filed a proof of service of the order to relieve as counsel and the
Notice of Deposition, to Plaintiff via mail. On August 3, 2023, Plaintiff
failed to appear for the deposition via video conference, and Defendant
obtained a Certificate of Non-Appearance. (Id. ¶ 6, Exh. B.)   
 
On February
14, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel Plaintiff’s
deposition. Plaintiff was ordered to appear within 15 days for a deposition.
(Min. Order, 2/14/24.) On February 15, 2024, Defendant served notice of the
order and notice of a deposition for February 28, 2024, via overnight mail. (Id.
¶ 11.)
 
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff did not appear at the February 28,
2024 deposition, in violation of the Court’s order. (Id. ¶ 12, Exh. E.) 
 
Notice
of this motion was served via mail on Plaintiff at the address listed in the
Order to relieve as counsel.
 
            The Court finds that Plaintiff has
not complied with the prior discovery order and has failed to comply with
multiple deposition notices. Plaintiff has also not responded to this motion. Accordingly,
the Court grants the motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. The
only remaining defendants are named but have not been served. Given the age of
the case, which was filed on November 4, 2020, and lack of service, the Court
dismisses the complaint with prejudice.  
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
