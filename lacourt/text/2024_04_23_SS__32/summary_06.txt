And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Filemon R. Lopez, filed a complaint against the defendant, USAA Casualty Insurance Company, for damages sustained in a motor vehicle accident on May 27, 2014. The defendant demurred on the basis that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because it is barred by the statute of limitations. The plaintiff failed to oppose the demurrer, which means the Court does not need to consider evidence outside of the complaint. The Court finds that the statute of limitations is two years, and since the accident occurred in 2014, the statute of limitations expired in 2016. The Court also takes judicial notice of the defendant's exhibits A and B, which show that the plaintiff previously filed a complaint based on the same facts but abandoned the trial. The Court finds that the plaintiff does not meet his burden to show that the pleading can be amended successfully. Therefore, the Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
