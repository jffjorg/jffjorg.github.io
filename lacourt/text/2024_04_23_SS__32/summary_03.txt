And here is the text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion to compel Defendant Jaime Rafael Duran Gonzalez to attend his deposition. The Court finds that Gonzalez's non-appearance at the December 14, 2023 deposition, despite notice and attempts to contact him, warrants the granting of the motion to compel. The Court awards sanctions in the amount of $1,240.85 to counsel for Cross-Complainants. The Court also declines to award sanctions as to Defendant's counsel, as it does not appear that counsel counseled the discovery abuse. The Defendant shall appear for a deposition within 20 days' notice of this order.
