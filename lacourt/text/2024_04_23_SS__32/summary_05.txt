And here is the English text summarizing the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Taiwo Balgoun Adam, due to irreconcilable differences between counsel and plaintiff. However, the court orders counsel to file an amended proposed order within 5 calendar days of the hearing, including information about all future proceedings in the case. If the motion is conditionally granted, counsel must serve the signed order within 10 days of the order and provide proof of service. Counsel will remain the attorney of record for the plaintiff until the updated proposed order is filed and served.
