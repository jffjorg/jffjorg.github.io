MOTION
 
On November 27, 2023, Plaintiff Filemon R. Lopez (“Plaintiff” in pro
per) filed a complaint against Defendant USAA Casualty Insurance Company
(“Defendant”) for damages sustained after an alleged May 27, 2014 motor vehicle
accident. 
 
Defendant now demurs on the basis that the complaint fails to state
facts to constitute a cause of action because it is barred by the statute of
limitations. No opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
The primary function of a pleading is to give the other party notice
so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect in a pleading that
otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect substantial
rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.) “A demurrer tests the
legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v.
Bank of America, N.A. (2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form
or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th
968, 994.)  It is not the function of the
demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of
the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to
be true.  (Donabedian, 116
Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the
face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that
are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can
be considered.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v.
Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts
asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States
Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other
grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d
287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].)
 
A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is
incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.) 
A general demurrer may be brought where the dates alleged in the
complaint show the cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations.
(See Saliter v. Pierce Bros. Mortuaries (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 292, 300.) If
dates are missing from the complaint that would show the statute of limitations
bars recovery, then there is no ground for a general demurrer. The party
demurring must instead ascertain the factual basis for the contentions and file
a motion for summary judgment. (See United Western Medical Centers
v. Superior Court (1996)
42 Cal.App.4th 500, 505.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where
there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show
the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v.
YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any
reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it
is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada
Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
The Declaration of Arnold S. Levine states that the parties spoke
about the instant demurrer, through a Spanish interpreter. (Levine Decl. ¶
3–4.) Therefore, the meet and confer requirement was met. 
 
JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
The Court takes judicial notice of Defendant’s exhibits A and B:
Remittitur issued by Second Court of Appeal, Division Two, dated May 28, 2019,
dismissing appeal in matter of Rocha v. Sealey (BC610902) and Minute Order
dated March 8, 2021, dismissing Filemon R. Lopez v. USAA Casualty Ins. Comp.
(19STCV31776) for failure to prosecute. (Evid. Code § 452(d).) 
 
The Court, on its own, takes judicial notice of the Court’s record in
case number 19STCV31776. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant argues the complaint is barred by
the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations for a personal
injury action is two years. (Code Civ. Proc. § 335.1.) The complaint alleges a
motor vehicle accident and states the “accident occurred in Long Beach, CA in
May 27, 2014.” (Complaint, 1.) Therefore, the statute of limitations in this
case expired on May 27, 2016. Since this action was filed on November 27, 2023,
the action is barred on the face of the complaint. 
 
Plaintiff’s
complaint also states: “Please Judge I (sic) asking please give me the
extension the two years when the superior court closed for Covid-19.”
(Complaint, 2.) In 2020, the California Rules of Court enacted Emergency Rule 9, which
tolled the statute of limitations for civil actions from April 6, 2020, until
October 1, 2020, or 178 days. (CRC Emergency Rule 9.) However, given that this action
expired in May 2016, before that rule was enacted, there is no basis for
extending the statute of limitations in this case. 
 
Furthermore, the
materials judicially noticed show that Plaintiff previously filed a complaint
based on the facts of this case but abandoned the trial after the trial judge
ruled against him on motions in limine. (Exh. A.) The Court of Appeal affirmed
the trial court’s dismissing the action under Code of Civil Procedure section
581(d). Also, the minute order from case number 19STCV31776 shows
that Plaintiff filed a previous action against Defendant which was dismissed
without prejudice on March 8, 2021 after failing to appear at trial. (Exh. B.) The
complaint in that case also alleges damages against Defendant based on a May
27, 2014 accident. (Complaint, filed 9/9/19.) 
 
Plaintiff
does not oppose this motion and therefore fails to meet his burden that the
pleading can be amended successfully. Therefore, in light of the two cases that
Plaintiff previously filed concerning this matter, and the fact Plaintiff does
not oppose this motion, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint
without leave to amend. 
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
