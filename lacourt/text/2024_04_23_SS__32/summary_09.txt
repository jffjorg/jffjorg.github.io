And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies Defendant Los Angeles Dodgers, LLC's motion for relief from waiver of objections to Plaintiff Jamie Merchain's Request for Production, Set One. The Plaintiff served the request on July 28, 2023, and the Defendant failed to respond by the deadline. The Defendant claims that the failure to serve timely responses was due to Counsel Leigh P. Robie's mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, but the Court finds that the Defendant has not shown that the failure was excusable. The Court finds that the Defendant's responses were in substantial compliance with the discovery requests. Therefore, the Defendant's motion is denied.
