And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs in the amount of $43,896.09. The Court found that the Plaintiffs are entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and that the fees and costs were reasonably incurred. The Court also considered the evidence presented by both parties and exercised its discretion to consider the Defendant's late-filed opposition.

The Plaintiffs had purchased a 2018 Chevrolet Camaro LT from General Motors, LLC, but the vehicle had manufacturing defects and was unable to be repaired. The Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against General Motors, LLC for breach of implied and express warranties, and the parties entered into an Offer to Compromise. The Plaintiffs then filed a Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs, seeking an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

The Defendant argued that the attorneys' fees and costs were unreasonable and that the Plaintiffs' counsel had overbilled for their services. However, the Court found that the fees and costs were reasonable and granted the Plaintiffs' Motion. The Court also awarded the Plaintiffs' requested costs in the amount of $1,861.09.

The Court's decision is based on the California Civil Code, the California Rules of Court, and various court decisions, including Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc., Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc., Wilkerson v. Sullivan, Christian Research Institute v. Alnor, and PLFM Group v. Drexler.
