I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a quiet title action.  On November 22, 2016, Plaintiff Heidi
Lindegaard Brask (formerly known as Heidi Annette Christiansen) filed a Notice
of Settlement of Entire Case.  On January
19, 2017, Plaintiff and Defendant Carmiel Cohen entered into a Settlement
Agreement and Release (the “Agreement”). 
The court dismissed the action pursuant to the Agreement on February 16,
2017.  The parties, who have two children
together, agreed that Defendant was to make child support payments until the
parties’ youngest child turned 18 years of age on July 25, 2021, and to pay
Plaintiff the sum of $600,000.  Within 90
days of July 25, 2021, Defendant was to make an additional payment of $862,000
for the benefit of the two children.  As
security for the payment of child support, Defendant was to execute a Deed of
Trust in the amount of $350,000 on the property located at 6460 Colgate Avenue,
Los Angeles, CA 90048 (the “Subject Property”). 
As to the $600,000 payment, Defendant was to make the payment within 90
days of July 25, 2021.  As security,
Defendant was to provide Plaintiff with a Second Deed of Trust in the amount of
$600,000, to be reconveyed to Defendant upon receipt of the $600,000 payment.  
 
            Defendant
was obligated to pay the sums of $862,000 and $600,000 to Plaintiff on October
23, 2021.  Defendant did not make the
payments.  As required by the Agreement,
on January 26, 2024, Plaintiff sent Defendant a Notice of Default and
Opportunity to Cure.  Under the Notice,
Defendant had 15 days to cure the default. 
Defendant did not cure the default.
 
            On February
14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement.  Plaintiff also seeks an award of attorney’s
fees and costs.  After two hearings and
supplemental briefing, the court granted Plaintiff’s motion on September 5,
2024.  The court also granted Plaintiff’s
request for attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses, and directed Plaintiff to
file her motion for reasonable attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses within 30
days of the order.
 
            On
September 25, 2024, Plaintiff concurrently filed this Motion for Attorneys’
Fees and her Memorandum of Costs. 
Plaintiff now seeks her attorneys’ fees in the sum of $5,772.50 and
costs in the amount of $165.25.
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
 
II.           DISCUSSION & LEGAL STANDARD
 
            A
prevailing party in entitled to recover costs, including attorneys’ fees, as a
matter of right. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1032(a)(4), 1032(b), 1033.5.)
 
Civil Code section
1717 states that “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract
specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the
prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing
on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or
not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other
costs.  (Civ. Code, § 1717(a).)  The term “on a contract” is liberally
construed to include any action that “involves” a contact.  (Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown
Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 894.)  “To determine whether an action is on the
contract, we look to the complaint and focus on the basis of the cause of
action.”  (Brown Bark III, L.P. v.
Haver (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 809, 821.) 
“[F]ees are properly awarded under section 1717 ‘to the extent that the
action in fact is an action to enforce—or avoid enforcement of—the specific
contract.’”  (Turner v. Schultz
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 974, 980.)  The
prevailing party on the contract is “the party who recovered greater relief in
the action on the contract.”  (Civ. Code,
§ 1717(b)(1).)
 
            Here, the
court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement because
Defendant failed to comply with the terms of the Agreement.  Plaintiff is therefore the prevailing party.  Further, pursuant to section 10.0, of the
Agreement, the Parties expressly reserved their right to recover “reasonable
attorney’s fees, costs and expenses incurred in the enforcement of this
Agreement if any Party fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the
Agreement.”  As the court stated in its
September 5, 2024, order, Plaintiff may recover her attorney’s fees, costs, and
expenses subject to noticed motion. 
Further, the court finds Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees in the
sum of $5,772.50 and costs in the amount of $165.25 is reasonable.
 
III.         CONCLUSION 
 
Accordingly, the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is awarded her attorneys’ fees in
the sum of $5,772.50 and costs in the amount of $165.25.
 
Moving party to give notice.
