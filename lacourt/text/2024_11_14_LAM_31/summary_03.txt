And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion brought by the Bank on behalf of itself and nonparty SJS Associates, Inc. dba Lender's Foreclosure Services. The Court is skeptical of this procedural anomaly, citing case law that suggests a party cannot bring an anti-SLAPP motion on behalf of a nonparty. The Bank is seeking relief on behalf of defendant Shen, who conducts business as Lender's Foreclosure Services, but has not appeared in the action. The Court notes that the Bank has not cited any authority for seeking relief on behalf of another defendant. The Court will consider whether the Bank alone is entitled to relief.
