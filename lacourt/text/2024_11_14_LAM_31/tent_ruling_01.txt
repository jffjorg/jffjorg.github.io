PLAINTIFF
AND CROSS-DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES



 
MOVING PARTY:              Plaintiff
and Cross-Defendant Century City Mall, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant
and Cross-Complainant Bailey 44, LLC
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
            
This action arises from the breach
of a commercial lease agreement.  On
April 14, 2021, plaintiff Century City Mall, LLC (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint
against its former tenant, defendant Bailey 44, LLC (Defendant), for refusing
to pay rent and unlawfully abandoning the leased premises with several years of
term remaining.  
 
            On
June 16, 2021, Defendant concurrently filed its Answer and Cross-Complaint,
alleging two crossclaims for declaratory judgment and conversion.  Plaintiff moved for summary judgment on
Defendant’s crossclaims.  On June 16,
2023, the court granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on the
crossclaims. 
 
            The case
proceeded to trial.  On July 29, 2024,
the first day of trial, Defendant represented to the court that it would not
defend the case.  The court granted
defense counsel’s motion to be relieved and struck Defendant’s answer.  Plaintiff presented evidence.  The court found Defendant breached the lease
and that Plaintiff was entitled to recover damages in the amount of
$435,242.20.  Judgment was entered in
Plaintiff’s favor on August 6, 2024.
 
            On
September 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion for Attorneys’ Fees.  Plaintiff seeks an to recover attorneys’ fees
in the sum of $999,476.90 as the prevailing party.
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        DISCUSSION & LEGAL STANDARD
 
Plaintiff seeks an award of
attorneys’ fees in the sum of $999,476.90 pursuant Civil Code section 1717.
            
Section 1717 provides, “[i]n any
action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s
fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded
either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is
determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the
party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees in addition to other costs. 
[¶]  Where a contract provides for
attorney’s fees, as set forth above, that provision shall be construed as
applying to the entire contract, unless each party was represented by counsel
in the negotiation and execution of the contract, and the fact of that
representation is specified in the contract. 
[¶]  Reasonable attorney’s fees
shall be fixed by the court, and shall be an element of the costs of suit.”
(Civ. Code, § 1717(a).)  
 
“When a party obtains a simple,
unqualified victory by completely prevailing on or defeating all contract
claims in the action and the contract contains a provision for attorney fees,
section 1717 entitles the successful party to recover reasonable attorney fees
incurred in prosecution or defense of those claims.”  (Scott Co. of California v. Blount, Inc. (1990)
20 Cal.4th 1103, 1109; Civ. Code, § 1717(a)–(b).)
 
Here, Plaintiff has obtained an
unqualified victory on its breach of contract claim.  (Judgment, 8/6/24.)  Second, Plaintiff obtained an unqualified
victory on Defendant’s crossclaims.  (See
Minute Order, 6/16/23.)  Further, the
lease agreement contains a provision for attorney fees.  (Maczek Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. 1, § 27.22.)  Plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorneys’
fees.  Given that this litigation spanned
three years, including extensive discovery in prosecuting defending against the
cross-claims, and indeed, proceeded to trial, (see Maczek Decl. ¶¶ 23, 35-46,
53, 57–62, 65–68, 72-75), the court finds the request for $999,476.90 in
attorneys’ fees is reasonable. 
 
III.       CONCLSUION
 
The Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is
GRANTED.  Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Century
City, Mall, LLC is awarded $999,476.90 in attorneys’ fees.
 
Moving party to give notice.
