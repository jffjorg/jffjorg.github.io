[1] The Bank purports to bring this
motion on behalf of itself and nonparty SJS Associates, Inc. dba Lender’s
Foreclosure Services.  No authority is
cited in support of this procedural anomaly. 
To the contrary, case law suggests a party cannot bring an anti-Slapp
motion on behalf of a nonparty.  (See,
e.g., Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights v. Garamendi Garamendi (2005)
132 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1392 (rejecting proposition that a party’s status as an
intervenor on the side of the defense gave it a right to bring an anti-SLAPP
motion as a defendant because the complaint in intervention did not transform
the intervenor into a defendant).)  SJS
Associates is not a defendant in this action. 
Rather, the Bank seeks relief on behalf of defendant Shen.  As alleged in the Complaint, Shen conducts
business as Lender’s Foreclosure Services. 
Yet, Shen has not appeared in this action.  The Bank does not cite any authority for the
proposition that it may seek to specially strike allegations on behalf of
another defendant.  Consequently, the
court considers whether the Bank alone is entitled to relief.  


[2] Referred to in the Complaint and
the moving papers as “Trustee”.


[3] The fourth cause of action for
negligence is alleged against Shen alone. 
The court therefore does not consider further whether the allegations in
support of the negligence claim are subject to the special motion to strike.
