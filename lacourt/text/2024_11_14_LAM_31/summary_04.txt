And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's Motion for Attorneys' Fees, which was unopposed. The Plaintiff, Heidi A. Christiansen, seeks to enforce a settlement agreement with the Defendant, Carmiel Cohen, and recover attorney's fees and costs. The settlement agreement was entered into on January 19, 2017, and required the Defendant to make child support payments and pay $600,000 and $862,000 to the Plaintiff. The Defendant failed to comply with the agreement, and the Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce the agreement and seek attorney's fees and costs. The Court granted the motion and ordered the Plaintiff to file a motion for attorney's fees, costs, and expenses.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff is the prevailing party and is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The Plaintiff's request for attorney's fees in the sum of $5,772.50 and costs in the amount of $165.25 is reasonable. The Motion for Attorneys' Fees is granted, and the Plaintiff is awarded her attorney's fees and costs.
