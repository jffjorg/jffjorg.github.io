And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's unopposed motion for summary adjudication of the first and third causes of action. The first cause of action is for breach of contract, and the plaintiff has met its burden in showing that there are no triable issues of material fact. The plaintiff submitted evidence showing that a contract existed, and that he performed all of his obligations by making investments in Janus and loaning money to the company. The defendant breached the contract repeatedly by taking a salary from Janus without permission, and the plaintiff suffered damages as a result.

The third cause of action is for breach of fiduciary duty, and the plaintiff has also met its burden in showing that there are no triable issues of material fact. The plaintiff submitted evidence showing that Callahan had full control over the affairs of Janus and the money in its account, and that he owed fiduciary duties to the plaintiff. Callahan breached his fiduciary duty by taking a salary, loan, or any other money from the company without permission, and the plaintiff suffered damages as a result.
