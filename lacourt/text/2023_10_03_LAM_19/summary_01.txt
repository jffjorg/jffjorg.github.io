And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is continued to November 7, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. due to the improper redaction of evidence filed in support of the motion. The judge has ordered a hearing to consider the sealing of the redacted evidence and has granted the Defendant an opportunity to follow the procedures for filing records under seal. The Defendant must file a memorandum and supporting declaration for the motion to seal by November 7, 2023, and provide courtesy copies of all briefing filed by October 31, 2023. The judge has also warned that the court cannot consider evidence that is partially redacted without a court order, and has cited relevant California Rules of Court and case law.
