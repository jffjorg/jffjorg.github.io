## English Text Summary

The Judge has continued the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment to November 7, 2023. This is because the Defendant filed evidence with redactions without first obtaining a court order allowing for such redactions. The Judge cites California Rules of Court, emphasizing that court records are presumptively open, and redactions require a court order. 

The Judge has scheduled a hearing on November 7th to address the issue of the redacted evidence. The Defendant has the opportunity to file a motion to seal the records appropriately, with supporting documentation. Alternatively, the Defendant can refile the exhibits without redactions. The Judge has also ordered the Defendant to provide courtesy copies of all briefing related to the motion by October 31st.
