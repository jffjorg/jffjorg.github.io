[1]           Petitioner was suspended for three
days. (AR 69.) Under Civil Service Rule 18.01(C), “An employee who is suspended
for up to five days may appeal such suspension to the director of personnel.”
The rule further provides that the director of personnel “shall determine
whether or not to consider the appeal.” When no hearing is required by law, judicial
review of an administrative decision is available not under CCP § 1094.5 but
CCP § 1085. (Weary v. Civil Service Com. (1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 189, 195;
cf. Civ. Serv. Rule 4.03(A) [petition for hearing granted in cases of
suspension in excess of five days].)
