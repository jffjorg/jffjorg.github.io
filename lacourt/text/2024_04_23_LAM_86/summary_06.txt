Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the motion for leave to intervene filed by Oscar Barragan, Brendan Corbett, Bruce Chase, Anthony Geisbauer, Thomas Giandomenico, John MacDonald, Rick Rector, Steven Ruiz, and Edmundo Torres. The Proposed Intervenors seek to enforce the judgment and writ of mandate, which was issued on July 14, 2020. The writ commands the County of Los Angeles to pay explosive detail pay to all employees who are or were assigned to explosive breaching duties.

The Court has found that the Proposed Intervenors do not have an interest in the lawsuit, as they are management-level employees who were not represented by ALADS at the time the cross-petition was filed in August 2018. The Court has also found that the County did not have sufficient notice that ALADS sought relief on behalf of the Proposed Intervenors.

The Court has exercised its discretion to deny intervention, as the Proposed Intervenors do not have a direct interest in the lawsuit. The Court has considered the factors set forth in Hausmann v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 611, 616, including whether the intervenor has a direct interest in the lawsuit, whether intervention would not enlarge the issues raised by the original parties, and whether the intervenor would not "tread on the rights of the original parties to conduct their own lawsuit."
