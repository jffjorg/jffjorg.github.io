Date:               4/23/24
(1:30 PM)
Case:                           Hanmi Bank v. Overseas
Food Distribution, LLC et al. (24STCV01748)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Hanmi Bank’s UNOPPOSED
application for right to attach order with respect to defendant Shahpour
Javidzad is GRANTED. 
 
Pursuant to CCP §484.090, the Court finds:

the claim is one upon
     which attachment may be issued;
plaintiff has established
     the probable validity of the claim;
attachment is not sought
     for any purpose other than recovery on the claim; and
the amount to be attached
     is greater than zero.

 
Plaintiff’s claim is for amounts owed under an Equipment
Finance Agreement (“Agreement”) between plaintiff’s assignor, BSB Leasing, Inc.
(“BSB”) and defendant Overseas Food Distribution, LLC (“OFD”). (Jacobs Decl. ¶¶
7, 10 & Exs. 1, 4; Denton Decl. ¶¶ 5, 7 & Exs. 1, 4; Myerson Decl. ¶¶
5, 7 & Exs. 1, 4.) Under the Agreement, OFD financed the purchase of
specified equipment. OFD agreed to make 60 monthly payments of $3,216.46, plus
applicable taxes and insurance. (Jacobs Decl. ¶ 8(a), (b) & Ex. A at 1.)
OFD agreed that, upon default, including failure to make any payment when due,
BSB could declare all unpaid payments and all future payments immediately due
and payable. (Jacobs Decl. ¶ 8(d)(ii) & Ex. 1 at ¶ 12.)  Defendant Shahpour Javidzad signed an
Unconditional Guaranty of Equipment Finance Agreement (“Guaranty”), whereby
defendant guaranteed the amounts owed by OFD under the Agreement. (Jacobs Decl.
¶ 9 & Ex. 3; Denton Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 3; Myerson Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex.
3.)  
 
OFD owes $161,474.88 under the Agreement, plus interest and
late fees. (Jacobs Decl. ¶ 12.) Defendant Javidzad owes the same amount under
the Guaranty. (Jacobs Decl. ¶ 12.) 
 
Based on the foregoing, the application will be granted in
the amount of $171,474.88, which includes estimated costs of $2,500.00 and
estimated allowable attorney fees of $7,500.00. (Jacobs Decl. ¶ 8(d)(iv) &
Ex. 1 at ¶ 12.) 
 
The Court will sign the proposed Right to Attach Order and
Order for Issuance of Writ of Attachment after Hearing, electronically received
3/7/24, subject to certain modifications. 
The Order shall be as be to Shahpour Javidzad, who signed the Guaranty
in an individual capacity. (Jacobs Decl. ¶ 9 & Ex. 3.)  Accordingly, the Court shall strike any
reference to Javidzad and his capacity as Trustee of The Javidzad Family
Trust.  While a claim against an
individual may reach assets held in trust, that is not always the case.  Here, there is no showing that assets held in
The Javidzad Family Trust may be attached as if they are assets of Shahpour
Javidzad.  For this same reason, the
Court will strike the specific reference in Attachment A to the real property
located at 135 Carolyn Way, Beverly Hills, CA 90210, as the record before this
Court indicates such property is held by “Shahpour Javidzad and Firouzeh
Javidzad, Trustees of The Javidzad Family Trust dated December 18, 2015.”  (See Jacobs Decl. ¶ 20 & Ex. 9
[Quitclaim Deed for property].)
 
No Writ shall issue without the posting of bond in the
amount of $10,000. (CCP § 489.220.)
