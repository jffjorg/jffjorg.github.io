And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the Seventh Cause of Action alleging a violation of the Bance Civil Rights Act is granted. The judge has also granted the requests for judicial notice. The plaintiff, Daniel Antunez, alleges that his rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the California Constitution, and California laws were violated. However, the judge has determined that the claim is without merit because the Bance Civil Rights Act only applies to government actors, and the alleged violation in this case was committed by private security guards. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint to address the deficiency. The judge has given the moving party notice to file proof of service of such notice.
