And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in an action relating to elder abuse at a skilled nursing facility. Plaintiff Nathan Bears seeks leave to file a first amended complaint, primarily adding causes of action for wrongful death and violation of resident rights. The Court may allow the amendment if it is in the furtherance of justice and does not cause prejudice to the opposing party. The Judge has found that the proposed amendment will not cause sufficient prejudice to preclude it, and therefore grants the motion. The Judge notes that the statute of limitations issue raised by the defendants is an issue properly raised via a demurrer or summary adjudication motion, rather than through this motion. The Court sets the trial date for October 2025.
