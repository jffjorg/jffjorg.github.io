Summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment, denying the motion. The motion was brought by the defendants, who sought to have all claims against them dismissed. The defendants argued that the plaintiff, Kangying, LLC, was not a member of IMT LLC, and therefore had no standing to bring the claims. The Court agreed with the defendants, finding that the IMT LLC operating agreement did not define Kangying, LLC as a member, and that the termination agreement signed by Kevin Yap, a minority member of IMT LLC, only bound IMT LLC, not Kangying, LLC. The Court also found that there was a triable issue as to whether Kangying, LLC consented to the termination agreement. The Court granted the request for judicial notice and ordered the moving parties to submit a proposed judgment within 10 days.
