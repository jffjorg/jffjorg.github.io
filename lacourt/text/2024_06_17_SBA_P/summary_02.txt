And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the demand for punitive damages. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant, El Dorado LF, LLC, was liable for punitive damages due to the actions of its security guards during an altercation at the Hustler Casino. However, the judge found that the complaint did not contain sufficient factual allegations to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not allege that a managing agent of the defendant had acted with malice, oppression, or fraud. As a result, the judge granted the motion to strike the demand for punitive damages, but allowed the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.
