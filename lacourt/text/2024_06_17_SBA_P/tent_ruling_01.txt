  Case Number:  21TRCV00594    Hearing Date:   June 17, 2024    Dept:  P MOTION: DemurrerTentative Rulings: Cross-Defendant’s Demurrer is overruledI. BACKGROUNDPlaintiffs Robert Bass (“Bass”) and Jeannette Buchanan aka Jeannette Bass (“Buchanan”) (“Plaintiffs”) commenced this action on August 12, 2021. The operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”), filed on June 22, 2023, alleges causes of action for: (1) Breach of Oral Contract; and (2) Fraudulent Misrepresentation against defendant Tim Roth (“Roth”) and DOES. Plaintiffs allege that Roth breached an oral settlement agreement the parties entered into with regard to Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. YC072026 (the “Original Complaint”) (the “Settlement”). Plaintiffs allege that, in reliance on Roth’s promise to pay them $115,000 pursuant to the Settlement, Plaintiffs submitted a Request for Dismissal of the Original Complaint with the court on January 3, 2018.On February 20, 2024, Roth filed his First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”) against Plaintiffs and ROES alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Fraud; (3) Promissory Fraud; (4) Indemnity; (5) Breach of Contract; and (6) Promissory Fraud. The fourth COA is asserted against Buchanan only. The fifth and sixth COA are asserted against Bass only. The allegations common to all COAs are as follows:Bass and Roth were childhood friends. (FACC ¶ 5) In 2000, Bass started renting space from Roth for his business operations. (Id., ¶ 6.) Roth is a licensed real estate broker and general contractor. (Id., ¶ 15.) Roth met Buchanan after her marriage with Bass in 1993. (Id., ¶ 7.) In 2006, Bass and Buchanan got divorced. (Id., ¶ 8.) In 2007, Buchanan purchased real property located at 2410 Grant Avenue, Hermosa Beach, CA (the “Property”) for the total price of $800,000. (Id., ¶ 9; Exhibit A.) Buchanan borrowed about $640,000 for the purchase (the “Loan”), leaving $160,000 to be placed into escrow from other sources. (Ibid.) No real estate agents were involved in this transaction. (Ibid.) The Loan had a variable rate of interest which began in excess of 7.5% per annum with payments to be applied solely against interest for 10years. (Id., ¶ 10; Exhibit B.) Buchanan granted Bass, now her ex-husband, some form of ownership in the Property which was not recorded. (Id., ¶ 11.)When the real estate market crashed in 2008, Plaintiffs pleaded with Roth to help them avoid foreclosure. (Id., ¶ 15.) In March 2010, the parties entered into a purchase agreement, whereby Roth agreed to purchase 99% of the title to the Property, subject to the loans relating to the Property, for $50,000 (the “Purchase Agreement”). (Id., ¶¶17-19; Exhibits C and F.) While Bass never had any ownership of record and was already divorced from Buchanan prior to her purchase of the Property in her own name, Plaintiffs executed a Grant Deed purporting to convey Bass’ interest in the Property to Buchanan to induce Roth to enter the Purchase Agreement. (Id., ¶ 20; Exhibit D.) In 2016, the Property was sold without losses to Plaintiffs or damage to Buchanan’s credit score. (Id., ¶ 23.) Roth was not aware of the Original Complaint (filed in 2017 and voluntarily dismissed in 2018) or any purported settlement agreement between him and Plaintiffs until after this action was commenced. (Id., ¶ 24.)Plaintiffs now demur to the FACC.II. MEET AND CONFERPlaintiffs’ counsel’s two-paragraph declaration states that the parties met and conferred but were unable to reach an agreement. (See Ruhle Decl.) Roth’s counsel also maintains that the parties met and conferred, but there is no discussion or evidence of the substance of the parties’ efforts to meet and confer. Roth’s counsel also states that he encouraged Plaintiffs to file a declaration triggering an automatic 30-day extension of the time to respond to the FACC. (Johnson Decl., ¶ 3.)Nevertheless, Plaintiffs’ demurrer was untimely filed, even under the extended deadline. Roth moves the Court to strike the demurrer based on untimeliness. The court exercises its discretion to consider the demurrer. (Jackson v. Doe (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 742, 750.)III. MOVING PARTY’S GROUNDSPlaintiffs demur to all six COAs for uncertainty and insufficient facts (CCP § 430.10(e) and (f).)IV. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICEThe court may take judicial notice of “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of any state of the United States” pursuant to Evid. Code § 452(d). The Court may take judicial notice of the existence of the records, but not the truth of matters asserted in such records. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565).Roth requests judicial notice of various filings and rulings in this action and Case no. YC072026. Plaintiffs request judicial notice of the Court’s May 16, 2024 Minute Order re: Status Conference in this action.The parties’ requests for judicial notice are GRANTED as to the existence of the records, but not the truth of the matters contained in the records.V. ANALYSISA. Legal StandardA demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to respond to. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)1st and 5th COAs: Breach of Contract“The elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are: (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to plaintiff.” (Coles v. Glaser (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 384, 391(internal quotations omitted).) An action for breach of a written contract must be commenced within 4 years of the breach of that contract. (CCP § 337(a).)Plaintiffs contend that the FACC fails to allege the third element of breach. The FACC alleges that Plaintiffs breached the Purchase Agreement “by demanding Roth pay to Cross-Defendants sums that could not be owing to them in relation to the Property or for any other reason as a consequence of which Roth . . . has been deprived of the benefit of funds previously expended to fulfill his obligations under the agreements”. (FACC ¶ 29.) Plaintiffs argue that this is insufficient because Plaintiffs’ demand, which Roth alleges constitutes a breach of the Purchase Agreement, arises from Roth’s alleged breach of the oral agreement to settle the Original Complaint, not from the agreement to purchase the Property. However, the Purchase Agreement and the Settlement are inextricable from one another. Plaintiffs themselves admitted that the Original Complaint “arose from a real estate investment in a property located at 2410 Grant Avenue”, “in furtherance of” which Plaintiffs “provided a capital contribution to Roth . . . pursuant to an oral agreement.” (TAC at lines 18-24.) The purported Settlement arises from the Purchase Agreement. Roth properly pled each element of a claim for breach of contract.Regardless, the cross-complaint alleges a breach of written contract to purchase property; it need not and does not cite the factual allegations in plaintiff’s pleading.Plaintiffs also contend that the claim is time-barred because the Agreement was entered into in 2010. This argument fails because the limitations period only begins to run with Plaintiffs’ discovery of an alleged breach, not when a contract is formed.Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ demurrer to the 1st and 5th COAs is OVERRULED.2nd, 3rd, and 6th COAs: Fraud and Promissory Fraud“The elements of fraud are (a) a misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c) intent to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Ctr. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) The facts constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) To properly allege fraud against a corporation, the plaintiffs must plead the names of the persons allegedly making the false representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written. (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)Plaintiffs argue that the FACC fails to state how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered to comply with the heightened pleading standards of a fraud cause of action. Plaintiffs did not specifically identify any missing links in the FACC. The Court finds that the FACC sufficiently alleged a cause of action for fraud against both plaintiffs. Roth specifically identified misrepresentations made by Bass (FACC ¶ 32), misrepresentations made by Buchanan (FACC ¶ 33), and information that both plaintiffs hid from him (FACC ¶ 34). Roth believed and relied on those misrepresentations and omissions. (FACC ¶ 35.) The misrepresentations were false and the omissions were material. (FACC ¶ 36.) Roth was injured as a consequence. (FACC ¶ 38.)Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ demurrer to the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th COAs is OVERRULED.4th COA: Indemnity“To state a claim for equitable indemnity, a defendant must allege the same harm for which he may be held liable is properly attributable—at least in part—to the cross-defendant.” (Platt v. Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate Services (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1439, 1445, fn. 7.)The FACC alleges indemnity against Buchanan and ROES only. Bass seeks damages against Roth in the TAC. The FACC alleges that if Roth is held liable to Bass on the TAC, such liability is not the result of any wrongdoing on the part of Roth, but solely on the acts and omissions of Buchanan by reason of her failure to provide all material facts to Roth and herfailure to honor the promises and representations set forth in the general allegations and other undisclosed agreements. (FACC ¶ 47.)Plaintiffs demur to this cause of action on the grounds that Roth’s other causes of action in the FACC are invalid. As discussed above, Roth sufficiently pled all of the other causes of action. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ demurrer to the 4th COA must be OVERRULED.VI. CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
