And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to overrule the Plaintiffs' demurrer to the Cross-Defendant's demurrer. The Judge found that the Cross-Defendant has sufficiently pleaded causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, and promissory fraud. The Judge also found that the Plaintiffs' demurrer to the 1st and 5th causes of action for breach of contract was overruled because the Cross-Defendant properly pled each element of a claim for breach of contract. The Judge also found that the Plaintiffs' demurrer to the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th causes of action for fraud and promissory fraud was overruled because the Cross-Defendant sufficiently alleged a cause of action for fraud against both Plaintiffs. The Judge also found that the Plaintiffs' demurrer to the 4th cause of action for indemnity was overruled because the Cross-Defendant sufficiently pled all of the other causes of action.
