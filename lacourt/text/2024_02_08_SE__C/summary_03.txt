English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses from the Defendants. The Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to a Demand for Production of Documents and Special Interrogatories to conduct jurisdictional discovery. However, the Judge finds that the discovery sought is irrelevant to the issue of jurisdiction and is not likely to lead to the production of facts establishing jurisdiction. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's claims of alter-ego liability have no relevance to the issue of jurisdiction over Nellis Building Service, Inc. The Judge also notes that jurisdiction must be based on an individual's contacts to the state, and that alter-ego is not sufficient to extend jurisdiction. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to give notice to the opposing parties and sets a deadline for the Plaintiff to file a reply to the opposition.
