Motion to Set Aside Judgment is GRANTED.  
 
Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
Defendant STRATTON TERMITE & ROOFING SOLUTIONS, INC.’s
Proposed Answer attached as Exhibit 3 to the Moving Papers is not deemed filed.
Defendant STRATTON TERMITE & ROOFING SOLUTIONS, INC. is ORDERED to
shall file the Proposed Answer within five court days of the Court’s issuance
of this Order. 
 
All parties are ORDERED
to appear for a Case Management Conference on Friday, March 8, 2024 at 9:30
a.m. in Dept. SE-F. 
 
Judgment after Court Trial was entered on October 3, 2023. 
 
Defendant moves to set aside the default under CCP § 473(b), which
states that “[t]he court may…relieve a party or his or her legal representative
from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” 
 
The policy of hearing cases on
their merits is well-established. (See, e.g., Berman v. Klassman (1971)
17 Cal.App.3d 900.) Given the liberality associated with Motions to Set
Aside Defaults, the Court finds the Declarations of
Dante Ardite and Frank Martinez sufficient to warrant to relief. The law
favors trials on the merits. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th
975, 980.) The Court finds adequate grounds to allow Defendant
the opportunity to defend itself on the merits of this action.
 
The Motion is GRANTED. 
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff seeks $33,163.21 in fees and costs
associated with litigating this matter to date plus $3,157.26 in fees and costs
associated with opposing this Motion. Plaintiff also requests that this Court
re-issue an Order for Mr. Ardite to pay unpaid sanctions in the amount of
$4,905.00. Plaintiff’s requests for sanctions in the amounts sought are excessive.  The Court imposes sanctions in the amount of
$1,000.00 pursuant to CCP §473(c)(1)(A). “Whenever the court grants relief from
a default, default judgment, or dismissal based on any of the provisions of
this section, the court may do any of the following: (A) impose a penalty of no
greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) upon an offending attorney or
party.” (CCP §473(c)(1)(A).)
