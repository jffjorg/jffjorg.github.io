No Replies filed as of February 5, 2023. Due by February 1,

This wrongful termination action was filed by Plaintiff
DAVID J. LEE (“Plaintiff”) against Plaintiffs BASE HILL, INC. (“Jan Point”);
NELLIS BUILDING SERVICE, INC. (“Nellis”); and SUNNY KIM (“Kim”) on December 22,
2022. 
 
Plaintiff alleges that he was hired to be Senior Vice
President in the janitorial services industry by Kim for both Base Hill and
Nellis. (Complaint ¶13.) Plaintiff attended a board meeting with Kim on April
27, 2021, wherein Kim allegedly “informed Plaintiff that he was nothing but
‘two balls and a stick’…. [[¶] On 04/28/2021… Plaintiff informed Sunny Kim that
referring to him as nothing more than genitalia was sexual harassment and was
an illegal employment practice.” (Complaint ¶¶17-18.) “On 05/11/2021, Plaintiff
participated in another meeting with Sunny Kim before which Mr. Kim had been
drinking again. The issue of Sunny Kim’s verbal sexually abusive language was
again discussed. [¶] Sunny Kim informed Mr. Lee that he could be terminated for
Sunny Kim’s own ‘personal reasons.’ Plaintiff informed Sunny Kim that such
action would be wrongful termination…. In retaliation for Plaintiff’s good
faith complaints opposing sexual harassment, Sunny Kim then replied that
Plaintiff’s employment was terminated.” (Complaint ¶¶19-20.) 
 
Plaintiff is a resident of La Palma in Orange County, CA.
(Complaint ¶4.) Jan Point is a California Corporation with its principal place
of business in Los Angeles County, and is also qualified to do business in
Nevada. (Complaint ¶5.) Nellis is a Nevada Corporation, with its principal
place of business in Clark County, NV. (Complaint ¶7.) Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants are the alter egos of each other. (Complaint ¶9.) Plaintiff
initially performed all work in Santa Fe Springs, CA; but relocated to Las Vegas,
NV in 2021. (Complaint ¶¶14-15.) 
 
Plaintiff alleges that jurisdiction in the State of
California is proper “because at least one of the Defendants is a citizen of
California, and significant relief is being sought against Defendants whose
violations of California employment laws form a significant basis for
Plaintiff’s claims.” (Complaint ¶2.) 
 
Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses Demand for
Production of Documents (set one) against Defendants Kim and Nellis; and
Special Interrogatories (set one) against Defendants Kim and Nellis for the
purpose of conducting jurisdictional discovery, which Plaintiff argues is
necessary to oppose Defendants’ pending Motion to Quash. 
 
“The plaintiff has the right to conduct discovery with
regard to the issue of jurisdiction to develop the facts necessary to sustain
this burden.” (Mihlon v. Sup. Ct. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 703, 710.) In
order to take jurisdictional discovery, “the plaintiff must demonstrate that
discovery is likely to lead to the production of evidence of facts establishing
jurisdiction.” (In re Automobile Antitrust Cases I and II (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 100, 127.) “Any discovery must be limited to the issue of specific
personal jurisdiction based on the required minimum contacts… relevant to the
jurisdictional analysis.” (Burdick v. Sup. Ct. (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 8,
30.) 
 
“If the propounding party, on receipt of a
response to interrogatories, deems that (1) an answer to a particular
interrogatory is…incomplete…or (3) an objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general, that party may move for an order compelling further
response.” (CCP §2030.300(a).)
 
“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing,
or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further
response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following
apply: (1) A state of compliance with the demand is incomplete. (2) A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.” (CCP
§2031.310(a).) 
 
A motion to compel further responses to a request for production “shall
set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by
the inspection demand.” (CCP §2031.310(b).) 
 
Plaintiff moves to (separately) compel Defendant Kim’s further responses
to SI (set one) Nos. 3-6, 25-27, 31-33, 37-38, 50, 53, 55, 76, 78, 81, 84, and
88; and Nellis’ further responses to SI (set one) Nos. 3-6, 25, 29, 31, 33, 43,
58, and 59.
 
Plaintiff also moves to separately compel Defendant Kim’s further
responses to RPD (set one) Nos. 3-6, 25-27, 31-33, 37-38, 50, 53, 55, 76, 78,
81, 84, and 88; and Nellis’ further responses to RPD (set one) Nos. 1-6, 8, 13,
17, 21, 31, 44, 49, and 54.
 
The Motions to Compel Further Responses are DENIED. Plaintiff asserts
that the discovery he seeks is necessary to prove there is a “unity of
interest” between Sunny Kim and Nellis for purposes of establishing alter-ego
liability.  The discovery he seeks,
however, is irrelevant to the issue of jurisdiction and is not likely to lead
to the production of facts establishing jurisdiction.  Whether or not Kim and Nellis are alter egos
has no relevance to whether this Court has proper jurisdiction over
Nellis.  Nellis is a separate entity from
Kim and must be judged by its own contacts with California. For instance, even
where jurisdiction is proper over Kim, such jurisdiction does not automatically
confer jurisdiction over a separate corporate entity such as Nellis. Alter ego
is not sufficient, by itself, to extend jurisdiction. (HealthMarkets, Inc.
v. Sup. Ct. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1160, 1169-1170.) Jurisdiction must be
based on an individual’s contacts to the state. (Id.)
