Discussion
 
The Center brings forth the motion pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280 for an order that the Plaintiff be ordered that all
matters contained in the First Set of RFAs, including Facts numbers 1 to 35 and
the genuineness of the document known as Police Incident Report be deemed
admitted and conclusively established for all purposes in this action against
Plaintiff. While the complaint alleges that Plaintiff was attacked, the Center
maintains that Plaintiff  broke into the
homeless center by climbing a fence and picked a fight with someone staying at
the shelter. Turning to the facts to be admitted by Plaintiff, they include
facts as to the Center’s defense such as:
 
-       
About a year prior to the date of the incident March
14, 2021, Richard Castro was homeless.
-       
About a year prior to the date of the incident March
14, 2021, Richard Castro sought refuge and help at the temple run by the
Center.
-       
As he had done many times previously, on the morning of
the date of the incident, Richard Castro broke into the temple when he returned
from doing drugs and/or alcohol.
-       
As stated in in the police report #DR21-07116, Richard
Castro incited the incident by throwing a sandwich at “ZAMORANO aka Seva.
 
And according to the police report, Plaintiff arrived at the
Center, trespassed, challenged Zamorano to a fight, Plaintiff possibly had a
knife on him, and as Zamorano feared for his life, he used pepper spray and hit
Plaintiff on the head to defend himself. 
 
CCP section 2033.280 provides the following:
 
If a party to whom requests for
admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules
apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for admission are directed waives any
objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).
The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. (2) The party's failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010). c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both whose failure to serve
a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion. emphasis
added.) 
 
Here, the discovery was served upon Plaintiff’s prior
counsel in May 2024, but even with extensions, no responses were provided. Thus,
it is indisputable that Plaintiff has failed to serve timely responses. 
 
Additionally, the court orders that the genuineness of the
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted. 
 
Lastly, as for monetary sanctions, absent an opposition, the
court finds no substantial justification in failing to respond to discovery.
The Center requests $970.00 against Plaintiff (calculated as follows: 1.5 hours
drafting the motion and supporting papers, 1 hour to appear at the
hearing, $75 for costs/fees, at $450/hour). (See Schloss Decl. ¶ 6.) Here,
utilizing a Lodestar approach and considering the totality of the
circumstances, the court finds 1 hour expended on the motion reasonable (as no
supporting paper to draft since no opposition) + 30 minutes for the hearing and
reduces the hourly rate from $450/hour to $300/hour for total monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $525 (1.5 hours + $75 fees). 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing—as no responses have been served to
the RFAs propounded upon Plaintiff in May—the motion is granted in addition to
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Richard Casto in the reduced amount of $525.
