And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Tabawa Mindfulness and Detachment Center brings a motion for an order establishing admissions and for monetary sanctions against Richard Castro, the plaintiff. The motion is granted, and Richard Castro is ordered to admit the facts specified in the requests for admission. The court also imposes monetary sanctions on Richard Castro in the amount of $525. The Center had served discovery requests on Richard Castro's prior counsel in May 2024, but no responses were provided, and Richard Castro has failed to serve timely responses to the requests for admission. The court finds that Richard Castro has failed to justify his failure to respond to discovery, and therefore, monetary sanctions are imposed.
