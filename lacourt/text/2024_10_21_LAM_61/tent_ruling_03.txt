If trial is not held within the time allowed, an action may be dismissed by the court on its own motion or on motion of the defendant. (Code Civ. Proc. § 583.360, subd. (a).)Defendant Joseph C. Hooper (Defendant) represents that the present action and related divorce action filed against Plaintiff Marianne Hooper (Plaintiff) were settled in December 2021, but that no notice of dismissal has been filed. (Motion at p. 3.) Given the complaint’s initial filing date of December 10, 2015, Defendant argues that the five-year time limit passed in December 2020, and now dismissal is required under Code of Civil Procedure § 583.310.The original action being filed in December 2015, the five-year deadline in which to bring the case to trial has long passed. Defendant’s counsel declares that he has attempted to get Plaintiff’s counsel to file a dismissal pursuant to a settlement agreement, but has received only promises that Plaintiff’s counsel would get back to him. (Frazee Decl. ¶ 3.) No opposition has been filed.The time limit has passed, and the motion is GRANTED.
