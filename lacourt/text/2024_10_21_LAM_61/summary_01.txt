And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Zhifeng Ren, has moved to vacate the default and default judgment entered against him on June 27 and August 23, 2022, respectively. The defendant argues that the proof of personal service filed in the case is false, as he claims he was not present at the address where he was allegedly served on March 23, 2022. However, the court finds that the defendant's motion is defective in several respects. Firstly, it is supported by no competent evidence, as the defendant's own declaration is missing and the declaration of his counsel is based on hearsay. Secondly, the declarations of the process servers submitted by the plaintiff corroborate the fact that the defendant was served and received timely notice. Finally, the motion is untimely, as it was filed just within the two-year deadline but the defendant admits that he was made aware of the judgment through a text from the plaintiff in August 2023 and did not seek relief until a year later. The court also notes that the defendant's briefing in support of his motion is excessive and unpersuasive. Therefore, the motion to vacate the default and default judgment is denied.
