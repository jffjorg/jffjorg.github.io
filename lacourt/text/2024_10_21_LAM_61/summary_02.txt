And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motions to compel further responses to requests for production filed by Plaintiff Raymond Ghermezian. The motions were filed in an attempt to obtain discovery sought by inspection demands, but the judge found that the motions failed to establish good cause for the discovery. The judge noted that the parties have previously agreed to conduct an informal discovery conference before filing motions to compel, and that the moving party has not demonstrated a legitimate basis for the discovery sought. The judge also found that the responses from the defendants were adequate and that no further responses are required. As a result, the judge denied the motions and did not award any sanctions to either party.
