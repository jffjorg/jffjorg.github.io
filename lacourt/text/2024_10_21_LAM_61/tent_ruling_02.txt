 Case Number:  23STCV13104    Hearing Date:   October 21, 2024    Dept:  61 RAYMOND GHERMEZIAN, et al. vs ALMA NUNEZ, et al.TENTATIVEPlaintiffs Raymond Ghermezian and Raymond Ghermezian, A Professional Corporation’s Motions to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production from Defendants Alma Nunez and Joseph H. Low IV are DENIED. No sanctions are awarded.Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSIONPlease note that this Court now requires that an Informal Discovery Conference be conducted before any party files a motions to compel further going forward. “A party may demand that any other party produce . . . a document that is in the possession, custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010(b).) The demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that (1) a statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete, (2) a representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or (3) an objection in the response is without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(a).) “The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand,” and “[t]he motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b).)A motion to compel a further response to an inspection demand must set forth specific facts showing “good cause” justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1); Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) Unless there is a legitimate privilege issue or claim of attorney work product, that burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance. (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 444.) Once the moving party demonstrates good cause for the discovery, the burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure to fully respond to the inspection demand. (Coy v Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220.)Plaintiff Raymond Ghermezian (Plaintiff) seeks to compel further responses to Requests for Production No. 10–12 from Defendants Alma Nunez and Joseph Low (Defendants). These requests are as follows:· Request No. 10: Any and all DOCUMENTS referring to medical records, reports, and billing in which MS. NUNEZ received care and treatment for on the NUNEZ vs. AVALON BAY COMMUNITIES, INC. Case No. 30-2019-01107010 matter.· Request No. 11: Any and all DOCUMENTS establishing negotiated amounts of medical billing on MS. NUNEZ’ medical care on the NUNEZ v. AVALON BAY COMMUNITIES, INC. Case, Case # 30-2019-01107010 matter.· Any and all DOCUMENTS establishing final paid amounts of medical billing on MS. NUNEZ’ medical care on the NUNEZ vs. AVALON BAY COMMUNITIES, INC., Case £ 03-2019-01107010 matter.Defendants responded to Request No. 10 with objections based on privacy, privilege, the collateral source rule, and on the grounds that Plaintiff already had the information. (Separate Statement at p. 2.) Defendants also responded that they did not possess the documents in question, but identified the medical providers who were in possession of the information. (Separate Statement at pp. 2–4.) Defendants responded to Requests No. 11 and 12 with statements of inability to comply, stating that no responsive documents exist because no negotiations have been permitted to take place because of Plaintiff’s interference. (Separate Statement at pp. 4–7.)Plaintiff argues that the response to Request No. 10 is defective because Defendants have previously indicated that they have possession of the medical records. (Separate Statement t p. 4.) Plaintiff also argues that the responses to Requests No. 11 and 12 are non-compliant because they do not state whether the documents requested have never existed, in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.230. (Separate Statement at pp. 6–8.)Defendants in opposition argue that no further responses are required as to Request No. 10, because all of Nunez’s medical records were produced on October 3, 2024. (Cohen Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendants also argue that no further response is required as to Requests No. 11 and 12, because they have supplied a statement of inability to comply.Plaintiff’s motions are unpersuasive, because they fail to establish any good cause for the documents sought. A motion to compel a further response to an inspection demand must set forth specific facts showing “good cause” justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1.) Plaintiff here simply presents the the requests and argues that Defendants’ responses are meritless, without articulating any relationship between the requests and the present action.Little cause would be served by granting the motion here, since Defendants have since produced the medical records at issue, satisfying Request No. 10. Nor is any further response required as to Requests No. 11 or 12, as Defendants have already supplied statements of inability to comply under Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.230. Although Plaintiff argues that Defendants have not stated specifically whether the documents never existed or have been lost, the responses clearly state that responsive documents do not exist because the negotiated amounts or payments therefore have not yet occurred. (Separate Statement at pp. 4–7.)The motion is DENIED.II. SANCTIONSStatute provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for admission, absent substantial justification otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)Plaintiff seeks $2,800.00 in connection with each motion, a sum he cannot recover because he has not prevailed and because self-represented litigants cannot recover attorney fees for theirself-representation. (See Do v. Superior Court (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1217.)Defendant Low seeks $3,100 in sanctions, representing roughly 5.16 hours of attorney work at $600 per hour. (Low Decl. ¶¶ 3–4.) But once again, Low’s declaration reveals he was performing the work on his own behalf, and no sanctions are appropriate. (Ibid.)Nunez seeks $3,200 in sanctions, but provides no supporting declaration, referring instead to Low’s declaration in support of his own motion. (Nunez Opposition at p. 3.) But Low’s declaration states that he prepared his own opposition materials, and Nunez’s opposition papers are signed by another attorney.No sanctions are awarded.
