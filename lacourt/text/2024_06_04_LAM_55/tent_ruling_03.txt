 Case Number:  23STCV17717    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Defendant Colgate-Palmolive Company’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Initial
Responses to Form and Special Interrogatories, Sets One, and Request for
Sanctions in the Amount $1,347.50. Defendant Colgate-Palmolive Company’s Motion
to Compel Plaintiff Augustina Nwosu’s Responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, Pursuant To Code Of Civil Procedure §2031.300(B) and
Request for Sanctions in the Amount of $1,347.50.
BACKGROUND
AUGUSTINA NWOSU (“Plaintiff”) brings this case against
THE COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY and SMART & FINAL
for alleged injuries Plaintiff sustained from her deodorant.  
Defendant THE COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COMPANY (“Defendant”) filed
two motions to compel Plaintiff to provide initial, verified responses to
special interrogatories, form interrogatories and document requests, and
imposing $1,347.50 in sanctions as to each motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A motion to compel initial discovery responses need
only show that discovery was properly served on the opposing party, the time to
respond expired, and no response was served. Leach v. Sup. Ct. (1980)
111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 06; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 (compelling initial
interrogatory responses),  2031.300
(compelling initial document requests). A motion to compel initial discovery
responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing,
and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390,
404.
Generally, monetary sanctions are mandatory as to
parties losing discovery motions, unless courts find substantial justification
or other injustice. E.g., Foothill Properties v. Lyon/Copley Corona Assocs.,
L.P. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1542, 1557-1558. “‘[S]ubstantial justification’
has been understood to mean that a justification is clearly reasonable because
it is well-grounded in both law and fact.” Doe v. U.S. Swimming, Inc.
(2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1434. “If the party seeking a monetary sanction
meets its burden of proof, the burden shifts to the opposing party attempting
to avoid a monetary sanction to show that it acted with ‘substantial
justification.’” Doe v. U.S. Swimming, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1424,
1435.
ANALYSIS
Defendant filed the motions based on Plaintiff’s
failure to provide any response to properly served discovery requests. Defendant
has adequately shown that it served Plaintiff with the discovery on 3/12/24 but
Plaintiff did not timely serve responses or respond to the meet and confer
requests by Defendant’s counsel. Defendant therefore had no choice but to file
this motion. Plaintiff filed a declaration from her attorney explaining that he
had “personal challenges” that prevented him from promptly responding to the
discovery but that Plaintiff has now served verified written responses to the
three sets of discovery. Onyejekwe Decl., ¶ 2, Exs. A, B. 
Where respondents served untimely discovery responses
after parties have filed motions to compel initial responses, courts have broad
discretion as to ruling, including: 1) denying the motion as moot, in whole or
part, where valid responses without objections have resolved the motion; 2)
awarding requested sanctions; 3) allowing moving party to take the motion off
calendar; 4) considering the motion as voluntarily narrowed in scope; 5)
compelling responses without objection, where no legally valid responses have
been provided, as to some, or all, interrogatories; 6) treating the motion as
one to compel further responses, and ruling accordingly, with, or without, a
separate statement; 7) ordering the parties to meet and confer; 8) ordering
moving party to file a separate statement; or, 9) ordering the motion off
calendar while requiring the propounding party to file a motion to compel
further responses. Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Klugman (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 409.
Given that Plaintiff has now served verified written
responses to the outstanding discovery, the Court exercises its discretion to
take the motions off calendar as moot. The Court also exercises its discretion
to find that there was substantial justification for Plaintiff’s tardy
responses based on counsel’s explanation that personal issues prevented him
from serving the responses earlier. Thus, the Court will not impose monetary
sanctions. 
The other defendant in this case also has motions to
compel responses on calendar for 7/1/2024. The Court will ask Plaintiff at the
hearing about the status of those responses. 
CONCLUSION
The Court orders the motions off calendar, as moot.
