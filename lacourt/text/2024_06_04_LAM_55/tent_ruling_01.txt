  Case Number:  22STCV29915    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Application of Darian A. Stanford for Special Admission - Pro Hac Vice for
Defendant Jonathan Beckman.
BRADLEY LAW et al. (“Plaintiffs”)
bring this case against EVENTUS HOLDINGS, LLC et al. (“Defendants”) related to
Defendants’ alleged scheme to take Plaintiffs’ assets in violation of various agreements. Oregon attorney Darian A. Stanford applies for admission
pro hac vice for Defendant JONATHAN BECKMAN. 
A judge’s determination of whether to grant an
application to appear pro hac vice is evaluated under the
abuse-of-discretion standard. E.g., United States Golf Ass'n v. Arroyo
Software Corp. (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 607, 624. 
The Court finds that the motion sufficiently complies
with California Rules of Court, rule 9.40, including the applicant’s
declaration addressing the rule elements. Counsel declares that in the past two
years he has filed just one other amended application to appear pro hac vice in
California courts. No reason appears to deny the application, including because
of the absence of any opposition.
The Court grants the application. The Court sets a
nonappearance re pro hac vice renewal fee as to Darian A. Stanford for June 4.
