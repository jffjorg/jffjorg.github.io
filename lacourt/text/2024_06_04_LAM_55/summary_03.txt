And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the motions to compel initial discovery responses and requests for sanctions filed by the defendant, Colgate-Palmolive Company. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff, Augustina Nwosu, failed to provide timely responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff's attorney explained that personal challenges prevented him from promptly responding to the discovery requests. The Court finds that the defendant has adequately shown that it served the plaintiff with the discovery requests, but the plaintiff failed to respond in a timely manner. However, the Court also finds that there was substantial justification for the plaintiff's tardiness. Therefore, the Court will not impose monetary sanctions. The Court will take the motions off calendar as moot, as the plaintiff has now served verified written responses to the outstanding discovery.
