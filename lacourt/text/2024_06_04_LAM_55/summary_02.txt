Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrers to certain claims in the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC) are sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff has been given permission to file and serve a Third Amended Complaint (TAC) that abandons certain claims. The judge has also tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's claims for quiet title, fraud, breach of contract, and negligence are without merit. The plaintiff is required to attend the hearing to discuss the filing and potential further briefing schedule.
