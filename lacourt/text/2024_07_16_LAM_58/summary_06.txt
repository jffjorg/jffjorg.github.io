And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Jamilah Duncan's motion for order approving attorney's fees to her counsel in the amount of $50,754.50 (net $43,689.39), approving supplemental fees to partition referee Charles Grimes in the amount of $6,377.50, and ordering that the balance of the funds be interpleaded due to conflicting claims.

The judge has found that the attorney's fees incurred by Plaintiff's counsel are reasonable and incurred for the common benefit. The judge has also found that the supplemental fees to the partition referee are recoverable costs of partition under Code of Civil Procedure §874.010(b).

Regarding the interpleader, the judge has found that the situation permitting interpleader exists, as there are conflicting claims to the remaining net sales proceeds due to Jamisha Duncan. The judge has ordered that the remaining net sales proceeds be interpleaded with the court, pending resolution of the dispute over payment of the two attorney liens against Jamisha Duncan.

The judge will determine the custodian for the interpleaded funds at the hearing on July 16, 2024.
