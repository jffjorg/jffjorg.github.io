I.              
Background
 
On October 12, 2024, Plaintiff
Jamilah Duncan filed this action against Defendants Jamisha Duncan, Jahlil
Vigil and Natalie Gergely alleging (1) Partition of Real Property; (2) Battery;
(3) Negligence; (4) IIED; and (5) NIED. Plaintiff owns a 50% interest in 246
East 135th Street, Los Angeles, CA (the “Property”) as a tenant in
common with Defendant Jamisha Duncan. 
Plaintiff seeks an order for partition of the Property.  Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant Jamisha
Duncan and Jahlil Vigil attacked her on June 16, 2022.  
 
On February 23, 2024, the court
approved a partition by sale of real property, which sale closed on April 16,
2024.  Sales proceeds in the amount of
$150,883.82 were deposited with the Court on April 24, 2024.  Thereafter, on May 3, 2024, the Court
directed that this motion for fees should be filed and set for hearing on July
16, 2024.  
 
II.           
Discussion 
 
A.   
 Applicable
Law
 
            “The
costs of partition include: (a) Reasonable attorney's fees incurred or paid by
a party for the common benefit. (b) The fee and expenses of the referee. (c)
The compensation provided by contract for services of a surveyor or other
person employed by the referee in the action. (d) The reasonable costs of a
title report procured pursuant to Section 872.220 with interest thereon at the
legal rate from the time of payment or, if paid before commencement of the
action, from the time of commencement of the action. (e) Other disbursements or
expenses determined by the court to have been incurred or paid for the common
benefit.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 874.010.)  
 
            “The
costs of partition as apportioned by the court may be ordered paid in whole or
in part prior to judgment.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§874.110(a).)  “The proceeds of sale for
any property shall be applied in the following order:  (a) Payment of the expenses of sale. (b)
Payment of the other costs of partition in whole or in part or to secure any
cost of partition later allowed. (c) Payment of any liens on the property in
their order of priority except liens which under the terms of sale are to
remain on the property. (d) Distribution of the residue among the parties in proportion
to their shares as determined by the court.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §873.820.)  
 
            “The
court must order that all the sale proceeds and any security be either
transferred to the interested persons or held for their benefit. The proceeds
may be held by being deposited in court, placed in trust, invested in
California or federal Government bonds, or deposited in a savings account in a
federally insured institution. (Code Civ. Proc., § 873.810.) Holding proceeds
may be appropriate, for example, pending resolution of a dispute over payment
of a lien. (Legislative Com. Comment to C.C.P. 873.820.) (See C.E.B., 1 Real
Property Remedies and Damages 2d, § 8.81 et seq.)”  (12 Witkin, Summary (11th
ed. 2017), Real Prop, §80.)
 
B.   
Request for Attorney’s Fees Reasonable
 
Plaintiff incurred attorney’s fees of $50,754.50 for the
common benefit based on 10 hours of legal work drafting and filing the
Complaint and obtaining defaults, approximately 50 hours in connection with law
and motion practice in this action and approximately 20 hours in connection
with settlement discussions with Defendant Jamisha Duncan, negotiations with
the foreclosing lender, negotiations with Defendant’s former attorneys, both of
whom filed liens and/or lis pendens, conversations with the partition referee,
and drafting various stipulations re: agreements to vacate on close of sale and
agreements to release liens in return for an order depositing all funds with
the clerk of court.  (Motion, Butler
Dec., ¶¶5-7.) The remaining time was spent on miscellaneous court proceedings
or communications with other parties or the partition referee.  (Id.)
 
Plaintiff requests a net attorney’s fee award of
$43,689.39.  Plaintiff’s explanation for
this amount is unclear. Plaintiff claims there the net sales proceeds were
$258,765.86.  Plaintiff then states “The
subtraction of outstanding fees of $57,132.00, leaves a balance of
$201,633.86.”  (Motion, 5:19-20.)  There is no explanation as to what these
“outstanding fees” in the points and authorities or Butler’s declaration.  The accuracy of Plaintiff’s calculation of
the balance of sale proceeds therefore cannot be confirmed.   
 
Accepting the accuracy of Plaintiff’s calculation of the net
sales proceeds, Plaintiff and Defendant Jamisha were entitled to half of that
amount—$100,816.93.  A judgment lien
against Plaintiff was paid from the sale proceeds through escrow in the amount
of $107,882.04.  As such, Plaintiff
received $7,065.11 more than she was entitled to from the net sales proceeds
($107,882.04-$100,816.93).  Plaintiff
states that amount should be deducted from Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees of
$50,754.50, leaving a net attorney fee award of $43,689.  
 
Plaintiff’s counsel submits a declaration attesting to an
hourly rate of $595.  (Motion, Butler
Dec., ¶3.)  Plaintiff’s counsel attests
to approximately 80 hours dedicated to the partition sale and the common
benefit of the tenants in common.  (Id.
at ¶¶5-7.)  Plaintiff’s counsel attaches
copies of itemized bills for work performed on this matter.  (Id. at ¶4, Ex. 1.)  
 
Based on a review of the bills, the amount requested is
reasonable and incurred for the common benefit. 
No opposition was filed to the request for fees.  The request for attorney’s fees is granted as
recoverable cost of partition under Code of Civil Procedure §874.010(a).  
 
C.   
Request for Supplemental Award of Referee’s Fees
Reasonable
 
            The
partition referee, Charles Grimes, has already received $13,522.50 for the
service rendered in this action and costs were advanced in the amount of
$800.  Grimes now requests an additional $6,337.50
for services rendered up to the date of discharge by deposit with the court of
the net sales proceeds.  Grimes provides
a declaration in support of that amount for services rendered from February 9,
2024 through May 3, 2024.  (Motion,
Grimes Dec., Attachment). Funds were deposited with the clerk on April 24, 2024
and Grimes attended a status conferred regarding the sale on May 3, 2024.  (Id.) 

 
            The
request for a supplemental award of referee’s fees in the amount of $6,337.50
is granted.  Such fees are recoverable
costs of partition under Code of Civil Procedure §874.010(b).
 
D.   
Request that Balance of Funds be Interpleaded
Proper
 
            Interpleader
is proper whenever “double or multiple claims are made … by two or more persons
… such that they may [expose the person against whom the claims are asserted] …
to double or multiple liability …”  (Code
of Civ. P., §386(b).)  “The true test of
suitability for interpleader is the stakeholder's disavowal of interest in the
property sought to be interpleaded, coupled with the perceived ability of the
court to resolve the entire controversy as to entitlement to the property
without need for the stakeholder to be a party to the suit.”  (Pacific Loan Mgmt. Corp. v. Sup.Ct.
(Armstrong) (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1485, 1489-1490.) 
 
            “The
function of an interpleader action is to eliminate the risk of incorrectly
resolving conflicting claims. When a disagreement arises as to the ownership of
said property, the holder thereof has not obligated himself to settle said
disagreement and deliver the property to either of said parties in the face of
conflicting claims thereto.”  (Southern
California Gas Co. v. Flannery (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 477, 489 (citing
Pacific Loan Management Corp., supra and Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp.
(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 876 (stakeholder not obligated to “resolve the
apparent dispute without the consent of the competing claimants”).)  
 
            “Typical”
situations permitting interpleader include “a bank escrow holder faced with
conflicting claims of vendor, purchaser and purchaser's assignee; an escrow
holder of a fund where one claimant notified the escrow holder that the
contract was cancelled and nothing should be paid to the other claimant; and an
insurance company admitting liability under a life insurance policy where
conflicting claims to the proceeds existed.” 
(Pacific Loan Mgmt., supra, 196 Cal.App.3d at 1490.) 
 
            Plaintiff
asks that the court order that the remaining net sales proceeds that are due
Defendant Jamisha Duncan be interpleaded with the court.  Plaintiff maintains there are two attorney
liens against Jamisha that have not been reduced to a judgment and therefore
could not be paid from escrow.  The two
liens total $114,045.18, which exceeds the amount of sales proceeds due to
Jamisha ($100,816.93 if Plaintiff’s calculation is accepted as correct).  In the face of these two competing attorney
liens which exceed the amount of proceeds due Jamisha, Plaintiff’s request for
an order requiring interpleader is proper. 

 
            At
the hearing the Court will determine the custodian for the interpleaded funds.
 
III.       Conclusion
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion for Order (1) Approving Attorney’s Fees to Plaintiff’s Counsel in the
Amount of $50,754.50 [Net 43,689,39]; (2) Approving Supplemental Fees to
Partition Referee in the Amount of $6,377.50; (3) Ordering that Balance of the
Funds be Interpleaded due to Conflicting Claims is GRANTED.
