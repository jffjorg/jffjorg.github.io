**Case Information**

* Case Name: Emir Phillips v. Gary Fidler, et al.
* Case Number: 24STCV05755
* Hearing Date: July 16, 2024

**Tentative Ruling**

* The defendants' special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP motion) is GRANTED as to the first through fifth causes of action for defamation, false light, negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and breach of contract.
* The defendants are awarded fees in the amount of $9,500.
* The defendants' special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP motion) is GRANTED as to the protected conduct in the sixth cause of action for breach of privacy.
* The defendants are awarded fees in the amount of $6,412.50.

**Background**

* The plaintiff alleges that the defendants defamed him and painted him in a false light by attaching his LinkedIn page to an unlawful detainer complaint and making false allegations regarding his employment.
* The defendants argue that their actions were protected by the anti-SLAPP statute.

**Discussion**

* The court finds that the defendants' conduct was protected by the anti-SLAPP statute, as it was related to a pending judicial proceeding and was made in furtherance of the defendants' right of petition or free speech.
* The court also finds that the plaintiff failed to establish the probability of prevailing on his claims, as he failed to submit prima facie evidence of each element of his causes of action.
* The court further finds that the defendants established an absolute affirmative defense based on Civil Code section 47(b), the litigation privilege.

**Request for Attorney's Fees**

* The defendants are entitled to mandatory fees as prevailing parties on the anti-SLAPP motion.
* The court reduces the defendants' requested fees from $19,060 to an amount to be determined, as the hourly rate of $950 is excessive.

**Conclusion**

* The defendants' special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP motion) is GRANTED as to the first through fifth causes of action and a portion of the sixth cause of action.
* The defendants are awarded fees in the amount of $9,500 and $6,412.50.
* The court will issue a final ruling after considering any objections to the tentative ruling.
