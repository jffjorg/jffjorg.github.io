            Background
 
Plaintiffs filed the Complaint on February 26, 2021. Plaintiffs’
First Amended Complaint was filed on July 15, 2022. Plaintiffs’ Second Amended
Complaint was filed on February 27, 2023. Plaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaint
(“TAC”) was filed on October 17, 2023. Plaintiffs allege the following facts.  On March 2, 2020, Plaintiffs suffered water
damage on their real property, located at 111 Avenue F., Unit 1, Redondo Beach,
CA 90277, when the toilet in the bathroom overflowed.  Plaintiffs allege claims of insurance bad
faith against the insurance carriers as well as claims against contractors
based on failure to remediate.  Manuel
Rocha is alleged to be the sales agent who sold the HOA policy written by
Farmers Insurance Exchange.  Plaintiffs
allege the following causes of action: 1. Breach of Written Contract; 2. Breach
of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; 3. Intentional
Misrepresentation and Fraud; 4. Negligent Misrepresentation and Fraud; 5. IIED;
6. Elder Abuse; 7. Negligence; 8. Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code 17200; 9. Breach
of Written Contract; 10. Breach of Written Contract.
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of
action.”  (Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) 
"Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer." 
(Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure §
430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
Active Environmental Solutions, LLC and Joshua
Lingurar (“Active Defendants”)
 
Defendants demur to the third, fifth, and sixth causes
of action on the grounds that the causes of action fail to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
 
Meet and
Confer
 
Defendants set forth a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41 and CCP § 435.5. (Decl., Keith A.
Haskins.)
 
Third Cause of Action for Fraud 
 
The demurrer to the third cause of action is overruled.
 Plaintiffs state facts sufficient to
state a cause of action. 
 
“A complaint for fraud must allege the following
elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent
to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and
(4) resulting damages.”  Service by
Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816. “[T]he
elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he has known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” Boschma v. Home Loan
Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.
 
“Every element of the cause of action for fraud must
be alleged in the proper manner and the facts constituting the fraud must be
alleged with sufficient specificity to allow defendant to understand fully the
nature of the charge made.”  Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.  Plaintiffs must state facts which “show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.”  Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.
 
Plaintiffs have alleged specific facts as to how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made. (TAC, ¶¶
58-59, 119.)  Plaintiffs allege that
Defendants falsely represented through the written work order authorization
that they would conduct mold testing when they did not intend to do so.  (Id.)  In
addition, Plaintiffs have alleged specific facts to meet the elements of
knowledge of falsity, intent to deceive, and justifiable reliance.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants knew that
the representation was false because they did not intend to conduct mold
testing in order to continue to get work from Liberty vendors. Plaintiffs have alleged
facts to demonstrate intent to deceive, justifiable reliance, and damages.  (TAC, ¶¶ 119, 121, 122.)
 
Plaintiffs have alleged facts to demonstrate the
existence of a duty separate and apart from the duty contained within the
agreement. “[C]onduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious only
when it also violates a duty independent of the contract arising from
principles of tort law. An omission to perform a contract obligation is never a
tort, unless that omission is also an omission of a legal duty.” Erlich v.
Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551 (internal citations and quotations
omitted). Here, Plaintiffs have alleged that they were induced to enter into
the agreement based and in reliance on the false representations and would not
have otherwise entered into the agreement. Thus, the cause of action is not
directly based on a breach of the agreement, but upon fraudulent inducement to
enter into the agreement.
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the third cause of action is
overruled. 
 
Fifth Cause of Action for IIED
 
Defendants’ demurrer is overruled.  Plaintiffs state facts sufficient to state a
cause of action.
 
“The elements of a prima facie case for the tort of
intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1) extreme and outrageous
conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard
of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's
suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate
causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous
conduct.”  Miller v. Fortune Commercial Corp. (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 214,
228–29.
 
Plaintiffs have alleged facts to meet the elements of
the cause of action. Based on the conduct already alleged in paragraphs 58-60
and 119, alleging conduct which would directly expose Plaintiffs to toxic mold,
the factual allegations are sufficient to allege extreme and outrageous conduct
with the intention or reckless disregard of the probability of causing
emotional distress, as well as causation of severe emotional distress. (TAC, ¶¶
133.)  “Where reasonable [minds] may
differ, it is for the jury, subject to the control of the court, to determine
whether, in the particular case, the conduct has been sufficiently extreme and
outrageous to result in liability.” Fuentes v. Perez (1977) 66
Cal.App.3d 163, 172.  
 
The demurrer to the fifth cause of action is overruled.

 
Sixth Cause of Action for Elder Abuse
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.  Plaintiffs fail to state facts
sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30 states, in relevant
part: “(a) “Financial abuse” of an elder or dependent adult occurs when a
person or entity does any of the following:
(1) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains
real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or
with intent to defraud, or both.
(2) Assists in taking, secreting, appropriating,
obtaining, or retaining real or personal property of an elder or dependent
adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both.
(3) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or
retains, or assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or
retaining, real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult by undue
influence, as defined in Section 15610.70.”
 
Pleading a claim for elder abuse requires specific
facts of intentional or, at a minimum, reckless conduct.  See, Worsham v. O’Connor Hospital
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 331, 338.  To
state the statutory cause of action for Financial Elder Abuse, Plaintiff must
plead specific facts.  See, Covenant
Care v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 771, 790.  
 
Plaintiffs have failed to state the requisite specific
facts to state a cause of action.  Plaintiffs
attempt to allege a cause of action for elder abuse based on financial abuse.  However, there are no facts to show that
demurring Defendants herein took, secreted, appropriated, obtained, or retained
real or personal property of Plaintiffs, or assisted in doing so.  The factual allegations to support the elder
abuse cause of action are similar to the allegations of the third and fifth
cause of action.  However, the damages
complained of in those causes of action are not based on the taking of
Plaintiff’s property, but, instead, emotional distress damages or damages
related to the purported fraud.  There
are no facts that demurring Defendants actually took any of Plaintiffs’ own
personal or real property or assisted in doing so. 
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.
 
Rainbow International of Buena Park and Mark
Lingurar’s Demurrer to Third Amended Complaint (“RBP”) or (“JTIE”)

Defendants demur to the third, fifth, and sixth causes
of action for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
and uncertainty.
 
Meet and Confer

Defendants set forth a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41 and CCP § 435.5. (Decl., Johanna Boktor.)
 
Third Cause of Action for Fraud 
 
The demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts sufficient to state
a cause of action. 
 
“A complaint for fraud must allege the following
elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent
to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and
(4) resulting damages.”  Service by
Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816. “[T]he
elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he has known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” Boschma v. Home Loan
Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.
 
“Every element of the cause of action for fraud must
be alleged in the proper manner and the facts constituting the fraud must be
alleged with sufficient specificity to allow defendant to understand fully the
nature of the charge made.”  Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.  Plaintiffs must state facts which “show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.”  Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.
 
Plaintiffs have failed to allege specific facts to
meet the element of justifiable reliance. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants
made false representations by alleging that they were licensed contractors when
they were not in fact licensed.  However,
Plaintiffs have failed to allege any specific facts showing in what manner that
they justifiably relied on this alleged misrepresentation. For example, there
are no facts to indicate what actions that Plaintiffs would have done
differently if they had been aware of the misrepresentation.  As such, Plaintiffs have failed to allege
damages caused by the alleged misrepresentation. 
 
The Court distinguishes the allegations made against
the Active Defendants where Plaintiffs did in fact allege that they would have
acted differently by not entering into, signing, and approving the work
authorization had Plaintiffs known that mold testing would not be conducted
despite the alleged representation that the testing would take place. 
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Fifth Cause of Action for IIED
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
“The elements of a prima facie case for the tort of
intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1) extreme and outrageous
conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard
of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's
suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate
causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous
conduct.”  Miller v. Fortune Commercial Corp. (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 214,
228–29.
 
To the extent that the cause of action is premised
upon the same factual allegations that supported the third cause of action, Plaintiffs
have failed to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for the
reasons stated above. The lack of factual allegations to meet fraud also shows that
the facts to support the element of extreme and outrageous conduct are lacking.
In addition, to the extent that the cause of action is premised upon the work
that was performed and specifically the lack of mold testing, there are no
facts to show that this Defendant actually performed the testing. As noted
above, the Active Defendants are alleged to have been responsible to conduct
the testing. 
 
The demurrer to the fifth cause of action is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Sixth Cause of Action for Elder Abuse
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.  Plaintiffs fail to state facts
sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30 states, in relevant
part: “(a) “Financial abuse” of an elder or dependent adult occurs when a
person or entity does any of the following:
(1) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains
real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or
with intent to defraud, or both.
(2) Assists in taking, secreting, appropriating,
obtaining, or retaining real or personal property of an elder or dependent
adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both.
(3) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or
retains, or assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or
retaining, real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult by undue
influence, as defined in Section 15610.70.”
 
Pleading a claim for elder abuse requires specific
facts of intentional or, at a minimum, reckless conduct.  See Worsham v. O’Connor Hospital
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 331, 338. To state the statutory cause of action for
Financial Elder Abuse, Plaintiff must plead specific facts.  See Covenant Care v. Superior Court
(2004) 32 Cal.4th 771, 790. 
 
Plaintiffs have failed to state the requisite specific
facts to state a cause of action.  Plaintiffs
attempt to allege a cause of action for elder abuse based on financial abuse.
However, there are no facts to show that demurring Defendants herein took,
secreted, appropriated, obtained, or retained real or personal property, or
assisted in doing so. The factual allegations to support the elder abuse cause
of action are similar to the allegations of the third and fifth cause of
action. For the reasons previously stated, the allegations are not sufficient
to state the third and fifth causes of action. 
 
In addition, Plaintiffs seek enhanced remedies under
the Elder Abuse Act which requires Plaintiffs to plead the requisite specific
acts to meet the requirements of Civ. Code § 3294 as required by Wel. &
Inst. Code § 15657.5.  Here, Plaintiffs
have failed to allege specific facts stating that Defendants acted with malice,
in conscious disregard for the rights of Plaintiffs. 
 
In addition, similar to the allegations against the
Active Defendants, the damages complained of in the third and fifth causes of
action are not based on the taking of Plaintiff’s property, but emotional
distress damages or damages related to the purported fraud. There are no facts
that demurring Defendants took or assisted in taking any of Plaintiffs’
property. Plaintiffs attempt to allege a convoluted attenuated theory that
Defendants assisted in the taking of property because Defendants may have been
paid by Liberty Defendants through premiums obtained from Plaintiffs.  However, this theory is far too attenuated and
fails to demonstrate that these Defendants assisted in the initial act of
taking of premiums, which presumably occurred prior to the loss, but, instead,
that they may have been paid at some point by an insurance carrier that they
had contracted with and not by Plaintiffs.
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.
 
Rainbow International LLC’s Demurrer to Third Amended
Complaint
 
Defendant demurs to the entire TAC.  In addition, Defendant demurs to the third
through eighth causes of action for failure to state sufficient facts and
uncertainty.
 
Meet and Confer

Defendant set forth a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41 and CCP § 435.5. (Decl., Calvin E.
Davis.)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendant’s request for judicial notice of Items 1 and
5 is granted pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d).
 
Defendant’s request for judicial notice of Exhibits A
to C is granted, in part. The Court takes judicial notice of the existence of
the agreement and the terms that are stated in the agreement, only, pursuant to
Evidence Code section 452(h).
 
Demurrer
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint is
sustained with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts
sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts of any actual
conduct, wrongful or otherwise, that can be attributed to this Defendant.  In fact, Plaintiffs concede this in the
opposition and state that the causes of action are simply based on the fact
that the RBP Defendants are agents of demurring Defendant. In addition,
Plaintiffs concede that the theory of liability is not based on alter ego
liability or ostensible agency. 
 
The causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action because the agency allegation is merely a bald
conclusion without any supporting facts to support the conclusion.  Plaintiff alleges the following: “Rainbow LLC
acted as the franchisor to JTIE dba Rainbow and in that role established
standards for JTIE to follow in providing restoration services, including
providing a uniform operating system, and allowed JTIE to use the name
“Rainbow” in exchange for a royalty fee paid by JTIE to Rainbow. In this
regard, Rainbow LLC provided operational control over the structure of JTIE dba
Rainbow and JTIE dba Rainbow was the agent of Rainbow LLC.”  (TAC, ¶ 22.)  Thus, Plaintiff freely admits that Rainbow LLC
was the franchisor to RBP or JTIE. 
 
“A franchisor enters this arena, and becomes
potentially liable for actions of the franchisee's employees, only if it has
retained or assumed a general right of control over factors such as hiring,
direction, supervision, discipline, discharge, and relevant day-to-day aspects
of the workplace behavior of the franchisee's employees. Any other guiding
principle would disrupt the franchise relationship.”  Patterson v. Domino's Pizza, LLC (2014)
60 Cal.4th 474, 497–498.  Here,
Plaintiffs fail to allege any facts to demonstrate any of the factors noted
above.  Instead, the alleged agency
relationship is solely based on the existence of the franchise agreement
itself, i.e., that the franchise agreement itself constituted some type of
operational control. As shown above, the general proposition is that a
franchisor does not, in fact, engage in “operational control” simply by virtue
of the agreement, but instead to demonstrate vicarious liability other facts
must be alleged that would establish that the general proposition of no
vicarious liability does not exist here.  No such facts have been pled by Plaintiffs.
 
Thus, the demurrer to the TAC is sustained with 20
days leave to amend.
 
 
Liberty Mutual Insurance Company
Liberty Insurance Company
 
Defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance Company demurs to
the entire TAC on the grounds that there is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
Both Defendants demur to the third and fourth causes of action for failure to
state sufficient facts.
 
Meet and Confer
 
Both demurring Defendants set forth meet and confer
declarations in sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41 and CCP § 435.5. (Decls.,
Mona Aghazadeh-Sanaei.)
 
Demurrer by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company
 
First, at the outset, the basis for any liability
against Liberty Mutual Insurance Company has not been adequately alleged.  Plaintiffs have not alleged facts to
demonstrate that this entity has a duty of care to Plaintiffs either
contractually or through tort law.  Plaintiffs
appear to concede that there is no contractual duty since Plaintiffs have not
named this entity in the contract-based causes of action.  As to the tort claims, it appears that
Plaintiff is attempting to allege liability based on an alter ego theory of
liability.
 
“In California, two
conditions must be met before the alter ego doctrine will be invoked.  First, there must be such a unity of interest
and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that the separate
personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality
exist.  Second, there must be an
inequitable result if the acts in question are treated as those of the
corporation alone.”  Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523,
538.
 
Among the factors to be
considered in applying the alter ego doctrine are commingling of funds and
other assets of the two entities, the holding out by one entity that it is
liable for the debts of the other, identical equitable ownership in the two
entities, use of the same offices and employees, and use of one as a mere shell
or conduit for the affairs of the other. 
See Id. at 538-539.  Other factors include inadequate
capitalization, disregard of corporate formalities, lack of segregation of
corporate records, and identical directors and officers.  See Id.
at 539.  No one characteristic
governs.  The courts must look at the
totality of the circumstances to determine whether the doctrine should be
applied.  See Id.
 
In the SAC, Plaintiffs only pled bare bones
boilerplate conclusions with respect to alter ego liability. (SAC, ¶¶ 31-32). With
the TAC, Plaintiffs have alleged more facts which attempt to show that
Defendants, in certain written documents and correspondences, appeared to mix
and match the names “Liberty Mutual” and “Liberty Insurance.” (TAC, ¶ 9.)  While, at least, Plaintiffs have now attempted
to plead some facts other than bare bones conclusions, there are still
insufficient facts to support the element that an inequitable result would
exist if each corporation is not treated as their own independent entity rather
than as alter egos of each other.
 
Thus, as to Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, the demurrer
is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Demurrer by Liberty Insurance Company
 
Third Cause of Action for Fraud 
 
The demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiffs fail to state facts sufficient to state
the causes of action. 
 
“A complaint for fraud must allege the following
elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent
to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and
(4) resulting damages.”  Service by
Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816. “[T]he
elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he has known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” Boschma v. Home Loan
Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.
 
“Every element of the cause of action for fraud must
be alleged in the proper manner and the facts constituting the fraud must be
alleged with sufficient specificity to allow defendant to understand fully the
nature of the charge made.”  Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.  Plaintiffs must state facts which “show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.”  Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.
 
Similar to the allegations against the Rainbow
Defendants, the theory of fraud as against Liberty is that Defendant
misrepresented the fact that the Rainbow Defendants were licensed contractors.
Again, similar to the allegations against the Rainbow Defendants, Plaintiffs
have not alleged specific facts to allege the element of justifiable reliance.
There are no facts to indicate in what manner Plaintiffs justifiably relied
upon this representation to their detriment. The parties are referred to the
analysis of the demurrer of the Rainbow Defendants since the analysis applies
equally herein. 
 
Finally, to the extent that the cause of action does
appear to be premised upon duties contained within a written agreement
(insurance policy), Plaintiffs have not alleged facts to demonstrate the
existence of a duty separate and apart from the duty contained within the
agreement. “[C]onduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious only
when it also violates a duty independent of the contract arising from
principles of tort law. An omission to perform a contract obligation is never a
tort, unless that omission is also an omission of a legal duty.” Erlich v.
Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551 (internal citations and quotations
omitted).
 
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.
 
Fourth Cause of Action for Negligent Misrepresentation
and Fraud – Contractor Status
 
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.  Plaintiffs fail to state facts
sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
“The elements of negligent misrepresentation are (1)
the misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact, (2) without
reasonable ground for believing it to be true, (3) with intent to induce
another's reliance on the fact misrepresented, (4) justifiable reliance on the
misrepresentation, and (5) resulting damage. While there is some conflict in
the case law discussing the precise degree of particularity required in the
pleading of a claim for negligent misrepresentation, there is a consensus that the
causal elements, particularly the allegations of reliance, must be specifically
pleaded.” National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. Cambridge
Integrated Services Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 35, 50 (internal
citations and quotations omitted).
 
The cause of action fails to state sufficient facts
for the same reasons noted in the ruling to the demurrer to the third cause of
action. 
 
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.
 
Motion to Strike of Active Defendants
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. 
CCP § 436(a).  The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.  CCP § 436(b). 
The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant,
false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.  CCP § 436. 
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading
or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.
 
Active Defendants move to strike the prayer for
punitive damages and prayer for double damages pursuant to the Probate Code. 
 
Civ. Code, § 3294 states, in relevant part:
“(a) In an action for the breach of an obligation not
arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that
the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff,
in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example
and by way of punishing the defendant.
(b) An employer shall not be liable for damages
pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer,
unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and
employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are
awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect
to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization,
ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an
officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.
(c) As used in this section, the following definitions
shall apply:
(1) “Malice” means conduct which is intended by the
defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is
carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression” means despicable conduct that
subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that
person's rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an intentional misrepresentation,
deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the
intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of
property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”
 
To state a claim for punitive damages, Plaintiffs must
allege specific facts rather than conclusions that Defendant’s conduct
constitutes oppression, fraud, or malice. Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73
Cal.App.3d 864, 872. Here, as noted above, in the Court’s ruling to the
demurrer to the third causes of action, Plaintiffs have now alleged
sufficiently that Defendant engaged in fraud. Thus, the prayer for punitive
damages is sufficiently stated. The motion to strike the prayer for punitive
damages is denied.
 
As to the claim for double damages pursuant to Probate
Code § 859, the motion to strike is granted with 20 days leave to amend based
on the ruling sustaining the demurrer to the sixth cause of action.
 
Motions to Strike of Rainbow Defendants
 
Rainbow International of Buena Park and Mark Lingurar
move to strike the following allegations:
 
“1. Paragraph 118, lines 24 through 27, which states,
“Rainbow Defendants made intentional misrepresentations either by expressly
stating they were licensed contractors or by performing work that required a
contractor’s license when they knew they were not. The work performed by
Rainbow Defendants was not done in a workmanlike manner." 
2. Paragraph 120, lines 14 through 15, which states,
“Liberty Defendants, Rainbow Defendants, and Active Environmental Defendants
intended to induce Mrs. Pleatman’s reliance on their representations." 
3. Paragraph 139, lines 21 through 23, which states:
“Defendants, and each of them, acted in bad faith and with recklessness,
oppression, fraud, and/or malice by the above acts and by other means of which
Mrs. Pleatman is presently unaware, but which Mrs. Pleatman will prove at the
time of trial.” 
4. Prayer 4, line 12 through 13, which states: “For
exemplary and punitive damages from Defendants and each of them in an amount
sufficient to punish Defendants and deter such conduct in the future;” 
5. Prayer 5, line 14 through 15, which states: “For
double damages as allowed by law, including, but not limited to, Probate Code
859.” (Notice of Motion, page 2, lines 7-22).
 
As to Items 1 to 3, the motion to strike is moot upon
the sustaining of the demurrer to the third and sixth causes of action.
 
As to Items 4 and 5, the motion to strike is granted
with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Civ. Code, § 3294 states, in relevant part:
“(a) In an action for the breach of an obligation not
arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that
the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff,
in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example
and by way of punishing the defendant.
(b) An employer shall not be liable for damages
pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer,
unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and
employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are
awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect
to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization,
ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an
officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.
(c) As used in this section, the following definitions
shall apply:
(1) “Malice” means conduct which is intended by the
defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is
carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression” means despicable conduct that
subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that
person's rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an intentional misrepresentation,
deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the
intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of
property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”
 
To state a claim for punitive damages, Plaintiffs must
allege specific facts rather than conclusions that Defendant’s conduct
constitutes oppression, fraud, or malice. Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73
Cal.App.3d 864, 872. Here, as noted above, in the Court’s ruling to the
demurrer to the third, fifth, and sixth causes of action, Plaintiffs have
failed to state sufficient specific facts to allege that Defendants acted
willfully, maliciously, intentionally, and/or recklessly to support Plaintiffs’
prayer for punitive damages. As to the claim for double damages pursuant to
Probate Code § 859, the motion to strike is granted based on the ruling
sustaining the demurrer to the sixth cause of action.
 
Rainbow International LLC moves to strike the
following allegations:
 
“1. Paragraph 118 of the TAC; 
2. Lines 14-16 of Paragraph 129 on page 29 the TAC,
which read, “Rainbow Defendants made negligent misrepresentations either by
expressly stating they were licensed contractors or by performing work that
required a contractor’s license when they knew or should have known that they
were not”; 
3. Lines 12-13 of Paragraph 133 on page 33 of the TAC,
which read, “Defendants intended to cause Mrs. Pleatman emotional distress or
acted with reckless disregard of the probability that Mrs. Pleatman would
suffer emotional distress”; 
4. Lines 18 – 20 of Paragraph 133 on page 33 of the
TAC, which read, “Despite this, Defendants acted recklessly ultimately exposing
the Pleatmans to mold and causing them to have to move out of the Pleatman
Property for extended periods of time”; 
5. Paragraph 139 of the TAC; 
6. Paragraph 4 of Plaintiffs’ Prayer on page 40 of the
TAC; and, 
7. Paragraph 5 of Plaintiffs’ Prayer on page 40 of the
TAC.” (Notice of Motion, page 2, lines 6-19).
 
Defendant’s motion to strike is moot upon the
sustaining of the demurrer to the entire TAC as to this Defendant.
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
