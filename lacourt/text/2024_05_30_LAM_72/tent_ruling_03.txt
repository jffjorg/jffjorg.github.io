 Hearing Date:  May 30, 2024
 Calendar Number:  4



 
 
 
Plaintiffs Renee Turner, Rashanee Y. Guest, and Ra’nala Skye
Williams, a minor, by and through her Guardian Ad Litem, Rashanee Y. Guest
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”), move for an order setting this case for trial
preference.  Defendants 23930 Copa
Pacific Apts LLC (“Copa”) and Defendant GGE Management LLC (“GGE”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) oppose the motion.
 
The Court will hear argument, first from Defendants, then
from Plaintiffs, on the following questions:
 
1.     
Is there any guidance from case law about what the term
“substantial interest in the case as a whole” means in CCP § 36, subdivision
(b)?
2.     
Is there any guidance from any other source, such as
treatises, practice guides or legislative history about what the term
“substantial interest in the case as a whole” means in CCP § 36, subdivision
(b)?
3.     
Are Defendants correct that the minor plaintiff cannot
meet the jurisdictional minimum of $35,000? 
Does it matter?
