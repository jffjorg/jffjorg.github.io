And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint and the motion to strike the complaint in the case of Healthy California LLC v. AACHI Masala Food (P) Ltd., et al. (Case Number: 24STCV09106).

The demurrer to the complaint was filed by the defendants, Miramar Cash & Carry and Vadilal Industries USA, Inc., who argue that the complaint does not state a cause of action and that the statute of limitations has expired. The court finds that the complaint does state a cause of action and that the statute of limitations is not a valid defense.

The defendants also moved to strike the complaint on the grounds that it fails to allege a basis for relief. The court finds that the complaint does accurately set forth the statutory basis for the relief sought.

The court overrules the demurrer to the complaint and denies the motion to strike the complaint. The court finds that the complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and that the statute of limitations is not a valid defense.

The court's ruling is tentative and may be modified or reversed after further hearing. The parties are encouraged to submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.
