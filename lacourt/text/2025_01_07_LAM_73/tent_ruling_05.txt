DISCUSSION
 
On June 10, 2024,
Plaintiff Travis Rounds filed his complaint against Defendant BCBG IP Holdings
LP and Does 1 through 25 for violations of the California Trap and Trace Law
(Cal. Penal Code § 638.51). The complaint alleges the following. Defendant BCBG
IP Holdings LP (“BCBG” or “Defendant”) designs, produces, merchandise, manages,
market, and manufactures through contract supply chain partners, kidswear,
accessories, and women’s and men’s apparel under owned, licensed, and private
label brands. As part of Defendant’s marketing regime, BCBG has partnered with
TikTok to install sophisticated software on its landing page to learn the
location, source, and identity of consumers who happen to land on their
website. Plaintiff visited Defendant’s website on March 4, 2024. Without
Plaintiff’s knowledge or consent, Defendant deployed a de-anonymization process
to identify Plaintiff using electronic impulses generated from Plaintiff’s
device, as further described herein. Defendant’s installation of the TikTok
tracing process violates California’s Trap and Trace Law, codified at
California Penal Code § 638.51.
 
Plaintiff filed a
Request for Entry of Default on September 20, 2024 as to Defendant. The clerk
entered default on that same day. 
 
Plaintiff requests
a court judgment against Defendant, seeking damages in the amount of $5,000,
costs in the amount of $555.49, and attorney fees in the amount of $1,560.00,
for a total of $7,115.49.

·       [As
to attorney’s fees, counsel requests $1,560.00 under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021.5, which awards fees to a “successful party against one or more
opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an
important right affecting the public interest.”  However, Los Angeles
County Local Rule 3.214 limits the amount of fees pursuant to statute in a
default case.  Counsel does not explain why Local Rule 3.214 does not
apply here.]
