Discussion
On April 29, 2020, Plaintiff Abdulrazzaq Edouni
(“Plaintiff”) filed this employment action against Defendant Sanitation
Districts of Los Angeles (“Defendant”). On April 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging the following causes of
action: (1) retaliation – Government Code § 12940(h); (2) retaliation – Labor
Code section 1102.5; (3) employment discrimination on the basis of race and
creed – Government Code § 12940(a); (4) work environment harassment on the
basis of race and creed – Government Code § 12940(j); (5) failure to prevent
harassment, discrimination, and retaliation – Government Code §
12940(k).  
On November 8, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint
against Defendant in case number 21STCV41184 (“Related Complaint”), alleging
(1) discrimination in violation of FEHA; (2) harassment in violation of FEHA;
and (3) retaliation in violation of FEHA. On December 16, 2021, the Court
related the two cases.  
On September 7, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed the second
cause of action in the FAC for violation of Labor Code § 1102.5.   
On December 12, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant motion for trial preference under CCP § 36(e). No
opposition has been filed. 
Trial is currently set
for February 24, 2025. 
ANALYSIS
 
A.    Legal
Standard for Trial Preference under CCP § 36(e)
CCP § 36(e) allows the
Court discretion to grant a motion for preference when the "interests of
justice will be served by granting this preference." The Court’s decision
to grant or deny discretionary trial preference requires an evaluation of
various factors, including the court’s calendar, any dilatory conduct by
Plaintiff, potential prejudice to Defendant from an accelerated trial date, and
the risk of mandatory dismissal if trial preference is denied (Mitchell v.
Frank R. Howard Memorial Hospital (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1396, 1404). The
Court may also consider specific circumstances, such as Plaintiff's advanced
age or health conditions, the potential need for live testimony, or other
factors that may impact the fairness of the trial (Salas v. Sears (1986)
42 Cal.3d 342). 
B.    Trial
Preference is Unnecessary 
 
Plaintiff
moves the Court for an Order that the trial be specially set for a date that is
no later than March 24, 2025, due to the impending expiration of the 5-year
time frame to bring this matter to trial on April 28, 2025. Trial is already
set for February 24, 2025, which is over two months before the expiration of
the 5-year time frame, and a month before the requested specially set trial
date of no later than March 24, 2025. Plaintiff argues that the motion is
brought to prevent a situation in which the Court hypothetically is already
engaged in trial when trial in this matter is scheduled to start, or a
situation in which an older case receives priority over this one. However, at
this time trial preference is unnecessary and there is no risk of mandatory
dismissal unless hypothetical situations were to occur. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court DENIES the motion without prejudice.
 
DISPOSITION
The motion for trial preference is DENIED.
