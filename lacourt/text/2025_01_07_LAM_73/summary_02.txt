And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by the Defendant's counsel, Elizabeth Read. The motion is denied without prejudice. The court finds that the defendant would be prejudiced by the withdrawal of counsel, as the trial is set for January 17, 2025, and the defendant does not have a reasonable time to obtain new counsel. Additionally, the court notes that a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record, and therefore, the defendant needs to have counsel to represent it. The motion is denied without prejudice, which means that the defendant can refile the motion if it can provide a new counsel and show that it is not prejudiced by the withdrawal of its current counsel.
