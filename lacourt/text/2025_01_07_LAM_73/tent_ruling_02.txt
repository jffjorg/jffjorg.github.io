MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL (filed 12/02/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel is DENIED.
 
I. BACKGROUND 
On May 27, 2022, Plaintiff EFT Global Holdings dba Sentar
Pharmaceuticals (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Alternate
Health Inc. (“Defendant”). 
The Complaint alleges the following. On or about September 21,
2016, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a License Agreement. (Compl., ¶ 5.)
Pursuant to the License Agreement, Plaintiff licensed certain rights to the
Patent Rights to Defendant in return for certain consideration and Defendant's
continued performance of certain obligations. (Ibid.) Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant did not uphold its part of the License Agreement. (Compl., ¶ 9.)
On October 12, 2017, Defendant filed a claim in which it asserted that the
Licensor Patent Rights are invalid or enforceable, specifically, Defendant
asserted Plaintiff had no patents at all. (Compl., ¶ 16.) Based on the mutual
assent of the parties stated in writing no later than September 12, 2017, and
Defendant's filed claim on October 12, 2017, the License Agreement terminated
no later than October 12, 2017. (Compl., ¶ 17.) 
On December 2, 2024, counsel for Defendant filed a Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel. Counsel also filed a supporting declaration and proposed
order.   
No opposition or other response has been filed.   
II.DISCUSSION
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
California
Rules¿of Court,¿rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1)
notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel
(prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-053)).¿ 
 
The¿court has discretion
to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted¿provided
that¿there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of justice.¿¿(See¿Ramirez v.¿Sturdevant¿(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
904, 915.)¿ 
 
B.      Application
Here,
Defendant’s counsel, seeks relief under Code of Civil Procedure, Section
284(2). Counsel correctly completed and filed the notice (Form MC-051) and
declaration (MC-052). (Code Civ. Proc., § 284(2); Cal. Rules Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a) & (c).) In the declaration, counsel explains that this
motion is being brought under Section 284(2) instead of 284(1) because the
previous handling attorney passed away on July 12, 2024, the new handling
attorney is semi-retired, and the law firm is winding down its practice and in
the process of withdrawing from all cases. It would be an extreme hardship on Elizabeth
Read to continue this litigation in California and Defendant is unable to pay
fees and costs for trial or travel expenses. 
Counsel
served the notice (MC-051), the declaration (MC-052), and the proposed order
(MC-053) on Defendant by mail and filed a Proof of Service with the Court. The
Court finds all the requirements for relief have been completed. 
However,
the Court finds that Defendant would be prejudiced by the withdrawal. Trial in
this matter is set for January 17, 2025. Defendant does not have a reasonable
time to obtain new counsel. Further, “a corporation cannot represent itself in
a court of record either in propria persona or through an officer or agent who
is not an attorney.”¿ (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage Control
Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.) Therefore, the Court denies
the motion without prejudice.  
III. CONCLUSION 
 
The
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is denied without prejudice.
