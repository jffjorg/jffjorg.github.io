And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the State's motion to file a first amended cross-complaint. The State seeks to amend its cross-complaint to include a claim for breach of contract and to add language alleging that the State is exempt from the requirement of submitting a government claim to the City under the Government Claims Act. The judge finds that the proposed amendments are based on the same facts alleged in the original cross-complaint and would not prejudice the City. Therefore, the judge grants the State's motion for leave to file a first amended cross-complaint. The State is ordered to file and serve its first amended cross-complaint within 10 days of the hearing on this motion.
