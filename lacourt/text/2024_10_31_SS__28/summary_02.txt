And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and has ruled as follows. The plaintiff, Maria G. Orozco, filed a complaint against the defendant, Northgate Gonzalez, LLC (erroneously sued as Northgate Gonzalez Markets, Inc.), alleging negligence and premises liability. The defendant filed an answer and later a motion for summary judgment, which the plaintiff opposed. The Court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the defendant has carried its initial burden of showing that the green leafy material was not on the floor long enough for the defendant to have discovered it. However, the Court also finds that the plaintiff has raised a triable issue of fact regarding whether the defendant's policy on inspection and sweeps was reasonable under the circumstances, whether the defendant's employee's inspection and sweep were reasonable under the circumstances, and whether the green leafy material was on the floor long enough to give the defendant constructive notice. Therefore, the Court denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
