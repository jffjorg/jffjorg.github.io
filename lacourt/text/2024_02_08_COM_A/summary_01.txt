And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by the Guardian ad Litem, Denise Duperron, to resign from her appointment. The Guardian was appointed to represent the interests of the defendant, Steven Duperron, but has been unable to contact him for over two years and has lost touch with him. Additionally, the Guardian has disclosed a conflict of interest due to her own physical safety concerns, which creates a conflict with her siblings who are also involved in the litigation. The judge has determined that the Guardian is no longer able to fulfill her role and has granted the motion to withdraw and terminate her appointment as Guardian ad Litem.
