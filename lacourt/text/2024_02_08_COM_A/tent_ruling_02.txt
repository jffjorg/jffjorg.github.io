[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION AND ATTENDANCE OF A PERSON MOST QUALIFIED
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
      The complaint
alleges that Defendant issued to Plaintiffs an express warranty in connection
with Plaintiffs’ lease of a 2018 Chevrolet Silverado made and distributed by
Defendant. The vehicle suffered from a defect within the transmission system that
Defendant failed to repair within a reasonable number of attempts in violation
of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. 
II.     
ARGUMENTS
      Plaintiffs
request an order to compel Defendant, General Motors, LLC (“GM”) to produce its
person most qualified (“PMQ”) to testify on categories 1-8, 10, and 11 as set
forth in Plaintiffs’ Notice of Deposition of the Person Most Qualified and
Demand to Produce Documents at Deposition. GM is using the same obstructionist
strategy that it employs in other cases.  
      In
opposition, GM argues it offered to produce a PMQ tailored to Plaintiffs’
specific vehicle. GM properly objected to categories of inquiry and production
not involving Plaintiffs’ vehicle.
      Plaintiffs
argue in reply that regardless of prior discovery propounded by Plaintiffs, they
are entitled to take the deposition of a person most qualified. GM agreed to
produce a witness and documents responsive to the categories at issue but
refuses to provide a deposition date. 
III.   
DISCUSSION
      Of the 38 active cases for violation of the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”) filed in this Court against GM, this
is the 30th discovery motion to date involving GM’s failure to
respond to relevant and discoverable requests for documents or to produce a
person most qualified (“PMQ”). As in every discovery motion brought by a
plaintiff against GM, GM opposes on the same grounds: Plaintiffs failed to meet
and confer in good faith, the discovery involves irrelevant topics that include
vehicles other than Plaintiffs’ (“other vehicle evidence”), the documents are
subject to numerous privileges, and/or compliance is unduly burdensome and
oppressive. 
      The
Court has previously articulated its position on these same issues in multiple discovery
motions raised in the following cases involving GM:

      In this
case, Defense counsel failed to respond in good faith to Plaintiffs’ requests
to set a deposition date, although GM agreed to produce a witness for certain
categories. (Arbre Kornely Declaration, Ex. D.) GM failed to respond to that
email or a second email set sent on December 4, 2023. (Id., Ex.
E.) Given the impending trial date set for March 20, 2024, Plaintiffs sent an
amended deposition notice setting the deposition for January 8, 2024. (Id.
Ex. F.) 
      GM again
objected on numerous grounds and took issue with Plaintiff unilaterally scheduling
the deposition without consulting defense counsel. (Id. Ex. G.)
This issue could have been avoided had GM responded to Plaintiffs’ emails to
schedule a mutually convenient date. Plaintiffs again requested dates for the
deposition by email sent January 3, 2024, but defense counsel failed to
respond. (Kornely Declaration, ¶ 16, Ex. H.) 
      Defense
counsel does not provide any documentary evidence that he conferred with
Plaintiffs’ counsel about the limited categories of inquiry that Defendant
would permit. There is no explanation for defense counsel’s failure to respond
to Plaintiffs’ emails. 
      GM’S
opposition again offers no substantive or persuasive argument to support its
objections to the PMQ deposition notice or document request. The Court has
previously determined that Plaintiffs’ discovery requests fall within the broad
scope of discovery in lemon law cases. The Court has conducted informal
discovery conferences on other matters with GM’s counsel (Erskine Law Firm)
explaining why the discovery is permissible. 
      While
Defendant may object based on confidential, propriety, and trade secret
information, this is not a basis for refusing to produce a witness. Defendant is
required to provide a privilege log of all documents withheld and the specific
objection asserted to enable the Court to determine whether any privilege
applies. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240 subp. (b).) The privilege log must
contain clear descriptions of the documents as set forth in the statute. (Id.)

      Plaintiffs
are entitled to discover other vehicle evidence. (Donlen
v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 154. The requests are
relevant to Plaintiffs’ burden of establishing Defendant’s non-compliance with
its obligations under the Act to reasonably attempt to repair the vehicle. (Oregel
v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.) The
discovery is also relevant to the recovery of civil penalties. (Jensen
v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 136.
      GM has
not provided any evidence that compliance with the document request will be
unreasonably burdensome and oppressive. GM’s remedy is to move for a
protective order, not refuse to respond or unilaterally impose limitations on Plaintiffs’
discovery. GM did not meet its burden of proof on that issue. (West
Pico Furniture Co. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) 
      In
anticipation of GM’s contention that it requires more than 10 days to comply
because it is overburdened by the number of lemon law cases it must defend, the
discovery propounded, and the depositions for which witnesses must be produced,
this is not an issue for the Court to resolve. Trial is presently set for March
20, 2024, and Plaintiffs first served a deposition notice on January 15, 2023.
(Korneley, Ex. B.) Over one year later, Plaintiffs have not been able to secure
firm dates.  
IV.   
CONCLUSION
      Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to
produce a witness or witnesses qualified to testify on all topics of inquiry
identified in Plaintiffs’ Notice of Deposition and to comply with the Demand to
Produce Documents at Deposition within 10 days without objection, limitation, or
condition. Plaintiffs did not request imposition of sanctions; therefore, none
is awarded.
