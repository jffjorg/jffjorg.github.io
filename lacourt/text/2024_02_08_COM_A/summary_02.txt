And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition and attendance of a person most qualified (PMQ) in a case involving a defective 2018 Chevrolet Silverado. The Plaintiffs allege that General Motors, LLC (GM) issued an express warranty for the vehicle, but failed to repair the defect within a reasonable number of attempts. The Judge found that GM's opposition to the motion was without merit, as GM failed to respond in good faith to the Plaintiffs' requests to set a deposition date. The Judge ordered GM to produce a witness or witnesses qualified to testify on all topics of inquiry identified in the Plaintiffs' Notice of Deposition and to comply with the Demand to Produce Documents at Deposition within 10 days without objection, limitation, or condition.
