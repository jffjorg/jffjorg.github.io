      A
minor’s settlement is valid if approved by the court after a hearing.  (Prob. Code, §§3505, 3500.) All five of the minor claimants did not sustain injury and did
not incur medical expenses. Plaintiffs’ counsel is not deducting costs from
each minors’ settlement, leaving a net settlement amount of $1,000 for each
minor claimant. The guardians request that each minors’ settlement be
distributed to their respective guardian, which is permitted by Probate Code § 3401.
      Plaintiffs
have allocated a larger portion of the settlement to the adult Plaintiffs who
suffered more general damages than the minor claimants for economic loss and
emotional distress.        
      Subject
to a hearing, the Court is inclined to approve settlement in each of the five
petitions.
