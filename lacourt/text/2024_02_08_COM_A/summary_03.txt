Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the City of Compton's motion to appoint a receiver to take control of a property allegedly owned by FS International, Inc. and operated by Mehdi Javadiaghdam. The City alleges that the property is being used to operate an illegal marijuana dispensary in violation of the Compton Municipal Code, despite numerous citations. The defendants argue that a compliance officer or referee would be a less drastic remedy, but the City asserts that the defendants have demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to comply with the law. The judge finds that the appointment of a receiver is necessary to terminate the illegal activity and require a certificate of occupancy. The receiver will be required to file a bond and will have the power to take control of the property, manage the building, and secure a cost estimate and construction plan for necessary repairs. A hearing is set for March 26, 2024, for the receiver to submit a rehabilitation plan.
