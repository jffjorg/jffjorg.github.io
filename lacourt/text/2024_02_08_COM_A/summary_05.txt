And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling approves the settlement of claims by five minor claimants, each of whom received a net settlement amount of $1,000 after costs were deducted. The settlements were reached with all defendants and were allocated in a way that reflected the greater damages suffered by the adult plaintiffs. The court has reviewed the settlements and is inclined to approve each of the five petitions, subject to a hearing on February 8, 2024. The hearing will provide an opportunity for the court to review the settlements and ensure that they are fair and in the best interests of the minor claimants.
