And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the motion to quash service of summons filed by Chatsworth Gardens Apartments, LLC is placed off calendar due to defects in the proof of service. The proof of service is confusing and fails to specify whether the motion was served electronically or by United States Postal Service mail. Additionally, the proof of service does not include an email address for the plaintiffs' counsel. The court notes that Chatsworth Gardens Apartments, LLC has not specifically addressed the proof of service filed on 3/3/23, which indicates personal service on 12/12/22. The court has decided not to address the merits of the motion due to the defects in the proof of service.
