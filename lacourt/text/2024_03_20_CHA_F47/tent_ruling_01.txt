SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Stephanie Hernandez;
Aurora Gonzalez; Diamond Ayala, a minor, by and through her Guardian Ad Litem
Stephanie Hernandez; Mia Ayala, a minor, by and through her Guardian Ad Litem
Stephanie Hernandez and Ezra Cardenas’, a minor, by and through his Guardian Ad
Litem Stephanie Hernandez (collectively, Plaintiffs) tenancy in an apartment
complex owned, managed and/or operated by Defendant Chatsworth Gardens
Apartments, LLC.  Plaintiffs claim that
the apartment was infested with bed bugs and that they suffered personal
injuries as a result.  
 
On 5/4/21, Plaintiffs filed this action against
defendants, including Chatsworth Gardens Apartment, LLC.  On 1/11/23, while this action was pending in
the Spring Street Courthouse, Chatsworth Gardens Apartments, LLC filed and
served a motion to quash service of summons. 
On 3/3/23, Plaintiffs filed a proof of service indicating that on
12/12/22 Chatsworth Gardens Apartments, LLC was personally served by leaving
the summons and complaint with “Cynthia Garcia – Account Manager” at the
following address: 23586 Calabasas Rd., Ste 100, Calabasas, CA 91302-1322.  
 
Before the motion to quash was heard, this case was
transferred to Department F47 in the Chatsworth Courthouse.  On 9/28/23, Chatsworth Gardens Apartments LLC
re-filed its motion to quash summons.  No
opposition or other response to the motion has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS 

 
The proofs of service attached to both the instant motion
and the prior motion to quash are defective. 
The proofs of service confusingly state:
 
“On September 28,
2023, I electronically served the foregoing documents described as: 
 
MOTION TO QUASH by mailing
the documents on the following interested parties: 
 
Ilan N. Rosen Janfaza
9025 Wilshire Blvd., Penthouse
Floor 
Beverly Hills, CA 90211 
 
A true and correct
copy of transmittal will be produced if requested by any party or the court.”      
 
Based on the foregoing, it cannot be determined whether
the motion was served electronically or by United States Postal Service
mail.  If the motion was served
electronically, which seems most likely based on the indication that a copy of
the transmittal will be produced if requested and the reference to CRC 2.251 in
a footnote, the proof of service further fails because no email address for
Plaintiffs’ counsel is set forth in the proof of service.  
 
Since there is no opposition or other response to the
motion to cure the defect in notice, the matter is placed off calendar.  
 
Even if the proof of service for the motion was not
defective, the Court notes that Chatsworth Gardens Apartments, LLC has not
specifically addressed the proof of service filed on 3/3/23 by Plaintiffs
indicating that Chatsworth Gardens Apartments, LLC was personally served with
the Summons and Complaint on 12/12/22 at 23586 Calabasas Rd., Ste. 100,
Calabasas, CA 91302-1322 by delivering the documents to “Cynthia Garcia –
Account Manager.”
 
The declaration of Marc Kanter seems to address the service
on Chatsworth Gardens Apartments which is the subject of another proof of
service filed on 3/3/23 which indicates that on 12/12/22 documents were
delivered to “Jennifer Garcia – Manager” at 8820 Topanga Canyon Blvd., West
Hills, CA 91304-1447 and thereafter mailed to the same address.  (See Kanter Decl.).  
 
Additionally, it is not clear why the notice of the
motion cites CCP 1179.11(a)(2) which relates to unlawful detainer actions based
on nonpayment of rental debt due to Covid-19 hardship.  (See Notice of Motion, p.2:6-9).  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is placed off calendar.
