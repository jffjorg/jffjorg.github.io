DISCUSSION
 
Defendants Nirav
J. Shah, M.D. and Nirav J. Shah, M.D., a Professional Medical Corporation move
the court for an order to compel Plaintiff Victoria Gunther to provide answers,
without objections, to Defendants’ Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for Production of Documents, Set One.
Defendants also move this Court for an order for sanctions in the amount of
$720.00 against Plaintiff Victoria Gunther. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On September 29, 2023, Defendants propounded discovery requests on
Plaintiff including Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for
Production of Documents, Set One. (Villebro Decl. ¶2, Exh. A.) Responses to the
discovery requests were due on or before October 31, 2023. (Villebro Decl. ¶3.)
No extension of time to respond was sought by Plaintiff. (Villebro Decl. ¶4.)
Defendant attempted to meet and confer on January 31, 2024, giving Plaintiff
until February 14, 2024 to respond. (Villebro Decl. ¶5, Exh. B.) As of the date
of this motion, no responses have been received. (Villebro Decl. ¶6.) 
 
As such, Defendants’ unopposed
motion to compel Plaintiffs’ discovery responses to Defendants’ Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand for
Production of Documents, Set One is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to produce
verified discovery responses without objection in twenty days.
 
Sanctions
 
Defendants request monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $720.00 per motion or $2,160.00 total.

 
If a propounding party moves for and
obtains a court order compelling a response, the court shall impose monetary
sanctions against the party failing to timely respond to interrogatories and
demands for inspection unless that party acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c),
2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
Defense counsel contends they spent 1
hour preparing each motion, anticipate another hour reviewing the opposition
and reply per motion, and another hour appearing at the hearing per motion.  Counsel’s hourly rate of 220.00 (Villebro
Decl. ¶8.) Counsel also seeks $60.00 for filing fees per motion. (Norling Decl.
¶8.) 
 
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED, in the reduced
amount of $1,060.00, total. The court finds only one hour necessary for
attending the hearing on the three motions.
