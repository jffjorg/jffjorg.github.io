  Case Number:  22NWCV01452    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2024    Dept:  SEC PALLIN v. PRECISION CONSTRUCTION GROUP, INC.CASE NO.: 22NWCV01452HEARING: 12/06/24Plaintiff JONATHAN JACOB PALLIN’s Unopposed Motion for an Order to Show Cause Re: Contempt is DENIED without prejudice.Court Clerk to give notice.No Opposition filed as of December 2, 2024. Due by November 20, 2024. (CCP §1005(b).)Plaintiff JONATHAN JACOB PALLIN (“Plaintiff”) moves the Court for an Order to Show Cause re: Contempt against Defendant JERRY SORRENTINO due to his “willful and continued defiance of the Court’s August 29, 2024 Order Compelling Defendant’s Responses to Demand for Production of Documents (“Set One”) by September 13, 2024, and Defendant and his counsel’s failure to jointly pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $633.75 by September 28, 2024…. [¶] Plaintiff is also seeking further award of attorneys’ fees and costs as a result of being required to bring motion.” (Notice. 2:6-14)The Motion is unopposed.“Disobedience of any lawful judgment, order, or process of the court” is an act of contempt of the authority of the Court. (CCP §1209(a)(5).) “When the contempt is not committed in the immediate view and presence of the court, or of the judge at chambers, an affidavit shall be presented to the court or judge of the facts constituting the contempt, or a statement of the acts by the referees or arbitrators, or other judicial officers.” (CCP §1222(a).)The factual predicates to a finding of contempt are: (1) the rendition of a valid order; (2) actual knowledge of the order; (3) ability to comply; and (4) willful disobedience. (Conn. v. Sup. Ct. (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 774, 784.)The punishment for contempt is up to five days’ imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $1,000 for each contempt. (See CCP §1218(a).) In addition, a person who is subject to a court order as party to the action who is adjudged guilty of contempt for violating that court order may be ordered to pay the party initiating the contempt proceeding the reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred by that party in connection with the contempt proceeding. (Id.) Civil contempt proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature because of the penalties which may be imposed. (In re Kreitman (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 750, 754.) Thus, “guilt must beestablished beyond a reasonable doubt.” (Ross v. Superior Court of Sacramento County (1977) 19 Cal.3d 899, 913.)The respondent must be formally notified of the contempt charge and of the time and place of the hearing; otherwise, the Court lacks jurisdiction to proceed. For this purpose, both the OSC and affidavit ordinarily must be served on respondent in a manner authorized for service of summons. (Cedars-Sinai Imaging Med. Group v. Sup. Ct. (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1286.) Personal service of the order to show cause on the party charged is a jurisdictional requirement for a contempt order. (See In re Meyer (1933) 131 Cal.App.41 43.)Here, no Proof of Service has been separately filed, or attached in conjunction with the Moving Papers. Therefore, at this time, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Defendant Jerry Sorrentino for purposes of issuing an OSC Re: Contempt. The Motion is DENIED without prejudice. The Moving Party is not foreclosed from re-filing and properly serving this application, and then seeking ex parte relief to have the matter advanced to a sooner date, if necessary. The Court notes that no Motion for Sanctions (e.g., terminating, issue, or evidentiary) has been filed or scheduled with the Court.
