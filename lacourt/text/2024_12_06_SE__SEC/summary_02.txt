And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' unopposed motion for summary adjudication. The Plaintiffs, MELISSA GIRON and RUDY GIRON, are seeking summary adjudication of three issues related to Defendant AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO., INC.'s affirmative defenses. The issues at hand are whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to summary adjudication of the Defendant's Fifth Affirmative Defense (Third Party Resolution Process), Eighth Affirmative Defense (No Civil Penalty), and Eighth Affirmative Defense (Willful and Civil Penalties).

The Court has found that there is no existence of disputed issues of material fact with regards to the Plaintiffs' ability to obtain civil penalties because the Defendant fails to establish that it maintains a qualified third-party resolution process. The Court has also found that even if the Defendant did have a third-party dispute resolution process, that would not be a shield to civil penalties under Cal. Civ. Code §1794(c) (which depends on a finding of willfulness).

Based on the foregoing, the Court has granted the unopposed motion for summary adjudication as to the Defendant's Fifth and Eighth Affirmative Defenses.
