And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has denied, without prejudice, the unopposed motion for an order to show cause re: contempt brought by plaintiff Jonathan Jacob Pallin against defendant Jerry Sorrentino. The motion was made due to Sorrentino's failure to comply with a court order to respond to a demand for production of documents and failure to pay monetary sanctions. The court lacks jurisdiction to proceed with the contempt proceeding because no proof of service has been filed or attached to the moving papers. The plaintiff is not foreclosed from re-filing the application and properly serving it, and then seeking ex parte relief to have the matter advanced to a sooner date if necessary.
