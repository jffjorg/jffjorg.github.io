Instant Motions
 
Plaintiffs now moves this court,
per Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2030.290 and 2031.300 for orders (1) compelling
Defendants David and Julian to serve initial responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories,
Set No. One, and Requests for Production, Set No. One, and (2) awarding
sanctions of $7,020.00 per motion, amounting to a total of $14,040.00. 
 
Decision
 
The motions are GRANTED. Defendants
David and Julian are to serve responses, without objections, within 30 days.
Defendants David and Julian shall also pay $760 in sanctions for each motion, or
$1,520.00 in total, jointly and severally, to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30
days.
 
The motions are unopposed. The lack
of an opposition operates as a
concession that the motion has merit. See California Rules of Court Rule
3.1113(a); see also Rule 3.1320(f); Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005)
133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20.
 
A reasonable amount of time for
Plaintiff’s counsel to spend on each motion is two hours. $350 per hour is a
reasonable rate. And each motion incurred a $60 filing fee. That adds up to
$760 per motion.
