```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues in the case Guffey v. Rokit. The court sustains the demurrer filed by Defendant Launch, with 20 days leave to amend, on the grounds that the First Amended Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to support a cause of action. The court also orders counsel to pay their complex litigation fees and sets deadlines for future events, including the filing of an answer and a motion for class certification. The court provides guidance on the drafting of the case management order and continues the case management conference to April 2, 2024.
