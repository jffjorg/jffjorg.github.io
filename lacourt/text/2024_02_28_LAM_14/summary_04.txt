Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this case, the plaintiff, Kneeland, alleges that the defendants, Roman Sales, Inc. and Michael Roman, refused to accommodate her disability, fired her, and then refused to pay her the severance pay agreed upon. The defendants have moved the court for permission to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff for recording conversations without consent.

The court has granted the motion, finding that the defendants have a right to file the cross-complaint and that there is not sufficient evidence to show that they are exercising that right in bad faith. The court notes that the defendants are entitled to file a cross-complaint at any time during the course of the action, as long as they act in good faith, and that the legislative mandate is clear that a policy of liberal construction of section 426.50 to avoid forfeiture of causes of action is imposed on the trial court.

The court has ordered the defendants to file their cross-complaint by March 6, 2024.
