And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by defendants VEVO LLC, Jesse Judelman, and Andrea Zapata to the second and tenth causes of action in the complaint filed by plaintiff Lugo on November 7, 2023. The plaintiff claims discrimination, harassment, and wrongful termination based on her rejection of her immediate superior's romantic advances. The demurrer is sustained with 10 days leave to amend. The court finds that the second cause of action (harassment) is uncertain due to the lack of separation of factual theories and lack of identification of supporting facts. Similarly, the tenth cause of action (declaratory relief) is too uncertain to be evaluated separately.
