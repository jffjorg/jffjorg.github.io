Instant Motion
 
Defendant Ryan now moves this court for an order quashing a deposition
subpoena served on third-party witness US Bank.
 
Decision
 
            The motion is TAKEN OFF-CALENDAR.
 
Discussion
 
            On December
29, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel served a document subpoena on US Bank. (Defense
Exhibit 1). The subpoena asks for bank statements issued to Defendant Ryan and
Defendant June. (Id.).
 
            Defendant
Ryan argues that this subpoena was served after the discovery cut-off. This is correct.
However, it does not end the discussion.
 
            On April
11, 2023, this court set trial for January 29, 2024, with all discovery
deadlines pegged to that date. Though the court has subsequently continued the
trial, it has not continued the discovery deadlines. The parties were entitled
to complete discovery “on or before” the 30th day prior to the trial.
Code of Civil Procedure § 2024.020. The 30th day prior to
January 29, 2024, was December 30, 2023. See Code of Civil Procedure
§ 12c. However, since that day was a Saturday, it is excluded pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure § 12b. Therefore, December 29, 2023, was the deadline
for completion of discovery.
 
            Serving a
document subpoena on the deadline date violates that deadline. Any witness has
at least 15 days to respond to a record subpoena. Code of Civil Procedure
§ 2020.410(c). Therefore, the discovery will, by definition, not be
completed before the deadline. Plaintiff therefore has no enforceable right to a
response to the subpoena.
 
            This does
not mean that US Bank can’t answer. It just means that US Bank may
choose not to answer without facing any consequences from this court. And the
rule has a flip side: there is also a cut-off date for the hearing of party
discovery motions.
 
            The parties
are entitled to have a discovery motion heard “on or before” the 15th
day prior to trial. Code of Civil Procedure § 2024.020. The 15th
day prior to January 29, 2024, was January 14, 2024. However, since that day
was a Sunday, both it and January 13, 2024, are excluded pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure § 12b. Therefore, January 12, 2024, was the last day for
the court to hear discovery motions. 
 
This motion was not filed until
January 18, 2024, after the deadline. At no point did Defendant Ryan ask this
court to hear the motion before the deadline. Nor has there been a motion
asking the court to re-open discovery so that this motion could be brought. Therefore,
by the terms of Section 2024.020, the court is not permitted to hear this
motion. See Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1585-90.
 
Conclusion
 
            Defendant
Ryan has correctly concluded that Plaintiffs have no right to enforce their subpoena.
Nevertheless, as provided in the very same statute, the court cannot hear a
party’s motion to quash that subpoena. Therefore, the motion is TAKEN
OFF-CALENDAR.
