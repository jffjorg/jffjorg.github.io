  Case Number:  20STCV09522    Hearing Date:   February 28, 2024    Dept:  14 Lujan v. DoverCase Background
 
Plaintiff is a line worker in a
pump factory. He alleges that he suffered an on-the-job injury to his left hand
which broke one of his fingers. He claims Defendants did not honor his doctor’s
note putting him on light duty work restrictions. Later in the year Plaintiff
suffered a shoulder injury and was put on light duty by the doctor, a
recommendation that Plaintiff claims Defense again ignored and eventually fired
him for.
 
            On December
11, 2020 Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) for (1) Disability
Discrimination; (2) FEHA Retaliation; (3) Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process;
(4) Failure to Accommodate; (5) Failure to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation;
(6) Defamation; (7) Violation of CFRA; (8) CFRA Retaliation; and (9) Wrongful
Termination against Defendants Dover Pump Solutions Group; Wilden Pump and Engineering,
LLC (“Wilden”); PSG; Beth Seara (“Seara”); David Leedom (“Leedom”); and DOES 1-10.

 
On February 18, 2022, Plaintiff
filed two “Amendments to Complaint” substituting Defendant Seara in lieu of DOE
1 and Defendant PSG – A Dover Company in lieu of DOE 3.
 
On March 2, 2022, Plaintiff filed
two “Amendments to Complaint” substituting Defendants A Dover Company and Dover
Corporation in lieu of DOEs 4-5, respectively. 
 
On March 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed
an “Amendment to Complaint” substituting Defendant PSG California, LLC (“PSG
California”) in lieu of DOE 6. PSG California is the new name of Defendant
Wilden.
 
On August 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed
name corrections, changing the name of original Defendant PSG to “Pump
Solutions Group” and changing the name of original Defendant Dover Pump
Solutions Group to “Dover Corporation” – the same name as DOE 5.
 
The result of all these changes is
the following list of Defendants: Dover Corporation, Pump Solutions Group, PSG
California, Seara, Leedom, PSG – A Dover Company, and A Dover Company.
 
On June 1, 2022, Defendants PSG
California, Seara, and Leedom filed their joint Amended Answer. On September
26, 2022, Defendant Dover Corporation filed its Answer. 
 
            On November
3, 2022, this court dismissed Defendant Dover Corporation due to lack of timely
service under Code of Civil Procedure § 583.410.
 
            On November
9, 2022, the default of Defendant PSG – A Dover Company was entered. 
 
Defendant Pump Solutions Group has
been served but has yet to file a responsive pleading. Defendant A Dover
Company has not yet been served.
 
            On August
8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Conditional Settlement of Entire Case.
 
Instant Motion
 
            Plaintiff
now moves this court for an order entering judgment against Defendant PSG
California, LLC, in the amount of $21,403.54, and for an award of $14,000.00 in
attorney fees and costs.
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is CONTINUED to May 1, 2024 at 8:30 am. The OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement)
currently set for March 8, 2024 is also advanced and continued to May 1, 2024
at 8:30 am.
 
            On November
8, 2023, Defense counsel filed a Notice of Related Cases in Case No. 23 STLC
07184. Defense counsel is ORDERED to file a copy of that Notice in Case No. BC
704 715, by 4 pm today.
 
Governing Statute
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure § 664.6 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
“(a) If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms
of the settlement…
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following:
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the
party.”
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel of record in this case are Mr. David R. Denis (“Denis”) and Mr. Armando
M. Galvan from the Law Offices of David R. Denis, P.C. (“Firm”). Mr. Denis and
the Firm are judgment debtors in the case of Eric Mintz v. Law Offices of David
R. Denis PC, et al. (LASC Case No. BC 704 715), pending in Department 71 of
this courthouse, before the Hon. Daniel M. Crowley. On May 17, 2023, Judge Crowley
issued an order restraining Mr. Denis (and anyone else connected with him) from
assigning, disposing, or spending any attorneys’ fee award that may become
payable to Mr. Denis.
 
            On
September 20, 2023, the parties to this case completed execution of a
settlement agreement. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit B). That settlement included a
separate amount for attorney’s fees payable directly to the Firm. (Id.).
 
            On October
17, 2023, Defense counsel in this case received a demand letter from Mr. Denis’s
Judgment Creditor, informing them of the assignment order and directing that
payment be sent to the Judgment Creditor instead. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit E).
 
            Defense
counsel notified Mr. Denis and his Firm and made the following suggestion: their
client would split the fee amount due to Mr. Denis into two increments and
write two corresponding checks. The first would be in the amount of the
judgment owed by Mr. Denis, and the second would be for the remainder. The
first check would be directed to the Judgment Creditor, and the second would be
directed to Mr. Denis. (Plaintiff’s Exhibits C-D).
 
            On October
26, 2023, Mr. Denis responded, refusing that proposal on the grounds that he
had already paid the judgment. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit F). All counsel engaged in
further back-and-forth but were unable to reconcile their respective positions.
(Plaintiff’s Exhibits G-H). Defense informed Mr. Denis that they would interplead
the disputed amount ($21,243.54) and send Mr. Denis a check for the remainder.
(Plaintiff’s Exhibit H).
 
            That
interpleader was ultimately filed on November 8, 2023, and given Case No. 23 STLC
07184. On that same date, Defendant PSG California also filed a Notice of Related
Cases in Case No. 23 STLC 07184, identifying Case No. BC 704 715. However, they
did not file a corresponding Notice of Related Cases in Case No. BC 704 715, as
required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.300(d).
 
            Three
months later, Plaintiff filed the instant motion, demanding that this court enter
judgment against Defendant PSG California in the disputed amount. 
 
            There is no
issue currently ripe for decision in this department. Only Judge Crowley can
determine whether and when the judgment entered in his department has been
satisfied. Only the judge who hears the interpleader action can determine how
the interpled funds will be paid. And only when those funds are disbursed will
this court be able to judge what portion (if any) of the settlement amount
remains unpaid.
 
            However, in
the interest of moving this dispute to an efficient resolution, this court can
direct Defense counsel to complete their filing on the Notice of Related Cases.
CRC Rule 3.300(d) requires that the Notice be filed in both cases because Rule
3.300(h) specifies which of the two (or more) involved judges will decide
whether to relate them. In this instance, Rule 3.300(h)(1)(B) directs that the
judge in unlimited jurisdiction be the one to make the determination. The
filing in the interpleader alone is ineffective, because the judge in that case
is not empowered to make any decision, and it gives the judge in the other case
nothing to rule on.
 
            The appropriate
course of action at this point is for this court to step aside while the other
two cases proceed, either as related cases or not. Once the predicate questions
mentioned above have been decided, this issue will become ripe and can be
resolved.
 
Conclusion
 
            There are issues
pending in other courts that must be addressed before this court can determine either
that there has been a breach or the appropriate remedy. Therefore, the motion
is CONTINUED to May 1, 2024 at 8:30 am. The OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement)
currently set for March 8, 2024 is also advanced and continued to May 1, 2024
at 8:30 am.
 
            Additionally,
Defense counsel are ORDERED to complete their filing of the Notice of Related Case
in Case No. 23 STLC 07184 by filing a copy of that Notice in Case No. BC 704
715. That copy is to be filed by 4 pm today.
