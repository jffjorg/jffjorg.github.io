```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the motion to quash a deposition subpoena served on US Bank is taken off-calendar. The subpoena was served after the discovery cut-off, and although the court has not continued the discovery deadlines, the parties were entitled to complete discovery before the trial date. As a result, the court cannot hear the motion to quash the subpoena. The judge also notes that the party bringing the motion did not file it until after the deadline and did not ask the court to hear it before the deadline. The court is not permitted to hear a party's motion to quash a subpoena after the deadline, and therefore the motion is taken off-calendar.
