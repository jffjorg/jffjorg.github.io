Tentative Ruling:

  * The court will award attorney's fees to defendants Terri Murphy and Michael Murphy in the amount of $163,620.00.
  * The court will consider the lodestar approach to determine the reasonableness of the fees, which includes the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.
  * The court will consider the factors specific to the case, such as the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.
  * The court will adjust the lodestar figure to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.
  * The court will consider the declaration of attorney Katharine Miller, which describes the work performed for which fees are sought, but notes that the evidence submitted is insufficient and does not appear to reflect a sufficient record of contemporaneous billing entries.
  * The court will consider the reasonable hourly rate of $600 per hour, but notes that this method is vague and improper as the billing documents are not submitted for the court to confirm what rates were actually charged.
