And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to interrogatories. The motion was brought improperly, as verified responses had already been served. The plaintiff failed to comply with mandatory procedures for pursuing a motion to compel further responses, including meeting and conferring with the defendant and filing a separate statement. The court also found that the plaintiff did not make a good faith attempt to informally resolve the issues before filing the motion. As a result, the motion is denied, and no sanctions are awarded to either side. The court orders the plaintiff to file a new motion for further responses following proper meet and confer efforts and accompanied by a separate statement.
