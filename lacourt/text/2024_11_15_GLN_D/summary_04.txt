And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered a motion by Umpqua Bank, the plaintiff, to obtain an order directing Judgment Debtor Ilya Gorbonos to transfer to the sheriff possession of his stock certificates, voting trust certificates, and other documents evidencing ownership in STRS, Inc. The motion is based on a writ of execution issued for $63,456.96 and a judgment by default entered in favor of Umpqua Bank.

The court has found that the motion does not demonstrate a need for the order as required by CCP § 699.040 (b). The court notes that the judgment was entered in July 2024 and the motion was filed in September 2024, only two months later, and that no judgment debtor examination has been conducted. The court also notes that there is no evidence explaining why the corporate judgment debtor, Dental Alloys USA, Inc., cannot satisfy the judgment.

As a result, the court has denied the motion for turnover order in aid of execution without prejudice. The court encourages the parties to provide further evidence at the hearing to establish a need for the order.
