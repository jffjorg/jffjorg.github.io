considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On July 19, 2019, Plaintiff Joanne
King (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Anza Management Company
(“Anza”), 15025 Saticoy Street, Inc. (“Saticoy”) and Does 1-50 for negligence
and negligence: premises liability. 
On October 25, 2019, the clerk
entered the defaults of Saticoy and Anza (“Defendants”). 
On November
20, 2019, Defendants filed an answer. 
On November 21, 2019, the Court set
aside Defendants’ defaults based on the parties’ stipulation. 
On August 8, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel filed a declaration stating that Plaintiff had died. 
On January 30, 2024, Defendants
filed a motion to dismiss the action and for sanctions, to be heard on March
28, 2024. On January 31, 2024, Defendants filed an amended motion. On March 15,
2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On March 28, 2024, the Court continued the
hearing to May 9, 2024 “to give the Court an opportunity to consider
Plaintiff’s counsel’s anticipated motion to substitute a successor-in-interest
in place of the deceased Plaintiff.” (March 28, 2024 minute order.)  On April 8, 2024, Defendants filed a reply. 
On May 2, 2024, the Court granted
the motion of CourtneyAnne Rodriguez Ramirez (“Rodriguez”), in her capacity as
successor-in-interest to Plaintiff, to be substituted into the case in place of
the deceased Plaintiff, Joanne King, and for leave to file a first amended
complaint. 
On May 3, 2024, Rodriguez filed a first amended complaint against Anza,
Saticoy, and Does 1-50 for negligence and negligence: premises liability. 
Trial is currently scheduled for
June 6, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendants ask the Court to dismiss
the action for delay in prosecution and for $21,894.44 in sanctions. 
Plaintiff asks the Court to deny the
motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410
provides: 
“(a) The court may in its discretion
dismiss an action for delay in prosecution pursuant to this article on its own
motion or on motion of the defendant if to do so appears to the court
appropriate under the circumstances of the case. 
“(b) Dismissal shall be pursuant to
the procedure and in accordance with the criteria prescribed by rules adopted
by the Judicial Council.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 583.410.)
Code of Civil Procedure section 583.420
provides in part: 
“(a) The court may not dismiss an
action pursuant to this article for delay in prosecution except after one of
the following conditions has occurred: 
“(1) Service is not made within two
years after the action is commenced against the defendant. 
“(2) The action is not brought to
trial within the following times: 
“(A) Three years after the action is
commenced against the defendant unless otherwise prescribed by rule under
subparagraph (B). 
“(B) Two years after the action is
commenced against the defendant if the Judicial Council by rule adopted
pursuant to Section 583.410 so prescribes for the court because of the
condition of the court calendar or for other reasons affecting the conduct of
litigation or the administration of justice. . . .”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 583.420, subd. (a).)DISCUSSION
Defendants ask the Court to exercise
its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410 to dismiss the
action.  In their motion, Defendants assert
that Plaintiff Joanne King passed away in February
2023 but no successor-in-interest had been named to take the deceased Plaintiff’s
place.
After Defendants filed their motion,
the Court granted Rodriguez’s motion to be substituted into the case in place
of the deceased Plaintiff in Rodriguez’s capacity as successor-in-interest.  Rodriguez has now filed a first amended complaint.
The Court finds that Rodriguez has
demonstrated her intention to prosecute the case as successor-in-interest.  Therefore, the Court exercises its discretion
to deny Defendants’ motion to dismiss.
CONCLUSION
The Court DENIES the motion to
dismiss filed by Defendants Anza Management Company and 15025 Saticoy Street,
Inc.
Moving parties are ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
Moving parties are ordered to file
proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
