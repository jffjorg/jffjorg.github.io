Significant Statements:
  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.

  - "Terminating sanctions are a 'drastic measure which should be employed with caution.'"
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the Defendant's motion to dismiss the Plaintiff's action and has decided to deny the motion. The Defendant had sought to dismiss the action based on the Plaintiff's failure to comply with court orders. The Court has instead awarded monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff in the amount of $220.17. The Court has also denied the Defendant's request for terminating sanctions, which would have effectively ended the Plaintiff's case.
