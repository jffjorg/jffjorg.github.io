 Case Number:  22STCV11531    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  28 Having considered the  moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  A.   Previous  proceedings On April 5, 2022,  Plaintiff Samuel Rojas (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants  C&C North America, Inc. (“C&C”), Nolan Transportation Group, LLC  (“Nolan”), Emmet Isaacs, Cosentino Los Angeles (“Cosentino”), and Does 1-50 for  general negligence and premises liability. On May 10, 2022, the  Court dismissed Nolan without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. On November 18,  2022, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Nolan as Doe 1. On January 11, 2023,  C&C filed an answer. On March 10, 2023, the  Court granted Nolan’s motion to quash service of the summons and complaint on  Nolan. On June 8, 2023,  Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against Defendants C&C, Nolan,  Emmitt Isaacks, Cosentino, and Does 1-50 for general negligence and premises  liability. On June 30, 2023, Nolan  filed an answer to the first amended complaint.  On July 10, 2023, C&C filed an answer.  On August 28, 2023, Defendant Emmet Isaacs  filed an answer. On November 1, 2023,  Plaintiff amended the first amended complaint to include Defendant Jose Tapia  as Doe 1.  On March 5, 2024, Plaintiff  amended the first amended complaint to include Defendant Jose Tapia Perez as  Doe 2. On April 8, 2024, the  Court dismissed Defendant Jose Tapia (Doe 1) without prejudice at Plaintiff’s  request.  On April 11, 2024, the Court  dismissed Defendant Emmet Isaacs without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request.  On April 17, 2024, the Court dismissed  Defendant Jose Tapia Perez (Doe 2) without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. On April 11, 2024,  C&C filed a stipulation signed by counsel for C&C, Plaintiff, and Nolan  stating in part:  “1.  On July 1, 2021, Defendant JOSE TAPIA PEREZ was in the course and scope of his  employment with Defendant C&C NORTH AMERICA, INC. at the time of the  accident that is the subject of this lawsuit.  “2.  JOSE TAPIA PEREZ was acting within the scope of his employment with Defendant  C&C NORTH AMERICA, INC. when plaintiff Samuel Rojas was harmed on July 1,  2021.  “3.  At the time of plaintiff Samuel Rojas’s harm, on July 1, 2021, JOSE TAPIA  PEREZ’S conduct was reasonably related to the kinds of tasks that he was  employed by Defendant C&C NORTH AMERICA, INC. to perform.  “4.  If a jury finds Defendant JOSE TAPIA PEREZ negligent for causing Plaintiff  SAMUEL ROJAS’s injuries, then Defendant C&C NORTH AMERICA stipulates it is  jointly and severally liable for all compensatory damages attributed to  Defendant JOSE TAPIA PEREZ awarded to Plaintiff.  “5.  Defendants C&C NORTH AMERICA and JOSE TAPIA PEREZ do not admit to liability  and instead expressly reserve, their right to contest all elements of  Plaintiff’s causes of actions along with the nature and extent of Plaintiff’s  injuries and damages that were caused by the accident that is the subject of  this lawsuit. . . .” On April 25, 2024,  Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint against C&C, Nolan, Emmet  Isaacks, Cosentino, and Does 1-50 for general negligence and premises  liability, including a prayer for punitive damages. Trial is currently set  for September 19, 2024.  B.   This  motion On April 4, 2024,  Plaintiff filed a motion to compel C&C’s responses to special interrogatories,  set three to be heard on May 9, 2024.  (Plaintiff also requested sanctions but later withdrew the request.)  On April 26, 2024,  C&C filed an opposition. On April 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply. PARTIES’ REQUESTS            Plaintiff  asks the Court to compel C&C’s responses to special interrogatories, set  three. C&C asks the Court to  deny the motion.  LEGAL STANDARD  Code of Civil Procedure  section 2030.290 provides: “If  a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,  the following rules apply:  “(a)  The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise  the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection  to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection  for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court,  on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that  both of the following conditions are satisfied:  “(1)  The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance  with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240.  “(2)  The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,  inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b)  The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling  response to the interrogatories.  “(c)  The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with  Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully  makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it  finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification  or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a  party then fails to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those  orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an  evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with  Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)    DISCUSSION            On  February 1, 2024, Plaintiff served special interrogatories, set three, on  C&C.  Plaintiff granted C&C’s  requests to extend C&C’s time to respond to March 27, 2024, but C&C did  not serve timely responses.  On  April 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel C&C’s responses to the  special interrogatories.           On  April 25, 2024, C&C served responses to the special interrogatories.  Although C&C had waived any objections by  failing to provide timely responses, C&C’s responses contained objections.  Plaintiff argues that C&C’s responses  were deficient in other respects as well.   C&C argues that its belated service of responses to the  special interrogatories renders Plaintiff’s motion to compel moot.           In Sinaiko  Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148  Cal.App.4th 390 (Sinaiko), the Court of Appeal rejected the argument  that, because defendants served responses to the plaintiff’s interrogatories,  the plaintiff’s sole remedy was to move to compel further responses to the  interrogatories.  The Court of Appeal explained:  “Under [Code of Civil Procedure] section 2030.290 . . . once a party has failed  to serve timely interrogatory responses, the trial court has the authority to  hear a propounding party’s motion to compel responses under [Code of Civil  Procedure] section 2030.290, subdivision (b), regardless of whether a party  serves an untimely response. If a party fails to serve a timely response to  interrogatories, then by operation of law, all objections that it could assert  to those interrogatories are waived. ([Code Civ. Proc.,] § 2030.290, subd.  (a).) Unless that party obtains relief from its waiver, the propounding party  is entitled to move under subdivision (b) for an order compelling the response  to which the propounding party is entitled—that is, a response without objection,  and that substantially complies with the provisions governing the form ([Code  Civ. Proc.,] § 2030.210) and completeness ([Code Civ. Proc.,] § 2030.220) of  interrogatory responses.”  (Sinaiko,  supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 408.)           Based  on the reasoning of Sinaiko, the Court concludes that Plaintiff’s motion  to compel is not moot.  It is undisputed  that C&C’s responses to Plaintiff’s special interrogatories were untimely.  It is also undisputed that C&C’s belated  responses contain objections.  Because  C&C waived its objections by failing to provide timely responses, and the  Court has not relieved C&C of its waiver, the objections were  improper.  Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff’s  motion to compel C&C’s objection-free responses to the special interrogatories.  The Court does not address Plaintiff’s contention  that C&C’s interrogatory responses are deficient in other respects. CONCLUSION  The  Court GRANTS Plaintiff Samuel Rojas’s motion to compel Defendant C&C  North America, Inc.’s  responses to special  interrogatories, set three.   The Court orders Defendant C&C North America, Inc. to provide  verified code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories without  objections by June 7, 2024. Moving party is ordered  to give notice of this ruling. Moving party is ordered  to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
