 Case Number:  21STCV41887    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
November 15, 2021, Plaintiffs Noe Moreno, Amalia Moreno, Yulisa
Rojo (“Rojo”), a minor, by and through her guardian ad litem Natalia Moreno,
and Monique De Haro (“De Haro”), a minor, by and through her guardian ad litem
Natalia Moreno filed this action against Defendants Lei Zhuo and
Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
November 16, 2021, the Court appointed Natalia Moreno to serve as guardian ad
litem for De Haro. 
On
November 19, 2021, the Court appointed Natalia Moreno to serve as guardian ad
litem for Rojo. 
On
April 28, 2023, Plaintiff “Noe Romero” filed a notice of settlement.  On May 1, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel informed
the Court that the parties had settled. 
On April 11, 2024, Petitioner Natalia
Moreno (“Petitioner”) filed (1) a petition to approve the compromise of De Haro’s claims and (2) a petition to approve the compromise
of Rojo’s claims.  The petitions were
set to be heard on May 9, 2024. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUESTS 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending actions of minor Plaintiffs
De Haro and Rojo. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
A.  
Monique De
Haro 
Sections 5 to 7 of the petition state that the facts, events, and circumstances of the accident, De Haro’s injuries,
and De Haro’s treatment are “not applicable.”  Yet Attachment 13a to the petition states: “This
matter arises out of a November 28, 2019, incident. Plaintiffs were lawfully
operating their vehicle eastbound on SR-91 near Alameda St. Defendant operated
his vehicle eastbound on SR-91 without caution and in such an unsafe manner
that it violently collided into Plaintiffs' vehicle. A settlement was reached
with $1,000 for Monique De Haro.”  In
addition, Section 13b of the petition requests reimbursement for items obtained from “Diversified Medical,” which suggests that
De Haro may have had medical treatment.  Therefore,
Petitioner can and should provide additional information in Sections 5 to 7 of
the petition. 
Section 11b(5) of the petition does not identify all
of the parties who are receiving settlement payments because it does not list
Yulisa Rojo. 
Section 13a of the petition does not list the amount
of attorney’s fees requested.  Section 16c
of the petition asks for attorney’s fees of $400.00, which is 40 percent of the
gross settlement amount.  California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, “requires a
trial court, in determining reasonable attorney fees, to balance an attorney's
interest in fair compensation with the protection of the interests of a minor
client. Thus, a trial court ‘must give consideration to the terms of any
representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative of
the minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on
the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made.’ ” (Schulz
v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 1167, 1176-1177 (Schultz),
quoting Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(a)(2).) 
The Court has considered the factors listed in rule
7.955, including counsel’s declaration and the retainer agreement, and
concludes that an attorney’s fee award of 30 percent is reasonable in this
case.  (See Schultz, supra,
27 Cal.App.5th at p. 1175 [“Even if there is no benchmark starting point for
attorney fees in cases under California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, a court may
of course reasonably determine that 25 percent is an appropriate percentage in
a given case”].)  Therefore, the Court
will not award attorney’s fees that exceed $300.00. 
Section 13b and Attachment 13b of the petition list
$200.63 in costs. Section 16d of the petition, however, lists “expenses” of $355.08.  Petitioner should explain the difference
between these figures. 
          Based on the issues described above, Petitioner should
recalculate the net settlement amount. 
Petitioner should clarify whether the distribution of
the net settlement proceeds will take place as specified in Section 18a(3)(a)
of the petition or as specified in Section 18b(2) of the petition.  The petition currently contains check marks
next to both of these sections. 
The Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
B.   Yulisa Rojo 
The
complaint filed on November 15, 2021 spells
Rojo’s first name “Yulisa.”  The petition
for minor’s compromise spells her first name “Yulissa.”  Petitioner should confirm the correct
spelling. 
In
Sections 5 to 7 of the petition, Petitioner states that the facts, events, and
circumstances of the accident, Rojo’s injuries, and Rojo’s treatment are “not
applicable.”  Yet Attachment 13a to the
petition states: “This matter arises out of a November 28, 2019, incident.
Plaintiffs were lawfully operating their vehicle eastbound on SR-91 near Alameda
St. Defendant operated his vehicle eastbound on SR-91 without caution and in
such an unsafe manner that it violently collided into Plaintiffs' vehicle. A
settlement was reached with $1,000 for Yulissa Rojo.”  In addition, Section 13b of the petition requests reimbursement for items obtained from
“Diversified Medical” and “Chino Valley Medical,” which suggests that Rojo may
have had medical treatment.  Therefore,
Petitioner can and should provide additional information in Sections 5 to 7 of
the petition. 
Section
11b(5) of the petition does not identify all of the parties who are receiving
settlement payments because it does not list De Haro. 
Section
13a of the petition does not list the amount of attorney’s fees requested.  Section 16c of the petition asks for
attorney’s fees of $400.00, which is 40 percent of the gross settlement amount.
California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, “requires a trial court, in determining
reasonable attorney fees, to balance an attorney's interest in fair
compensation with the protection of the interests of a minor client. Thus, a
trial court ‘must give consideration to the terms of any representation
agreement made between the attorney and the representative of the minor or
person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and
circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made.’ ” (Schulz, supra,
27 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1176-1177, quoting Cal. Rules of Court, rule
7.955(a)(2).) 
The
Court has considered the factors listed in rule 7.955, including counsel’s
declaration and the retainer agreement, and concludes that an attorney’s fee
award of 30 percent is reasonable in this case. 
(See Schultz, supra, 27 Cal.App.5th at p. 1175 [“Even if
there is no benchmark starting point for attorney fees in cases under
California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, a court may of course reasonably
determine that 25 percent is an appropriate percentage in a given case”].)  Therefore, the Court will not award
attorney’s fees that exceed $300.00. 
Section
13b and Attachment 13b of the petition list $192.13 in costs. Section 16d of
the petition, however, lists “expenses” of $346.58.  Petitioner should explain the difference
between these figures. 
Based
on the issues described above, Petitioner should recalculate the net settlement
amount. 
Petitioner
should clarify whether the distribution of the net settlement proceeds will
take place as specified in Section 18a(3)(a) of the petition or as specified in
Section 18b(2) of the petition.  The
petition currently contains check marks next to both of these sections. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice.
