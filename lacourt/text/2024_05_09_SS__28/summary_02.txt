And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the petitions for approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiffs Monique De Haro and Yulisa Rojo's claims. The court finds that the petitions are incomplete and lack necessary information. The court orders the petitioner to recalculate the net settlement amount and to provide additional information about the settlement. The court also finds that the attorney's fee award of 30 percent is reasonable, but not to exceed $300. The court denies the petitions without prejudice and orders the petitioner to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
