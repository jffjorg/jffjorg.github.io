And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Beaudet discloses that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck approximately 24 years ago, which developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. Judge Beaudet does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased in this case, but she is willing to recuse herself if either party files a verified statement of disqualification by November 18, 2024. The Case Management Conference will be continued to December 9, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this disclosure to any new parties added to the case and to file proof of service promptly. Any new party has 14 calendar days from the date of service to file and serve the statement.
