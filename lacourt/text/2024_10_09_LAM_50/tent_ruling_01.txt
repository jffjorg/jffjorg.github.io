[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
MOTION FOR
  RECONSIDERATION OF ORDER JANUARY 24, 2024 [sic]




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Background
Plaintiff Curtis R. Olson (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on December
23, 2019 against a number of defendants, including Vidala Aaronoff. 
Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint on November 17,
2020, alleging ten causes of action. On August 29, 2023, Jane Doe filed a
Cross-Complaint in this action against, inter alia, Plaintiff. The
Cross-Complaint alleges nine causes of action. 
On January 24, 2024, the
Court issued an Order in this action concerning Plaintiff’s unopposed “motion
for statutory appellate attorney’s fees under C.C.P. §
425.16, SUBD (c)(1).” The Court’s January 24, 2024 Order provides, inter
alia, that “the Court will require a supplemental declaration from
Plaintiff’s counsel more clearly setting forth the fees incurred by Plaintiff
in responding to Defendant’s appeal. In addition, the Court will require
additional information concerning Mr. Little’s requested hourly rate.” (January
24, 2024 Order at p. 7:23-26.) The January 24, 2024 Order further provides that
“the Court continues the
hearing on the instant motion to 2/23/24, at 2 pm in Dept. 50. The
Court sets the following briefing schedule:  
Plaintiff’s supplemental declaration to be filed and served
by 1/31/24, with a courtesy copy delivered to Dept. 50. Defendants’
response, if any, to be filed and served by 2/7/24, with a courtesy copy
delivered to Dept. 50. The argument and evidence in the supplemental
papers are limited to the requested additional information, as discussed above,
and the response thereto. The parties may not include any argument or evidence
on any other issue.” (January 24, 2024 Order at p. 8:12-21.)[1]
            Vidala Aaronoff (“Aaronoff”) now moves “pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1008(a) for reconsideration
of the order dated January 24, 2024…” Plaintiff opposes. 
Discussion
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008,
subdivision (a) provides as follows: 
 
“When an application for an order has been made to a judge,
or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.” 
The legislative intent was to restrict
motions for reconsideration to
circumstances where a party offers the court some fact or circumstance not
previously considered, and some valid
reason for not offering it earlier. ((Gilberd
v. AC Transit (1995) 32
Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500);
(Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342 [“[T]he party seeking reconsideration
must provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the
failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time.”]); (New
York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-213 [“The burden under section 1008 is comparable to
that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence:
the information must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable
diligence, have discovered or produced it at the trial.”].)
Reconsideration cannot
be granted based on claims the court misinterpreted
the law in its initial ruling; that is not
a “new” or “different” matter. ((Gilberd v. AC
Transit, supra, at p. 1500.)
Moreover, counsel’s mistake
based on ignorance of the law is not
a proper basis for reconsideration.
((Pazderka v. Caballeros Dimas Alang, Inc. (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 658, 670.)
In the notice of motion, Aaronoff states
that she moves “pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
1008(a) for reconsideration of the order dated January 24, 2024 in which
the Court ruled that Aaronoff’s Request for Continuance of Hearing and Briefing
Schedule, so Defendant could file an opposition to Plaintiff’s Attorney’s Fees
Motion, which was supported by a Declaration of Vidala Aaronoff, would not be
considered by the Court because Defendant did not serve all parties.” (Notice
of Mot. at pp. 1:27-2:3.) 
As an initial matter, it does not appear
that the Court issued any order on January 24, 2024 denying any request by Aaronoff
for a “continuance of hearing and briefing schedule.” (Notice of Mot. at p.
2:1.) As discussed above, the Court’s January 24, 2024 Order concerns
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees and sets a supplemental briefing
schedule. Aaronoff does not appear to provide evidence of any Court order concerning
any purported request by Aaronoff “for Continuance of Hearing and Briefing
Schedule, so Defendant could file an opposition to Plaintiff’s Attorney’s Fees
Motion…” (Notice of Mot. at p. 2:1-2.) As noted by Plaintiff in the opposition,
“there is no order to reconsider.” (Opp’n at p. 2:4-5.) 
In her declaration in support of the motion,
Aaronoff states that “[r]econsideration of the order dated January 24, 2024 is
requested on the grounds that: a. New or different facts or circumstances have
been discovered since the date of the order in that Defendant Aaronoff’s
process server via attorney service actually did serve all parties in this
instant action. However, the proof of service was merely incorrect and an
Amended Proof of Service has been filed which shows that all parties in this
action were served.” (Aaronoff Decl., ¶ 3.) Aaronoff does not appear to specify
in her declaration what the process server allegedly served the parties with.
Moreover, the Court does not see how this relates to the Court’s January 24,
2024 Order, or why it demonstrates grounds for the Court to reconsider the
January 24, 2024 Order. As discussed, Aaronoff does not provide evidence of any
January 24, 2024 Order denying a request by Aaronoff for a continuance. 
            Based on
the foregoing, the Court does not find that Aaronoff has demonstrated grounds
for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008.

Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Aaronoff’s motion is denied. 
Plaintiff is to provide notice of
this ruling.
