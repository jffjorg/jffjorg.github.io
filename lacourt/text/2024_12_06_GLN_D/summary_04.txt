And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to enforce a settlement agreement without prejudice. The Judge found that there was no evidence before it to determine that the parties had stipulated to a settlement in a signed writing, and therefore could not confirm the accuracy of the representations made in the memorandum. The Judge also noted that the Declaration of Benjeman Beck was filed late, which prejudiced the Defendant and provided insufficient notice. The Judge ordered that the parties should provide an evidentiary showing to support the motion and will hear argument on whether the matter should be continued.
