And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Edit Vardanya, the parent of the plaintiff, Leah Nazaryan. The defendant seeks indemnity from Vardanya, alleging that her negligence caused the incident in which a metal stand fell on Nazaryan's head. The judge finds that the defendant has shown good cause for the delay in filing the cross-complaint, citing the need to confirm facts through Vardanya's deposition and the lack of prejudice to the plaintiff. The judge also notes that the trial is set for October 2025, leaving sufficient time for the defendant to gather evidence and conduct discovery. The judge concludes that granting the motion will promote judicial efficiency and fairness, as all parties can be tried together in a single proceeding.
