And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied, without prejudice, the plaintiff's unopposed motion to amend his second amended complaint. The judge found that the motion did not substantially comply with the California Rules of Court, specifically CRC Rule 3.1324(a) and (b). The judge ordered the plaintiff to correct the non-compliance and re-file the motion. The judge reminded the plaintiff that all documents must be typed, not handwritten, and in the correct format. The motion is denied, and the plaintiff is directed to re-file the motion in the correct format.
