 Case No.:

 Hearing Date:  October 31, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Lauren Potter’s unopposed motion for relief from the Order on January
24, 2024, dismissing her complaint is denied. 

 
Plaintiff Lauren Potter (“Potter”) (“Plaintiff”)
moves unopposed for relief from this Court’s order on January 24, 2024,
dismissing her Complaint on the basis the dismissal was due to mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, and/or excusable neglect.  (Notice Motion, pgs. 1-2.)
 
Background
Plaintiff filed her Complaint on March 25, 2019,
against Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) and The Westin Long Beach
(“Westin Long Beach”) (collectively, “Defendants”) for two causes of action,
negligence and public nuisance, arising from allegations that she developed
bedbug bites during her stay a hotel owned by Defendants.  (See Complaint ¶1.)
On August 17, 2023, this Court granted summary
judgment against Plaintiff.  On September
28, 2023, Plaintiff filed three pleadings purporting to name DOE 1 s Princess
Inn, DOE 2 as Praven Patel, and DOE 3 as Dipak Patel.  The Court rejected these three pleadings,
instructing Plaintiff that DOE amendments must be made on Los Angeles Superior
Court Form CIV-105.  Plaintiff
disregarded the Court’s rejection of the pleadings and served the three
defendants with a Summons, Complaint, and the three pleadings.  Plaintiff then attempted to enter default
against the three defendants named on the rejected DOE amendments, which was
rejected.
On January 24, 2024, this Court dismissed
Plaintiff’s action without prejudice on account of Plaintiff’s failure to serve
the summons and complaint on properly named DOE defendants, pursuant to C.C.P.
§§581(g), 583.210, and 583.250.  (1/24/24
Minute Order.)
On July 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant
motion.  As of the date of this hearing
no opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §473(b) mandates setting aside a
dismissal when plaintiff seeks relief based on an “attorney’s affidavit of
fault” “attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.”  (C.C.P. §473(b).)  “Application for this relief shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” 
(Id., emphasis added.)
Relief under C.C.P. §473(b) applies only to
those dismissals that are the procedural equivalent of a default.  It does not require setting aside mandatory
dismissals entered pursuant to §583.250.  (Bernasconi Commercial Real Estate v. St.
Joseph’s Regional Healthcare System (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1078, 1082.)
A
judgment of dismissal based on delay in prosecution is not “on the merits,” and
hence is not entitled to res judicata effect.  Therefore, plaintiff should be free to file a
new lawsuit on the same claim.  (Buell
v. CBS, Inc. (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 823, 826-827; Fierro v. Landry’s
Restaurant Inc. (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 276, 288.)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s motion is denied.  Plaintiff fails to attach “a copy of the
answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein,” which in this instance
is the three DOE amendments made on Los Angeles Superior Court Form CIV-105.  (See C.C.P. §473(b).)
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
unopposed motion for relief from the Order on January
24, 2024, dismissing her complaint is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
