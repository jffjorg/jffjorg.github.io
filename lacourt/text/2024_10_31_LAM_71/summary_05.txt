And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the unopposed application of Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc. to admit Daniel R. Strecker to appear pro hac vice on its behalf. As required by California Rule of Court 9.40, the application provides the necessary information, including Strecker's residence and office address, courts of admission, and proof of good standing. The application also includes proof of payment of the $500.00 application fee and proof of service on the State Bar of California. However, the application is missing Strecker's New York State Bar Number, which is necessary for the court to enter the application into its system. Therefore, the court grants the application pending receipt of Strecker's New York bar number.
