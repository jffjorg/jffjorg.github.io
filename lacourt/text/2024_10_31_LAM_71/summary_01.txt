Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the unopposed motion of plaintiff Lauren Potter to set aside the dismissal of her complaint against Marriott International, Inc. and The Westin Long Beach. The dismissal was entered on January 24, 2024, due to the plaintiff's failure to properly serve the summons and complaint on defendants. The plaintiff seeks relief under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), which allows for setting aside a dismissal based on an attorney's affidavit of fault or excusable neglect. However, the judge has denied the motion because the plaintiff failed to attach a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed, which is required by the statute. The judge has also noted that the dismissal was based on a delay in prosecution, which is not entitled to res judicata effect, meaning the plaintiff is free to file a new lawsuit on the same claim.
