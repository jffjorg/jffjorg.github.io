And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer to the first, second, and fourth causes of action in a complaint brought by the People of the State of California, ex rel. Meredith J. Williams, against Phibro-Tech, Inc. The complaint alleges that Phibro-Tech failed to comply with the California Hazardous Waste Control Law, specifically the 2016 Closure Plan Modification, which required the company to close Pond 1 at its facility. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state a claim and is untimely.

The court has taken judicial notice of the 2016 Closure Plan Modification and the September 20, 2017 final order on Phibro-Tech's appeal of the modification. The court has also considered the allegations in the complaint, including Phibro-Tech's failure to begin the process of closing Pond 1 and its failure to revise the closure cost estimate.

The court has overruled the demurrer and ordered Phibro-Tech to answer the complaint within 10 days. The court has also ordered Phibro-Tech to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
