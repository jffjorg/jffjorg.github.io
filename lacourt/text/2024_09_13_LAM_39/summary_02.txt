And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by the plaintiff, People of the State of California ex rel. Meredith J. Williams, to the second cause of action in the cross-complaint filed by the defendant, Phibro-Tech, Inc. The plaintiff is seeking to determine the legal sufficiency of the defendant's cross-complaint, which alleges that the plaintiff failed to comply with the California Hazardous Waste Control Law.

The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the defendant may re-file its cross-complaint with additional allegations that demonstrate present harms to its economic and property interests. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.

The judge's decision is based on the principle that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint, and that the court must liberally construe the allegations of the complaint. The judge has also applied the law set forth in 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, which provides that a person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, subjects another person to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured.

In making its decision, the court has considered the defendant's allegations that the plaintiff deliberately flouted the law by erroneously applying the HWCL and its implementing regulations to the defendant, and that the plaintiff's actions threatened the defendant's ability to operate its hazardous waste storage facility. The court has also considered the defendant's argument that it has alleged present harms to its economic and property interests, which are sufficient to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.
