Defendant Kenji Morinaga




OPPOSING PARTY


Plaintiff
  6340 Hollywood Associates, LLC



  
BACKGROUND
Defendant Kenji
Morinaga (“Defendant”) moves to quash service of summons.  Plaintiff 6340 Hollywood Associates, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) opposes the motion. 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff filed a proof of service on August
21, 2024, which reflects, on July 27, 2024 at 11:11 a.m., Plaintiff served Defendant
at 6338 Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles by substituted service on John Doe,
a co-tenant, whose gender, approximate age, “Skin,” hair, height, and weight
are noted.  (See Proof of Service of Summons, filed August 21, 2024.)  The proof of service also indicates the
documents were mailed to Defendant,  first class with postage prepaid, to the 6338
Hollywood Boulevard address.  
 As service was effectuated
by a registered process server, Plaintiff’s service is entitled to a
presumption of validity. (Evid. Code, § 647.) 
Defendant is, therefore “required to produce evidence that [he was] not
served.” (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th
383, 390.)
Defendant has submitted a declaration in which he states, “I
am unaware of having been served, or properly served, with any summons directed
to me in this case, and I do not believe I have been so served.”  (See Declaration of Kenji Morinaga, ¶ 5.)  Defendant’s declaration is vague and
indirect.  For example, he fails to
address whether he has a co-tenant who might have accepted substituted service
on his behalf on July 27, 2024 and whether he was substitute served by
Plaintiff.  Accordingly, the motion is
denied.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of
this order and to file proof of service of same.
