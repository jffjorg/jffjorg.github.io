MOTION
Plaintiff People
of the State of California ex rel. Meredith J. Williams, Director of the
California Department of Toxic Substances Control (“Plaintiff”) brought this
action against Defendant Phibro-Tech, Inc. (“Defendant”), contending Defendant failed
to comply with the California Hazardous Waste Control Law.  Defendant has demurred to the first, second
and fourth cause of actions in Plaintiff’s complaint.  Plaintiff opposes the demurrer. 
ANALYSIS
“It is black
letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  In ruling on a demurrer, the court must “liberally construe[]” the
allegations of the complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)  “This rule of liberal construction means that
the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)
Plaintiff alleges as
follows: Defendant owns and operates a hazardous waste treatment and recycling
facility (Complaint, ¶ 29); on September 20, 2017, Plaintiff’s 2015 Permit
Modification of the Closure Plan for Pond 1, Permit No. 91-3-TS-002, No. 03,
which Plaintiff refers to as the 2016 Closure Plan Modification, became
effective, and it required Defendant to begin the process to close Pond 1 at
its facility by March 20, 2018 (id., ¶¶ 45-46); Plaintiff inspected
Defendant’s facility on October 9, 2018 and found Defendant had not begun the
process of closing Pond 1 at its facility (id., ¶ 50);  Plaintiff again inspected Defendant’s
facility on September 4 and 5, 2019 and October 17, 2019 and notified Defendant
of violations in reports on April 17 and May 12, 2020 and March 22, 2021 (id.,
¶ 51). 
Plaintiff’s first
cause of action is for failure to implement the closure of Pond 1.  Defendant requests judicial notice of the 2016
Closure Plan Modification.  Plaintiff
references this Plan Modification in its complaint but did not attach it to the
complaint.  As such, the Court takes
judicial notice of it.  (Ascherman v.
General Reinsurance Corp. (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 307, 310-311.)  Defendant argues the 2016 Closure Plan
Modification does not require Defendant to close Pond 1 within 180 days of the
2016 Closure Plan Modification’s effective date.  Defendant is incorrect.  The 2016 Closure Plan Modification states Defendant
“shall complete closure activities . . . within . . . 180 days after approval
of the closure plan.”  (Declaration of
Robert B. Martin III in Support of Demurrer, Exhibit B, p. 068.)  
Defendant also
requests judicial notice of the September 20, 2017 final order on Defendant’s
appeal of the 2016 Closure Plan Modification. 
The Court likewise grants this request, as Plaintiff references the
final order in the complaint, but does not attach that order to the complaint.  In the order, Defendant’s Permit Appeals
Officer found Plaintiff’s January 17, 2017 approval of Defendant’s request for
a Class 2 permit modification of its permit for its wastewater treatment system
relocation and replacement “to revise the effective date of the 2016 permit
modification to be subsequent to the processing of the 2015 Class 2 Permit
Modification Request.”  (Martin Decl., Exhibit
F, p. 14.)  Plaintiff approved the 2015
Class 2 Permit Modification Request on February 17, 2017.  (Id., Exhibit F, p. 13.)  Thus, the effective date of the 2016 Closure
Plan Modification was after February 17, 2017. 
However, this is immaterial, as Plaintiff does not contend the 2016
Closure Plan Modification was effective until the September 20, 2017 final
order.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 45-46.)  
Defendant also
argues the statute of limitations bars Plaintiff’s first cause of action.  A five-year statute of limitations applies to
that claim.  (Code of Civil Procedure, §
338.1.)  The statute of limitations runs
from “the discovery by the agency . . . of the facts constituting the grounds
for commencing the action.”  (Ibid.)  The statutes of limitations for this action
were tolled from April 6, 2020 to October 1, 2020, which is an additional 178
days, due to the pandemic. (Cal. Rules of Court, emergency rule 9(a).)  Plaintiff filed this action on September 13,
2023.  Thus, Plaintiff’s action is
untimely if Plaintiff discovered the facts underlying Plaintiff’s claim before
March 19, 2018.  Plaintiff alleges Plaintiff
learned Defendant failed to begin the process of closing Pond 1 in its
inspection on October 9, 2018. (Complaint, ¶ 50.)  Plaintiff, therefore, alleges facts to show its
complaint is timely.  
Defendant argues Plaintiff
should have known it could not have timely closed Pond 1 before March 19, 2018,
because Plaintiff knew Defendant had failed to take intermediate steps.  (Complaint, ¶ 47.)  However, Plaintiff’s action is not based on Defendant’s
failure to take intermediate steps.  The
basis for Plaintiff’s action is Defendant’s failure to timely close Pond
1.  Accordingly, the Court cannot
conclude Plaintiff’s first cause of action is untimely.
Defendant requests
judicial notice of the 2015 Class 2 Permit Modification Request, which states,
in pertinent part, “Within 3 days of commencement of operations of Tanks W-7,
W-8, J-6, or J-7, the owner or operator shall remove all waste from Tanks W-1,
W-2, W-3, and W-4 and begin closure of Tanks W-1, W-2, W3, and W-4 as specified
in the approved 2015 Pond 1 Closure Plan.” 
(Martin Decl., Exhibit E, p. 350.) 
This references the timeline for the closure of wastewater tanks, not
the pond.  As such, its relevance is
unclear.  For the same reasons,
Defendant’s argument Plaintiff’s second cause of action for failure to complete
the closure of Pond One is time-barred fails.
Plaintiff’s fourth
cause of action is for failure to revise closure cost estimate.  Plaintiff alleges, “On or about October 20,
2017, 30 days after DTSC’s Permit Appeal Officer vacated the stay and
reinstated the 2015 Closure Plan and the 2016 Closure Plan Modification, [Defendant]
was required . . . to submit to DTSC the revised closure cost estimate for the
Facility, including, but not limited to, Pond 1.”  (Complaint, ¶ 76.)  Defendant argues it submitted a closure cost
estimate in September 2015.  That is
irrelevant, however, as Plaintiff contends Defendant failed to revise its
closure cost estimate, not that it failed to submit one. 
Defendant also
argues it was not required to submit a revised closure cost estimate because
the increased closure cost resulted from inflation.  In support of this argument, Defendant cites California
Code of Regulations, title 22, section 66264.142, which states, in pertinent
part, “[d]uring the active life of the facility, the owner or operator shall
adjust the closure cost estimate for inflation . . . .”  (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, § 66264.142, subd.
(b).)  It is, therefore, unclear why
Defendant contends it was not required to update its closure cost estimate.  Defendant also argues Plaintiff’s fourth
cause of action is time-barred, which, as set forth above, is unpersuasive.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Defendant’s
demurrer to the first, second, and fourth causes of action in Plaintiff’s
complaint is overruled.  Defendant is to
answer the complaint within 10 days.  
Defendant is
ordered to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
