[1] Ultimate facts are those “constituting the cause of
action” or those upon which liability depends, e.g., duty of care, breach of
the duty and causation (damages).  (See
Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.)  Further, “[t]he term ultimate fact generally
refers to a core fact, such as an essential element of a claim. Ultimate facts
are distinguished from evidentiary facts and from legal conclusions.”  (Central Valley General Hosp. v. Smith
(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 501, 513 [cleaned up]; see also Rodriguez v. Parivar,
Inc. (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 739, 750–751 [“The elements of a cause of action
constitute the essential or ultimate facts in a civil case”].)
 


[2] As part of Issue 2, Defendant raised the following
sub-issues:
 
A.    The Court's factual finding “that Plaintiff experienced
a sharp pain when the female clipped her foot. . . . is  not supported by the evidence.”  
B.    “The Court apparently ignored that Plaintiffs own
doctor, trained to record the details of the cause of Plaintiffs injury,
recorded that Plaintiff reported one day after the injury that "a woman in
high heels stepped on her foot." There is no way this woman wearing high
heels could have been employed by the Warehouse as a hostess, who walks the
entire shift in a large restaurant seating patrons. Plaintiff’s own doctor
recorded exactly what the Warehouse employees recorded in their statements.” 
C.    “Plaintiff never testified that the person, who
clipped her foot was an employee of Defendant.”
D.    “Plaintiff’s friend Earick corroborates it was highly
unlikely the host was the fictional person carrying two hands of dirty dishes.”
 
Concerning sub-issue A, the Court refers Defendant to
the Statement of Decision, 6:4-5, and the citations to the record, in
particular, RT I, 16:5-7 (Q:  WHAT DID IT
FEEL LIKE WHEN THIS WOMAN CLIPPED YOUR LEFT FOOT WITH HERS?  A:  IT
FELT LIKE A REALLY SHARP PAIN).
