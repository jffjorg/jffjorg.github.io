And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the disputes raised by the defendant regarding the court's factual findings, particularly the finding that the plaintiff experienced a sharp pain when her foot was clipped. The defendant disputes this finding, citing the lack of evidence to support it. The judge refers the defendant to the statement of decision and record citations, specifically the testimony of the plaintiff regarding the sharp pain. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's doctor recorded the injury report, which is consistent with the warehouse employees' statements.Ultimately, the judge intends to determine liability and resolve the disputes based on the ultimate facts of the case, which include the cause of action, duty of care, breach of duty, and causation.
