And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for a new trial. The defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict and that the court committed errors in law. However, the judge found that the defendant's arguments were nonsensical and unsupported by the evidence. The judge also found that the defendant failed to establish good cause for an extension of the reply brief deadline and that the court's statement of decision was sufficient. The judge awarded economic damages to the plaintiff in the amount of $8,810 and concluded that the verdict was supported by the evidence.
