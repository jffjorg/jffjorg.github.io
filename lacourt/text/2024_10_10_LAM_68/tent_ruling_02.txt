SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
August 17 and 30, 2023, Plaintiffs B&L Property Group, LLC and Hiram Banks
filed a verified complaint, and verified first amended complaint, for (1) Quiet
Title; (2) Injunctive Relief; (3) Declaratory Relief; (4) Continuing Private
Nuisance; And (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. On October 12,
2023, the parties stipulated to the filing of a second amended complaint. On
October 17, 2023, Plaintiff Hiram Banks filed a verified second amended
complaint for (1) Quiet Title; (2) Injunctive Relief; (3) Declaratory Relief;
(4) Continuing Private Nuisance.
 
On
November 21, 2203, Defendant T. Karl Raab answered the second amended
complaint, and filed a cross-complaint against Banks for Trespass to Land, and
Negligence. Banks answered the cross-complaint on December 15, 2023.
 
RULING: Denied.
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant,
Hiram Banks moves to compel further responses to Request for Production to of
Documents (set one), numbers 1-7, 11-14, 16-18, 21, and 22, and Special
Interrogatories (set one), numbers 2-5, 7, 10, 13, and 14. Banks moves to
compel further responses on grounds that the initial responses were untimely,
thereby waiving any all objections, the objections lack merit, and the
electronically stored information was not produced in statutory accordance.
Defendant/Cross-Complainant, T. Karl Raab in a combined opposition represents
the responses were timely served via electronic service, and supplemental
responses were since provided, thereby rendering the motion moot. Raab denies
any waiver of objections and requests the court continue the hearing, if
necessary to bring a motion for relief from waivers. Raab also maintains some
bad faith tactics as a means of presenting a request “ridiculously high” sanctions
amount. Banks in a combined reply maintains “recent” service of the documents
and special interrogatories (e.g. within a “few weeks of the motion”) will not
moot the motion. Banks reiterates the basis for recovery of “reasonable”
sanctions, and the lack of verification note. 
 
Both
sets of discovery were propounded on November 28, 2023. An extension was
granted until January 9, 2024. Raab steadfastly maintains the responses were
properly served via electronic delivery on January 9, 2024, at 1:20 p.m.
Verification issues with the represented transmission led to dispute and apparent
distrust between the parties as vociferously stated in the subject motion.
 
Other
than disputed opinions on the veracity of counsel, and a cover letter
identifying the seven sets of items purportedly transmitted, neither party
presents any actual evidence of electronic service or rejection via a “bounce
back” email notification. Regardless, on January 18, 2024—NINE days later—Raab
followed up with a “dropbox” link, which Banks acknowledges. Thus, it appears
responses were in fact received no later than nine (9) days after the 1-9-24
agreed upon extension.
 
Banks
offers an additional new argument in the declaration of counsel challenging the
verification as well, which would render the subject motion as one constituting
no responses. (Appleton v. Sup. Ct. (1988)
206 Cal.App.3d 632, 635-636.) The motion otherwise offers no actual substantive
address of this potential position, and the court declines to consider the
unmade arguments on behalf of Banks, or any potential new arguments presented
in the reply.
 
Notwithstanding
undisputed service via dropbox no later than 1-18-24, Banks still waited until
April 12, 2024, to file the motion after settlement negotiations broke down.
Banks represents a granted extension for service, and the Raab opposition
offers no dispute over the timeliness of the motions.
 
The
court cannot verify service on January 9, 2024, but declines to order service
of responses without objections under the circumstances whether the responses
were timely served on January 9 or January 18, 2024. Assuming a worst case
scenario that the responses were served nine (9) days later on January 18,
2024, Banks still concedes to receiving responses. Banks was in possession of
said responses for almost three (3) months before electing to proceed on the
motion and, again, only after settlement talks failed. The circumstances
support a finding of substantial compliance with the service requirements, and
reasonable excuse for any alleged delay. The court finds absolutely no showing
of material prejudice in any form to Banks. The court therefore finds a basis
for relief from any waiver of objections, as necessary. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).) With the December trial date
remaining firm, the court therefore grants relief from any waivers, rather than
further continue the hearing for additional briefing on the subject.
 
Banks
in reply appears to back away from the waiver argument either way, and
maintains justification for the motion based on supplemental responses
admittedly served after the filing of the motion. "Whether
a particular response does resolve satisfactorily the issues raised
by a motion is a matter best determined by the trial court in the exercise of
its discretion, based on the circumstances of the case. In many cases involving
untimely responses, the propounding party will take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions. If the propounding
party proceeds with the motion, however, the trial court has the discretion to
rule on the motion. The trial court might compel responses without
objection if it finds no legally valid responses  have been provided to
one or more interrogatories; it might deny the motion to compel responses as
essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions;
it might treat the motion as one under section 2030.300 and either
determine that further answers are required, or order the propounding
party to “meet and confer” (§ 2030.300, subd. (b)) and file a separate
statement (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1020(a)(2), (c)); or it might take the
motion off calendar, thereby requiring the propounding party to file a motion
under section 2030.300.” (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 408–409.) 
 
The
court declines to consider the propriety of the responses. The court finds the
supplemental responses render the motions moot and therefore DENIES the motion
on this basis. Again, if applicable, Raab is also relieved of any waived
objections. 
 
The
court however adheres to a policy that whenever a motion prompts a response
demonstrating validity to the motion, including service of supplemental
responses, the court will impose sanctions in favor of the moving party.  Banks requests $22,260 in sanctions. The
requested amount constitutes an obscene demand with an apparent punitive and vitriolic
purpose, with the result providing a tactical collateral advantage in
continuing negotiations. The court finds an insufficient  nexus with any actual effort of discovery
dispute resolution and preparation for trial.
 
Nevertheless,
the statutory minimum for documents demands is $1,000. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.050, subd. (a), 2031.280, subd. (a). The court therefore awards this
amount. The court also imposes an additional $500 in sanctions for the special
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).) TOTAL sanctions of
$1,500 are granted against Raab and counsel of record joint and several and
payable in 30 days.
