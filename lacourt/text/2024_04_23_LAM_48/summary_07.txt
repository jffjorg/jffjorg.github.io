Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted in part the plaintiff's motions to compel discovery. The defendant failed to timely respond to discovery requests, and the court has awarded sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $3,651.32. The court finds that the defendant's dilatory behavior and service of responses almost four months late—and only in response to the plaintiff's motions—warrants sanctions. The court orders the defendant's counsel to pay the total sanction of $3,651.32 to the plaintiff within ten days.
