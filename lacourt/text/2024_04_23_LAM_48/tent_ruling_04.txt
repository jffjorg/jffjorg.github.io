[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTION
  FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
April 23, 2024



 
On July 15, 2022, Plaintiff Jennifer
Bornoff filed this action against Defendant State Farm General Insurance Company,
alleging breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
On
November 28, 2023, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative,
summary adjudication.
PROCEDURAL ISSUES
“Separate
statements are required not to satisfy a sadistic urge to torment lawyers, but rather
to afford due process to opposing parties and to permit trial courts to expeditiously
review complex motions for [summary adjudication] and summary judgment to determine
quickly and efficiently whether material facts are undisputed.”  ((United
Community Church v. Garcin (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 327, 335 (United Community Church).)  “The separate statement ‘provides a convenient
and expeditious vehicle permitting the trial court to hone in on the truly disputed
facts.’ [Citation.]”  (Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 243, 252 (Nazir).)  “[I]t is no answer to
say the facts set out in the supporting evidence and memorandum of points and authorities
are sufficient.  ‘Such an argument does not
aid the trial court at all since it then has to cull through often discursive argument
to determine what is admitted, what is contested, and where the evidence on each
side of the issue is located.’”  (United Community Church, supra, 231 Cal.App.3d at p. 335.)  “The due process aspect of the separate statement
requirement is self-evident—to inform the opposing party of the evidence to be disputed
to defeat the motion.”  (Id. at p. 337.)
The parties should not “include in the separate statement
every fact they intend to include in their motion, regardless of its materiality.”  (Beltran
v. Hard Rock Hotel Licensing, Inc.
(2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 865, 875.)  “The paragraphs in a separate statement should be limited to facts that address
the elements of a cause of action or an affirmative defense.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(1); rule 3.1350(a)(2), (d)(2).)  The statute and Rules of Court do not preclude
litigants from including background, nonmaterial information in their papers as
long as they include a cite to the evidence, but nonmaterial facts should not be
included in the separate statement.  The point
of the separate statement is not to craft a narrative, but to be a concise list
of the material facts and the evidence that supports them.”  (Ibid.)
Of the unique facts in Plaintiff’s Separate Statement
of Additional Material Facts, many are unnecessary and are not, in fact, material
to the claims or defenses.  Additionally,
what a party said or perceived is not a “material fact”; rather, it is evidence
of a fact.  (Reeves
v. Safeway Stores, Inc. (2004) 121
Cal.App.4th 95, 106 (Reeves).)  “The separate
statement should include only material facts and not any facts that are not pertinent
to the disposition of the motion.”  (California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(d)(2).)  “[T]rial
courts have the inherent power to strike proposed ‘undisputed facts’ that fail to
comply with the statutory requirements and that are formulated so as to impede rather
than aid an orderly determination whether the case presents triable material issues
of fact.  If such an order leaves the required
separate statement insufficient to support the motion, the court is justified in
denying the motion on that basis.”  (Reeves, supra, 121 Cal.App.4th at p. 106.)
Although
the Court will not strike non-material portions of Plaintiff’s separate statement
here, counsel is cautioned to include only facts that are truly material to the
motion.
REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE.
The
parties’ requests for judicial notice are denied as unnecessary.  All of those documents are already part of this
case’s record.
BACKGROUND FACTS
All
of Defendant’s material facts are undisputed.[1]
Defendant
issued a Businessowners Coverage Form policy to Jennifer Bornoff dba Verona by Jeni
B, which was effective for the period of March 1, 2022, to March 1, 2023.  (Undisputed Material Fact “UMF” 1.)
On
March 6, 2022, Plaintiff’s business suffered a burglary including stolen merchandise,
and Plaintiff submitted a claim for loss of business personal property and loss
of income (“Claim #1”).  (UMF 2.)  On March 11, 2022, Plaintiff sent Defendant a
list of missing inventory ($967.00) and a repair invoice ($700.95), which combined
was less than her $5,000.00 deductible for Claim #1.  (UMF 3.) 
On March 16, 2022, Defendant issued a $1,000.00 advance payment to Plaintiff
for the loss of income portion of Claim #1. 
(UMF 4.)
On
March 31, 2022, Plaintiff’s business suffered a second burglary including stolen
merchandise, and Plaintiff submitted a second claim for loss of business personal
property and loss of income (“Claim #2”). 
(UMF 5.)
On
April 11, 2022, Defendant received a Designation of Counsel from Plaintiff’s counsel
and a single packet of documents related to both Claim #1 and Claim #2 containing
information about approximately 972 stolen items.  (UMF 6.) 
On May 26, 2022, Defendant requested that Plaintiff provide the wholesale
pricing of the items for sale and the age and replacement cost for items not held
for sale for her business personal property losses.  (UMF 7.) 
On June 3, 2022, Defendant requested that Plaintiff state which item of business
personal property was being claimed for which claim, and Plaintiff provided the
list three days later.  (UMF 8-9.)
On
July 18, 2022, Defendant completed its business personal property estimates in the
amount of $55,166.37 for Claim #1 after Plaintiff’s deductible of $5,000.00 was
applied and $75,493.53 for Claim #2 after Plaintiff’s deductible of $5,000.00 was
applied.  (UMF 10.)  Defendant issued the payments two days later.  (UMF 11.) 
Plaintiff did not dispute the amount she was paid for her business personal
property losses.  (UMF 12.)
On
July 21, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel sent Defendant letters demanding an additional
$1,400.00 for merchandising costs, $3,390.95 for replacement of a mirror and display
cabinet, $650.00 for additional merchandising, and $16,200.00 for estimated repairs.  (UMF 13.)
On
July 25, 2022, Defendant requested Plaintiff’s actual sales since March 6, 2022,
in order to calculate Plaintiff’s loss of income from the burglaries.  (UMF 14.) 
Plaintiff provided the information two days later.  (UMF 15.) 
On August 12, 2022, Defendant sent Plaintiff’s counsel a letter advising
that based on the information it was provided, Plaintiff’s total income for the
period of March 2022 through June 2022 was greater than her historical sales and
therefore there was no loss of income.  (UMF
16.)
On
September 1, 2022, Defendant issued payment to Plaintiff for all of the additional
amounts she requested on July 21, 2022.  (UMF
18.)
On
October 5, 2022, Defendant calculated Plaintiff’s loss of income with her March
2022 through September 2022 sales figures and issued payment of $1,484.45 to Plaintiff
for her loss of income.  (UMF 21; see UMF
19-20.)  Plaintiff did not dispute the loss
of income calculation.  (UMF 22.)
Plaintiff
has admitted several times that Defendant had paid all of the benefits that she
was entitled to under the Policy for both of her Claims.  (UMF 23.)
DISCUSSION
For
each claim in the complaint, the defendant moving for adjudication must satisfy
the initial burden of proof by showing that one or more elements of a cause of action
cannot be established or that there is a complete defense to a cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520 (Scalf).)  Then the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show
that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf,
supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1520.)  To establish a triable issue of material fact,
the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial responsive evidence.”  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th
151, 162-163.)
A.        Plaintiff Concedes That the First Cause
of Action is Now Moot.
The
first cause of action alleges that Defendant breached its contract with Plaintiff
by not paying all policy benefits for her Claims.  Plaintiff admits that all benefits have now been
paid, and this cause of action is moot.  (Opposition
at p. 9.)
Summary
adjudication of the first cause of action is granted.
B.        Plaintiff Did Not Suffer Any Detriment
From Delayed Claims Handling.
The
second cause of action alleges breach of the duty good faith and fair dealing when
Defendant unreasonably withheld benefits due under the policy.
To
establish a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing for insurance
claims, a plaintiff must establish that (1) benefits due under the policy were withheld,
and (2) the reason for withholding benefits was unreasonable or without proper cause.  (Love v. Fire Insurance Exchange (1990)
221 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1151.)  “As a general
rule . . . there can be no breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing if no benefits are due under the policy.”  (Brehm v. 21st Century Ins. Co. (2008)
166 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1235.)  However, “the
principle that no breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing can occur
if there is no coverage or potential for coverage under the policy is quite different
from the argument that no breach of the implied covenant can occur if there is no
breach of an express contractual provision: ‘[B]reach of a specific provision of
the contract is not a necessary prerequisite to a claim for breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing. . . . [E]ven an insurer that pays the full
limits of its policy may be liable for breach of the implied covenant if improper
claims handling causes detriment to the insured.’”  (Id. at p. 1236.)
Defendant
paid all benefits owed under the policy, Plaintiff never disputed the amount of
benefits, and Plaintiff admitted that she was paid all benefits owed.  Accordingly, Defendant has met its initial burden
of showing that Plaintiff did not suffer any detriment due its claims handling.
Plaintiff
argues that she suffered a detriment due to a 35-day delay, when she initially submitted
Claim #1 on March 7, 2022 until April 11, 2022. 
(Opposition at pp. 11-14.)  Plaintiff
details her initial conversations with a claims handler during this time period
and his subsequent failure to respond.  (Ibid.)  However, Plaintiff provides no evidence that she
suffered additional detriment due to this delayed handling.  Plaintiff declares that she experienced financial
hardship because she went through her personal savings, used credit cards to purchase
inventory and groceries, borrowed money, and used a Go Fund Me campaign to keep
her business open and pay bills.  (Bornoff
Decl. ¶ 20.)  These economic harms were remedied
when Defendant paid all benefits owed, and Plaintiff never disputed the amounts
that Defendant paid.
Plaintiff
also declares that she suffered great emotional distress, had sleepless nights,
gained weight, and started to lose her hair. 
(Bornoff Decl. ¶ 21.)  “[E]motional
distress damages are recoverable in a first party bad faith case only when the insured
establishes financial loss . . . .  Then,
and only then, may the insured recover for emotional distress damages as well as
the pecuniary loss.”  (Waters v. United
Services Auto. Assn. (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1063, 1074; see also Continental
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 69, 85 [“a claim for emotional
distress in a bad faith action cannot stand alone, but must be accompanied by some
showing of economic loss”].)  Because she
suffered no economic loss as a result of the delay, Plaintiff cannot recover damages
for emotional distress.
Summary
adjudication of the second cause of action is granted.
C.        Defendant Has Shown That Plaintiff Cannot
Establish a Basis for Punitive Damages.
For
the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff cannot establish an underlying claim upon
which punitive damages may be awarded.
Summary
adjudication of punitive damages is granted.
CONCLUSION
The
motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.  Defendant
is ordered to submit a proposed judgment within five days.
A
Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Submission of Proposed Judgment is scheduled for
May 1, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
