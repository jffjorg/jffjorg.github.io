[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO TAX
  COSTS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
April 23, 2024



 
On March 25, 2019, Maria Carrasco filed this action against
Tania Saroyan.
On July 27, 2020, Saroyan filed a second
amended cross-complaint against Samuel Carrasco, Erick Carrasco, and others.
Saroyan dismissed the Carrascos on December
19, 2023.  On December 26, 2023, the
Carrascos each filed a memorandum of costs, each requesting $2,051.64 in costs.
On January 12, 2024, Saroyan filed motions
to tax costs.

“A
‘verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of the propriety’ of the items
listed on it, and the burden is on the party challenging these costs to demonstrate
that they were not reasonable or necessary.” 
(Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486.)  “[I]f the correctness of the memorandum is challenged
either in whole or in part by the affidavit or other evidence of the contesting
party, the burden is then on the party claiming the costs and disbursements to show
that the items charged were for matters necessarily relevant and material to
the issues involved in the action.”  (Oak
Grove School Dist. of Santa Clara County v. City Title Ins. Co. (1963) 217 Cal.App.2d
678, 699.)
On
each memorandum of costs, Saroyan moves to strike $835.39 in deposition costs and
$763.12 in “other” costs.
The
Carrascos’ counsel told Saryoan’s counsel that the depositions costs were from the
“Third Volume of Tania Saroyan (where we dealt primarily with the cross-claims)
and James (the Housing department investigator),” but he did not provide any documentation.  (Chukiat Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.)  Saryoan contends that she has no knowledge of
any deposition of James.  (Motion at p. 2,
fn. 2.)  In opposition, the Carrascos explain
that the deposition was of James McDevitt, the invoice was for $996.90, and the
parties each incurred one-third of the total cost.  (Nava Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. A.)  However, Saroyan explains in her reply that the
Carrascos provided notice on the evening of Thursday, January 20, 2022 for a deposition
occurring on Friday, January 21, 2022 at 4:00 p.m.  (Atabek Decl. ¶¶ 2-4; see id., Ex. 1.)  “An oral deposition shall be scheduled for a date
at least 10 days after service of the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.270, subd. (a).)  The Court therefore strikes $332.30 (one-third
of the $996.90 total) from each memorandum of costs for this improper deposition.
The
Carrascos’ counsel told Saryoan’s counsel that the $763.12 in “other” costs was
mediation costs, but he did not provide any documentation.  (Chukiat Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.)  In opposition, the Carrascos provide a September
29, 2020 receipt for total mediation costs of $2,312.50.  (Nava Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. D.)  Mediation costs are not expressly permitted or
prohibited by statute, and thus they are allowable in the court’s discretion.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4).)  The Court did not order mediation, and thus this
was a voluntary cost.  Moreover, the September
2020 mediation was not reasonably necessary to this action because Saroyan’s cross-complaint
was not heavily litigated and Saroyan did not dismiss the Carrascos until December
15, 2023.  The Court therefore strikes $763.12
in mediation costs from each memorandum of costs.
The
motions to tax costs are GRANTED.  The Court
strikes $332.30 in deposition costs and $763.12 in “other”/mediation costs from
each memorandum of costs, for a total deduction of $1,095.42.
Samuel
Carrasco and Erick Carrasco may each recover $956.22 in costs from Tania Saroyan
($2,051.64 minus $1,095.42).
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
