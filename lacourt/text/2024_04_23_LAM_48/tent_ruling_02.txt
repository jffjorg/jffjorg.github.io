  CASE NO.: 21STCV06712
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
April 23, 2024



 
Michael
J. Kapin and the firm Kapin PLLC, counsel of record for Defendants DM Holdings Group
LLC, Dope Media Inc., Dope Media LLC, and Hightimes Holding Corp., seek to be relieved
as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states
that there are irreconcilable differences between counsel and clients.  No party opposed the motions.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until August 26, 2024, and there
is no prejudice to Defendants.
The
unopposed motions to be relieved are GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on DM Holdings
Group LLC, Dope Media Inc., Dope Media LLC, Hightimes Holding Corp., and all parties
who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for Entity Defendants is scheduled for July 23, 2024 at 8:30
a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
DM
Holdings Group LLC, Dope Media Inc., Dope Media LLC, and Hightimes Holding Corp.
must retain new counsel by that date or the Court may strike their answers and place
them in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 23rd day of April 2024
