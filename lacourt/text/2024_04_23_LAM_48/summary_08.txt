And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has tentatively denied the motion to consolidate sixteen cases involving similar workplace policies and employment contracts. The Judge found that the cases have unique factual circumstances and require individualized proof of damages, making consolidation impractical. The Judge also noted that consolidation would compromise the clarity and focus of the trial, likely leading to jury confusion.
