[TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER; SETTING

Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
April 23, 2024



 
On August 3, 2023, Plaintiff
Bre Silver MF Roosevelt CA LLC filed this action against Defendant 727 West Seventh
LLC.  The Complaint alleges breach of lease
and account stated.
On
November 30, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer.
DEMURRER
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)  “Because a demurrer
challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside
the pleading that are subject to judicial notice.”  (Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health
Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.)
Defendant
argues that the Complaint improperly alleges “Unpaid late charges, and other expenses,
charges, and costs” because landlords could not add these charges during the COVID-19
Local Emergency Period, and other charges and expenses cannot be ascertained on
the face of the Complaint.  (Demurrer at p.
2.)  Plaintiff seeks damages “according to
proof”; it need not allege the exact amount of damages at this stage.  (See Complaint at p. 8.)  Moreover, Plaintiff does allege an unpaid balance
of $228,189.21 as of July 18, 2023, which is a specific amount as of a specific
date, and that date includes time after the February 1, 2023 expiration of the COVID-19
Local Emergency Period.  (Complaint ¶¶ 22,
26, 31.)
Defendant
argues that the rent ledger in Exhibit A of the Complaint includes a $300 flat charge
for water, but the amendment in Exhibit E states that the landlord shall submit
a bill to the tenant for which such amount is not to “exceed $300” or not to exceed
the amount the utility company would have charged the tenant.  (Demurrer at p. 2.)  Defendant faults Plaintiff for not attaching any
bills.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff need not include evidence at the pleading
stage, and the attached ledger’s $300 charge is not inconsistent with the provision
that the amount is not to “exceed $300.”
Defendant
argues that the amendment in Exhibit E provides that Plaintiff was in the process
of having the water and sewage separately sub-metered for the Premises, but the
rent ledger reflects billing from Plaintiff to Defendant.  (Demurrer at p. 3.)  According to Defendant, “that would suggest on
the face of the complaint, the Plaintiff never fulfilled its agreement to submeter
the property.  This failure to perform in
accordance with Paragraph 5 of the 4th Amendment is inconsistent with the allegation
in Paragraph 27 on page 7 of the Complaint where the Plaintiff asserts that he has
‘duly performed all the terms.’”  (Ibid.)  If Defendant contends that Plaintiff did not fully
perform its duties, that is a defense that Defendant can assert, not grounds for
demurrer.
Finally,
Defendant argues that Plaintiff inconsistently alleges that Defendant owed $243,789.45
and $228,189.21.  (Demurrer at p. 3.)  Plaintiff’s allegations are not inconsistent.  The Complaint alleges, “As of July 7, 2023, Defendants
owed the sum of $243,789.45 to Plaintiff under the Lease.”  (Complaint ¶ 18.)  Later, the Complaint alleges, “As of July 18,
2023, rent and charges in the sum of $228,189.21 were still due, owing, and unpaid
from Defendants to Plaintiff.”  (Complaint
¶ 22.)  These different amounts are alleged
as of different dates.
The
demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendant is ordered
to file an answer within 10 days.  (California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j)(1).)
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
On
March 21, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a Notice of Unavailability of Counsel
designating April 4, 2024 through April 9, 2024 as a period of time during which
counsel demands that no one will take any actions in the case and threatening sanctions
if anyone does so.
The
Court, on its own motion, strikes the Notice of Unavailability of Counsel under
Code of Civil Procedure section 436, subdivision (b).
“It
has apparently become common practice in the trial courts for litigants to file
a ‘notice of unavailability’ under the guise of Tenderloin Housing Clinic, Inc.
v. Sparks (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 299, 10 Cal.Rptr.2d 371.  The notice purports to advise the other parties
to the action—as well as the court—that the deliverer will not be available for
a prescribed period of time and that no action may be taken during that period which
adversely affects the unavailable party. 
To the extent this practice attempts to put control of the court’s calendar
in the hands of counsel—as opposed to the judiciary—it is an impermissible infringement
of the court’s inherent powers.”  (Carl
v. Superior Court (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 73, 74-75.)
As
the Carl court explained, “[n]othing in Tenderloin, however, expressly
condones the practice that has grown up around its name.  It has simply been made up.”  (Id. at 76.)
On
December 7, 2023, the Court ordered Plaintiff’s prior Notice of Unavailability of
Counsel (filed November 7, 2023) stricken. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s counsel was on notice about the impropriety of filing
a Notice of Unavailability of Counsel and should not have filed one yet again.
Counsel
for Plaintiff is ordered to cease and desist from filing Notices of Unavailability
in cases pending in Department 48 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
An
Order to Show Cause re: Sanctions of Up to $500.00 Under CCP 177.5 Against Attorney
Ronald K. Brown, Jr. is scheduled for May 24, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
