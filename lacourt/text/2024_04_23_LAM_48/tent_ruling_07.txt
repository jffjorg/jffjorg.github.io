On
September 11, 2023, Plaintiff Jason Annigian filed this action against Defendant
BMW of North America LLC, and on September 25, 2023, he filed a first amended complaint.
On
January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed motions to compel Defendant’s responses to Form
Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories. 
Plaintiff also requested sanctions.
When
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (a).)  Sanctions shall be
imposed against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel,
unless the party acted with substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise
be unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c).)
Plaintiff
propounded discovery on November 20, 2023. 
(Pascal Decl. ¶ 3.)  Defendant did
not timely respond by December 20, 2023. 
(Pascal Decl. ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff’s counsel
met and conferred with Defendant’s counsel, but Defendant never provided responses.  (Pascal Decl. ¶¶ 5-9.)  As of Plaintiff’s January 29, 2024 motions, “Defendant
has gone radio silent and failed to provide initial responses to Plaintiff’s discovery
requests.”  (Pascal Decl. ¶ 9.)
Defendant’s
late-filed oppositions state that Defendant ultimately served responses on April
17, 2024.  (Opposition at p. 2.)  Accordingly, the motion to compel is now moot.
The
Court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery even where the requested discovery was provided to
the moving party after the motion was filed. 
(California Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
According
to the oppositions, which were not accompanied by a declaration, the handling associate
is no longer with defense counsel’s office “as of a week ago.”  (Opposition at p. 6.)  “It was not until the next handling counsel reviewed
the case files and discovered that this dispute was still ongoing and that that
the discovery motions were on calendar.” 
(Id. at p. 7.)  This does not
excuse the failure to timely serve initial responses in December 2023.  Defendant’s dilatory behavior and service of responses
almost four months late—and only in response to Plaintiff’s motions—warrants sanctions.
The
motions to compel are GRANTED IN PART.
The
Court awards Plaintiff $1,825.66 (Special Interrogatories) and $1,825.66 (Form Interrogatories),
for a total sanction of $3,651.32.  Defendant’s
counsel is ordered to pay a total sanction of $3,651.32 to Plaintiff within ten
days.
The
remainder of the motions are MOOT.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
