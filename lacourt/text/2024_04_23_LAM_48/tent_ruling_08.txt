[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE
  CASES
 
Dept. 48

On February 2, 2024, Plaintiff Nicholas Leinbach filed
this action (Case No. 24STCV02800) against Defendants Better Earth Inc., Zain Jan,
Shaun Sharabi, Trace Rucarean, Patrick Butler, Michael Cavaleri, and Jeremy Nicholson.
This case was later related to fifteen
other cases: 24STCV02767, 24STCV02782, 24STCV02797, 24STCV02805, 24STCV02933, 24STCV02935, 24STCV02936, 24STCV02937,
24STCV02942, 24STCV02950, 24STCV02955, 24STCV02961, 24STCV02968, 24STCV03051, and 24STCV03097.
On March 29, 2024, Defendants filed a
motion to consolidate.
PROCEDURAL ISSUES
A Notice of Motion containing a list of
all named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names
of their respective attorneys of record must be filed in each case sought to be
consolidated.  (California Rules of Court,
rule 3.350(a)(1).)  No Notice of Motion was
filed in the related cases.  However, Defendants’
counsel declares that all of the plaintiffs are represented by the same counsel,
and all of the defendants are represented by the same counsel.  (Kelley Decl. ¶¶ 20-21.)
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
Defendants’ objections to the Declaration
of Andrew S. Levine are sustained.
DISCUSSION
Under Los Angeles Superior Court Rule
3.3, subdivision (g), “A motion to consolidate two or more cases may be noticed
and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments, have been related
into a single department, or if the cases were already assigned to that department.”

“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court,
it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the
actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1048, subd. (a).)  The purpose of consolidation is to enhance trial
court efficiency by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence and the danger
of inconsistent adjudications.  (See Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield Claimants
Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-979.)
Consolidation
is not appropriate for these sixteen cases. 
Defendants highlight the common employer, office, supervisor, working conditions,
employment letters and contracts, and employee handbook.  (Motion at p. 10.)  However, as Defendants acknowledge, some plaintiffs
were paid hourly and some plaintiffs were paid a salary.  (Motion at p. 11.)  Defendants also acknowledge that the plaintiff
in Case No. 24STCV02961 uniquely alleges claims for disability discrimination, failure
to accommodate, and failure to engage in the interactive process.  (Motion at p. 10, fn. 2.)
The
plaintiffs “acknowledge that there exist legal questions under the same Labor Code,
the same wage orders, and the same common law in each of their matters,” but each
plaintiff’s case will depend on its own facts. 
(Opposition at p. 9.)  “Moreover, each
Plaintiff's claim for owed commissions necessitates a separate and detailed accounting
and calculation and will rely on the testimonial evidence from distinct individuals,
reflecting the difference in terms of employment and varying durations of service.”  (Ibid.)  The differences in facts and evidence also extend
to each plaintiff’s claims for violations of overtime, meal breaks, and rest breaks.  Each plaintiff “periodically” worked excess hours
or was not allowed breaks, and this will be a unique calculation for each plaintiff.  (See, e.g., Leinbach Complaint ¶¶ 48, 53, 59,
61.)  Regardless of similar workplace policies
(see Motion at p. 11), whether these policies for followed may vary between the
plaintiffs—which Defendants also acknowledge. 
(Motion at p. 12 [“BEI acknowledges that a trial of each action would require
each plaintiff to prove his/her individual damages.  Such individualized proof will be necessary whether
or not the Related Cases are consolidated.”].)
Given
these factual differences between sixteen different plaintiffs’ employment, the
Court agrees with the plaintiffs that “the consolidation would severely compromise
the clarity and focus of the trial, likely leading to jury confusion.”  (Opposition at p. 9.)
Accordingly,
the motion to consolidate is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
