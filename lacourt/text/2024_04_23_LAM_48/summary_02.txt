And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motions of Michael J. Kapin, counsel for the defendants DM Holdings Group LLC, Dope Media Inc., Dope Media LLC, and Hightimes Holding Corp., to be relieved as counsel due to irreconcilable differences between counsel and clients. The judge notes that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. The judge also notes that a corporation cannot represent itself in court, and therefore schedules an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel for July 23, 2024, at which point the entity defendants must retain new counsel or risk having their answers struck and being placed in default.
