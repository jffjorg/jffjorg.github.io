And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Jill Feeney regarding Plaintiff Arthur Tsatryan's Motion for Clarification. The motion seeks clarification on three issues: (1) whether the Court's July 27, 2023 order merely provides more time for Defendant to respond to requests for admissions, (2) what bases support the dismissal of other defendants, and (3) how res judicata applies to the case. The Court finds that the order is unambiguous and does not require further clarification. The Court also determines that Plaintiff is attempting to relitigate issues from a previous Family Court proceeding and that a motion for clarification is not the appropriate method of raising arguments against dismissal. The Court sets a hearing date for October 26, 2023, and gives Plaintiff the opportunity to file legal briefing addressing the issue of dismissal at least 10 court days before the hearing date.

Plaintiff Arthur Tsatryan's Motion for Clarification is denied. The case involves fraud, defamation, and wrongful eviction arising from a family dissolution matter. The plaintiff alleges that Polina Tsatryan, the defendant, falsely testified during their divorce proceedings, leading to the illegal eviction of the plaintiff from their Santa Clarita residence. The plaintiff's motion seeks clarification on various aspects of the Court's July 27, 2023 order, which the Court deems unnecessary as it is unambiguous. The Court has determined that the plaintiff is attempting to relitigate matters already adjudicated in Family Court and has the opportunity to file legal briefing addressing the issue of dismissal.
