Case No.: BC680322 Hearing Date: October 4, 2023 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: PLAINTIFF ARTHUR TSATRYAN’S MOTION FOR CLARIFICATIONPlaintiff Arthur Tsatryan’s Motion for Clarification is DENIED.Moving party to provide notice. FACTUAL BACKGROUNDThis is an action for fraud, defamation, and wrongful eviction arising out of a family dissolution matter. The First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleges as follows. Plaintiff Arthur Tsatryan (“Arthur”) filed a petition for divorce from his wife, Polina Tsatryan (“Polina”) in September 2009. (FAC ¶ 12.) During the dissolution proceedings, Polina testified that an interspousal transfer deed from their Santa Clarita residence executed in Arthur’s favor during their marriage had been a fraud perpetrated by Arthur against her. (FAC ¶ 16.) This testimony, however, was false, and Polina perjured herself. (FAC ¶ 16.) The court nonetheless ordered the property transferred from Arthur to Polina. (FAC ¶ 18.) Polina and other defendants then illegally evicted Arthur from the residence. (FAC ¶ 87.) PROCEDURAL HISTORYOn October 20, 2017, Arthur filed the original Complaint. On March 20, 2018, Arthur filed the First Amended Complaint asserting six causes of action:1. Fraud;2. Libel Per Se;3. Defamation;4. Conspiracy;5. Wrongful Eviction; and6. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. On October 9, 2018, Arthur filed the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging nine causes of action:1. Fraud;2. Libel per se;3. Defamation;4. Conspiracy;5. Wrongful Eviction;6. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress;7. Punitive Damages;8. Equitable relief; and9. Declaratory Relief. On July 27, 2023, the Court issued an order setting an OSC re: dismissal on the grounds that Plaintiff is attempting to relitigate a matter already adjudicated in Family Court. In the same order, the Court continued Plaintiff’s pending Motions to Deem Requests for Admissions (“RFAs”) Admitted, Continue Trial, and to Enter Default to October 26, 2023.On August 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for clarification.DISCUSSIONPlaintiff moves for clarification of the Court’s July 27, 2023 order. Plaintiff first seeks clarification on whether the Court merely provides more time for Defendant to provide a response to the request for admission and whether the Court will consider the original 7/28/2023 hearing date as the date of hearing to evaluate any tardy responses to his requests for admissions.The courts have the inherent authority to adopt procedures needed to exercise jurisdiction as well as to manage and control their dockets. (Code Civ. Proc., section 128; People v. Perkins (2016) 197 Cal.Rptr.3d 743.) Here, the Court continued Plaintiff’s pending motions to deem requests for admissions admitted, continue trial, and enter default so that the hearing regarding dismissal may be heard first. The July 27, 2023 order is unambiguous and does not require further clarification.Plaintiff also seeks clarification on what bases support the dismissal of the other defendants in this case. Specifically, Plaintiff disputes the dismissals of Defendants Block and Kosich. The July 27, 2023 order does not disturb past dismissals or appeals, but instead sets a hearing date so that Plaintiff has the opportunity to be heard on the issue of dismissal. The order is not ambiguous and does not require further clarification.Plaintiff finally seeks clarification on how res judicata applies to the case at hand. Plaintiff asks the Court to clarify why Court seeks to dismiss now after five years. Plaintiff asks the Court to clarify why res judicata applies because the appellate court in cases B270784 and B276299 only examined the issues of attorney’s fees and quashing a writ of possession. Finally, Plaintiff seeks clarification on how the SAC is frivolous, arguing the SAC is supported by law and fact.Again, the July 27, 2023 order is not ambiguous. The order states “Attached at Exhibit A is the January 14, 2019 decision of the Court of Appeal in B270784, B276299 setting forth the procedural history and the decisions of both the Family Court and the Court of Appeal relevant to Plaintiff’s claim here that he was wrongfully evicted as result of the lies told by Defendant Polina Tsatryan and others during the course of the family court proceeding…Here, Plaintiff is attempting to relitigate what occurred in Family Court with respect to the residence. He cannot do so.” Trial courts have inherent authority to fashion remedies as necessary to protect defendants’ rights to be free from frivolous claims. (Huang v. Hanks (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 179, 182 (citing Stephen Slesinger, Inc. v. Walt Disney Co.155 Cal.App.736, 762.).) Here, the Court determined from the appellate decisions in cases B270784 and B276299 that Plaintiff appears to be attempting to relitigate issues from those matters in the case at hand. Plaintiff has the opportunity to file legal briefing addressing the issue of dismissal at least 10 court days before October 26, 2023. A motion for clarification is not the appropriate method of raising his arguments against dismissal.DATED: October 4, 2023 ______________________________                                                                      Hon.
