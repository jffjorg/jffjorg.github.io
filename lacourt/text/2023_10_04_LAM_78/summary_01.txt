The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Westlake Services, LLC's motion to compel Defendant Hitham Ahmed's responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Two). The motion is denied. The judge finds that the second set of Special Interrogatories is not duplicative of the first set, as it seeks information about each of Defendant's affirmative defenses individually. However, the judge notes that the deadline for Plaintiff to file a motion to compel further responses as to the first set of Special Interrogatories has passed, and the Court no longer has jurisdiction to rule on that motion. The judge also finds that Plaintiff was substantially justified in making this motion, as Defendant failed to provide timely responses to the Special Interrogatories, and sanctions are denied.

## English Summary

The judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Westlake Services' motion to compel Defendant Hitham Ahmed's responses to a second set of Special Interrogatories (SROGs). The judge finds that although the second set of SROGs contained some new questions, many were duplicative of questions already asked in the first set. 

Plaintiff argued the second set sought information about each of Defendant's affirmative defenses individually, but the judge found this distinction irrelevant because the core information sought was already provided in the first set.  

Additionally, the judge determined that Plaintiff's motion was untimely, as the deadline to file a motion to compel responses to the first set of SROGs had already passed.  

Therefore, the motion to compel was denied, and sanctions against Plaintiff were also denied because the judge found Plaintiff's actions substantially justified.
