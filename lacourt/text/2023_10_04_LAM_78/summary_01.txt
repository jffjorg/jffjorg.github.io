And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Westlake Services, LLC's motion to compel Defendant Hitham Ahmed's responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Two). The motion is denied. The judge finds that the second set of Special Interrogatories is not duplicative of the first set, as it seeks information about each of Defendant's affirmative defenses individually. However, the judge notes that the deadline for Plaintiff to file a motion to compel further responses as to the first set of Special Interrogatories has passed, and the Court no longer has jurisdiction to rule on that motion. The judge also finds that Plaintiff was substantially justified in making this motion, as Defendant failed to provide timely responses to the Special Interrogatories, and sanctions are denied.
