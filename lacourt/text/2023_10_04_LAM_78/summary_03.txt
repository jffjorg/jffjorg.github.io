And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on defendant Elizabeth Reyes Mejia's demurrer to the complaint filed by plaintiff Briana Jocelyn Garcia-Nava. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached the implied warranty of habitability, tortiously breached the implied warranty of habitability, and were negligent in failing to install a working heater and carbon monoxide alarms in her rented unit.

The court has overruled Mejia's demurrer on all grounds. With respect to the first and second causes of action, the court finds that the complaint sufficiently states facts to support the claims. The court also finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges that Mejia committed wrongs in her personal capacity and that the defendants had notice of and sufficient time to cure the alleged defective conditions.

The court also denies Mejia's motion to strike the plaintiff's demand for punitive damages. The court finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges that the defendants made a conscious decision not to install a heater and carbon monoxide alarm to save money, despite being aware of the probable consequences, and that such conduct rises to the level of despicable conduct.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and oral argument.
