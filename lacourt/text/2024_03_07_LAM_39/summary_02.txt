And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving The BSA Formula, LLC (Plaintiff) and Earl Robinson (Defendant). The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant breached their contract, interfered with their business operations, and engaged in unfair competition. The Defendant demurred to each cause of action and moved to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The Court overruled the demurrer and granted the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages associated with the first, second, and fifth causes of action. The Court also struck a paragraph in the Plaintiff's complaint related to the unfair competition claim. The Court ordered the Plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 20 days and set a final status conference and trial date.
