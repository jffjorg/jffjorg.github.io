  Case Number:  20STCV20862    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  39 Outsource, LLC v.
Horizon Communications Technologies, Inc.
Case No.
20STCV20862
Motion for Attorneys’
Fees
 
Plaintiff Outsource, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) prevailed on its breach of contract claim against Defendant
Horizon Communications Technologies, Inc. (“Defendant”).  Now, Plaintiff seeks attorneys’ fees.  The
prevailing party must seek an award of attorneys’ fees via a noticed motion,
and bears the burden of proof to justify the amount sought.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(c)(5)(A).)  The parties’ contract
provides that Plaintiff is “entitled to recover the reasonable attorney’s fees
and costs incurred in enforcing its rights under this Agreement.”  (Declaration of Dayton B. Parcells, III,
Exhibit 2.)  Plaintiff is therefore
entitled to recover fees Plaintiff incurred in prevailing on Plaintiff’s
contract claims against Defendant.  (See Santisas
v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 615.) 
However, Plaintiff’s billing records include substantial fees Plaintiff
incurred in defending against the claim of third-party claimant Sunwest
Bank.  Plaintiff is not entitled to
recover those fees from Defendant, as those fees do not stem from the contract
claims between Plaintiff and Defendant.  
 
Based upon the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
motion is continued to May 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  Plaintiff’s counsel may submit the following:
(1) An amended notice making clear how much Plaintiff is requesting relating to
the contractual claims between the parties; (2) A new declaration; (3) Billing
records in support of the new, reduced amount; and (4) Any other evidence in
support of the request.  Defendant may
file an opposition, and Plaintiff may file a reply brief, based upon statutory deadlines
associated with the new hearing date.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
