And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's first amended complaint (FAC) relating to punitive damages. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's allegations of malice, fraud, and oppression were conclusory and insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. However, the court found that the plaintiff's allegations were bolstered by other factual assertions in the FAC, including the defendant's alleged failure to remedy a leak issue and its refusal to remediate a health risk caused by mold resulting from the leaks. The court ruled that these facts could support a finding that the defendant acted maliciously in exhibiting a "willful and conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others." The court also noted that the defendant's argument concerning consequential damages for business interruption was not properly brought before the court, as it was not mentioned in the defendant's notice of motion.
