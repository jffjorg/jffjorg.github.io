And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute over the endorsement of a settlement check. The plaintiff, Melissa Rosapapan, is seeking to compel the defendant, D. Hess Panah, to endorse the check so that she can receive her settlement. The settlement check was made payable to Rosapapan, McElfish Law Firm, and Panah Law Firm, and McElfish has agreed to hold the balance of the settlement for attorney's fees in trust until there is an agreement between McElfish and Panah or the court has ordered a distribution.

The judge notes that California Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(d)(7) requires a lawyer to "promptly distribute, as requested by the client or other person, any undisputed funds or property in the possession of the lawyer or law firm that the client or other person is entitled to receive." However, the judge concludes that the plaintiff has cited no legal authority for the court to order specific performance pursuant to this rule.

The judge sets an Order to Show Cause re: dismissal of action with prejudice and what, if any, corrective action should be taken by the court in view of any violation of the California Rules of Professional Conduct. The parties are ordered to appear in person on October 13, 2023, and the Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal (Settlement) is advanced and vacated.

## English Summary:

The Court is considering a motion by Plaintiff Melissa Rosapapan to compel D. Hess Panah to endorse a settlement check. 

The case stems from a motor vehicle accident. Panah initially represented Rosapapan but McElfish Law Firm took over the case. 

A settlement was reached, and a check was issued to Rosapapan, McElfish Law Firm, and Panah Law Firm. Panah is refusing to endorse the check until an agreement is reached regarding the distribution of attorney's fees. 

Rosapapan argues that Panah's refusal violates California Rules of Professional Conduct 1.15(d)(7), which requires lawyers to promptly distribute undisputed funds. The Court acknowledges this rule but notes that Rosapapan has not provided legal authority for compelling specific performance under this rule.

The Court has scheduled an Order to Show Cause hearing for October 13, 2023, to determine if Panah's actions constitute a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct and what corrective action, if any, should be taken. Both Panah and McElfish are required to appear in person.

## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where Plaintiff Melissa Rosapapan is seeking to compel her former attorney, D. Hess Panah, to endorse a settlement check. The settlement check was made payable to Plaintiff, her current attorney (McElfish), and Panah. Panah is refusing to endorse the check until an agreement is reached regarding attorney's fees. Plaintiff argues that Panah is obligated to endorse the check under California Rules of Professional Conduct 1.15(d)(7), which requires lawyers to promptly distribute undisputed funds to clients.

However, the judge points out that Plaintiff has not cited any legal authority supporting the Court's ability to order specific performance under this rule.  

The judge has set an Order to Show Cause hearing for October 13, 2023, where both parties are required to appear. The court will consider whether to dismiss the action with prejudice and what corrective action, if any, should be taken against Panah for a potential violation of the California Rules of Professional Conduct.

The Judge's tentative ruling is concerning a motion for an order for specific performance of California Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(d)(7) by Plaintiff Melissa Rosapapan against Defendant D.
