And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute over the endorsement of a settlement check. The plaintiff, Melissa Rosapapan, is seeking to compel the defendant, D. Hess Panah, to endorse the check so that she can receive her settlement. The settlement check was made payable to Rosapapan, McElfish Law Firm, and Panah Law Firm, and McElfish has agreed to hold the balance of the settlement for attorney's fees in trust until there is an agreement between McElfish and Panah or the court has ordered a distribution.

The judge notes that California Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(d)(7) requires a lawyer to "promptly distribute, as requested by the client or other person, any undisputed funds or property in the possession of the lawyer or law firm that the client or other person is entitled to receive." However, the judge concludes that the plaintiff has cited no legal authority for the court to order specific performance pursuant to this rule.

The judge sets an Order to Show Cause re: dismissal of action with prejudice and what, if any, corrective action should be taken by the court in view of any violation of the California Rules of Professional Conduct. The parties are ordered to appear in person on October 13, 2023, and the Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal (Settlement) is advanced and vacated.
