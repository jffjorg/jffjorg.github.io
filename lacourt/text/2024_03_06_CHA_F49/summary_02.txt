And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's ex parte motion for trial preference under California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) section 36. The plaintiff, Joyce Elaine Bertoldo, is seeking to advance her case for trial due to her age (94 years old) and declining health. The Judge finds that the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the action and that her health condition necessitates a preference to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff has provided good cause for the ex parte application, as required by California Rules of Court rule 3.1335. The defendant, Atria Management Company, LLC, opposes the motion, arguing that an ex parte application is procedurally improper. However, the Judge finds that the application is authorized under C.C.P. section 36 and California Rules of Court rule 3.1335.
