Case    # 20CHCV00631      LOS  ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH  VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT  F49    MARCH 6, 2024    MOTION TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 20CHCV00631    Motion  filed: 2/7/24   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Mark A. Liker RESPONDING PARTY: none NOTICE: ok    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order compelling Defendant Roshmore Development Inc. (“Roshmore”) to comply  with the Court’s November 1, 2023, order compelling Roshmore to provide further  responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and  monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,760.00. Additionally, Plaintiff requests  monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,850.00 in the instant motion.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The motion  is GRANTED IN PART.    BACKGROUND   This  action arises out of a dispute regarding real property commonly known as 28212  Kelly Johnson Parkway #215 and #225 which are medical office suites.    On  October 15, 2020, Plaintiff Mark A. Liker (“Plaintiff”) filed the underlying  complaint in this action for Breach of Contract. On October 20, 2020, Plaintiff  served a Lis Pendens on Defendants/Cross-Complainants Roshmore and Cochran,  Inc. (collectively, “Cross-Complainants”), which he recorded on January 26,  2021. Subsequently, Plaintiff voluntarily withdrew the Lis Pendens.    On  April 2, 2021, Cross-Complainants filed their Cross-Complaint against  Cross-Defendants Mark A. Liker and Lucy Holdings, LLC (Cross-Defendants).  Subsequently, on August 3, 2023, Cross-Defendants filed operative First Amended  Cross-Complaint (“FACC”) for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Duty of  Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Indemnity, (4) Declaratory Relief, and (5) Negligence. On  November 1, 2023, the Department F47 Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel  Further Responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One,  and awarded Plaintiff sanctions in the amount of $2,760.00. (11/1/23 Minute  Order.)   On  February 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Compliance of  the Court’s November 1, 2023, Minute Order (the “Motion”).   On  February 20, 2024, the present case was assigned to Department F49.   No  opposing papers have been received.    ANALYSIS Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 contains the remedy for a  failure to obey an order compelling further response: Except as  provided in subdivision (j), if a party fails to obey an order compelling  further response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the  imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of, or in  addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (i).) The exception in subdivision (j) pertains to  electronically stored information that has been lost or damaged.  Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320 contains the remedy for a  party’s failure to produce responsive documents in accordance with its  responses to demands for production. It states, "If a party filing a  response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling . . .  thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in  accordance with that party's statement of compliance, the demanding party may  move for an order compelling compliance." (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320,  subd. (a).)         A.     Improperly Filing   Multiple motions should not be combined into a single filing.  (See Govt. Code § 70617(a)(4) (setting forth  the required filing fee for each motion, application, or any other paper or  request requiring a hearing); see also Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before  Trial, [8:1140.1] at 8F-60 (The Rutter Group 2011) (“Motions to compel  compliance with separate discovery requests ordinarily should be filed  separately.”))    As  a preliminary matter, Plaintiff improperly combined and filed four motions as a  single filing.  Plaintiff’s  instant Motion seeks orders from the Court to: (1) compel Roshmore’s compliance  with the Court’s November 1, 2023 order, (2) compel Roshmore’s responses to  Plaintiff’s subsequent Request for Production of Documents, Set Two (Requests  Nos. 1-7), (3) compel Roshmore’s responses to Plaintiff’s Special  Interrogatories, Set One (Interrogatories 1 – 26), and (4) compel Roshmore’s  responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. (Mot., at 4, 8.) Considering  that combining multiple motions under the guise of one motion with one hearing  reservation manipulates the Court Reservation System, unfairly advantages filer  over other litigants, and could result in the avoidance of paying separate  filing fees, the Court directs Plaintiff to obtain separate hearing  reservations and pay separate filing fees for each motion.   Accordingly,  the Court will proceed to review and rule only on the Motion to Compel Compliance,  as it is appropriately indicated in the motion’s title and a single filing fee  has been paid.    B.     Motion  to Compel Compliance     Here,  Plaintiff argues that as of the filing of the instant Motion, Roshmore has not  served any supplemental responses ordered by the Court, nor has Roshmore paid  monetary sanctions ordered in the amount of 2,760. (Arnold Decl., ¶ 20.) Furthermore,  Defendant Roshmore does not oppose Plaintiff’s instant Motion.    Under this record, Defendant Roshmore has not complied with  the Court’s November 1, 2023, order for failing to provide supplemental  responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One. (Request  Nos. 1-18.)   Additionally, Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions in the  amount of $3,850.00, comprising $2,850.00 in attorney’s fees incurred for the  instant Motion and an additional $1,000.00 sanction as per Code of Civil  Procedure section 2023.050 subdivision (a).   Regarding the attorney’s fees, Plaintiff’s counsel states  that they are calculated based on an hourly rate of $450.00, encompassing 4.2  hours in drafting the meet and confer emails and the instant Motion. The Court  deems the hourly rate to be reasonable; however, it adjusts the total hours to 2  hours by removing the hours spent on meet and confer and other improperly  combined motions, totaling $960.00. ($450.00/hr X 2 hrs for drafting the Motion  + $60 filing fee.)    Moreover, the Court finds that Defendant Roshmore’s failure  to comply with the Court’s November 1, 2023 order constitutes a lack of good  faith, highlighting Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.050, subdivision  (a)(1), which states, “The party, person, or attorney did not respond in good  faith to request for the production of documents made pursuant to Section 2020.010, 2020.410,  2020.510, or 2025.210, or to an inspection demand made pursuant to Section  2031.010.”   The Court considers subdivision (d) under the same section,  which mandates that “Sanctions pursuant to this section shall be imposed only  after notice to the party, person, or attorney against whom the sanction is  proposed to be imposed and opportunity for that party, person, or attorney to  be heard.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.050, subd. (d).) Accordingly, the Court  will hear Defendant’s arguments at the hearing to further decide on this  monetary sanction.                Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion to  Compel Compliance is GRANTED IN PART.   CONCLUSION   Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Compliance is GRANTED IN PART.    Defendant Roshmore is ordered to comply with the Court’s  November 1, 2023 Order to provide supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s Request  for Production of Documents, Set One (Request Nos. 1-18) and to pay monetary  sanction ordered in the amount of $2,760.00 within 10 days of receiving of this  order.   Defendant Roshmore and its counsel are further ordered to,  jointly and severally, pay Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $960.00.   Moving party is ordered to provide notice of this order.
