And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendant, County of Los Angeles, is sustained with leave to amend. The plaintiff, Victor Sonora, filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) on September 15, 2023, seeking damages for personal injuries and property damages resulting from an accident. The defendant filed a demurrer on February 5, 2024, arguing that the FAC lacks sufficient facts to establish a sole cause of action for motor vehicle liability.

The judge found that the defendant met all procedural requirements, including the meet and confer requirement, and that the demurrer was timely filed. The judge also found that the FAC lacks factual allegations or reasons for any specific statutory liability of a government entity, such as the defendant.

Therefore, the judge sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, ordering the plaintiff to file a Second Amended Complaint within 30 days. The judge also ordered the moving party to provide notice of this order.
