Ruben Eliezer Rivera Lopez v. City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles
Thursday,
 June 6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
MOTION
 TO APPOINT SUCCESSOR-IN-INTEREST
 
      The
complaint alleges claims for premises liability for injuries sustained by
Plaintiff, who fell on a sidewalk due to a dangerous condition. Lucia Lopez is
Plaintiff’s mother. Plaintiff died on August 7, 2023. Decedent was never
married and had one child, Sofia Lucia Rivera, who is a minor. Lucia Lopez
requests an order appointing her as successor-in-interest. No opposition has been
filed. 
      An
action for or against a decedent is not lost by reason of that person’s death. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.21.) The claims survive subject to the applicable
limitations period. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.20.) The court “shall allow a pending action or
proceeding that does not abate to be continued by the decedent's personal
representative or, if none, by the decedent's successor in interest pursuant to
a noticed motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.31.) 
      The
motion is adequately supported by Lucia Lopez, who submits a declaration and a copy
of the death certificate, stating the decedent’s name, date, and place of death.
(Lucia Lopez Decl. ., .pdf p. 4-5.) Ms. Lopez declares that no proceeding is
pending in California for administration of the decedent’s estate, that she is
decedent’s successor-in-interest, and that no other person has a superior right
to continue the decedent’s claims. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 377.32.)             
      Based
on the foregoing, the motion is GRANTED.
