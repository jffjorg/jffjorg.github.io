 Case Number:  22LBCV00071    Hearing Date:   January 11, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Complaint
in 22LBCV00071
Plaintiff LBCM, Inc. filed this
action against Defendant PAMC Services, Inc. on 2/17/22. Plaintiff alleges it
owned and operated a community association service building doing business as
CondoServices in Signal Hill, California. Plaintiff alleges the parties entered
into an asset purchase agreement on or about May 10, 2021 wherein Defendant
agreed to purchase certain assets relating to Plaintiff’s business for $900,000.
Plaintiff alleges Defendant has failed to make the final payment of $400,000.00
and to take on the obligations of the business, including equipment leases,
vendor contracts, office leases, and utilities. 

 
Plaintiff filed the operative Second
Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on 9/15/22, asserting causes of action for:
1.     Breach
of Written Contract
2.     Fraud
 
On 2/23/23, the Court sustained
Defendant’s demurrer to the fraud cause of action without leave to amend, finding
Plaintiff had failed to allege facts showing fraud in the inducement.  Specifically, the Court found all of the acts
Plaintiff alleged showed fraud in the inducement took place substantially AFTER
the parties entered into their contract, such that intent not to perform could
not be inferred from the doing of those acts. 
Plaintiff’s action against Defendant, at this time, sounds solely in
contract.
 
2.     Cross-Complaint
in 22LBCV00071
On 3/03/23, Defendant filed a cross-complaint
against Plaintiff.  The cross-complaint
includes causes of action for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, fraud
and deceit, and rescission.  The crux of
the cross-complaint is that PAMC purchased, from LBCM, 125 property management
contracts that existed between LBCM and 125 different common interest developments
for management of the property.  PAMC
alleges LBCM represented, during the course of the negotiations, that the
contracts were valid, enforceable, and did not need more than the usual
attention by a community association manager; additionally, LBCM represented
the business ran itself because the associations were all under contract and
did not need special attention.  However,
shortly after the parties closed the contract, PAMC learned that the
associations had myriad problems and management issues that required substantial
time to address and correct.  
 
On 7/20/23, Defendant filed its
operative FACC, which includes causes of action for breach of contract,
negligent misrepresentation, and fraud and deceit.  
3.     Complaint
in 23LBCV00100
Plaintiff, LBCM, Inc. filed
23LBCV00100 against Defendants, Gangitano Law, PC and Patrick Anthony Gangitano
for legal malpractice.  23LBCV00100
arises out of Defendants’ advice and representation of Plaintiff in connection with
business transactions that give rise to the events at issue in
22LBCV00071.  On 6/0823, the Court
granted Defendants’ motion to stay 23LBCV00100 pending the outcome of
22LBCV00071, finding any ability of LBCM to recover in 23LBCV00100 depends on
LBCM first sustaining damage in 22LBCV00071. 

 
4.     23CMCV00946

Plaintiff, San Tropez Homeowners Association filed 23CMCV00946 against
Defendants, PAMC and LBCM for conversion, breach of confidential relationship,
negligence, and unfair competition.  The crux
of the San Tropez complaint is that Plaintiff entered into a management agreement
with Tyler Management, Inc., which assigned the rights and obligations under
the agreement to LBCM, which in turn assigned the rights and obligations under the
agreement to PAMC; PAMC ultimately concluded the parties’ relationship, but
neither defendant has returned all of Plaintiff’s financial records and related
documents.

Law
Governing Consolidation
CCP §1048 grants discretion to the trial courts to consolidate actions
involving common questions of law or fact. 
The trial court's decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent a
clear showing of abuse of discretion. 
(Feliner v. Steinbaum (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 509, 511.)  A consolidation of actions does not affect
the rights of the parties.  The purpose
of consolidation is to avoid unnecessary costs or delay, avoid duplication of
procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common to both action, and avoid
inconsistent results by hearing and deciding common issues together.  (See Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d
471, 485.)  Each case presents its own
facts and circumstances, but the court generally considers the following: (1)
timeliness of the motion: i.e., whether granting consolidation would delay the
trial of any of the cases involved; (2) complexity: i.e., whether joining the
actions involved would make the trial too confusing or complex for a jury; and
(3) prejudice: i.e, whether consolidation would adversely affect the rights of
any party. (See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47
Cal.2d 428, 430–431.)  In deciding
whether to grant a motion to consolidate, the court should weigh whether the
common issues predominate over the individual issues and whether any risks of
jury confusion or prejudice to the parties outweighs the reduction in time and
expense that would result from consolidation. (Todd-Stenberg v. Shield (1996)
48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978.)  
 
Consolidation is a procedure for uniting separate lawsuits for trial,
where they involve common questions of law or fact and are pending in the same
court.  (See CCP § 1048.)  The purpose is to enhance trial court
efficiency (i.e., to avoid unnecessary duplication of evidence and procedures);
and to avoid the substantial danger of inconsistent adjudications (i.e.,
different results because tried before different juries, or a judge and jury, etc.).  (See Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield Claimants
Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978–979.) 

 
A consolidation of actions does not affect the rights of the
parties.  The purpose of consolidation is
merely to promote trial convenience and economy by avoiding duplication of
procedure, particularly in the proof of issues common to both actions.  (See Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d
471, 485.)  In deciding whether to grant
a motion to consolidate, the court should weigh whether the common issues predominate
over the individual issues and whether any risks of jury confusion or prejudice
to the parties outweighs the reduction in time and expense that would result
from consolidation. (Todd-Stenberg v. Shield (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976,
978.)  
 
Procedurally, CRC Rule 3.350 provides as follows:
(a) Requirements of motion
(1) A notice of motion to consolidate must:
(A) List all named parties in each case, the names of those who have
appeared, and the names of their respective attorneys of record;
(B) Contain the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated,
with the lowest numbered case shown first; and
                                    (C) Be filed in each case sought to
be consolidated.
(2) The motion to consolidate:
            …
(B) Must be served on all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented
parties in all of the cases sought to be consolidated; and
                                    (C) Must have a proof of service
filed as part of the motion.
…

Analysis
a.     Procedural Issues
As an initial note, LBCM did not file its motion to consolidate in each
of the three cases to be consolidated; it filed the moving papers only in
22LBCV00071.  The motion is denied on
this procedural ground.  The Court,
however, will also consider the merits of the motion, as LBCM would likely
re-file the motion and correct the procedural deficiency absent a substantive
ruling.
 
Additionally, while the proof of service indicates LBCM served the
attorney defendants with the moving papers, the attorney defendants contend, in
opposition to the motion, that they were not served with the moving
papers.  It is not clear whether LBCM was
served.  Again, the Court will rule on the
motion despite any procedural error, as the attorney defendants were able to
fully brief the merits of the motion in their opposition papers.  
 
b.     Substantive Analysis
On the merits, the motion to consolidate 22LBCV00071 with 23LBCV00946
is nonsensical.  23LBCV00946 has been
stayed pending the outcome of 22LBCV00071. 
If the two cases were consolidated, this would undo the stay order.  The stay order, however, is necessary,
because 23LBCV00946 will not be ripe for determination unless and until
22LBCV00071 concludes in PAMC’s favor.  
 
The Court also finds consolidation of 22LBCV00071 with 23CMCV00946 is
not warranted.  23CMCV00946, at its core,
is about LBCM and PAMC’s failure to return financial records to San
Tropez.  This issue can be determined
regardless of the outcome of the litigation between LBCM and PAMC.  Notably, 22LBCV00071 is likely to go to trial
well before 23CMCV00946, which is still at the pleading stage and will be for
at least another nine months.  A resolution
of 22LBCV00071 is likely, if anything, to assist the parties in resolving
23CMCV00946 without the need for a trial. 

 
The motion is therefore denied for both procedural and substantive
reasons.  
 
8.     Case
Management Conference
The parties are reminded that there
is a CMC on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the motion to
consolidate.  The Court asks Counsel to
make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing on the motion and the CMC.
