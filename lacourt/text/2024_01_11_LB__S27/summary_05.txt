And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion brought by Randy Taylor, Reyna Taylor, and Steve Hawrylack to apply Stephen Forde's rights to their judgment lien. The motion seeks to apply the full amount of the judgment, including attorneys' fees and costs, against the lien. Forde and his attorneys, Buchalter, oppose the motion, arguing that their attorney lien is senior to the moving parties' lien.

The judge has considered the arguments and has decided to grant the motion in part. The judge finds that Forde's rights to collect $207,212.96 in connection with the judgment must be applied toward satisfaction of the moving parties' lien. The judge also orders the Court Clerk to endorse a statement on the amended judgment indicating the existence of the subject lien at the time it was created.

The judge has set a hearing for six months from now to determine the status of establishing Buchalter's lien. The judge has also ordered the moving parties to give notice of the ruling.
