Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's (SCE) motion to strike the plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages. The plaintiffs have alleged that SCE's pattern and practice of ignoring its obligation to remedy safety issues with its equipment led to the electrical explosion and fire in the underground high-voltage vault, which injured one of the plaintiffs. The judge found that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts that, if proven, could lead a juror to conclude that SCE acted in a manner that shows willful disregard for their safety. The judge also found that the pattern and practice alleged could be found, by a reasonable juror, to be despicable. Therefore, the motion to strike is denied, and SCE is ordered to file an answer to the Second Amended Complaint within ten days.
