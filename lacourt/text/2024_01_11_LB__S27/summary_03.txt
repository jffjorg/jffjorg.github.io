And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate three cases: 22LBCV00071, 23LBCV00100, and 23CMCV00946. The motion to consolidate is denied for both procedural and substantive reasons. The Judge notes that the motion was not filed in each of the three cases, and that the proof of service is unclear. Additionally, the Judge finds that the cases do not have common questions of law or fact that would warrant consolidation. The Judge also notes that one of the cases, 23CMCV00946, has been stayed pending the outcome of 22LBCV00071, and that consolidating the cases would undo the stay order. The Judge concludes that the cases should be tried separately, and that a resolution of 22LBCV00071 may assist the parties in resolving the other two cases without the need for a trial.
