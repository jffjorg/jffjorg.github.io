And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has considered the motions for summary judgment or adjudication filed by defendant Erdelji and the City. The court finds that there are triable issues of material fact concerning whether Erdelji was acting as a supervisor and also whether his complained-of conduct was sufficiently severe and pervasive to support a claim for harassment.

The court also finds that the City is strictly liable for its supervisory employee's harassing conduct. The court denies both motions for summary judgment or adjudication.

The parties are ordered to give notice of this tentative ruling. If the parties intend to submit on this tentative, they must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
