And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrers of defendants Michael R. Jones and Laura Survant, as well as Priya Uppuluri and Eman G. Youssef, are sustained. This means that the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint is granted. The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff's complaint is fatally uncertain as to all four demurring defendants. Specifically, the complaint fails to clearly state what claims are being made against the defendants, making it impossible for them to respond to the complaint. The judge also notes that several of the plaintiff's causes of action are only available against employers, not individual supervisors or agents of employers. The judge has given the defendants 20 days to amend their complaint to address these issues.
