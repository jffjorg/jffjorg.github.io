And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering defendant Zhan Liu's motion to set aside a default judgment entered against her. The judgment was entered in an action alleging a default on a $500,000 loan. The defendant argues that the judgment was the result of extrinsic fraud, specifically that she did not receive notice of the lawsuit because her husband, Moses Wong, orchestrated the loan in her name for his own purposes. The defendant presents evidence that she was in China at the time of service and did not receive notice of the lawsuit, and that her mother received the mail at her property and forwarded it to Moses Wong.

The judge finds that the defendant has met her burden of showing that the default judgment resulted from extrinsic fraud. The judge notes that the defendant presents prima facie evidence that plaintiff, through Moses Wong, knew that the defendant was in China when the summons was served, and that the manner of service used would result in the summons and complaint being forwarded to Moses Wong instead of the defendant.

The judge also finds that the defendant has shown a meritorious defense, a satisfactory excuse for not defending the lawsuit, and has acted with diligence in seeking to set aside the default judgment.

Finally, the judge notes that setting aside the default judgment would not cause significant prejudice to the plaintiff, and that the potential prejudice to the defendant far outweighs any prejudice to the plaintiff.

Accordingly, the judge grants the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment and vacates the default and default judgment entered against the defendant. The defendant is ordered to file her proposed answer forthwith.
