Claimant

Claimant
Travon Smith Jr., a minor, by and through guardian ad litem Travon Smith Sr., has
agreed to settle claims against Defendant “Williams Trust” in exchange for $9,166.66.  No deductions will be taken from Claimant’s funds.  If approved, the funds will be deposited into
a blocked account, subject to withdrawal only upon authorization of the court.
Claimant
Kordae Mohamed, a minor, by and through guardian ad litem Renee Mohamed, has agreed
to settle claims against Defendant “Williams Trust” in exchange for $9,166.66.  No deductions will be taken from Claimant’s funds.  If approved, the funds will be deposited into
a blocked account, subject to withdrawal only upon authorization of the court.
Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The Court has reviewed
the proposed settlement and finds that it may be fair and reasonable.  However, there is no Defendant named “Williams
Trust.”  If the settlements are with Defendants
Eloise Williams (as trustee of the Williams Trust Dated August 2, 1988) and/or Gaylord
Williams (as trustee of the Williams Trust Dated August 2, 1988), the Petitions
should accurately state so.  Additionally,
the proposed orders are incomplete and do not include the settlement amounts in
all required areas.
Accordingly,
the Petitions to Approve Minor’s Compromises are CONTINUED to October 10, 2024 at
8:30 a.m.
Petitioners
are ordered to file Revised Petitions and Revised Proposed Orders no later than
September 26, 2024.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
