And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the proposed settlement of minor's claims and finds that it may be fair and reasonable. However, there is an error in the naming of the defendant, which is incorrectly referred to as "Williams Trust". The proposed orders are also incomplete and do not include the settlement amounts in all required areas. Therefore, the petitions to approve minor's compromises are continued to October 10, 2024, and the parties are ordered to file revised petitions and proposed orders no later than September 26, 2024.
