And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash the Doe amendments filed by Armistead and Romac, defendants in a lawsuit brought by General Industrial Repair against Per Partners Limited LP and others. The lawsuit stems from a lease agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant Per Partners Limited LP, which was allegedly terminated prematurely by Per Partners. The Plaintiff added Armistead and Romac as defendants through Doe amendments, which defendants argue should be quashed because the Plaintiff knew of their identities prior to filing the complaint.

The judge finds that the Plaintiff was genuinely ignorant of Armistead and Romac for purposes of Section 474 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which allows for the use of fictitious names in pleadings. The judge concludes that the Plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence in seeking to ascertain the relationship between Per Partners and the Doe Defendants, and that the Plaintiff did not unreasonably delay filing the Doe amendments. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to quash the Doe amendments.
