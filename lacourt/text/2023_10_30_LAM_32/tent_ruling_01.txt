  order RE:
motion to quash doe amendments 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On September 23, 2021, Plaintiff
General Industrial Repair filed a complaint against Defendants Per Partners
Limited LP, David B. Rosenfield, and Angelina A. Rosenfield alleging the
following causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing; (3) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
(4) intentional misrepresentation; and (5) negligent misrepresentation. 
            The dispute arises from a lease agreement
between Plaintiff and Defendant Per Partners Limited LP. Defendant David
Rosenfield is allegedly a general partner of Per Partners. Plaintiff leased a
business premises from Per Partners starting in October 2007. The lease was a
five-year lease, but the parties agreed to a five-year extension in October
2012, extending the lease to October 2017. Plaintiff alleges that around
September 2017, the parties entered into another five-year extension that
extended the lease to October 2022. Defendants did not sign this second
extension agreement, but Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Angie Rosenfield
assured Plaintiff that if Plaintiff became current on rent payments and made
certain repairs, the lease would be extended to 2022. Plaintiff allegedly
relied on this representation to continue paying rent and making additional improvements
to the premises. 
            In June 2021, Defendant David
Rosenfield notified Plaintiff that Defendant Per Partners was terminating the
lease. Per Partners apparently deemed the lease to be a month-to-month contract
despite the alleged extension to 2022. Plaintiff’s breach of contract and fraud
claims stem from the premature termination of the lease and Defendants’
misrepresentations that the lease would be extended to 2022. 
            On February 10, 2022, Per Partners filed
a cross-complaint against Plaintiff and its principal, alleging breach of
contract, damage to real property, conversion, negligence, private nuisance,
and declaratory relief.  
            On July 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed
amendments to the complaint adding Armistead & Companies, Ltd. and Romac
Supply Co., Inc. as defendants. 
            On September 29, 2023, Armistead and
Romac filed the instant motion to quash the Doe amendments. Plaintiff filed its
opposition on October 17, 2023. Defendants filed their reply on October 23,
2023.  
LEGAL STANDARD
 “When
the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant, he must state that fact
in the complaint . . . and such defendant may be designated in any pleading or
proceeding by any name, and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or
proceeding must be amended accordingly.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 474.) “For this
rule to apply, it is necessary that the plaintiff actually be ignorant of the
name or identity of the fictitiously named defendant at the time the complaint
is filed.” (Hazel v. Hewlett (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1458, 1464.) Moreover,
“unreasonable delay in filing an amendment after actually acquiring such
knowledge can bar a plaintiff's resort to the fictitious name procedure.” (A.N.
v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1058, 1065.) “Improper
service of a defendant under section 474 may be attacked by a motion to quash.”
(McClatchy v. Coblentz, Patch, Duffy & Bass, LLP (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th
368, 375.) 
DISCUSSION
            For purposes of Section 474, a plaintiff
is considered “ignorant of the name of a defendant” if the plaintiff either is
ignorant of the defendant’s identity, or is ignorant of the facts giving rise to
liability against the defendant. (San Diego Navy Broadway Complex Coalition
v. California Coastal Com. (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 563, 579; Snoke v. Bolen (1991) 235
Cal.App.3d 1427, 1431.) 
Defendants argue that the Doe amendments
should be quashed because Plaintiffs have known of Defendants’ identities since
before the complaint was filed. Defendants point to documents produced in
discovery. (Bubman Decl., Ex. A.) One is a 2017 letter between Plaintiff and
Defendant David Rosenfield identifying Rosenfield as the president and CEO of
Romac. An April 2021 correspondence identifies Defendant Angie Rosenfield as
the office/credit manager for Romac. Romac’s address on both correspondences is
the same as that for Defendant Per Partners. Furthermore, a June 2021 letter contains
a heading titled “Rosenfield Family, Per Partners & Armistead Companies”
and lists the same address. Plaintiff also propounded discovery regarding
Armistead, which Defendants argue proves Plaintiff’s knowledge of Armistead. 
Defendants’ argument only focuses on
Plaintiff’s knowledge of Defendants’ identities. However, as discussed above,
ignorance for purposes of Section 474 also includes ignorance of the facts
giving rise to liability. Section 474 does not require a plaintiff to name an
individual or entity as a defendant if the basis for liability is unknown. 
Here, Plaintiff exercised reasonable
diligence in seeking to ascertain the relationship between Per Partners and the
Doe Defendants. Plaintiff propounded discovery, which was objected to, and then
a motion to compel was denied. (Hong Decl. ¶¶ 9, 12.) Plaintiff thereafter
continued his investigation, which eventually revealed that Armistead and Romac
were part of a larger organization involved in the sale of the subject
property. (Id., ¶ 14.) 
The Court finds that Plaintiff was
genuinely ignorant of Armistead and Romac for purposes of Section 474. The
Court does not find that Plaintiff unreasonably delayed filing the Doe
amendments or that Defendants will suffer prejudice. Defendants cite no
authority for their proposition that relation-back constitutes prejudice. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion to quash is
DENIED.
