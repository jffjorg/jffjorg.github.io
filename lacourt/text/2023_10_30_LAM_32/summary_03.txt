And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the foreclosure proceedings. The judge noted that there was no proof of service indicating service of the complaint to any defendant, and that the motion was improperly served via mail. Additionally, the judge ruled that a corporation cannot represent itself in court, and that the entities that allegedly own the subject property have no authority to file the motion. The judge also found that the motion failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success, and that any one of the reasons discussed would warrant denial of the motion.
