     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary
  injunction 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On September 27, 2023, Plaintiffs 26
Global Development, Inc.; Shaul Arbib; 600 Clinton Pl., LLC; and Yanit Z.
Ibrahimian filed this action against Defendants The Evergreen Advantage, LLC;
FCI Lender Services, Inc.; California TD Specialists; Qualfax, Inc.; RTI
Properties, Inc.; and Peak Foreclosure Services, Inc. The complaint asserts
causes of action for (1) accounting, (2) injunctive relief, and (3) breach of
contract. 
            The action concerns a property
located in Beverly Hills. Although Plaintiffs admittedly defaulted on a loan secured
by the property, the complaint alleges that Defendants failed to properly
account for payments made and initiated foreclosure proceedings without discussing
alternatives as required by law. Defendants also allegedly raised improper fees
and charges toward the loan principal. 
            On October 3, 2023, Plaintiffs filed
the instant motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the foreclosure
proceedings. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is
to preserve the status quo pending final resolution upon a trial. (See¿Scaringe¿v.¿J.C.C.
Enterprises, Inc.¿(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536.) A trial court deciding whether
to issue an injunction weighs two interrelated factors—the likelihood the
moving party will prevail on the merits at trial and the relative balance of
interim harms that are likely to result from the granting or denial of
preliminary injunctive relief. (White v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528,
554; Cohen v. Board of Supervisors (1985) 40 Cal.3d 277, 286.) “Generally,
the ruling on an application for a preliminary injunction rests in the sound
discretion of the trial court.” (Cohen, supra, 40 Cal.3d at p. 286.) 
DISCUSSION
            First, the Court notes that there is
no proof of service indicating service of the complaint to any defendant. The instant
motion has also been improperly served via mail because the defendants have not
appeared in the case. 
            Additionally, “[a] corporation
cannot represent itself in court, either in propria persona or through an
officer or agent who is not an attorney.” (Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v.
Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 729.) Therefore, the entity Plaintiffs,
the alleged owners of the subject property, have no authority to file this
motion. The entities cannot be represented by non-lawyer representatives such
as a CEO or agent. Therefore, the inclusion of Arbib and Ibrahimian as
plaintiffs does not redress the issue.
Lastly, the motion does not include any
evidence demonstrating a likelihood of success. (See Costa Mesa City
Employees Assn. v. City of Costa Mesa (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 298, 309.) 
In sum, the motion fails on both
procedural and substantive grounds. Any one of the reasons discussed above
would warrant denial of the motion. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary
injunction is DENIED.
