ANALYSIS: 
 
On September 11, 2020, Plaintiff
Leonard R. Tyler (“Plaintiff”) filed this
motor vehicle action against Defendants Noa Estrada and Jose Vargas
Guzman (“Defendants”). On December 4, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’
discovery motions and ordered Plaintiff
to serve responses to interrogatories and
requests for production, and to
pay sanctions within 20 days. (Minute Order, 12/04/23.) Defendants filed the instant Motion
for Terminating Sanctions on March
14, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative, Inc. v.
Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) The court should
look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating
sanctions are appropriate. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful
discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as
severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with
discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad
faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) “The court
may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 
(1)   An
order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.
 
(2)   An
order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed.
 
(3)   An
order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party.
 
(4)   An
order rendering a judgment by default against that party.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)
 
Discussion
 
The Court granted Defendants’ motions
to compel Plaintiff’s responses to interrogatories and requests for production,
and requests for sanctions on December 4, 2023. (Minute Order, 12/04/23;
Motion, Flowers Decl., Exh. A.) Defendant served Plaintiff with Notice of the
Ruling two days later. (Motion, Flowers
Decl., ¶3.) To date, Plaintiff has not complied with the order to serve
responses or pay sanctions. (Id. at ¶¶4-7.) 
 
The Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted for
Plaintiff’s non-compliance with the discovery order. Despite notice of the
Court’s ruling, Plaintiff failed to serve responses as ordered. Nor has
Plaintiff filed an opposition to this noticed motion. This demonstrates that
compliance with the Court’s orders cannot be achieved through lesser sanctions.
Although terminating sanctions are a harsh penalty, “[t]he court [is] not
required to allow a pattern of abuse to continue ad infinitum.” (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 280.) 
 
Monetary sanctions are also warranted for Plaintiff’s
non-compliance with the Court’s order to respond to discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (g).) Sanctions of $360.00 are awarded to Defendants
against Plaintiff in connection with the instant Motion based on two hours of
attorney time billed at $150.00 and $60.00 in filing fees. (Motion, Flowers
Decl., ¶8.)
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Noa Estrada and Jose
Vargas Guzman’s Motion for
Terminating and Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED.
PLAINTIFF LEONARD R. TYLER’S COMPLAINT,
FILED ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2020, IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. THE REQUEST FOR
MONETARY SANCTIONS IS GRANTED AGAINST PLAINTIFF LEONARD R. TYLER IN THE AMOUNT
OF $360.00, TO BE PAID WITHIN 20 DAYS OF NOTICE OF THIS ORDER.
