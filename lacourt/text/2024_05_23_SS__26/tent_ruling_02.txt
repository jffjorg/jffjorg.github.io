ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Joshua
Rogers (“Rogers”) filed the instant action against Defendants Torino Carr
(“Defendant Carr”) and Adriana Oh (erroneously sued as Andrea Oh) (“Defendant
Oh”) on August 23, 2021. The Complaint asserted causes of action for breach of
contract and common counts. On December 28, 2021, Plaintiff filed the First
Amended Complaint, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, fraud,
unjust enrichment, and theft by false pretense. On April 15, 2022, the Court
sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the First Amended Complaint to the cause of
action for theft by false pretense without leave to amend, and the fraud cause
of action with leave to amend. (Minute Order, 04/15/22.) The demurrer to the
causes of action for breach of contract and unjust enrichment was overruled. (Ibid.)

 
Plaintiff filed
the Second Amended Complaint on May 9, 2022. On August 8, 2022, the Court
sustained Defendants’ demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint without leave to
amend as to the fraud cause of action. (Minute Order, 08/08/22.) Defendants
filed an answer to the Second Amended Complaint on August 29, 2022. On February
21, 2024, the Court partially granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File
Third Amended Complaint by allowing the substitution of Envitae, an
unincorporated association, as the plaintiff and dismissing Defendant Adriana
Oh. (Minute Order, 02/21/24.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the Third Amended Complaint on February 29,
2024 and the instant Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on March 15, 2024. Defendants
filed an opposition on May 10, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
The Third Amended Complaint and Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings were filed by Rogers despite the plaintiff in this action now being
Envitae, an unincorporated association. It is black letter law that a
corporation cannot represent itself in court. (Clean Air Transport Systems
v. San Mateo County Transit Dist. (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 576, 578 (citing Merco
Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 729-730).)
This rule applies to all entities regarded as separate from their owners, including
partnerships and unincorporated associations. (See Clean Air Transport
Systems, supra, 19 Cal.App.3d at 578.) Plaintiff filed both the Third
Amended Complaint and Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings without proper legal
representation. 
 
Plaintiff moves for judgment on
the pleadings pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 438, pursuant to
which the parties are required to meet and confer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 438,
439.) The Motion is accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, as required.
(Motion, Rogers Decl., ¶4.) In addition to being improperly brought by a
non-attorney, the Motion is not timely under the moving statute. Code of Civil
Procedure section 438 states: “No motion may be made pursuant to this section
if a pretrial conference order has been entered pursuant to Section 575, or
within 30 days of the date the action is initially set for trial, whichever is
later, unless the court otherwise permits.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.
(e).) This action was initially set for trial on February 21, 2023 but the
Motion was not filed until February 27, 2024. The Court may permit a motion for
judgment on the pleadings after this time but declines to do so in this
situation. The trial in this action has been continued multiple times and the
instant Motion further delays it. Defendants previously filed an answer to the
pleadings in August 2022 with no move by Rogers for judgment on the pleadings
at that time. An unexplained delay of almost two years is grounds to deny leave
to bring the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings at this time. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Envitae’s Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED. TRIAL IS CONTINUED TO JULY 23, 2024 AT
8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
 
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE: LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR PLAINTIFF ENVITAE IS SET
FOR JUNE 23, 2024 AT 9:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
