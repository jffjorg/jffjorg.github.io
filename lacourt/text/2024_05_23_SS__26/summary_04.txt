And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to vacate the entry of default. The default was entered on March 5, 2024, after the defendant failed to file a responsive pleading. The defendant moved to vacate the entry of default on April 4, 2024, citing excusable neglect due to the defendant's attorney, Richard H. Lee, not being informed of the requests for entry of default. The court finds that the defendant's neglect was excusable, and therefore grants the motion. The default is vacated, and the defendant is ordered to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 20 days of the order.
