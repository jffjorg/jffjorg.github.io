Additionally, the court has set an order to show cause regarding the legal representation for plaintiff Envitae, an unincorporated association, for June 23, 2024. The court has determined that the motion for judgment on the pleadings was improperly brought by a non-attorney and that it was not timely under the moving statute. The court has also noted that a corporation cannot represent itself in court and that a non-attorney cannot file a motion for judgment on the pleadings.
