And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling granted the defendants' motion for terminating and monetary sanctions. The plaintiff, Leonard R. Tyler, failed to comply with a court order to serve responses to interrogatories and requests for production, and to pay sanctions. As a result, the court dismissed the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice and awarded the defendants monetary sanctions in the amount of $360.00. The court found that terminating sanctions were warranted due to the plaintiff's willful failure to comply with the court's orders. The court also granted the defendants' request for monetary sanctions, which was based on two hours of attorney time billed at $150.00 and $60.00 in filing fees.
