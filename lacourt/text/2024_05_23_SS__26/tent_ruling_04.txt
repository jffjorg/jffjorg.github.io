ANALYSIS:
 
On January 24, 2023, Plaintiff Kari Whitman Interiors, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action against Defendant The Wood Soul By Lilicales (“Defendant”).
Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive pleading, Plaintiff obtained
its default on March 5, 2024.  
 
On April 4, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to
Vacate Default. Plaintiff filed an opposition on May 10, 2024 and Defendant
replied on May 16, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to vacate the entry of
default pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). Under
this statute, an application for relief must be made no more than six months
after entry of the order from which relief is sought, and must be accompanied
by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.)
The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the moving defendant’s
proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be corrected
if Defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the hearing date. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 393, 403.) 
 
A request for relief
under the discretionary prong, based on party fault, must not only be made
within six months of entry of default but also within a reasonable time. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) The Motion was timely filed less than two months
after entry of default and is supported by a declaration of fault from Defendant’s
owner, Liliana Milton, who states she contacted an attorney, Richard H. Lee
(“Attorney Lee”), to undertake legal representation for Defendant in May 2023.
(Motion, Milton Decl., ¶3.) When served with a request for default in January
2024, Milton reached out to Attorney Lee and was informed he was no longer
representing Defendant. (Id. at ¶4.) This declaration is sufficient to
demonstrate excusable neglect by Defendant. Although Defendant was served with
a request for entry of default in July 2023, Milton’s failure to reach out to
Attorney Lee at that time did not amount to inexcusable neglect, as Plaintiff
argues. It was reasonable for Milton to assume Attorney Lee was in communication
with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the matter, whom she had hired just two
months prior. The Motion is also accompanied by a copy of Defendant’s proposed
answer. (Motion, Lee Decl., Exh. C.) As all the requirements for relief from
the default under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) have
been demonstrated, the Motion on these grounds is granted.
 
Furthermore, Plaintiff’s
counsel’s failure to inform Attorney Lee of the requests for entry of default served
on Defendant in July and December 2023 is a separate basis to vacate the
default. The Court of Appeals explains:
 
[I]t is
now well-acknowledged that an attorney has an ethical obligation to warn
opposing counsel that the attorney is about to take an adversary's default.
(Id. at pp. 701-702, 84 Cal.Rptr.3d 351.)
 
In that
regard we heartily endorse the related admonition found in The Rutter Group
practice guide, and we note the authors' emphasis on reasonable time: “Practice
Pointer: If you're representing plaintiff, and have had any contact with a
lawyer representing defendant, don't even attempt to get a default entered
without first giving such lawyer written notice of your intent to request entry
of default, and a reasonable time within which defendant's pleading must be
filed to prevent your doing so.” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2008) § 5:73, p. 5-19 (rev. #1, 2008)
as quoted in Fasuyi, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 702, 84 Cal.Rptr.3d 351.)
 
(Lasalle v. Vogel
(2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 127, 135.) Plaintiff’s counsel should have informed
Attorney Lee of its attempts to obtain Defendant’s default before submitting
the requests to the Court.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant The Wood Soul By Lilicales’
Motion to Vacate Entry of Default is GRANTED. THE DEFAULT ENTERED ON MARCH 5,
2024 IS VACATED. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE THE ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT
WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
