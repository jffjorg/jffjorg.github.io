In this case, Plaintiff/Judgment Debtor LINDA MAULTSBY
(“Plaintiff”) seeks damages against MARCEL BRUETSCH, CAPITALBENEFIT, INC., MURAL

ELKINS, ELKINS FAMILY REVOCABLE TRUST OF 2002, LAWRENCE C. HENIG, D.D.S., INC.
(“Defendants”) who allegedly fraudulently induced Plaintiff into loan
modification agreements regarding the loan on Plaintiff’s apartment property at
4757 S. Mansfield, Los Angeles, CA 90026. 
Defendant/Judgment Creditor Mural Media, LLC 401k Plan
(“Defendant Mural”) obtained an award of sanctions against Plaintiff, which the
Court reduced to a judgment in November 2023. In connection with that judgment,
Defendant Mural served discovery on Plaintiff. Defendant Mural now moves for an
order compelling initial responses from Plaintiff, without objections, as to special
interrogatories, set one, and requests for production, set one. Defendant Mural
also requests sanctions ($2,040.00 for each motion) against Plaintiff and
counsel. The motions are based on the ground that Plaintiff failed to serve any
responses. No opposition has been filed as to the motions.
A motion to compel initial discovery responses need
only show that discovery was properly served on the opposing party, the time to
respond expired, and no response was served. Leach v. Sup. Ct. (1980)
111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-06; Code Civ. Proc., §2030.290. Defendant Mural has
demonstrated that it served Plaintiff with the document requests and
interrogatories in October 2023, but Plaintiff has thus far failed to serve any
responses. Nor has Plaintiff filed any opposition to the motions to compel. 
The Court therefore grants the unopposed motions. Plaintiff
shall serve verified responses, without objections, to the document requests
and special interrogatories no later than 4/5/2024. There is no justification
for Plaintiff’s failure to respond to discovery, let alone any substantial
justification for doing so. Indeed, Plaintiff does not even oppose these
motions. The Court therefore orders Plaintiff to pay $2,040.00 per motion, for
a total of $4,080.00.
