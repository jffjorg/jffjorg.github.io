And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ruling on two motions filed by Defendant Mural Media, LLC 401k Plan (Defendant Mural). The motions are to compel Plaintiff Linda J. Maultsby to respond to discovery requests and to impose sanctions on Plaintiff and her counsel. Defendant Mural served discovery requests on Plaintiff in October 2023, but Plaintiff has failed to respond. The judge finds that Defendant Mural has demonstrated that it properly served the requests and that Plaintiff has failed to respond, despite the requests being served over two months ago. The judge grants the unopposed motions and orders Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests by April 5, 2024. The judge also imposes sanctions on Plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $4,080.00. The judge notes that there is no justification for Plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery and that Plaintiff does not even oppose the motions.
