And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of plaintiff Louis Hook to quash a deposition subpoena issued by the defendants. Hook's motion is based on two grounds: the defendants failed to serve him with a "Notice to Consumer" required by Code of Civil Procedure Section 1985.6, and the defendants did not properly serve him with notice of the deposition subpoena served on Jennifer Cooper. However, the judge finds that the first ground is not applicable because Hook was not an employee of Cooper's, and the second ground is not valid because the defendants complied with the applicable requirements of Section 2025.410. The judge also declines the defendants' request for monetary sanctions against Hook for filing the motion, finding that Hook had a good faith basis for doing so.
