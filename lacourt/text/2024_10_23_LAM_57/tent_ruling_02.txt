 Case Number:  23STCV24094    Hearing Date:   October 23, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is denying the motion of Plaintiff Louis Hook to quash a Deposition Subpoena ("the Subpoena") that the Defendants issued to Jennifer Cooper ("Cooper"), formerly a third-party human resource manager for the Defendants.   Hook's motion to quash is based on two grounds.  First, the Defendants failed to serve on Hook the "Notice to Consumer" that is required under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1985.6.  Second, the Defendants did not properly serve Hook with the the notice of the Subpoena that was served on Cooper. Neither ground is availing.  The Notice to Consumer requirement of Section 1985.6 is inapplicable because Hook was not an employee of Cooper's. In fact, Hook's own declaration in support of the motion states that Cooper reported to Hook during Cooper's tenure as a third-party human resource manager for the Defendants.  The Defendants' service of the notice of the Subpoena that was served on Cooper complied with the applicable requirements of Section 2025.410.The Court is declining Defendants' request that the Court impose monetary sanctions against Hook for filing the motion to quash.  In  reaching that conclusion, the Court was persuaded by the arguments in the reply brief of Hook in support of this motion as to the justification for filing the motion.  In the Court's view, those arguments refute the Defendants'  proposition that Hook lacked a good faith basis to file the motion.
