[1] The initial burden,
and Defendant’s burden, is to establish that a valid contract governs. (See Rosenthal v. Great W. Fin. Sec. Corp., 14 Cal.4th 394, 413, 58 Cal.Rptr.2d 875, 926 P.2d
1061 (1996) [The burden of proving the existence of an agreement
to arbitrate by a preponderance of the evidence rests on the moving party].)
 


[2] Plaintiff’s
evidentiary objections (to the submission of the warranty manual and portion of
Defense Counsel’s declaration) are overruled. As or the request for judicial notice (RJN), that
is granted. However, the appellate decisions in Martha Ochoa v. Ford Motor
Company (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 and Mark Kielar v. Hyundai Motor America
(Case No. C096773; Superior Court No. S-CV-0048230) are inapposite because Ochoa
is on appeal to the California Supreme Court. Under well-settled principles of
stare decisis, the superior courts are bound by all published decisions of the
Court of Appeal, but they are free to choose which appellate decision to follow when
faced with a split in authority. (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 456 [when “appellate decisions are in conflict” a “court exercising inferior jurisdiction can and
must make a choice between the conflicting decisions”]; accord, Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (2013)
218 Cal.App.4th 96, 101, fn. 7; McCallum v. McCallum (1987)
190 Cal.App.3d 308, 315, fn. 4.)  


[3] Here, Defendant HMA
has provided this warranty directly to Plaintiff in connection with his
purchase of the vehicle, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Warranty
which contain a binding arbitration provision. As such, HMA has standing to
compel arbitration under the Warranty. 


[4] Effectively, the court
need not address equitable estoppel as the alternative method of enforcing the
agreement.
