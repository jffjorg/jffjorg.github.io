And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Hyundai Motor America's motion to compel binding arbitration in this lemon law case. The plaintiff, Ben Su, purchased a 2022 Hyundai IONIQ 5 from Puente Hills Hyundai, LLC and filed a lawsuit against Hyundai Motor America and Puente Hills Hyundai, LLC alleging violation of the Song-Beverly Act, breach of express and implied warranties, and negligent repair.

The judge finds that the warranty booklet provided by Hyundai Motor America contains an arbitration provision that Ben Su had actual notice of. The judge also finds that Ben Su did not dispute the existence of the warranty contract and that he assented to its terms.

The judge concludes that the motion to compel arbitration is granted because Ben Su failed to meet his burden of establishing procedural and substantive unconscionability. The judge finds that the arbitration provision is enforceable and that any doubts about its enforceability should be resolved in favor of sending the parties to arbitration.
