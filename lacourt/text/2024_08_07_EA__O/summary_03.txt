And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute over an arbitration provision in a warranty agreement. The defendant, HMA, has provided the warranty to the plaintiff in connection with the purchase of a vehicle and has a binding arbitration provision. The judge has overruled the plaintiff's evidentiary objections and granted the request for judicial notice. The judge has also held that HMA has standing to compel arbitration under the warranty. The court will not address the issue of equitable estoppel as an alternative method of enforcing the agreement. The judge has relied on several court cases, including Rosenthal v. Great W. Fin. Sec. Corp. and Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court, to support their decision.
