Legal
Standard
 
A petition to compel arbitration must allege both (1) a “written
agreement to arbitrate” the controversy,[1]
and (2) that a party to that agreement “refuses to arbitrate” the controversy.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.) Once this is done, the burden shifts to the
opposing party to demonstrate the falsity of the purported agreement. (Condee
v. Longwood Management Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 218–219.) In ruling
on a motion to compel arbitration, the court must first determine whether the
parties actually agreed to arbitrate the dispute, and general principles of
California contract law help guide the court in making this determination.
(Mendez v. Mid-Wilshire Health Care Center (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 534,
541.) A petition to compel arbitration is a suit in equity to compel specific
performance of a contract. (Frog Creek Partners, LLC. v. Vance Brown, Inc.
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 515, 532.)  
 
Discussion[2]
 
The issue
presented is whether an arbitration provision found in the warranty booklet.
 
As clearly
established by Defendant’s citations, the rules governing contract law guide
motions to compel arbitration. (See e.g., Motion p. 7, quoting AT&T
Mobility LLC v. Concepcion (2011) 563 U.S. 333, 339, emphasis added
[“fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.”]; see
Motion p. 7, quoting (9 U.S.C. § 2) [The FAA applies to an arbitration
agreement that is “in a contract.”]; Motion 7:18-19 [“The parties
contractually agreed that the FAA would govern this agreement…”]; see also Turtle
Ridge Media Group, Inc. v. Pacific Bell Directory (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th
828, 832, emphasis added [“States are obligated ‘to treat arbitration
agreements the same as other types of contracts….’”]; see also Comedy
Club, Inc. v. Improv W. Assocs., 553 F.3d 1277, 1284 (9th Cir. 2009)
(internal quotation marks omitted) [“[W]here the contract contains an
arbitration clause, there is a presumption of arbitrability.”]; see also Felisilda
v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486, 496, emphasis added [“‘The
fundamental point is that “a party is not entitled to make use of [a
contract containing an arbitration clause] as long as it worked to [his or]
her advantage, then attempt to avoid its application in defining the forum in
which [his or] her dispute ... should be resolved.’”]; see also Metalclad
Corp. v. Ventana Environmental Organizational Partnership (2003) 109
Cal.App.4th 1705, 1714, emphasis added [“Plaintiff’s Claims are necessarily
inherently inseparable from the “underlying contract obligations”].) 
 
Turning to contract principles, in a
bilateral contract, the promisor and promisee exchange promises, whereby the
promises represent binding legal obligations. (Larwin-Southern California,
Inc. v. JGB Investment Co. (1979) 101 Cal.App.3d 626, 637.) This
requirement of binding legal obligations is generally referred to as the doctrine
of mutuality of obligation. As articulated by the California Supreme Court in Mattei
v. Hopper (1958) 51 Cal.2d 119, “the
contract to bind either party, both must have assumed some legal obligations .
. . Or, if one of the promises leaves a party free to perform or to withdraw
from the agreement at his own unrestricted pleasure, the promise is deemed
illusory, and it provides no consideration.” (Id. at p. 122.) “If there is no evidence establishing a manifestation
of assent to the ‘same thing’ by both parties, then there is no mutual consent
to contract and no contract formation.” (Opp. p. 2, quoting Bowers v.
Raymond J. Lucia Companies, Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 724, 733.)
Effectively, to assent to the terms of the agreement, a party must be aware of
the contractual provisions she is assenting to. (See Opp. p. 2, Windsor
Mills, Inc. v. Collins & Aikman Corp. (1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 987, 993
[“Hence, an offeree, regardless of apparent manifestation of his consent, is
not bound by inconspicuous contractual provisions of which he was
unaware, contained in a document whose contractual nature is not obvious.”],
emphasis added and underline added.) 
 
Here,
Plaintiff himself is stating there is an obvious contract by judicial admission.
Indeed, the complaint is one based on violation of an express warranty
based upon a contract that Plaintiff voluntarily and with knowledge entered.
 
-       
“These
causes of action arise out of the warranty obligations of HMA in connection
with a motor vehicle for which HMA entered into a written warranty contract
with Plaintiff(s).” (Complaint ¶5, emphasis and underline added)
-       
“On
September 15, 2022, Plaintiff purchased a 2022 Hyundai IONIQ 5, having VIN No.:
KM8KRDAF6NU108630 ("the Subject Vehicle”). These causes of action arise
out of warranty and repair obligations of HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA in connection
with a vehicle that Plaintiff purchased and for which HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA issued
a written warranty (Complaint ¶9, emphasis and underline added). 
-       
“DURING
these pre-sale communications, I asked about the manufacturer’s
warranty. Cardinaleway Hyundai of El Monte assured me that the Subject
Vehicle was already warranted under HMA’s express warranty.” (Su Decl.,
¶5, emphasis added.)[3]

For that reason—in that
Plaintiff does not dispute actual notice of the warranty contract—the Plaintiff’s
reliance on Norcia v. Samsung Telecommunications Am. LLC, 845 F.3d 1279
(9th Cir. 2017) is misplaced. There, the plaintiff learned of an express
warranty that contained an arbitration provision after purchasing his
phone and signing the customer agreement and taking the box and contents home.
To the extent
that Plaintiff argues that there is not a valid contract because “Defendant
categorically failed to set-forth any evidence showing an agreement to
arbitrate exists between Plaintiff and Defendant” (Opp. p. 6:24-25), that argument fails for two reasons.  
 
First, because
a provision within a contract is not read or understood by the nondrafting
party does not justify a refusal to enforce it. (Gutierrez v. Autowest, Inc.
(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 77, 88.)
 
Second, California
law recognizes that a drafting party “[is] under no obligation to highlight the
arbitration clause of its contract, nor [is] it required to specifically call
that clause to [the nondrafting party’s] attention.” (Sanchez v. Valencia
Holding Co., LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th at 899, 914.)
 
To the extent that Plaintiff may argue there is not a valid contract
because he was not provided with the warranty booklet, his declaration
inherently contends other. (See Su Decl., ¶6 [“I was never given notice ...that …a Warranty booklet
that was presumably delivered to me….”,
emphasis added.) 
To the extent that Plaintiff
argues the agreement is unconscionable, that too fails. 
As for both procedural and
substantive unconscionability, Plaintiff largely relies upon Dougherty v.
Roseville Heritage Partners (2020) 47 Cal.App.5th 93.) But Dougherty
is factually distinguishable. There, the arbitration clause was inconspicuously
buried at page 70 of the contract, and it permitted the defendant to modify the
agreement on 30 days’ notice, and if the resident did not agree, they would be
required to move out, and it also precluded the signors from pursuing punitive
damages or attorney’s fees under the Elder Abuse Act.
Here, the facts are
distinguishable on two fronts. First, the arbitration provision here is fully
conspicuous. Even if the booklet is 50 pages, the arbitration provision is set
out in a separate section in the handbook, is identified in the Table of
Contents, is clearly marked, not hidden, and not ambiguous. Thus, a purchaser
reading through the Warranty Handbook to assess the scope of the warranties
they were receiving at the time of purchase would as easily be able to find the
arbitration provisions as the warranty for parts of their vehicle. Second, even
as to arguments about substantive unconscionability, unlike the agreement in Doughtery,
here, the agreement contains an explicit opt out provision, there is no
restriction on recoverable damages, any limits on discovery will apply equally
to HMA and Plaintiff, and HMA will pay for all arbitration costs except for the
initial filing fee of $250. 
Ultimately, should there be
any doubts as to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement, any doubts
“are to be resolved in favor of sending the parties to arbitration.” (United
Transp. Union v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 804,
808); see also Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela (2019) 587 U.S. __ [139 S.Ct. 1407,
1418] [“ambiguities about the scope of an arbitration agreement must be
resolved in favor of arbitration.”]; Chiron Corp. v. Ortho Diagnostic Systems,
Inc., 207 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 2000) [“little doubt that the dispute [was]
subject to arbitration” where agreement covered “[a]ny dispute, controversy or
claims”]; AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of Amer., 475
U.S. 643, 650 (1986) [“only the most forceful evidence” can overcome contract
enforcement.].)
Thus, absent meeting its
burden to establish a defense by a preponderance of the evidence (Pinnacle
Museum Towers Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55
Cal.4th 223, 246-247), that leaves no doubts that the parties are to arbitrate
the matter.
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing—as Plaintiff is suing upon a written contract
that he, by judicial admission, assented to and that said warranty was provided
by HMA (as the direct provider) and he has failed to meet her burden of establishing both
procedural and substantive unconscionability—the
motion is GRANTED.[4]
