LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES,
INSPECTION DEMANDS
Within
30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of
the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the
party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or
unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the court
has extended the time for response. (CCP §2031.260(a).)
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the party making the demand
may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (CCP §2031.300(b).)
If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the party to whom the demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection
to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). (CCP
§2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver
on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1)
The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike
a motion to compel further responses, a motion to compel responses is not
subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding party does not have to
demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a “meet and confer”
requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 citing Weil and
Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group
2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489, pp. 8H-29 to
hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
 
TENTATIVE RULING MOTION 1-Res ID 0004
As
a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs filed this as one motion when it should have
been filed as two motions. Both Plaintiffs/Movants, Meline Galstyan and Andrey
Pilikyan, are seeking to compel responses to Demand for Production of
Documents, Set No. 1, that were served on Defendant Apex on June 11, 2024. 
However,
Plaintiffs attach the instant discovery, and each Plaintiff, Meline and Andrey,
each individually propounded their own discovery request for Demand for
Production of Documents, Set No. 1, on Defendant Apex.
 “[P]ayment of filing fees is both mandatory
and jurisdictional.” (Hu vs. Silgan Containers Corp. (1999) 70 Cal. App.
4th 1261, 1269.)  
Therefore,
Plaintiffs are ordered to pay the additional filing fee if they want both of
the motions heard.
As
to the merits of Plaintiffs’ motion, on June 11, 2024, Plaintiffs served Demands
for Production of Documents, Set One, on Defendant, Apex Home Loans, LLC.
(Alkana Decl. ¶¶ 1-2.) Plaintiffs’ counsel states that on July 22, 2024, a
letter was sent to Defendant’s counsel requesting responses to the discovery
request. (Alkana Decl. ¶ 4.)
Plaintiffs’
counsel, Eugene S. Alkana, stated that as of “this date” [the Court notes that
the Alkana Declaration was signed on 10/8/2024], Alkana had not received a response.
(Alkana Decl. ¶ 4.)
Here,
because Defendant has not provided timely responses, Plaintiffs’ motion should
be granted if Plaintiffs pay the additional filing fee. Defendant is ordered to
provide code-compliant, verified responses without objection, within ten days
after the hearing on this motion.
Sanctions
- Inspection Demands
In
relevant part, 2031.300(c) states as follows:
Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP § 2031.300(c).)
 
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Plaintiffs
request sanctions against Defendant, Apex Home Loans, LLC, and its counsel of
record, Harry A. Safarian and the Safarian Firm, APC, in the amount of
$1,350.00.
Plaintiffs’
counsel requests sanctions as follows:
I
communicated with Defendant’s counsel in attempts to resolve these issues. I
have also been compelled to make the instant motion. In all, I have expended
approximately three hours in pursuit of this matter including drafting of this
motion. I expect to spend another hour drafting any reply that might be
necessitated and appearing at the hearing of this motion. My hourly billing
rate in this matter is $450.00/hr. In addition, I have paid a $60.00 filing
fee. Therefore, Plaintiffs move the court for an order compelling Defendant
APEX HOME LOANS, LLC, and its counsel, Harry A. Safarian, Esq., and The
Safarian Firm, APC, be ordered to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiffs in the
sum of $1,350.00.
(Alkana
Decl. ¶ 6.)
The
Court will hear argument as to sanctions; the Court notes that no reply was
drafted even though the Alkana Declaration allocates time for drafting a reply.

Therefore, Plaintiffs are ordered to pay
the additional filing fee if they want both of the motions heard.
As to the merits of Plaintiffs’ motion, on June 11,
2024, Plaintiffs served Demands for Production of Documents, Set One, on
Defendant, Vache Agazaryan. (Alkana Decl. ¶¶ 1-2.) Plaintiffs’ counsel states
that on July 22, 2024, a letter was sent to Defendant’s counsel requesting
responses to the discovery request. (Alkana Decl. ¶ 4.)
Plaintiffs’ counsel, Eugene S. Alkana, stated that as
of “this date” [the Court notes that the Alkana Declaration was signed on

Plaintiffs request sanctions against Defendant, Vache
Agazaryan, and his counsel of record, Harry A. Safarian and the Safarian Firm,
APC, in the amount of $1,350.00.
Plaintiffs’ counsel requests sanctions as follows:
As the result of Defendant’s refusal to
provide answers to Plaintiffs’ proper discovery, which responses are necessary
in order to proceed with depositions and effectively prepare for trial, I
communicated with Defendant’s counsel in attempts to resolve these issues. I
have also been compelled to make the instant motion. In all, I have expended approximately
three hours in pursuit of this matter including drafting of this motion. I
expect to spend another hour drafting any reply that might be necessitated and
