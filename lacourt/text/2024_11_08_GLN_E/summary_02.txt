And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the City of Glendale's motion for summary judgment. The City had argued that it did not have actual or constructive notice of the hole in the sidewalk that caused the plaintiff, Elmira Oganyan, to trip and fall. However, the judge found that the City did not satisfy its burden of proof because it did not negate an essential element of the plaintiff's claim. Specifically, the judge found that the plaintiff's allegations in the complaint were sufficient to hold the City liable under Government Code Section 835(a), which allows for liability for a dangerous condition of public property. The judge did not evaluate the evidence presented by the parties regarding whether the City had notice of the hole, finding that it was not necessary to do so in light of the City's failure to satisfy its burden of proof.
