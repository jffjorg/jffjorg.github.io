And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Gagik Khachaturyan v. Garnik Tsaturyan, et al. The plaintiff, Gagik Khachaturyan, improperly combined six discovery motions into one motion, attempting to compel further responses from two different defendants regarding three different discovery methods. The court finds that this action manipulates the court's reservation system and unfairly jumps ahead of other litigants. Additionally, the plaintiff failed to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)-(d), and the court will hear argument on how to proceed. The court notes that even if it continues to hear the individual motion, the plaintiff would need to clarify which defendant and discovery method each motion applies to.
