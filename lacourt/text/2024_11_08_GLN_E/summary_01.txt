And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering three motions to compel responses to discovery requests served on three different defendants: AVI GHAZARYAN, VACHE AGAZARYAN, and ELVIS KESHISHYAN. The motions were filed by Plaintiffs MELINE GALSTYAN and ANDREY PILIKYAN, who are seeking to compel the defendants to respond to their discovery requests without objections.

The judge notes that the defendants have failed to respond to the discovery requests, which constitutes a waiver of their right to object to the discovery requests. The judge also notes that the plaintiffs have incurred legal fees in pursuing these motions and are seeking sanctions against the defendants and their counsel.

The judge is tentatively ruling in favor of the plaintiffs and ordering the defendants to provide code-compliant, verified responses without objection within ten days after the hearing. The judge is also considering the plaintiffs' request for sanctions against the defendants and their counsel in the amount of $1,350.00. The judge will hear argument as to sanctions and notes that no reply was drafted by the plaintiffs despite the allocation of time for drafting a reply.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after hearing argument from the parties.
