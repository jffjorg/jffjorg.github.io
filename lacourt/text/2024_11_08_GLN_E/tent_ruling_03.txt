Case No. 23GDCV02621
Trial Date: UNSET
Case Name: GAGIK KHAYCHATURYAN v. GARNIK TSATURYAN, et al.
TENTATIVE RULING 
Plaintiff, Gagik Khachaturyan, improperly combined six discovery
motions into one motion.  
A motion must be brought separately as to each discovery method
at issue. The instant motion attempts to compel further responses from two
different Defendants with respect to three different discovery methods (six
total motions). 
Using a singular reservation ID for what should have been six
motions results in there being only one hearing scheduled, despite the fact
that Movant intends for six motions to be heard. This manipulates the Court
Reservation System and unfairly jumps ahead of other litigants. Moreover,
scheduling one hearing date by using one Reservation ID for six motions avoids
payment of separate filing fees for each motion that the Court is entitled to
otherwise collect. “[P]ayment of filing fees is both mandatory and jurisdictional.”
(Hu vs. Silgan Containers Corp. (1999) 70 Cal. App. 4th 1261,
1269.)  

Not only does
Plaintiff create a jumbled mess by filing one motion and one separate statement
(when there should have been six motions and six separate statements),
Plaintiff also fails to comply with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)-(d).
The Court to hear
argument as to how it should proceed. 
Even if the Court continues
this individual motion (as opposed to denying it), and Plaintiff filed an
additional 5 motions and 5 separate statements, Plaintiff would need to be
clear as to what defendant and what method of discovery this motion should
apply to. 
Also, if the matter is
continued, the Plaintiff would have to take the time and effort to separate out
the papers and arguments on the various motions.
