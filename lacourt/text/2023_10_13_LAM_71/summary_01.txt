Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendants' person most knowledgeable (PMK) and orders them to appear for depositions and produce responsive documents within 7 days. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $3,910.00, but denies the defendants' request for sanctions. The judge finds that the defendants failed to produce documents and failed to appear for deposition, and that the plaintiff made a reasonable effort to meet and confer with the defendants. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's motion is granted and that the defendants must comply with the court's order.
