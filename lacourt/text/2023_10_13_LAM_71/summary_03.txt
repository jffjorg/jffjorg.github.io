And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in response to Defendant's Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses. The Court finds that Plaintiff's responses to Defendant's Demands for Production Nos. 2-17, 19, and 22 fail to meet the requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure. Specifically, Plaintiff's responses do not indicate whether it is producing all responsive documents, and instead suggest that there are documents not within its possession, custody, or control that it is not producing. The Court orders Plaintiff to provide compliant responses to these demands by October 31, 2023. Additionally, the Court awards Defendant sanctions in the amount of $2,370.

The Court also denies Defendant's request for sanctions on its motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, finding that Plaintiff's supplemental responses were sufficient.
