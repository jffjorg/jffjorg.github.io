And here is the English summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Cross-Defendants Pourandokht Pourat and Hormoz Pourat to set aside and/or vacate the entries of default in this case. The motion was filed on April 18, 2023, and the Court finds that the Cross-Defendants were never served with the complaint of default. The Court also finds that the Cross-Defendants' statement that they cannot find the Cross-Complaint is sufficient to establish excusable neglect. However, the Court denies the motion without prejudice due to the failure to attach a copy of the proposed pleading as required by California Code of Civil Procedure §473(b). The Court also notes that the authenticity of Pourandokht's signature on the motion is not clear and may need to be addressed at a later time.
