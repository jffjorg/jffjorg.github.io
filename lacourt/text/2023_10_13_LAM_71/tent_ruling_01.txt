 Hearing Date:  October 13, 2023



 
Plaintiff Maria Miranda’s
motion to compel the deposition of Defendants Juan Salvador Cleves, Patricia Cleves Cabrera
dba Lupitas Banquet Hal, and Lupitas Banquet Hall, Inc.’s person most knowledgeable
is granted.  Defendants Juan Salvador
Cleves, Patricia Cleves Cabrera dba Lupitas Banquet Hal, and Lupitas Banquet
Hall, Inc.’s person most knowledgeable are ordered to appear for depositions and produce
documents within 7 days of this ruling.
 
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of $3,910.00.
 
Defendant’s
request for sanctions is denied.
 
          Plaintiff
Maria Miranda (“Miranda”) (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel
the depositions of Defendant Juan Salvador Cleves (“Juan”), Patricia Cleves
Cabrera dba Lupitas Banquet Hal (“Patricia”), and Lupitas Banquet Hall, Inc.’s
(“Lupitas”) (collectively “Defendants”) person most knowledgeable (“PMK”) to
appear for deposition and produce documents.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2;
C.C.P. §§2025.450, 2025.460, 2025.480 et seq., 639(a)(5); CRC, Rule 3.920(a).)  Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of
$6,110, jointly and severally, against Defendants and their attorney of record,
Chad Biggins.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)
 
          Meet and Confer
A motion to compel a deposition must be accompanied by a
declaration stating facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (C.C.P. §§2016.040, 2025.480(b).)
Plaintiff’s counsel declares that Plaintiff’s counsel, Cory Gould
met and conferred with Defendant’s counsel. 
(Decl. of Kayyali ¶5, Exh. 1.)   Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration does not
provide a date for the meet and confer nor if the parties met and conferred by
telephone.  Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
declaration does not substantially comply with the requirements of C.C.P. §2016.040.  Regardless, the Court in its discretion will
consider Plaintiff’s motion.
 
Background
Plaintiff served a Notice of Deposition
of Lupitas’ PMK for the date of August 23, 2023.  (Decl. of Kayyali
¶5, Exh. 1.)  On August 18, 2023, Lupitas
served a set of boilerplate objections to Plaintiff’s notice of deposition and
every request for production of documents (“RFP”) at the deposition.  (Decl.
of Kayyali ¶6,
Exh. 2.)  On
August 23. 2023, Defendant’ counsel appeared for Luptitas PMK deposition, along
with Juan, but refused to produce documents or substantively respond the
questions.  (See Decl. of Kayyali
¶8, Exh. 4.)  
Plaintiff also requested deposition
dates for defendants Patricia and Juan.  (Decl. of Kayyali ¶9, Exh. 3.)  On August 23, 2023, Plaintiff requested Defendants’
counsel state whether he represents four witnesses disclosed by defendants.  (Decl. of Kayyali ¶9,
Exh. 5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares
Defendants’ counsel failed to provide dates for the depositions of Juan and Patricia and ignored Plaintiff’s inquiry
regarding representation of the four witnesses.  (Decl. of Kayyali ¶10.)  On September 1, 2023, Defendants served
objections to the depositions of Juan and Patricia and Plaintiff’s concurrent RFP.
 (Decl. of Kayyali ¶10.). 
Plaintiff’s counsel declares that
Defendants’ counsel also stated that he will confer as to whether he will represent
the witnesses Jorge Gandarilla and Fernando Tejas. (Decl.
of Kayyali ¶10.).  On August 23,
2023, Plaintiff noticed the depositions of Juan, Patricia, and witnesses Jorge
Gandarilla and Fernando Tejas, respectively, for September 5, 6 and 7. (Decl.
of Kayyali ¶11; Exhs. 6-9.)
On September 5, 2023, neither Juan nor
Defendants’ counsel appeared for the deposition.  (Decl. of Kayyali ¶16,
Exh. 12.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares thereby,
Plaintiff cancelled the court reporters and interpreters for the depositions
calendared for September 6 and 7, 2023. 
(Decl. of Kayyali ¶17.)
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on
September 14, 2023.  Defendant filed its
opposition on October 2, 2023.  As of the
date of this hearing Plaintiff has not filed a reply.
 
          Discussion
C.C.P. §2025.450 states, in pertinent
part, as follows:
(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person
designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
. . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document, . . .  described in the deposition notice.
(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the production for inspection of any document . . . described in the
deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition
and produce the documents . . . described in the deposition notice, by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.
 
(C.C.P. §2025.450.)
C.C.P. §2025.230 provides, “[i]f the
deponent named is not a natural person, the deposition notice shall describe
with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is requested. In
that event, the deponent shall designate and produce at the deposition those of
its officers, directors, managing agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to testify on its behalf as to those matters to the extent of any information known
or reasonably available to the deponent.”
All that a business entity is required
to do in response to a PMK deposition notice is to produce the employee(s)
“most qualified to testify on its behalf as to those matters to the extent of
any information known or reasonably available to the deponent.”  (C.C.P. §2025.230.)
A discovery referee may be appointed on
motion of any party or on the court’s own motion where necessary “to hear and
determine any and all discovery motions and disputes relevant to discovery in
the action and to report findings and make a recommendation thereon.”  (C.C.P. §639(a)(5); CRC, Rule 3.920(a).)
          Plaintiff’s
request that the Court appoint a discovery referee to preside over the
depositions at the expense of Defendants is denied.  In light of the impending trial date, the
Court does not intend to further delay the taking of depositions by the
additional complication of appointing a referee. 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion
pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders Juan, Patricia, and Luptias’ PMK,
to appear for depositions and produce responsive documents within 7 days of
this ruling.
 
Sanctions
C.C.P. §2023.030(a) provides that a
court “may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.”
Plaintiff’s counsel declares his hourly
fees are $550 per hour, and he spent 8 hours preparing the instant motion,
appearing at the depositions, and meeting and conferring.  (Decl. of Kayyali ¶20.)  However, reasonable attorneys’ fees cannot be
compensated for time incurred meeting and conferring.  Plaintiff’s counsel also requests three
additional hours to address the opposition, draft a reply brief, and appear in
court.  Reasonable fees do not include
anticipated fees, and in light of the lack of reply filed as of the date of
this hearing, the Court cannot impose sanctions for attorneys’ fees that were
not incurred.  
Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff
sanctions in the amount of $3,910.00, as calculated below:
(7 hours x $550/hour) + $60 filing fee =
$3,910.00
Defendants’ request for sanctions is
denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Juan, Patricia, and Lupitas’ PMK, to appear for depositions and produce responsive
documents is granted.  Juan, Patricia,
and Lupitas’ PMK are to appear for deposition with 7 days of this ruling.
Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of $3,910.00.
Defendants’ request for
sanctions is denied.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
