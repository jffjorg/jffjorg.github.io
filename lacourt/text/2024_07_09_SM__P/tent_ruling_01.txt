Ramos v. Wells
Fargo LLC et al., Case No. 23SMCV04217
Hearing Date July
9, 2024
Defendant Wells
Fargo Bank’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint 
 
Plaintiff Ramos,
administrator of the estate of decedent Sjostrand, alleges decedent suffered
from advanced Alzheimer’s and defendant Hamid, a Wells Fargo banker, facilitated
a fraudulent wire transfer from decedent to third-party Mitra. Plaintiff sues
Hamid and Wells Fargo for fraud, elder abuse, intentional infliction of
emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Defendant Wells’
prior demurer was sustained with leave to amend. Wells now demurs to the First
Amended Complaint, alleging the deficiencies were not rectified. 
 
Wells’ request for judicial notice of United State of
America v. Mitra, et al., Case No. 2:22-CR-00442-ES is GRANTED pursuant to
Evidence Code Sections 452(d) and 453 (except as to the truth).
Common Law Claims/UCC

Division 11 of the
California Uniform Commercial Code displaces common law claims where provisions
of the article cover the “circumstances giving rise to the common law
claims[.]” Zengen v. Comerica Bank (2007) 241 Cal.4th 239,
251-253. Successive sections of Division 11 address the liabilities of
consumers and banks when an unauthorized wire transfer is made. Cal. Com. Code
§§11202-11204.
 
“If a
receiving bank has received payment from its customer with respect to a payment
order issued in the name of the customer as sender and accepted by the bank,
and the customer received notification reasonably identifying the order, the
customer is precluded from asserting that the bank is not entitled to retain
the payment unless the customer notifies the bank of the customer’s objection
to the payment within one year after the notification was received by the
customer.” Cal. Com. Code §11505. “U.C.C. 11505 is a statute of repose, not a
statute of limitation.” 4. [§139] Miscellaneous Provisions., 4 Witkin, Summary
11th Neg Inst §139 (2024).
Wells Fargo again argues
the UCC displaces Ramos’ common law claims. The
FAC amended the claim to state “UCC does not apply as Defendant did not comply
with the security procedures required by UCC Sect. 11202 (b) and CA UCC Sect. 11201.”
FAC ¶¶11, 16, 31, 35, 41. The FAC alleges defendants failed to identify
decedent Sjostrand as being in the bank branch with defendant Hamid, decedent
Sjostrand did not and could not provide consent, and defendants made a false
statement that decedent Sjostrand provided consent for a wire transfer to
Mitra. FAC ¶¶17-20. On demurrer, the court must accept as true all allegations,
and plaintiff has alleged facts that take the claims out of the UCC.
 
Wells
contends the FAC fails to allege decedent Sjostrand provided the requisite
notice of any potential claim concerning an unauthorized wire transfer within
one year, as required by Section 11505. OVERRULED.
Elder Abuse 
A claim for
financial elder abuse lies when a person “[t]akes, secretes, appropriates,
obtains, or retains real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult
for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud,” assists in doing so, or “takes,
secrets, appropriates, or retains” property through undue influence. Cal. Welf.
&. Inst. Code §15610.30(a). A cause of action based on “assisting” in a
third party’s wrongful taking must allege defendant actually knew the
transaction or transfer was wrongful. E.g., Das v. Bank of America, N.A. (2010)
186 Cal.App.4th 727, 745. 
 
The FAC
alleges decedent Sjostrand was over 65 years old (FAC ¶2) and Wells
employee/agent defendant Hamid acted in concert with Mitra to allow for the
wrongful taking of the funds from decedent Sjostrand’s account. FAC ¶¶7-9. The
FAC alleges defendants acted with criminal intent and reckless disregard of the
banking laws, including the UCC, that required defendants to identify and
obtain decedent Sjostrand’s consent to provide wire transfer services. FAC ¶17.
The FAC alleges defendants knew decedent Sjostrand was over 65 years old and
caused her financial, physical and mental harm as a result of their actions in
violation of Welf. & Inst. Code sec. 15610.07(a). FAC ¶¶24, 26.
These
amendments are sufficient to state a claim for elder abuse. OVERRULED.
