And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant Wells Fargo's demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, Ramos, administrator of the estate of decedent Sjostrand, alleges that decedent Sjostrand suffered from advanced Alzheimer's and that defendant Hamid, a Wells Fargo banker, facilitated a fraudulent wire transfer from decedent Sjostrand to third-party Mitra. The plaintiff sues Wells Fargo and Hamid for fraud, elder abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

The judge has granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of United State of America v. Mitra, et al., Case No. 2:22-CR-00442-ES, and has found that the plaintiff's allegations take the claims out of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).

The judge has also found that the plaintiff's allegations state a claim for elder abuse, as alleged in the First Amended Complaint. The judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and has ordered the defendant to file an answer within 15 court days.
