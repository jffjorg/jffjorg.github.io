  - The Court will also entertain oral argument from Plaintiff that Southwest has failed to carry its initial burden on summary judgment because the witness statements supplied as the moving party's evidence is hearsay not within any exception.
```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory No. 15.1 is mooted by the service of fourth supplemental responses on July 3, 2024. However, the request for monetary sanctions is not mooted and the court awards sanctions in the amount of $2,068 to be paid by Defendant Southwest and/or its counsel.

The judge has also ruled that the motion for summary judgment will be continued, pending further discovery and argument. The court is inclined to continue the motion because Plaintiff's counsel has made timely efforts to seek to depose key witnesses, but has been spurned by the defense. The court will entertain argument from both sides and will consider whether there are any triable issues of fact that would require a trial.

The court has also granted summary adjudication on the product liability cause of action as against Southwest, but will continue to consider the negligence cause of action pending further discovery and argument. The court will entertain argument from both sides and will consider whether there are any triable issues of fact that would require a trial.
