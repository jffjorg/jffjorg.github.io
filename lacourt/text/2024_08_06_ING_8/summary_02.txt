  - "A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or unintelligible."
  - "A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing that the defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to respond to."

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the pleadings and has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Walker Consultants, Inc. dba Walker Restoration Consultants (DOE 1). The Court has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action, which alleges general negligence, without leave to amend. The Court has also sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges premises liability, but has granted leave to amend if the plaintiff can truthfully amend the allegations to more specifically allege Walker's role as the owner or operator of property where the claimed injury occurred. The Court has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges products liability, and has held that a products liability claim is generally unavailable when the alleged injury-causing activity of the defendant is the rendition of a service rather than the sale or distribution of a product. The Court has ordered the defendant to give notice and has allowed the plaintiff to present argument as to whether the Court should allow twenty (20) days leave to amend.
