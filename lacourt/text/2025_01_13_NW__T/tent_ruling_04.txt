 Case Number:  23VECV03943    Hearing Date:   January 13, 2025    Dept:  T 23VECV03943
Marmelejo v Arriaga
Ex parte
application to continue trial: Denied. 
No good cause shown. 
Discovery was
sent to plaintiff in April 2024. 
Defendant waited until 1/9/2025, 7-8 months later, to file motions to compel.  Waiting until the eve of trial to file the
motions indicates a lack of good faith.
Also, the motions were filed and served on 1/9/2025 by mail which means
the earliest date the motions could be heard is Feb. 10th which is 10
days before trial.  The motions,
therefore, are also untimely.  There is no
good cause to continue the trial date.
