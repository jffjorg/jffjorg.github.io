 Case Number:  23VECV01739    Hearing Date:   January 13, 2025    Dept:  T 23VECV01739 VARDANYAN V JAGUAR
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys Fees is
Granted in Part, grants $39,375 in attorneys’ fees, plus the $5,278.61 in costs
for a total of $44,653.61.
Introduction 
On or about December 8, 2020,
Plaintiff leased a new 2020 Land Rover Range Rover Velar distributed by
Defendant JLRNA. The Complaint was filed on April 21, 2023, which alleged a
violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act against Defendant.
Plaintiff alleges there were issues with the Vehicle that Defendant has
allegedly been unable to repair. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has been
unable to conform the Vehicle to the applicable warranty and that Defendant
failed to comply with its obligations under the Song-Beverly Act. JLRNA denied
these claims. The case settled by May 8, 2024. 
The parties filed a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case on May 21,
2024.  On October 11, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a motion for attorney’s fees and costs. 

Discussion
There is no dispute that Plaintiffs
are the prevailing parties and thus entitled fees per statute. Statutory
attorney fees are ordinarily determined by the court pursuant to the “lodestar”
or “touchstone” method. However, the Court’s discretion is somewhat limited in
fee awards under the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.  The statute takes a different approach from
customary statutory or contractual provisions. 
The statute requires an “initial determination of the actual time
expended; and then to ascertain whether under all the circumstances of the case
the amount of actual time expended and the monetary charge being made for the
time expended are reasonable.  These
circumstances may include, but are not limited to, factors such as the
complexity of the case and procedural demands, the skill exhibited and the results
achieved. If the time expended or the monetary charge being made for the time
expended is not reasonable under all the circumstances, then the court must
take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.”  (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of
California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.)  In the situation of a contingency fee
arrangement, the court in Nightingale stated, “for purposes of section 1794,
subdivision (d), a prevailing buyer represented by counsel is entitled to an
award of reasonable attorney fees for time reasonably expended by his or her
attorney.”  (Id. at p. 817-818
(citing to Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th
99, 104-105, fn. 6.)  
Once the court decides the amount of
hourly rate, that may then be adjusted based on factors specific to the case in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value of the legal services provided.
(Ibid.) These facts include (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4)
the contingent nature of the fee award. (Ibid.)
Reasonable Hourly Rate
“The reasonable hourly rate is that
prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The experienced trial judge is the best judge of the
value of professional services rendered in [her] court.” (Ibid.)
Plaintiffs seek to recover attorneys’
fees for attorneys Plaintiff requests fees and costs in the amount of
$172,176.11, consisting of $110,785.00 in attorneys’ fees for 162.4 hours of
work at the rate of $650/hour for Hovanes Margarian, and at the rate of
$550/hour for 9.5 hours expended by Armen Margarian, plus the 1.5 Lodestar
multiplier for a total of $55,392.50, assistant fees equal to $720.00, as well
as $5,278.61 in costs and expenses.
In opposition, Defendant argues the
attorneys’ fees request is excessive as this was a case without expert
depositions, motions for summary judgment or trials, with only “fill in the
blank” pleadings.  Defendant also argues
that hourly rates of $550 and $650 are not reasonable for a “simple, rote Lemon
Law action.” Defendant states that the median hourly rate for this sort of case
is $450 per hour.  (Opp., Exhibit 1,
Consumer Law Attorney Fee Survey Report.) 
Defendant notes that defense counsel billed less than one eighth of
Plaintiff’s amount, with total fees and costs coming in at just over
$20,000.  (Opp., Wolf Decl. para. 17.)
Defendant requests that the attorneys’ fees be granted in an amount no more
than $30,000.
The court agrees that the amount of
time claimed and the hourly rate are excessive. “The reasonableness of attorney
fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a
consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity
of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time
involved. The court may also consider whether the amount requested is based
upon unnecessary or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) A reduced award might be fully justified by a general
observation that an attorney over litigated a case or submitted a padded bill
or that the opposing party has stated valid objections. (Gorman v. Tassajara
Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 101.)
Based on this Court’s experience in
approving legal rates for lemon law actions, the court approves a rate of $575
per hour for Hovanes Margarian’s and $400 per hour for Armen Margarian.
Reasonable Hours Incurred
“A trial court assessing attorney
fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful
compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each
attorney ... involved in the presentation of the case.” (Christian Research
Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel indicates that
they spent 16.1 hours in pre-filing, 114.3 hours in
post-filing/discovery/settlement 7.9 hours in client communication, 9.4 hours
in breakdown of expended hours, and 13.2 hours on this fee motion.  Each of these seem very excessive for such
experienced attorneys.  If this motion is
an example of 13.2 hours of work, then it is clear that there is some
obfuscation going on.  A firm which does
this work, as claimed by counsel, should have the motion on word processing
which takes maybe 2-3 hours to modify to the particular case.  That is inflation of 80%.  Similarly, discovery is standard as
well.  Reducing the remainder of the time
which the court finds to be excessive as overstated, the Court reduces the
amount of hours to 65 hours for Hovanes Margarian. The court similarly reduces
Armen Margarian's time to 5 hours at a reasonable rate for an 8th
year attorney of $400.  Notably, counsel
do not list cases in which they received less per hour than they requested.  
Asking for inflated fees does not
help the credibility of the attorneys seeking fees.
Multiplier
While the lodestar reflects the basic
fee for comparable legal services in the community, it may be adjusted based on
various factors, including “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, and the skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; (3)
the contingent nature of the fee award” and (4) the success achieved. (Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)
Nonetheless, the court must not
consider extraordinary skill and the other Serrano factors to the extent these
are already included with the lodestar. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal. 4th
1122, 1138-1139.) “[A] trial court should award a multiplier for exceptional
representation only when the quality of representation far exceeds the
quality of representation that would have been provided by an attorney of
comparable skill and experience billing at the hourly rate used in the lodestar
calculation. Otherwise, the fee award will result in unfair double counting and
be unreasonable.” (Id. at 1139.)
Plaintiff requests a lodestar
multiplier enhancement of 1.5. The Court finds that a lodestar multiplier is
not warranted here. Nothing before the Court indicates that the case presented
novel issues or that the quality of representation was exceptional
representation or far exceeded the quality of representation that would have
been provided by attorneys of comparable skill and experience billing at the same
rates. The¿contingent risks, skill, and Plaintiff’s attorneys¿assert are
absorbed by their hourly rates.¿(See¿Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of
California. Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 822.)
Accordingly, the Court declines to
award a lodestar multiplier.
Costs
Allowable costs “shall be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).) Any
items not specifically mentioned by statute “may be allowed or denied in the
court's discretion.” (Id., subd. (c)(4).) The Beverly-Song Act allows a
successful plaintiff to recover both “costs” and “expenses.” (See Civ. Code, §
1794, subd. (d).)
'“If the items appear to be proper
charges the verified memorandum is prima facie evidence that the costs,
expenses and services therein listed were necessarily incurred by the defendant
[citations], and the burden of showing that an item is not properly chargeable
or is unreasonable is upon the [objecting party].' [Citation.]” (Nelson v.
Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.) 
Plaintiff requests a total of
$5,278.61 in costs. The cost items appear to be reasonable and proper.
Conclusion  
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney fees is GRANTED IN PART. The Court awards 65 hours at $575.00
per hour for at total of $37,375, plus 5 hours at $400 an hour for $2000 for total
fees of  $39,375 plus the $5,278.61 in
costs.

IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
