  Case Number:  23AHCV00041    Hearing Date:   August 6, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]  ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO VACATE/SET ASIDE DISMISSAL             I. INTRODUCTION Procedural  History & Factual Background            This matter stems from an automobile collision  that occurred on January 7, 2021 when Stephanie Gomez (Plaintiff) alleges that  Vanessa Lam (Lam) drove so negligently as to collide with Plaintiff. Plaintiff  filed their initial Complaint on January 6, 2023 against Allstate Northbrook  Indemnity Company (Allstate), then amended the Complaint to substitute Lam in  for a Doe defendant on April 21, 2023, and finally filed the operative First  Amended Complaint (FAC) on August 24, 2023.            On July 26, 2023 a case management  conference was held to address the issue of no proof of service for Lam.  Plaintiff’s counsel requested additional time to serve the proof of service and  the Court granted the request. (July 26, 2023 Minute Order). The hearing for  the order to show cause regarding failure to provide proof of service was  continued to October 24, 2023. On October 24, 2023, neither party appeared and  a hearing on the order to show cause regarding sanctions and dismissal for  Plaintiff’s failure to appear was scheduled for December 21, 2023. (October 24,  2023 Minute Order.) Although Lam filed a demurrer on December 20, 2023, the  Court dismissed the entire case on December 21, 2023, after Plaintiff again  failed to appear on December 21, 2023.             The motion now before the Court is  Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal (the Motion). Allstate opposes the  Motion; no reply was filed.         II.           DISCUSSION Legal  Standard           Although Plaintiff argues for relief  under Code Civ. Proc. §§ 473(a)(1) 473.5, and 473(b), the proper governing  statue here is Code Civ. Proc. §473(b) which states: “The court may, upon any  terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a  judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her  through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”         Analysis           In their moving papers, Plaintiff  contends that they never received notice of the demurrer that was filed and  heard on December 20, 2023, and only became aware of the dismissal after  checking the Court’s docket.            However, as Allstate points out in  their opposition papers, the demurrer was not the reason the case was  dismissed. The demurrer was only filed on December 20, 2023, it was never  heard. The Court dismissed the case the next day because Plaintiff had failed  to provide proof of service for Lam. The Court’s Minute Order on July 26, 2023  specifically instructed Plaintiff that if they were unable to effect service,  they must provide a written declaration five days prior to the October 24, 2023  hearing date. Plaintiff failed to do so. At the October 24, 2023 hearing date,  Plaintiff failed to appear, and the Court continued the matter to December 21,  2023.            Plaintiff’s argument of lack of notice  on the demurrer is misleading and unpersuasive. First, the demurrer was not the  cause for dismissal. Second, with regard to notice of Court hearings and  filings, the Court possess in its docket the following: (1) proof of service of  the demurrer on December 20, 2023 via mail, (2) a certificate of mailing on  October 24, 2023 notifying Plaintiff’s counsel of the hearing on December 21,  2023, and (3) a certificate of mailing on December 21, 2023 notifying  Plaintiff’s counsel of the dismissal of the case after failing to appear.  Additionally, there is no notice of a change of addresses nor email addresses  in the Court’s docket regarding Plaintiff’s counsel, in fact, all appear to be  the same in all filings. Moreover, the meet and confer declaration to the  demurrer demonstrates that the parties were in contact prior to its filing,  therefore, Plaintiff’s counsel was aware of the possible filing of the demurrer  whose notice they so contend. (See Demurrer, Declaration of Hamed Amiri  Ghaemmaghami, ¶¶5-6.)           Plaintiff’s moving papers are silent  as to the missed appearances, and the meet and confer efforts regarding the  demurrer. Code Civ. Proc. §473(b) allows the Court to set aside a dismissal for  mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, Plaintiff has  not presented excusable neglect here, and the Court finds none. The Motion is  denied.    III.           CONCLUSION            Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal is  DENIED.             Dated:  August 6, 2024                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  JARED D.
