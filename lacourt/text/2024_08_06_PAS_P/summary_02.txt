And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Jared D. Moses, has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Anina Siddiqui's Motion to Dismiss the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Tao Lao. The case concerns a breach of contract and common counts. Plaintiff was given 40 days to amend their complaint after the initial demurrer was sustained, but failed to do so. The Judge has applied the Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2), which allows the Court to dismiss an action if the plaintiff fails to amend the complaint within the allowed time. As Defendant has moved for dismissal and no opposition has been filed, the Judge grants the motion and dismisses the complaint.
