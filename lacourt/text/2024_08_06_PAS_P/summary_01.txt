And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's Motion to Set Aside Dismissal. The Plaintiff, Stephanie Gomez, alleges that the Defendant, Vanessa Lam, was negligent in an automobile collision on January 7, 2021. The Plaintiff filed a Complaint, which was amended to substitute Lam for a Doe defendant, and finally filed the operative First Amended Complaint on August 24, 2023. The Plaintiff failed to provide proof of service for Lam, and the Court dismissed the case on December 21, 2023, after the Plaintiff failed to appear. The Plaintiff now seeks to set aside the dismissal, arguing that they never received notice of the demurrer filed by the Defendant, but the Judge finds this argument unpersuasive. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff has not presented excusable neglect, and therefore, the Motion is denied.
