 Case Number:  23AHCV02162    Hearing Date:   August 6, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]  ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS       I.           INTRODUCTION Procedural  History & Factual Background             On September 19, 2023 Tao Lao (Plaintiff)  filed a Complaint against Anina Siddiqui (Defendant) for (1) breach of contract  and (2) common counts. On October 17, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer to  Plaintiff’s Complaint. The demurrer was sustained on March 24, 2024 in its  entirety, and Plaintiff was given 40 days leave to amend. (March 25, 2024  Minute Order.) The amended complaint was due on May 6, 2024, however Plaintiff  has failed to file one.             The motion now before the Court is  Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint for Failure to Amend (the  Motion). No opposition has been filed.       II.           DISCUSSION Legal  Standard            Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2), states that the  Court may dismiss an action against a defendant when, “after a demurrer to the  complaint is sustained with leave to amend, the plaintiff fails to amend it  within the time allowed by the court and either party moves for dismissal.”   Analysis            As Defendant outlines in their moving  papers, Plaintiff was given 40 days to file an amended complaint after the  initial demurrer was sustained, however, Plaintiff failed to do so. Therefore,  Defendant is entitled to move for dismissal.                         III.           CONCLUSION             Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s  Complaint for Failure to Amend is GRANTED.             Dated:  August 6, 2024     JARED D.
