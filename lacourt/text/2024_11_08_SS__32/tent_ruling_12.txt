TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


November
  8, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


23STCV15983




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Dismiss   




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Harry Connick, Jr.  




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  Myrika Hairston



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendant Harry Connick, Jr. (“Defendant”) moves to
dismiss Plaintiff Myrika Hairston’s (“Plaintiff”) action as a terminating
sanction for failure to comply with the Court’s July 29, 2024 discovery order
compelling her deposition. Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions. Plaintiff
opposes and Defendant replies.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“To
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a
terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the
following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings
of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or
disobeying
a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)

 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390,
quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)   
 
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be
made lightly.  But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores,
supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)    
 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra, 77
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson &
Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating
sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and subsequently granting
default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with one court order to
produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997)
16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the plaintiff
for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various
discovery statutes].)  
 
“If that party or party-affiliated deponent then fails to obey an
order compelling attendance, testimony, and production, the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against that party deponent or against the party with whom
the deponent is affiliated. In lieu of, or in addition to, this sanction, the
court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against that deponent or against the party with whom that party
deponent is affiliated, and in favor of any party who, in person or by
attorney, attended in the expectation that the deponent's testimony would be
taken pursuant to that order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(h).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
On
July 29, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s
deposition. The deposition was first noticed on April 11, 2024. (Min. Order, 7/29/24.)
The Court found that Plaintiff had failed to appear at her noticed deposition
on May 17, 2024, and ordered that she appear for a remote deposition on August
1, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. unless the parties stipulated otherwise. The Court also
imposed $388.90 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel of
record. (Ibid.) 
 
On
July 29, 2024, Defendant’s counsel informed Plaintiff that she had a hearing on
another matter on August 1, 2024. (Morvati Decl. ¶ 12.) On July 30, 2024,
Plaintiff advised that August 5, 2024 worked as an alternative date, and the
deposition was re-noticed. (Id. ¶ 13-14.) On that date, Plaintiff again
did not appear, and a certificate of non-appearance was obtained. (Id. ¶
15, Exh. K.) Plaintiff has also not paid the monetary sanctions from the July
29, 2024 order. 
 
Plaintiff’s
opposition consists of a brief attorney declaration where Plaintiff’s counsel
states: “My office attempted to get the Plaintiff to participate in her
scheduled depositions, but to no avail. No monetary sanctions are warranted as
to me or this office.” (Yeagar Decl. ¶ 2.) 
 
In
reply, Defendant’s counsel states that the request for monetary sanctions in
connection with the motion to compel was withdrawn as a professional courtesy
to Plaintiff and her counsel. (Morovati Decl. ¶ 5.) Defendant asserts that
Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed the August 5, 2024 deposition the day before and
never advised that Plaintiff would not show up. Since then, Plaintiff has made
no attempt to re-schedule the deposition. (Id. ¶ 8.) 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff failed to comply with the July 29, 2024
order. Therefore, monetary sanctions have been insufficient to induce
compliance. Plaintiff has also failed to appear for a subsequent agreed upon deposition
date. Plaintiff’s own counsel provides no justification for this misconduct and
does not even provide a possible date on which Plaintiff will appear for
deposition. In light of the amount of time that has passed and because there is
no indication that Plaintiff will comply, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s misconduct
is willful. The prejudice to Defendant in his inability to conduct basic
discovery, with a trial date in two months, is clear. Accordingly, terminating
sanctions are warranted. 
 
Because terminating sanctions are imposed, the Court declines to award
monetary sanctions.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, Defendant’s motion to dismiss is GRANTED. The complaint as
to Defendant Harry Connick, Jr. is dismissed with prejudice. 
 
The
only remaining defendants are named but have not been served. Accordingly, the
Court vacates all dates and sets the matter for an OSC re monetary sanctions
for failure to serve for December 9, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the
Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
