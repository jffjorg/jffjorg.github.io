And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add Orkid Plaza LLC as a defendant and assert a premises liability cause of action against it, as well as a dangerous condition of public property cause of action against the City of Los Angeles. The plaintiff also seeks to add allegations about a storage area in the alley that the City allowed Orkid Plaza to possess. However, the motion is denied because it does not include a declaration that addresses the requirements under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, and does not include a copy of the proposed pleading and identify the locations of the additions or deletions.
