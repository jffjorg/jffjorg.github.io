And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: one to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of conducting a neuropsychological examination and one to continue trial.

Regarding the motion to reopen discovery, the judge finds that the defendant acted reasonably diligently to continue trial and reopen discovery after learning of the October 2023 brain MRI report on July 29, 2024. The judge grants the motion, allowing the defendant to conduct the neuropsychological examination with Dr. Delis before the trial date.

Regarding the motion to continue trial, the judge finds good cause for a brief continuance due to the unavailability of the defendant's lead trial counsel for a summary judgment hearing on December 11, 2024. The judge grants the motion, continuing the trial to December 12, 2024.

The judge also orders that the final status conference be continued to November 21, 2024, and that all discovery and pre-trial motion cut-offs remain unaffected by this order.
