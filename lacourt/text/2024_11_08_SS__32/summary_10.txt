And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Counsel Valentine Aghakhani's motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Stefany Gabriela Barrera Malanco. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in attorney-client communication, but the Court found that Counsel did not take reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the Plaintiff's rights. Specifically, Counsel did not timely serve the moving papers and did not provide proof that the Plaintiff consented to electronic service. Additionally, the Court notes that the final status conference is set for November 8, 2024, and trial is set for November 13, 2024, and that relieving Counsel would likely prejudice the Plaintiff's rights. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice.
