And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for a minors' compromise without prejudice. The petition was filed by Margarita Flores, the petitioner, on behalf of her 15-year-old daughter, Jazmine Moran-Flores, the claimant. The judge denied the petition due to incomplete and conflicting information provided by the petitioner. Specifically, the judge took issue with the petitioner's failure to complete item 10c, which requires a description of the settlement terms, and the contradictory information provided in items 12b(1) and 12b(5) regarding the payment of medical expenses. The judge also pointed out that item 14a of the petition stated that the petitioner had paid none of the expenses, which contradicts the petitioner's claim in item 12b(1) that she paid all of the claimant's medical expenses. The judge ordered the petitioner to file a proof of service and to complete certain items in the Proposed Order (MC-351) and Proposed Order (MC-355).
