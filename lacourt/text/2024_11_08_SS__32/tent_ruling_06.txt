Motion
  to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff Loza Abduselam & Request for Sanctions

  Jose Sanchez & Universal Appliances, Kitchens, and Baths, Inc.




OPPOSING PARTY

BACKGROUND
 
On August 12, 2022, Plaintiff
Loza Abduselam filed this personal injury action against Defendants Jose
Sanchez (“Sanchez”) and Universal Appliances, Kitchens, and Baths, Inc.
(“Universal Appliances”) for a single cause of action of negligence. Plaintiff
contends that on August 21, 2020, a vehicle owned by Defendant Universal
Appliances and negligently operated by Defendant Sanchez, collided with
Plaintiff’s vehicle, causing Plaintiff to sustain serious injuries and damages
alleged therein. 
 
MOTION
 
            Defendants Jose Sanchez and
Universal Appliances, Kitchens, and Baths, Inc. now move to compel the
deposition of Plaintiff Loza Abduselam and request monetary sanctions in the
amount of $3,669.50. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Per Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, if a party to the action
fails to appear for deposition after service of a deposition notice and the party
has not served a valid objection to that deposition notice, the party that
noticed the deposition may move for an order to compel the deponent’s
attendance and testimony.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  
 
Here, Plaintiff’s Counsel, Michael McCabe declares that on February
14, 2024, Defendant properly noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for April 23, 2024,
by electronic mail which was then subsequently taken off calendar. (McCabe
Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) 
 
Then, on June 20, 2024, Defendant Sanchez properly noticed Plaintiff’s
deposition for August 5, 2024, by electronic mail and no objection was
thereafter received. (Id., ¶ 4, Ex. B.) On July 15, 2024, Defense
Counsel confirmed the deposition by email and sent a zoom link to Plaintiff. (Id.,
Ex. C.) On August 5, 2024, Plaintiff did not show for deposition and a
certificate of non-appearance was taken. (Id., ¶ 5, Ex. D.)
 
On September 6, 2024, Defendant Sanchez properly served a Notice of
Continuance of Taking Deposition of Plaintiff scheduled for September 23, 2024.
(Id., ¶ 6, Ex. E.) Plaintiff then sent a confirmation email and zoom
link. (Id., Ex. F.) Despite such and without objection, Plaintiff again
failed to appear for her deposition and a certificate of non-appearance was
taken again. (Id., Ex. G.) 
 
Accordingly, the motion to compel is granted.
 
With respect to sanctions, Defense Counsel McCabe declares that the
costs of the court reporter and affidavit of nonappearance were $1,095.00 and
$1,094.50 for the August 5, 2024, and September 23, 2024, depositions,
respectively. (McCabe Decl., ¶7, Ex. H.) Further, McCabe sets forth that he
spent three (3) hours preparing the instant motion and supporting documents at
an hourly rate of $185.00 and further expects to spend an additional five (5)
hours preparing any necessary reply brief and preparing and appearing for the
hearing on this motion. (Id., ¶ 8.) The cost of filing this motion was
$60.00. (Id.) Thus, Defense Counsel requests sanctions in the total
amount of $3,669.50. (Id.)
 
The Court finds that sanctions are warranted but the amount requested
is excessive given the nature of the motion, the lack of opposition, and that
counsel can appear remotely at a hearing. Accordingly, the Court awards
monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,189.50 (1.5 hours of attorney time, the
filing fee, and the nonappearance fees).
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendants’
Motion to Compel Plaintiff Abduselam’s Deposition and orders Plaintiff to
appear for deposition within fifteen (15) days’ notice of the Court’s orders,
unless Defendants stipulate otherwise.
 
In addition, the Court orders Plaintiff
and Plaintiff’s counsel to pay sanctions in the total amount of $2,189.50,
jointly and severally, to Defendant within 30 days of the hearing on the
motion.
 
Defendants shall provide
notice of the Court’s orders and file a proof of service of such.
