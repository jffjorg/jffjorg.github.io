And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to relieve counsel, Steven L. Boortz, as counsel for the defendants, Steve Self and Jonelle Oil Corporation. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, with counsel claiming that the client has ceased communicating and failed to heed advice. The judge found that relieving counsel would likely prejudice the defendants' rights, as the trial is set to begin on November 25, 2024, and there has been no request to continue the trial. The judge also noted that counsel failed to provide adequate notice of the motion and that the proposed order was incomplete. As a result, the judge denied the motion and ordered counsel to provide notice of the ruling and file proofs of service.
