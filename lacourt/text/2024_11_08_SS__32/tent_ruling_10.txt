TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


November
  8, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


23STCV11156




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Be Relieved as Counsel




MOVING PARTY:


Counsel Valentine Aghakhani




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Stefany Gabriela Barrera Malanco’s (Plaintiff)
counsel of record, Valentine Aghakhani
(Counsel), moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. Counsel contends
relief is necessary due to a breakdown in attorney-client communication.   
 
No opposition has been filed.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
¿To be granted relief as counsel, counsel must comply with
California Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362. Even where grounds for termination
exist, attorneys seeking to withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth
in California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and are subject to
discipline for failure to do so. CRPC 3.700(B) lists various grounds for
mandatory withdrawal.¿ 
 
An attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client
relationship and withdraw from a case is not absolute. (See Vann v. Shilleh
(1975) 54 Cal.App.3d 192, 197; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398.) The decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is
within the court's discretion, and it does not abuse that discretion by denying
the application on the ground that the attorney's withdrawal would work injustice
upon a third party. (Hodcarriers, Bldg. and Common Laborers Local Union No.
89 v. Miller (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 391.) 
 
The rules have been liberally construed to protect clients.
(Vann v. Shilleh, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d 192.) An attorney, either with
client's consent or court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal
can be accomplished without undue prejudice to client's interests; however, an
attorney “shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken
reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the
client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment
of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable
laws and rules.” (CRPC 3.700(A)(2).) A lawyer violates his or her ethical
mandate by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d
753, 758 759), or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing
the client’s case. (CRPC 3.700(A)(2); Vann v. Shilleh, supra.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Counsel
Aghakhani has filed forms MC-051 and MC-052 and has lodged with the Court a
copy of the proposed order on form MC-053 as required.  (Cal Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)  Counsel has filed the instant Motion on the
grounds that she has made extensive and reasonable efforts to contact Plaintiff
via phone, text message, physical mail, and electronic mail from April 2023 to
September 2024, as set forth in the declaration.  (MC-052 at ¶ 2, Exs. 1-12.)  Plaintiff has not responded to counsel’s
communication attempts and has not signed the Substitution of Attorney form
sent to her.  (Ibid.)
 
However, counsel
has again not timely served Plaintiff or Defendant with the moving
papers.  Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), requires
moving papers to be served at least 16 court days before a hearing, with an
additional five calendar days added when notice is provided by mail within the
State of California.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1005, subd. (b).) Therefore,
the papers should have been mailed by October 12, 2024, but were mailed October
15, 2024. Though Counsel asserts Plaintiff was served electronically, there
is no proof that Plaintiff consented to electronic service. (See Code Civ.
Proc. § 1010.6(c).)  
 
Additionally, the Court notes that the final status
conference is set for November 8, 2024, and trial is set for November 13, 2024.
No motion to continue trial has been filed in this case. Given the proximity to the trial date, the
Court finds that relieving counsel will likely prejudice Plaintiff’s rights.
Counsel does not set forth facts showing that he has taken reasonable steps to
avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of Plaintiff. (See CRPC
1.16(d).)  
 
Therefore,
the motion to be relieved is denied. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Counsel Valentine Aghakhani’s Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel as to Plaintiff Stefany Gabriela Barrera Malanco is
DENIED without prejudice.
