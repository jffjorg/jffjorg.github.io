And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Defendant Harry Connick, Jr.'s motion to dismiss Plaintiff Myrika Hairston's action with prejudice, citing Plaintiff's willful failure to comply with court orders to appear for deposition. The Judge finds that Plaintiff's misconduct is willful and that monetary sanctions have been insufficient to induce compliance. The Judge also orders Plaintiff to pay $388.90 in monetary sanctions that were previously imposed. The Judge vacates all previous dates and sets the matter for an Order to Show Cause regarding monetary sanctions for failure to serve the remaining defendants.
