And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is a dispute between the plaintiffs (Wayne Davis, Aaron Grim, Amy Higdon, Kenneth Hill, Shalonda Kemp, Kimiesha McGruder, Kaynesha Starks, and Christopher Thomas) and the defendant (Aster Gerbermichael) regarding discovery requests.

The plaintiffs have moved to compel the defendant to serve verified responses to three sets of discovery requests: Special Interrogatories, Set One; Request for Production, Set Three; and Supplemental Pre-Trial Interrogatory. The defendant has opposed the motions, arguing that they were not timely filed and that objections were not waived.

The judge has denied the motions to compel Special Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Production, Set Three, due to the lack of proof of service. However, the judge has granted the motion to compel Supplemental Pre-Trial Interrogatory, ordering the defendant to provide verified responses within 10 days.

The judge has also awarded monetary sanctions against the defendant and his counsel in the amount of $510.00, which is a reduced amount from the original request of $804.00. The judge has ordered the defendant to pay the sanctions within 30 days of the date of this order.

The judge has also ordered the plaintiffs to provide notice of the Court's order and file a proof of service of such.
