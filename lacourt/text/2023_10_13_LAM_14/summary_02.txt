And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants, Safaie and Arya. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to support a cause of action and is uncertain. The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the first cause of action, professional negligence, is overruled. However, the demurrer to the second and third causes of action, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud, is sustained. The plaintiff has 10 days to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies identified by the court. The judge has also taken off-calendar a motion to strike certain allegations from the complaint, which was filed in the wrong format.
