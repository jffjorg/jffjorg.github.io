 Case Number:  22STCV20357    Hearing Date:   October 13, 2023    Dept:  14 (1)       Demurrer
 
            Defendant
Safaie, joined by Defendant Arya, now demurs to the FAC on the grounds that it
fails to state facts sufficient to support any cause of action and is uncertain.
 
Decision
 
            The
demurrer to the first cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
            The
demurrer to the second and third causes of action is SUSTAINED, with 10 days
leave to amend.
 
First Cause of Action: Professional Negligence
 
            The
elements of a professional negligence claim are as follows: “(1) the duty of
the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as to other members
of his profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3)
a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting
injury; and (4) actual loss of damage resulting from the professional
negligence.” Budd v. Nixen (1971) 6 Cal.3d 195, 200.
 
            Plaintiff alleges
that they hired Defendants to pursue a civil action in this court, bearing case
number 20 STCV 00197. (FAC ¶ 5). They further allege that Defendants
refused to respond to a motion for summary judgment and intentionally dismissed
the case without client consent and without any communication. (FAC ¶ 11).
And they allege that this resulted in damages. (FAC ¶¶ 12-14).
 
            Defense
argues that Plaintiffs are required to plead facts showing that they would have
won the underlying case. That is incorrect. A complaint is not required to
plead evidentiary facts. C.W. Johnson & Sons, Inc. v. Carpenter
(2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 165, 169. The ultimate fact here is but-for causation.
The “case within a case” framework that Defense seeks to apply is merely one
way of proving that ultimate fact. Mireskandari v. Edwards Wildman Palmer LLP
(2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 247, 259-260. This is a matter for summary
judgment or trial, not demurrer.
 
Second Cause of Action: Breach of Fiduciary Duty
 
“The elements of a cause of action
for breach of fiduciary duty are: 1) the existence of a fiduciary duty; 2) a
breach of the fiduciary duty; and 3) resulting damage. (City of Atascadero
v. Merill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1999) 68 C.A.4th 445,
483).” Pellegrini v. Weiss (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 515, 524.
 
The FAC pleads breach of fiduciary
duty at paragraphs 18-24. It does not specifically identify any alleged breach.
Plaintiff must identify some conduct which constituted a breach of Defendant’s
fiduciary duty.
 
Third Cause of Action: Fraud
 
            The
elements of a cause of action for fraud are: (1) a false representation, actual
or implied, or concealment of a matter of fact material to the transaction
which defendant had a duty to disclose or defendant’s promise made without the
intention to perform; (2) defendant’s knowledge of the falsity; (3) defendant’s
intent to deceive; (4) plaintiff’s justifiable reliance thereon; and (5)
resulting damage to plaintiff. Mosier v. Southern
 Calif. Physicians Ins. Exchange (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th
1022, 1045. 
 
Fraud must be specifically pled,
and the particularity requirement necessitates the pleading of facts that “show
how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.” Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73. The
purpose of the rules of fraud pleading is to inform the defendant and the court
of the specific grounds of the charge and enable them to evaluate it. See Chapman
v. Skype Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 217, 231.
 
The FAC pleads breach of fiduciary
duty at paragraphs 26-32. It does not specifically identify any false
representations. It is impossible to tell what Plaintiff’s fraud theory is or
would be.
 
Conclusion
 
            Plaintiff
has properly pled a claim for legal malpractice. They have not, however,
clearly identified a breach of fiduciary duty, or pled an intelligible fraud
claim.
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the
first cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
            The
demurrer to the second and third causes of action is SUSTAINED, with 10 days
leave to amend.
 
(2)       Motion to
Strike
 
            Defendant
now moves this court for an order striking certain allegations from the FAC. 
 
Decision
 
The motion is TAKEN OFF-CALENDAR.
It was not filed in the proper format.
 
            A demurrer
is a responsive pleading. A motion to strike is a motion. The court’s
reservation system permits counsel to make a single reservation for a “demurrer
– with motion to strike” only because the two are frequently filed simultaneously.
That accommodation is not an invitation to combine the two into a single
document. They are separate things.
