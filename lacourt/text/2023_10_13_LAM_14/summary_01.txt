And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to continue the trial to February 5, 2024. The motion has been granted, and the trial will now be continued to March 11, 2024, at 9:00 am. The judge has also set a Final Status Conference for February 29, 2024, at 10:00 am, and all counsel must appear in person.

The judge has ordered the parties to address several case management issues, including the failure of Cross-Defendants Magic, GV, and C&C to serve responsive pleadings, and the failure of Cross-Complainant Pashyans to file proof of service for Cross-Defendants JMB and Amyan. The judge has also ordered the parties to dismiss the DOE defendants named in the complaint and the ROES named in the cross-complaint, and to file a compliant proof of service for Cross-Defendants JMB and Amyan by February 14, 2024.

The judge has granted the continuance due to the departure of an expert witness for Cross-Complainant Pashyans, the addition of a new party to the case, and the impact of the original trial date on the court's calendar.
