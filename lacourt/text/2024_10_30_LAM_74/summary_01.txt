And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Monica Potter, Sabrina Coryell, and Kevin Dwight. The defendants demurred to the petition, arguing that the settlement agreements bar the plaintiff's claims, that the plaintiff cannot properly plead third-party interference, and that the claim against defendant Kevin Dwight is time-barred.

The judge denies the moving parties' request for judicial notice of the settlement agreements and separation and release agreements, as the plaintiff alleges he signed the agreements "under pressure". The judge grants the requests for judicial notice of Exhibits "C"-"I".

The judge finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged an economic relationship with the Weisses, and that defendants Monica Potter and Kevin Dwight are third-parties to that relationship. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded an independent wrongful act against defendant Kevin Dwight, specifically the concealment of documents.

However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action against defendants Monica Potter and Sabrina Coryell, as they are only alleged to have interfered with the economic relationship and not committed an independent wrongful act.

The judge also finds that the complaint against defendant Kevin Dwight is time-barred, as the statute of limitations for actions against an attorney for professional services has expired.

The judge sustains the demurrer in its entirety and denies leave to amend.
