The requests seek documents and electronically stored information related to the electrical defect in Plaintiff's vehicle and other vehicles of the same make, model, and year. The judge also finds that Defendant FCA US LLC's objections to the requests are unpersuasive. The judge grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the requests, ordering Defendant to provide the requested documents and electronically stored information.
