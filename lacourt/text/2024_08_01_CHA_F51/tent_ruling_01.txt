MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 22CHCV01492

 
Motion filed: 5/29/24 
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Keith M. Davidson (“Counsel”)
CLIENT: Plaintiff Siobhan Williams Sanchez (“Plaintiff”)
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Counsel as attorney
of record for Plaintiff.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is granted.
 
In a civil action, an attorney may
move to be relieved as counsel at any time during the proceedings after giving
notice to his client. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284.) The moving attorney shall file
with his motion: (1) a notice of the motion, directed to the client using
Judicial Council form MC-051; (2) a declaration in support of the motion using
Judicial Council form MC-052; and (3) a proposed order granting the motion; all
to be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)
 
In his declaration, the moving
attorney is required to state “in general terms, and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1).” (Id., subd. (c).) The client
must be provided no less than five days’ notice before hearing on the motion.
An attorney may withdraw from a case when it can be accomplished without undue
prejudice to the client’s interests. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) On the other hand, if the attorney withdraws at a
critical point in the action, thereby prejudicing his client, he has violated his
ethical duties. (Ibid.) 
 
Here, Counsel filed this motion to
be relieved as counsel for Defendant on 5/29/24. Counsel served his client electronically,
by U.S. mail, and by overnight delivery on 5/29/24. No other parties have
appeared in the action.
 
Counsel properly filed an
accompanying notice of the motion using Judicial Council form MC-051, a
declaration in support of his motion using form MC-052, and a proposed order
granting the motion using form MC-053. In the MC-052 declaration, Counsel cited
irreconcilable differences with Plaintiff such that Counsel must withdraw from
representation thereof. (Decl. of Keith M. Davidson, ¶ 2.) The next hearing
date in this action is a case management conference, set for 8/1/24, the same
date as the instant hearing. No trial date has been set in this action. Therefore,
Counsel’s withdrawal does not raise the risk of unduly prejudicing his client. 
 
Accordingly, the statutory
requirements for the motion have been satisfied, and Counsel’s motion to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff is GRANTED.
