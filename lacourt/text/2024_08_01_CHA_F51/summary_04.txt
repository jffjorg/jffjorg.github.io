And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a demurrer with a motion to strike filed by the County of Los Angeles Department of Regional Planning (Respondent) against James Christopher Ball (Petitioner). The Petitioner brought this action against the Respondent in relation to the evaluation and approval of his Conditional Use Permit Application No. RPPL2019002661.

The judge has sustained the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend, meaning that the Petitioner has 30 days to fix the defects in his petition and re-file it. The motion to strike is moot since the demurrer is sustained.

The judge has also granted Petitioner's request for leave to amend, allowing him to file a second amended petition to cure the defects set forth above. The Court wants to get this case set for a hearing on the merits.

The judge has also ruled that the Petitioner's first cause of action, which challenges AB 52, a state law that requires consideration of tribal cultural resources, is uncertain and fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has also ruled that the Petitioner's second cause of action, which alleges Biological Monitor for One Parcel, is defective because Petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies and is not a legally cognizable cause of action.
