Barabas (“Moving Defendant”) RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Weston Middleton  (“Plaintiff”) NOTICE: OK   RELIEF REQUESTED: An order deeming each of Moving  Defendant’s Requests for Admission (“RFAs”), Set One, propounded on Plaintiff,  be admitted. Moving Defendant further requests monetary sanctions against Plaintiff  and/or his counsel in the amount of $3,725.00.   TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is moot. The Court  imposes sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of $1,000.00  payable within 45 days.   BACKGROUND   This is a property action in which  Plaintiffs own a residential property located at 24546 Golden Oak Lane,  Newhall, California 91321. (Compl. ¶  1.) Defendants Les R. Barabas and Tina Barabas allegedly own a residential  property located at 24506 Golden Oak Lane, Newhall, California 91321. (Id. at  ¶ 2.) Defendants Benjamin  Thursby and Shawn Palmer allegedly own a residential property located at 21166  Placerita Canyon Rd., Santa Clarita, California 91321. (Id. at ¶ 3.)  Defendants’ homes are located upslope from Plaintiffs’ home. (Id. at ¶¶  6–7.)   Plaintiffs allege that on 2/24/23–2/25/23, due to heavy  downpours of rain in the area, “the interconnected drainage swale system on  defendants’ properties failed, including the collapse of a portion of the  interconnected drainage swale, resulting in a very substantial mudslide onto  plaintiffs’ property.” (Id. at ¶ 9.) “Plaintiffs are informed and  believe and on that basis allege that prior to the February 25, 2023 mudslide,  defendants negligently, carelessly and unreasonably allowed soil build-up in  the interconnected drainage swales located on defendants’ respective  properties, preventing the swales from directing storm water off the subject  slope and away from plaintiffs’ property.” (Id. at ¶ 10.)   On 6/7/23, Plaintiffs filed their  complaint, alleging against Defendants the following causes of action: (1)  Continuing Private Nuisance; (2) Continuing Trespass; and (3) Negligence. On  7/17/23, defendants Thursby and Palmer filed their answer and cross-complaint,  alleging against both Barabas defendants the following causes of action: (1)  Declaratory Relief; (2) Negligence; (3) Private Nuisance; (4) Trespass; (5)  Negligent Trespass; (6) Indemnity; and (7) Contribution.   On 8/17/23, the Barabas defendants  filed their answers to Plaintiffs’ complaint and Thursby and Palmer’s  cross-complaint. On 8/17/23, the Barabas defendants filed their  cross-complaint, alleging against Thursby and Palmer the following causes of  action: (1) Equitable Indemnification; (2) Comparative Contribution, Partial  Indemnification; (3) Apportionment of Fault; and (4) Declaratory Relief.   On 8/17/23, Moving Defendant served  Plaintiff with his RFAs, Set One. On 2/26/24, Moving Defendant filed the  instant motion to deem his RFAs as admitted. On 7/23/24, Plaintiff filed his  opposition. On 7/24/24, Moving Defendant filed its reply.   ANALYSIS   A responding party must respond to  each propounded request for admission with either a substantive answer or an  objection to the particular request. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.210.)  A propounding party may move for an order deeming the  genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the  requests be deemed admitted if the responding party fails to serve a timely  response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2033.280, subd. (b); 2033.250,  subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve a timely  response “waives any objection to the requests, including one based on  privilege or on the protection for work product” unless the Court grants it  relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall  make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for  admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a  proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial  compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id. at subd. (c).)   Here, as Moving Defendant electronically  served his RFAs on Plaintiff by mail and email on 8/17/23, the last day for Plaintiff  to serve his response was 9/20/23. (Ex. A to Decl. of Scott Robert Bell); Code  Civ. Proc. § 2030.260, subd. (a).) As Defendant failed to timely serve his  response to Plaintiff’s RFAs, Defendant has consequently waived any objections  thereto. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) Plaintiff argues in  opposition that the instant motion is moot because on 7/9/24, he served his  objection-free responses to Moving Defendant’s first set of RFAs and Form  Interrogatories. (Opp. 1:18–2:7; Ex. 1 to Decl. of Mark Adams Poppett.) The  Court therefore finds that the instant motion is moot, with the only  outstanding issue being monetary sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel.   Sanctions¿    “It is mandatory that the court  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)  on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to  requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280,  subd. (c).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering  that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney  advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including  attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ.  Proc. § 2023.030, subd. (a).)   Here, Moving Defendant requests  monetary sanctions in the total amount of $3,725.00 to be imposed on Plaintiff  and/or his counsel. This amount includes: (1) 7 hours of Moving Defendant’s  attorney’s time spent working on this motion; (2) an anticipated 3 hours  reading Plaintiff’s opposition and drafting a reply; (3) and 0.5 hours to  appear at the instant hearing, at his hourly billing rate of $350.00 per hour. (Bell  Decl. ¶ 13.) Moving  Defendant also seeks to recover $60.00 in filing fees. The Court notes that the  claimed fees total $3,735.00.   In opposition, Plaintiff argues  that the Court should reduce the requested amount because Plaintiff’s counsel  encountered circumstances with his home and personal illness, “resulting in no  cover to pick up some of the slack of the backlog created by the above events  over which attorney Poppett had little control.” (Opp. 5:8–10; Poppett Decl. ¶¶ 10–20.)   The Court notes that Code of Civil  Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c) imposes a mandatory monetary  sanction against a party or attorney whose failure to serve a timely response necessitates  a motion to deem RFAs admitted. Therefore, in granting the instant motion, the  Court finds it reasonable to award Moving Defendant sanctions against Plaintiff’s  counsel in the amount of $1,000.00.    CONCLUSION    The motion is moot. The Court  imposes sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of $1,000.00  payable within 45 days.
