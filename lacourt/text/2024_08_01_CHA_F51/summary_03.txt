And here is the text summary:

This tentative ruling is issued on July 24, 2024, regarding a motion to deem requests for admission admitted in the case of Weston Middleton v. Les R. Barabas, et al. The plaintiff, Weston Middleton, alleges that the defendants, including Les R. Barabas, Benjamin Thursby, and Shawn Palmer, were negligent in their maintenance of the drainage system on their properties, leading to a mudslide that damaged Middleton's property.

The defendant, Les R. Barabas, filed a motion to deem his requests for admission admitted, as the plaintiff failed to timely respond to them. The plaintiff argues that the motion is moot, as he has since served his objection-free responses to the requests for admission.

The court finds that the motion is indeed moot, but imposes sanctions against the plaintiff's counsel, Mark Adams Poppett, in the amount of $1,000.00, payable within 45 days. The court notes that Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c) imposes a mandatory monetary sanction against a party or attorney whose failure to serve a timely response necessitates a motion to deem requests for admission admitted.
