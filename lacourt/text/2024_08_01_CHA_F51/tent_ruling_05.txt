Los Angeles Superior Court Case
# 23STCP01878

  
Motions Filed: 2/13/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Natalie Davidson
(“Plaintiff”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Zoya Vladimirskaya
(“Defendant”) 
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: Orders compelling Defendant’s
responses to Plaintiff’s first set of Requests for Production of Documents
(“RFPs”); and Form Interrogatories; and deeming Plaintiff’s Requests for
Admission (“RFAs”), Set One as admitted. Plaintiff further requests monetary
sanctions against Defendant and her counsel in the combined amount of $4,680.00.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed motions are granted. Defendant
is ordered to provide objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first set of RFPs
and Form Interrogatories within 30 days. Plaintiff’s RFAs, Set One, are deemed
admitted. The Court imposes sanctions against Defendant and her counsel in the
amount of $1350.00 payable within 45 days.
 
Plaintiff is reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended
General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil. When e-filing
documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set
forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First
Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly bookmarking
declarations and exhibits). (CRC 3.1110(f)(4).) Failure to comply with these
requirements in the future may result in papers being rejected, matters being
placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be resubmitted in
compliance with these requirements, documents not being considered and/or the
imposition of sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action concerns a business
dispute between Plaintiff and Defendant, who are equal sole shareholders,
directors, and officers of nominal defendant Cardea Hospice & Palliative
Care (“Cardea”). (Compl. ¶¶
7–9.) Plaintiff alleges that on 2/7/23, Defendant tendered her resignation as
an officer of Cardea and offered to sell her shares. (Id. at ¶ 10.)
Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant, inter alia, wrongfully converted
corporate funds to herself and others, attempted to evict Cardea from its
rental unit, and demanded that the business be shut down. (Id. at ¶ 12.)
 
On 5/31/23, Plaintiff filed her complaint, individually and
on behalf of Cardea, alleging against Defendants the following causes of
action: (1) Breach of Fiduciary Duty (against Defendant); (2) Conversion
(against Defendant); (3) Money Had and Received (against Defendant); (4)
Declaratory Relief (against all defendants); and (5) Removal Pursual to
Corporations Code § 304 (against all defendants). On 9/14/23, Defendants filed
their answer.
 
On 8/23/23, Plaintiff served the subject discovery requests
on Defendant. On 2/13/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motions to compel Defendant’s
responses thereto. No oppositions have been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A propounding party may move for an
order compelling a response to a request for production of documents if the
responding party fails to serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2031.300, subd. (b); 2031.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding
party who fails to serve a timely response “waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless
the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd.
(a).)
 
A propounding party may move for an
order compelling a response to interrogatories if the responding party fails to
serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd.
(b); 2030.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve
a timely response “waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings
under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless
the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.
(a).)
 
A propounding party may move for an
order deeming the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted if the responding party fails to
serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2033.280, subd.
(b); 2033.250, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve
a timely response “waives any objection to the requests, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product” unless the Court grants it
relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id. at subd. (c).)
 
Here, as Plaintiff electronically
served the subject discovery requests on Defendant on 8/23/23, the last day for
Defendant to respond was 9/25/23. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).) To date, Defendant has
not provided responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests. (Decl. of Paul Tokar ¶¶ 5, 9.) The Court notes that Defendant
has failed to oppose the instant motions. Accordingly, the Court grants the
instant unopposed motions to compel Defendant to provide responses to the
subject discovery requests.
 
Sanctions¿ 
 
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
“It is mandatory that the court
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests
for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd.
(c).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred
by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
 
Here, Plaintiff requests a total
sum of $4,680.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendant and her counsel. This
amount includes (1) 5 hours of Plaintiff’s attorney’s time spent preparing the
motions; and (2) an anticipated 5 hours drafting each reply and appearing at each
of the hearings, at counsel’s hourly rate of $450.00 per hour. (Tokar Decl. ¶ 8.) Plaintiff further
seeks to recover $60.00 in filing fees per motion.
 
In granting the instant unopposed motions,
the Court finds it reasonable to award Plaintiff sanctions against Defendant
and her counsel in the total amount of $1350.00. 
¿ 
CONCLUSION¿ 
 
The unopposed motions are granted.
Defendant is ordered to provide objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first
set of RFPs and Form Interrogatories within 30 days. Plaintiff’s RFAs, Set One,
are deemed admitted. The Court imposes sanctions against Defendant and her
counsel in the amount of $1350.00 payable within 45 days.
