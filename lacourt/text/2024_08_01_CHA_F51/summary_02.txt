**Significant Statements**
```
"The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial."
"The burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto."
"The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings."
```
Summary: The judge grants Moving Defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that Plaintiff has failed to show any triable issues of fact regarding the dog attack and the parties' relationships. The judge also sustains Moving Defendants' evidentiary objections to certain evidence presented by Plaintiff.
