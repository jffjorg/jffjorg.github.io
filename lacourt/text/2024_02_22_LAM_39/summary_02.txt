Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made several tentative rulings on pretrial motions filed by the parties. The judge has granted in part and denied in part Plaintiff's motion to exclude evidence of certain actions by John Doe, including his misdemeanor convictions and the underlying facts and circumstances. The judge has also granted in part and denied in part Defendant's motion to exclude evidence of prior settlements or verdicts against the LAUSD.

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion to exclude hearsay statements in police reports, finding that they are probative of issues at trial. The judge has also denied Defendant's motion to exclude argument and evidence that the LAUSD had responsibility to check on John Doe off-campus, finding that the issue is relevant to the case.

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion to exclude four witnesses, finding that they were disclosed in advance of the deadline and that there is no basis to conclude that Defendant's counsel concealed the names of these potential witnesses in discovery.

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion to exclude two exhibits, finding that they were produced before the Court's deadline and that there is no basis to conclude that Defendant's counsel concealed the exhibits in discovery.
