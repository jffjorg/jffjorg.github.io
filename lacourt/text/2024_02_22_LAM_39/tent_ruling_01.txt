  Case Number:  19STCV28669    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  39 Tami Kim Alan v.
Susan Arnheiter, et al.
Case No.
19STCV28669
Ex Parte
Application
 
            The Court
is scheduled to hear Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on February 26,
2024.  Plaintiff Tami Kim Alan filed an
ex parte application for an order deeming her opposition—which was filed on
February 13, 2024—to have been timely filed or, in the alternative, continuing
the hearing by three days.  This follows
Defendant’s ex parte application to advance the hearing by four days.  Each party opposes the other party’s ex parte
application.   
 
            This record
demonstrates that the parties cannot effectively resolve basic disputes without
court intervention.  The Court is currently
in a jury trial and is not available to conduct a case management
conference.  Therefore, the Court orders
as follows:
 
            1.         The Court denies Plaintiff’s ex parte
application as moot.
 
            2.         The Court advances and denies
Defendant’s ex parte application as moot.
 
            3.         The Court advances and vacates the
final status conference (currently set for March 15, 2024) and trial date
(currently set for March 26, 2024).  
 
            4.         The Court advances and continues the
hearing on Defendants’ motion for summary judgment from February 26, 2024, to March
26, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. 
 
            5.         The Court shall hold a trial setting
conference on March 26, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  
The Court provides notice that it does not intend to extend any
discovery deadlines absent a stipulation from the parties.  
 
            6.         Pursuant to the Court’s order of
January 30, 2023, the deadline for this case to proceed to trial shall be July
30, 2026.  
              
            7.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
