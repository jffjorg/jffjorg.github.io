And here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendant's ex parte application to continue the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Mike Nijjar from February 29, 2024, to March 19, 2024. The court has also advanced and continued the case management conference, the plaintiff's motion to compel, and the hearing on the defendant's motion for a protective order to March 19, 2024. The court has also discharged the order to show cause re: sanctions as all defendants have been served. The court's ruling is due to its engagement in a jury trial until March 8, 2024, which makes it unavailable to handle the matters set for hearing on February 29, 2024.
