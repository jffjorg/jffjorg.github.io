  Case Number:  22AHCV00242    Hearing Date:   December 9, 2024    Dept:  X DFENDANTS’  MOTIONS (3) TO TAX COSTS   Defendant moves to tax costs from  Plaintiff’s first, second, and third memoranda of costs (filed by Plaintiff on  7/16/24, 8/22/24, and 9/20/24, respectively).   Background   This case arises out  of Plaintiff Benjamin Martin’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that his previous employer,  Defendant Scott Warmuth (“Defendant”), failed to provide him with his personnel  records after terminating his employment.  Plaintiff filed this complaint on April 27,  2022, seeking injunctive relief under Labor Code section 1198.5.   Following the  parties’ bench trial on October 17, 2023, Plaintiff obtained judgment for  Defendant’s violation of Labor Code section 1198.5(b)(1).  On November 13, 2023, the Court  entered judgment awarding Plaintiff damages in the amount of $750.00.  (11/13/23 Judgment.)  Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees was  granted on December 15, 2023, entitling him to $38,663.40 ($24,750 in  attorney’s fees plus $13,913.40 in costs). (12/15/23 Minute Order.)   Three post-judgment  motions to tax costs are the subject of this hearing (nos. 6872, 9493,  and 2654).  Additionally, the Court has  set a hearing to determine the final judgment amount owed by the judgment  debtor.     Tentative Ruling   1.     Defendant’s Motion to Tax 7/16/2024 Memorandum  of Costs After Judgment (6872).  The motion  is denied for being untimely.  Plaintiff is  awarded $20,661.30.   2.     Defendant’s Motion to Tax 8/22/2024 Memorandum  of Costs After Judgment (9493).  The motion is denied for being untimely.   Plaintiff is awarded $8,279.30.   3.     Defendant’s Motion to Tax 9/20/2024 Memorandum  of Costs After Judgment (2654).  The motion is denied for being untimely.   Plaintiff is awarded $13,657.30.   The total  judgment amount for all three memoranda is $42,597.90.     Defendant’s Motion  to Tax Costs (6872) (re: 7/16/24 Memo of Costs) Is DENIED   Defendant’s First Motion to Tax Was Filed One Day Too  Late   On July 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Memorandum of Costs  After Judgment (the “First Memorandum”).  The First Memorandum was served  electronically.  The total of all  postjudgment costs is $59,324.70.  This  sum reflects $40.00 for issuing writ of execution, $381.30 in filing, service,  and levy fees, $20,240.00 in attorney’s fees, and $38,663.40 in previously  allowed postjudgment costs.  In  Paragraph 1(7), the $20,240.00 in attorney fees were incurred from  12/07/23-07/16/24.   On  July 31, 2024, Defendant filed and served a Motion to Stike $19,240.00 of the  $20,240.00 in attorney’s fees requested in Plaintiff’s First Memorandum.  Defendant argues the attorney’s fees are  unreasonably high on its face and Plaintiff presents nothing in support of his  request of such an exorbitant level of costs for a straightforward enforcement  of a judgment.    In opposition,  Plaintiff argues Defendant’s motion is untimely as it was filed on July 31,  2024 when the last day to file was July 30, 2024, and thus the amounts claimed  in the July 16, 2024 Memorandum of Costs are automatically allowed and added to  the judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 685.070(d).   Defendant’s  reply attributes the reason that the filing was one day late to a clerical  error.  The motion was initially filed on  July 30, but rejected by the court due to a clerical error of not having the  correct time the motion was set to be heard listed on it.  (McMenamin Decl., ¶ 4.)    Code of Civil  Procedure section 685.070 provides, in part:    (c) Within  10 days after the memorandum of costs is served on the judgment debtor, the  judgment debtor may apply to the court on noticed motion to have the costs  taxed by the court.  The notice of motion  shall be served on the judgment creditor.  Service shall be made personally or by mail.  The court shall make an order allowing or disallowing the costs to the extent  justified under the circumstances of the case.    (d)  If no motion to tax costs is made within the time provided in subdivision (c),  the costs claimed in the memorandum are allowed.   (Code Civ. Proc., §  685.070(c)-(d).)  “ ‘If the items  appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the  party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.  On the other hand, if the items are properly  objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party  claiming them as costs.’ ”  (Nelson v.  Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.)    Costs of enforcement  of a judgment are recoverable, including attorney’s fees in some instances,  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 685.040: “The judgment creditor is  entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.  Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a  judgment are not included in costs collectible under this title unless  otherwise provided by law.  Attorney’s  fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs collectible under  this title if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney’s fees to  the judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of  subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.”   The “second sentence  of section 685.040 applies to noncontract cases” and provides that attorney’s  fees may be recovered as costs if authorized by statute and expended to enforce  a judgment.  (Rosen v. LegacyQuest  (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 375, 382.)  Regarding  the reference to section 1033.5(a)(10)(A) in the last sentence of section  685.040, section1033.5(a)(10)(A) provides that costs include, “[a]ttorney’s  fees, when authorized by. . . [c]ontract.”  In sum, costs incurred to enforce a judgment  include attorney’s fees when the underlying judgment included an award of  attorney’s fees pursuant to a statute or contract.  Furthermore, if the statute on which a  judgment was based provides a right to attorney’s fees, then attorney’s fees  incurred to enforce that judgment are recoverable costs under section 685.040.  (York v. Strong (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th  1471, 1477 [“[T]here was no need for the trial court to wrestle with the  language of section 685.040 in this case, because our Supreme Court previously  ruled in Ketchum that attorney fees incurred in an effort to enforce a  fee judgment obtained under the anti-SLAPP law do qualify as recoverable costs  under section 685.040 . . . .”], citing Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24  Cal.4th 1122, 1141 n.6).)   Here, the award of  attorney’s fees would be based on the Labor Code statute and thus attorney’s  fees incurred to enforce that judgment are recoverable.  The suit was brought under Labor Code  section 1198.5.  As Defendant’s Motion to  Tax is untimely, Defendant forfeited his arguments  pertaining to the costs claimed in the First Memorandum.  Indeed, Plaintiff served the First Memorandum  on July 16, 2024, and served the filing on Defendant by electronic service.  Under section 685.070(c), a judgment debtor  has 10 calendar days from the service of a memorandum to file a motion to tax  costs.  The deadline to file a motion to  tax costs can be extended by 2 court days for electronic service.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd.  (a)(3)(B).)  Thus, Defendant had until  July 30, 2024 to move to tax the costs claimed in the First Memorandum.  He did not do so where the motion was filed on  July 31, 2024 and the proof of service appears to reflect service on July 31,  2024.   Section 685.070, subdivision (d), states that, “If no motion to tax costs  is made within the time provided ... the costs claimed in the memorandum are  allowed.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.070,  subd. (d), italics added.)  In essence,  “[s]ection 685.070 provides that if the judgment creditor files a memorandum of  costs and the judgment debtor does not timely file a motion to tax costs, then  the court is required to allow all of the costs claimed in the  memorandum of costs.”  (Code Civ. Pro., §  685.070(d); see Briggs v. Elliott (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 683, 695; Lucky  United Properties Investment, Inc. v. Lee (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 635, 643.)     Thus, the Court is  required to award Plaintiff the costs specified in the First Memorandum because  Defendant failed to file a timely motion to tax costs.  A court has a “mandatory” duty to allow  such costs where, as here, the judgment debtor does not move to tax costs in a  timely manner.  (Lucky United Properties  Investment, Inc. v. Lee (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 125, 146.)  “There are no exceptions to this rule.”  (Ibid.)     Based on the  foregoing, Defendant’s motion to tax Plaintiff’s 7/16/24 Memorandum of Costs  After Judgment is DENIED.  Plaintiff is  awarded $20,661.30 in attorney fees and costs.   Defendant’s Motion  to Tax Costs (9493) (re: 8/22/24 Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs) Is DENIED   Defendant’s Second Motion Was Filed One Day Too Late   On August 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a second Memorandum of  Costs After Judgment (the “Second Memorandum”).  The  total of all postjudgment costs is $67,604.00.  This sum reflects $414.30 in filing and  service of process fees, $7,865.00 in attorney’s fees, and $59,325.70 in  previously allowed postjudgment costs.  In  Paragraph 1(7), the $7,865.00 in attorney fees were specifically incurred  between 7/17/24 and 8/21/24.   On  September 5, 2024, Defendant moved to strike the Second Memorandum in its  entirety.  The motion argues that Plaintiff  provides no justification for any of the post-judgment costs claimed. Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that it  is untimely by one day, procedurally defective, and substantively without  merit.  He asserts that the costs claimed  in the Second Memorandum of Costs were reasonable, necessary, and automatically  added to the judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 685.070(d).  In reply, Defendant contends that the motion  is timely under the applicable statutory provisions and that Judgment Creditor  has failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify the claimed costs.   For the same reasons  as with the first motion, Defendant’s second motion is untimely.  Plaintiff filed and electronically served the  Second Memorandum on August 22, 2024.  Defendant  had 10 days plus 2 court-days to file a motion, by September 4, 2024 at the  latest.  The motion was filed one day too  late.  Thus, the Court is required to  award Plaintiff the costs specified in the Second Memorandum because Defendant  failed to file a timely motion to tax costs.   Defendant’s Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s 8/22/24 Memorandum of  Costs After Judgment is DENIED. Plaintiff is awarded $8,279.30 in  attorney fees and costs.   The Court Corrects Plaintiff’s Accounting Errors With  Regard to Interest   As discussed  above—in the Court’s ruling on Defendant’s motion to tax costs of Plaintiff’s First  Memorandum—an award of attorney’s fees would be based on Labor Code section  1198.5 and thus attorney’s fees incurred to enforce that judgment are  recoverable.  Pursuant to the Enforcement  of Judgments Law, section 680.010 et seq., postjudgment fees or costs,  including attorney fees incurred in enforcing a judgment, may be added to a  judgment when authorized pursuant to contract or statute, to the extent they are  “reasonable and necessary.”  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 685.040.)     The Court does note  some errors in the accounting regarding interest accrual.  Plaintiff’s  opposition argues interest begins to accrue upon entry of judgment, with  specific calculations provided for the amounts owed:   Here, the $750 awarded in the  judgment and $38,663.40 in costs and fees awarded (total $39,413.40), accrued  interest “upon entry of judgment” which was on November 14, 2023. Judgment  [Creditor] received a $750 payment on December 15, 2023. (Young Decl. ¶ 2, Ex.  1.) Thus, interest accrued at $10.80 per day for 31 days from November 14  through December 15, 2023 in the amount of $334.80. Payments are first applied  to accrued interest and then to the principal.  (Lucky, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th  125 at p. 139, citing § 695.220.)  The  $750 payment applied first to accrued interest of $334.80, and $415.20 applied  to the $39,413.40 principal, after which $38,998.20 was owed on the principal.   Interest accrued at $10.68 per day  until July 22, 2024, the date Judgment Creditor’s counsel received the proceeds  from a second check for $7,553.00.  (Young  Decl. ¶ 11.) Interest accrued at $10.68 per day for 249 days (Dec. 16, 2023 –  July 22, 2024), which is $2,659.32. The $7,553.00 payment applied first to  accrued interest of $2,659.32 and $4,893.68 applied toward the $38,998.20  principal, after which $34,104.52 was owed on the principal as of July 22,  2024.   (Opposition, p. 8.)    According to the opposition, the  total judgment amount of $39,413.40 accrued interest at $10.80 per day, leading  to a total of $334.80 in interest by December 15, 2023.  Subsequent payments were applied first to  accrued interest, resulting in a remaining principal of $38,998.20.  Plaintiff details further interest  calculations, culminating in a principal amount of $34,104.52 owed as of July  22, 2024, after additional payments.  Then,  the opposition argues the First Memorandum’s claim of $20,661.30 was  automatically added to the principal due to the debtor’s failure to challenge  it in a timely manner, and thus interest on the new principal of $54,765.82  accrued until August 5, 2024.  The  opposition also argues Defendant had until September 4, 2024, to file a motion  to tax costs against the Second Memorandum but failed to do so, so the claimed  costs of $8,279.30 are automatically added to the judgment.    The Court disagrees with Plaintiff’s conclusion as to when  interest becomes due.  Plaintiff’s  position relies on a formula that calculates the attorney fees awarded in the  December 15, 2023 minute order as beginning to accrue interest starting on  November 14, 2023—the date that the Court entered judgment for Plaintiff in the  amount of $750.  This would make  Defendant responsible for interest (on the attorney fees) which began to accrue  before the attorney fees were even determined.  An order for attorney fees constitutes a  separate money judgment.  (See Felczer  v. Apple Inc. (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 406, 416 [“We reject plaintiffs’  position as to their attorney’s fee award because it would require us to  conclude that a judgment entered before they were necessarily entitled to  recover fees was somehow a money judgment for those fees.  But because a ‘judgment [for] the payment of  money’ (§ 680.020) with respect to costs and attorney’s fees does not exist  until the right to some monetary payment is established, the plain language of  the statute does not support plaintiffs’ position.”])  Instead, the interest on the attorney’s fee  award would have began accruing on the date the award was ordered, i.e.,  December 15, 2023.   Now, the  Court calculates which of Plaintiff’s claimed costs in the Second Memorandum  are recoverable and applies payments that Defendant made to Plaintiff.  “Payment on a judgment is allocated first to  accrued interest on the principal amount, and then to the principal.  […]  The  amount required to satisfy a money judgment is the total amount of the  judgment, plus costs added after judgment (including attorney fees), plus  accrued interest on the judgment, less payments, and any amounts no longer  enforceable.  (§ 695.210.)”  (Lucky, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at  p. 139.)   On November 14, 2023, the Court awarded $750.00 to  Plaintiff.  (11/14/23 Judgment.)  Interest accrued at the rate of $0.21 per day  starting November 14.  Plaintiff received  a $750.00 payment on December 15, 2023.  (Young  Decl. (9493), ¶ 2.)  Thus, interest  accrued at $0.21 per day for 31 days, in the amount of $6.3674 in interest.  After applying the $750.00 payment towards the  interest, and then the principal, the remaining amount owed was $6.37 in  principal.   On December 15, 2023, the Court awarded $38,663.40 in  attorney fees and costs to Plaintiff. (12/15/23 Minute Order.)  After adding the remaining $6.37 in principal,  the total amount owed was $38,669.77.  Interest  accrued at the rate of $10.60 per day starting December 15.  Plaintiff received a check for $7,553.00 on  July 22, 2024.  (Young Decl. (9493), ¶  11.)  Thus, interest accrued at $10.60  per day for 220 days, for a total of $2,330.79 in interest.  After applying the $7,553.00 payment towards  the interest, and then the principal, the remaining amount owed was $33,447.56.     As of July 22, 2024, the total principal amount was  $33,447.56.  Interest accrued at the rate  of $9.16 per day starting July 22.  On  July 29, the Sheriff’s Department issued a check for the amount seized by bank  levy $31,467.77.  (Young Decl. (9493), ¶  12.)  Thus, interest accrued at $9.16 per  day for seven days, in the amount of $64.15 in interest.  After applying the $31,467.77 check towards  the interest, and then the principal, the remaining amount owed was $2,043.94.    As of July 29, 2024, the total principal amount was  $2,043.94.  Interest accrued at the rate  of $0.56 per day starting July 29.  On  September 9, Plaintiff received a $2,500.00 check from Defendant’s counsel.  (Young Decl. (9493), ¶ 18.)  Thus, interest accrued at $0.56 per day for 42  days.  After applying the $2,500.00 check  towards the interest, and then the principal, the principal is completely paid  off and there is a credit of $432.70.    As of September 9, 2024, after applying the $2,500.00  check towards the interest and principal, Defendant is credited with the  leftover amount of $432.70.   Defendant’s Motion  to Tax Costs (2654) (re: 9/20/24 Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs) Is DENIED   On September 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a third Memorandum of  Costs After Judgment (“Third Memorandum”).  The  total of all postjudgment costs is $13,657.30.  This sum reflects $237.30 in filing and  service of process fees and $13,420.00 in attorney’s fees.  In Paragraph 1(7), $7,865.00 in attorney fees were  incurred from 8/22/24 to 9/22/24.  The  Court notes the end date of 9/22/24 appears to be in error because the  memorandum was signed and dated as September 20, 2024, and was filed the same  day—so as of filing, September 22, 2024 had not yet occurred.    On  October 8, 2024, Defendant moved to strike the third Memorandum in its  entirety.  Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that it  is untimely.  The reply’s timeliness  argument is misplaced, as it refers to the timeline of filings regarding  Plaintiff’s Second Memorandum, not Plaintiff’s Third Memorandum.    For similar reasons  as with the other two motions, Defendant’s motion is untimely.  Plaintiff filed and electronically served the Third  Memorandum on September 20, 2024.  Ten  plus two court days would mean Defendant’s motion should have been filed on or  before October 2, 2024.  As the motion  was filed several days later, it is untimely and the Court is required to award  Plaintiff the costs specified in the Third Memorandum.    Based  on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to tax Plaintiff’s 9/20/24 Memorandum of  Costs After Judgment is DENIED.  Plaintiff  is awarded $13,657.30 in attorney fees and costs.
