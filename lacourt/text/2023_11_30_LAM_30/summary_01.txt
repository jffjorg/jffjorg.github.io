And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Barry Chase Foster's motion to quash the deposition subpoena served by State Farm General Insurance Company on Jeremy Karpel is granted as to Request Nos. 1-3 and 10, and denied as to Nos. 6-9 and 11-12. The Judge finds that State Farm's request for documents related to the investigation and criminal case of Barry Chase Foster is reasonable and not overly broad. However, the Judge grants the motion as to Request Nos. 1-3 because Jeremy Karpel has declined to provide copies of incident reports related to the criminal case, and as to Request No. 10 because it is highly probable that any responsive documents would be barred by Evidence Code § 1153.
