 Case Number:  22STCV13023    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2023    Dept:  39 Kenneth Oleesky v.
Lithia Motors, Inc., et al.
Case No.
22STCV13023
Ex Parte
Application to Continue Trial Date
 
            Defendants
filed an ex parte application to continue the trial date and all available
dates because the parties have been unable to complete discovery.  Plaintiff’s counsel has stipulated to this
trial continuance.  Finally, the Court
anticipates that it will be engaged in trial on the parties’ current trial date
in two related bench trials that will commence on January 8, 2024.  Therefore, the Court grants Defendants’ ex
parte application and advances and vacates the final status conference and
trial dates.  The Court sets trial on its
first available date:
 
            Post-Mediation
Status Conference:    May 13, 2024, at
8:30 a.m.  
 
            Final
Status Conference:                    October
4, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.
 
            Trial:                                                   October
15, 2024, at 9:30 a.m.
 
The discovery and motions deadlines shall be based on the
new trial date.  Defendants’ counsel
shall provide notice and file proof of such with the Court.
