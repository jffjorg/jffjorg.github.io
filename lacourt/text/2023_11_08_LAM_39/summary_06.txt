And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of J.W. v. Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). The case involves J.W.'s claims of childhood sexual abuse against the LAUSD, which were allegedly committed by an LAUSD employee in 1981. The LAUSD has demurred to the first and third causes of action, arguing that Assembly Bill 218, which revived the claims, is unconstitutional because it retroactively removes a substantive element of the claim and constitutes a gift of public funds.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the retroactive elimination of the claims presentation requirements is a valid public purpose, namely to reduce barriers for victims to assert claims. The Judge also notes that the Legislature's discretion in determining what constitutes a public purpose will not be disturbed by the courts, so long as the determination has a reasonable basis.

The LAUSD has also moved to strike the treble damages allegations, which the Judge has granted, as such damages are not recoverable against a school district.

The Judge has ordered that the LAUSD file an answer within 30 days, and that the parties proceed with the case management conference before the LAUSD files its answer.
