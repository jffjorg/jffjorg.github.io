Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for a protective order without prejudice. The motion was filed in response to issues that arose during depositions taken by plaintiff Brink Biologics, Inc. of Dr. Francisco Adrian, Ms. Anlai Wang, and Mr. David Dube. The judge finds that the defendants failed to demonstrate that the depositions were unwarranted or would cause undue burden or expense. The judge orders the defendants to provide a new witness (PMQ) to testify on two specific topics: ADCC release tests performed on PPQ batches of isatuximab and the locations where ADCC testing was performed. The judge also orders the parties to meet and confer to schedule the deposition.
