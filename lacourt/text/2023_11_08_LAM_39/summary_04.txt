And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Leslie Lopez, et al. v. Advanced Surgical Institute, APC, et al. (Case No. 22STCV22680). The defendants, Advanced Surgical Institute, APC, and Mohamad Afraciab, have moved to be relieved, citing good cause. The Court grants the motion, but with conditions. The Court orders an Order to Show Cause why the defendant should not be struck from the case, as they cannot appear without counsel. The OSC hearing will be held on January 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. If the defendant does not have counsel by the hearing date, or if a prospective attorney does not appear at the hearing, the Court will strike the answer of the defendant, allowing the plaintiff to seek entry of default and default judgment. Counsel must serve a copy of the minute order and the Court's signed order on the clients, and file proof of service with the Court. Once counsel complies with the order, they will be automatically relieved without further order of the Court.
