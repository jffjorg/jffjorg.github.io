FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS



 
MOVING
PARTY:               Plaintiff Winstress
Limited
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On February
17, 2022, Plaintiff, Winstress Limited, filed a Complaint for breach of lease
agreement against Defendants Yolanda E. Wilber (“Wilber”) and Alejandro Jose
Guerrero (“Guerrero”).  Plaintiff is the
landlord and Defendants are the tenants of the certain real property located at
1186 S. Crocker Street, Los Angeles, California 90021
 
            On May 31,
2022, the clerk of the court entered default as to Guerrero. 
 
On August 5, 2022, the court set
aside the default against Guerrero. 
 
            On May 25, 2023, the court granted Plaintiff’s
motion for summary adjudication on nine of twelve issues.  The remaining three issues were: (1) the
amount of rent that Defendants owed to Plaintiff pursuant to the Lease, (2)
when Plaintiff took possession of the Premises, and (3) whether Plaintiff was
required to and failed to mitigate its damages.
 
            On November
1, 2023, the remaining issues were heard at trial.  On December 8, 2023, the court issues a
judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants.  The court awarded Plaintiff damages in the amount
of $193,163.00.
 
            On February
6, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs and
concurrently filed a Memorandum of Costs.
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
 
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
 With respect to attorney fees
and costs, unless they are specifically provided for by statute (e.g., Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 1032, et seq.), the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and
counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the
parties.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.)¿ The prevailing party on a contract, which
specifically provides for attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the
agreement, is entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.¿
(Civ. Code § 1717, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(A).)¿
The court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall determine the prevailing
party and shall fix, as an element of the costs of suit, the reasonable
attorney fees.¿ (Civ. Code § 1717, subds. (a), (b).)¿ Any notice of motion to
claim attorney fees as an element of costs under shall be served and filed
before or at the same time the memorandum of costs is served and filed; if only
attorney fees are claimed as costs, the notice of motion shall be served and
filed within the time specified in CRC 3.1700 for filing a memorandum of
costs.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1702; Gunlock Corp. v. Walk on Water,
Inc. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303, fn. 1.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“It is well established that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence
of an abuse of discretion. [Citation.]”¿ (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily
“begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”¿ (Graciano v. Robinson
Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)¿ “[A] computation of
time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a
determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.”¿ (Margolin v. Reg’l
Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.)¿ The lodestar figure may
then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.¿
(See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing factors
relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].)¿ Such an approach anchors the trial
court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney’s
services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary.¿ (Id. at p.
48, fn. 23.)¿ The factors considered in determining the modification of the
lodestar include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.”  (Mountjoy
v. Bank of Am. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 271.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence.¿ (Premier Medical Management
Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th
550, 564.)¿ General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or
unrelated do not suffice.¿ (Ibid.)¿ 
 
III.       DISCUSSION           
            
            Plaintiff
moves the court to recover $54,942.50 in attorneys’ fees and $4,111.67 in costs
pursuant to the Lease Agreement. 
Paragraph 31 of the Lease Agreement provides:
 
If any Party or
Broker brings an action or proceeding to enforce the terms hereof or declare
rights hereunder, the Prevailing Party (as hereafter defined) in any such
proceeding, action, or appeal thereon, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorneys' fees. Such fees may be awarded in the same suit or recovered in a
separate suit, whether or not such action or proceeding is pursued to decision
or judgment. The term "Prevailing Party" shall include, without
limitation, a Party or Broker who substantially obtains or defeats the relief
sought, as the case may be, whether by compromise, settlement, Judgment, or the
abandonment by the other Party or Broker of its claim or defense. The
attorneys' fee award shall not be computed in accordance with any court fee
schedule, but shall be such as to fully reimburse all attorneys' fees
reasonably incurred. Lessor shall be entitled to attorney’s fees, costs and
expenses incurred in preparation and service of notices of Default and
consultations in connection therewith, whether or not a legal action is
subsequently commenced in connection with such Default or resulting Breach.
Broker(s) shall he intended third party beneficiaries of this Paragraph 31.” 
 
(Soroudi Decl.,
¶ 15; Shakouri Decl., ¶ 19; Ex. A.)
 
            As
the prevailing party, Plaintiff is entitled to an award of fees and costs.  Plaintiff seeks to recover for the following
hourly rates:
 

Michael
     A. Shakouri:  $400 x 15.4 hours;
     $425 x 51.3 hours
Michaela
     Heil: $325 x 77.4 hours
Daniel
     L. Goodkin: $495 x 1 hour
Karen
     Torres: $95 x 5 hours


Law
     Clerk: $95 x 9 hours

 
The court finds that the rates
requested by Plaintiff¿are¿reasonable and¿commensurate with or lower than rates
charged by attorneys with comparable skills and expertise.  In addition,
the court’s review of the Declaration of Michael Shakhouri (in support of the
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs), its description of the attorneys’ years
of experience, the accompanying exhibits, the elimination of duplicative and
repetitive entries, and the arguments and evidence brought forth by Plaintiff
leads to the conclusion that the attorneys’ fees as requested are reasonable.
Defendants, having not filed an opposition to the Motion, do
not offer any argument that the rates and fees are unreasonable, or that any of
the claimed costs are objectionable.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
The Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and
Costs is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is awarded the
total sum of $59,054.17, consisting of $54,942.50 in attorneys’ fees and $4,111.76
in costs.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
