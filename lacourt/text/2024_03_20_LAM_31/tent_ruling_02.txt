MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, 
OR
IN THE ALTERNATIVE, SUMMARY ADJUDICATION



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
JMF Pershing Square, LLC 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
            
I.          BACKGROUND           
 
            This
case is a commercial unlawful detainer (“UD”) action by Plaintiff JMF Pershing
Square, LLC (“Plaintiff”) against Defendant Home Furniture International, LLC (“Defendant”)
for possession of residential real property located at 448 S. Hill Street,
Suite 1101-1112, in Los Angeles (the “Property”). 
 
On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a verified UD complaint against Defendant. 
 
On March 1, 2024, Defendant filed its
answer to Plaintiff’s UD complaint. 
 
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed this
motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative summary adjudication against
Defendant pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1170.7 and 437c. 
 
            The
motion is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
In a UD proceeding, a “motion for summary judgment may be
made at any time after the answer is filed upon giving five-days notice.
Summary judgment shall be granted or denied on the same basis as a motion under
Section 437c.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1170.7.) 
 
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment “is to provide
courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to
determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.”¿ (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843; Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)¿ A plaintiff reaches its
burden on summary judgment by showing prima facie evidence for each
element of its cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc, § 437c, subd. (p); Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)  The
burden will then shift to the defendant to show the existence of a triable
issue of material fact for at least one element of the cause of action at
issue.  (Ibid.)
 
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment or summary adjudication and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”  (Dore v. Arnold
Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)  However, if all
inferences reasonably deducible from the submitted evidence are uncontradicted
by other inferences and there is no triable issue as to any material fact, the
moving party is entitled to summary adjudication as a matter of law.   (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c); Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) 
 
A
failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the
motion.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
8.54(c).) 
 III.           
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff moves for summary
judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication, on the ground that
Defendant continues to occupy the commercial leased premises located at the
Property despite having not paid Plaintiff any rent for the period from September
1, 2023 through February 1, 2024.  
To prevail on its motion for
summary judgment, Plaintiff needs to show prima facie evidence for each
element of its cause of action alleging UD.  (Code Civ. Proc, § 437c,
subd. (p); Scalf, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1519.)
The necessary elements for a cause
of action alleging commercial unlawful detainer are: (1) a verified complaint;
(2) facts on which the plaintiff seeks to recover; (3) a description of
premises with reasonable certainty; (4) the amount of rent in default if the
action is based on paragraph Code of Civil Procedure section 1161, subdivision
(2); and (5) the specific method used to serve the defendant with the notice or
notices of termination.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 1166.) A tenant of real property
is guilty of unlawful detainer “[w]hen the tenant continues in possession …
without the permission of the landlord … after default in the payment of rent,
pursuant to the lease or agreement under which the property is held, and three
days’ notice … in writing, requiring its payment … shall have been served upon
the tenant…”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161, subd. (2).) 
Here, Plaintiff’s evidence shows on
May 24, 2022, the parties executed a written lease agreement (the “Lease”) for the
Property.  (See Papazyan Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. 1.)  The term of the Lease
was from June 1, 2022 through July 31, 2024. 
(Id., Exh. 1, § 1.5.)  Rent
is due on the first day of each month. (Id.) The Lease provides
that as of August 1, 2023, rent is $17,300.00 per month, and that all monetary obligations
under the Lease are deemed rent, including parking charges.  (Id.,
§ 4.1.)  
On February 2, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
served Defendant with a three (3) day notice to pay rent or quit (the “Notice”)
for failure to pay rent in the estimated amount of $65,831.27 to cover the
period of September 1, 2023 through February 1, 2024.r.  (See Papazyan Decl.,
¶¶ 14, 17, Exh. 3.)  Plaintiff asserts the Notice was served by email,
Federal Express, certified mail return receipt requested, and regular mail as
provided in the Lease. (See Papazyan Decl., ¶ 17.)  Plaintiff
provides a copy of the account ledger for Defendant’s account (the “Account
Ledger”), which shows that Defendant are in default to Plaintiff in the total
amount of $65,831.27, as of February of 2024.  (See Papazyan Decl., ¶ 14,
15, Exh. 2.)  
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant did
not comply with the Notice directing payment of rent on or before February 9,
2024, which is the period stated in the Notice.  (See Papazyan Decl., ¶  20.)  Defendant
has not paid the rent due at any point after the three-day notice period
ended.  (Id., ¶  19.)  Defendant
remains in possession of the Property.  (Id.,
¶ 21.)  Plaintiff calculates that the Property’s
reasonable daily value is $576.66 based on the monthly rate under the
Lease.  (Id., ¶ 24.) 
Based on the foregoing evidence,
Plaintiff meets its initial summary judgment burden, and the burden shifts to
Defendant to show a triable issue of material facts.  (See Scalf, supra,
128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1519.)  Defendant has not filed opposition.
