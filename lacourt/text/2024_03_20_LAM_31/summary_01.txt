Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for attorneys' fees and costs filed by Winstress Limited, the prevailing party in the case. The motion seeks to recover $54,942.50 in attorneys' fees and $4,111.67 in costs incurred in enforcing the lease agreement. The judge finds that the hourly rates requested by Plaintiff are reasonable and commensurate with or lower than rates charged by attorneys with comparable skills and expertise. The court's review of the Declaration of Michael Shakhouri (in support of the Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs) and its description of the attorneys' years of experience, the accompanying exhibits, the elimination of duplicative and repetitive entries, and the arguments and evidence brought forth by Plaintiff leads to the conclusion that the attorneys' fees as requested are reasonable. The defendants did not file an opposition to the motion, so they do not offer any argument that the rates and fees are unreasonable, or that any of the claimed costs are objectionable. The total sum of $59,054.17, consisting of $54,942.50 in attorneys' fees and $4,111.76 in costs, is awarded to Plaintiff.
