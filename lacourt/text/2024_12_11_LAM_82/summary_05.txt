And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment filed by the California State Board of Pharmacy (Board). The Board is seeking to have the court dismiss a petition for writ of mandate filed by Yana Budnitsky, a pharmacist whose license was revoked and stayed with probation. The judge has granted the motion in part and denied it in part.

The judge has found that the petition to challenge the revocation decision of October 15, 2018, is time-barred because it was not filed within 30 days of the effective date of the decision. However, the judge has denied the motion to the extent it seeks to challenge the Board's Notice of Suspension issued on March 1, 2024, finding that there are triable issues related to whether the suspension is a final or interim administrative decision and whether Budnitsky was afforded adequate due process before the suspension was imposed.

The judge has also found that the Board failed to comply with Business and Professions Code section 494, which requires a 15-day notice of the hearing on the petition for an interim order, and has denied the motion to the extent it seeks to challenge the Board's decision to suspend Budnitsky's license without providing her with an opportunity to be heard.
