[1] The District did
not serve the motion on Petitioner’s counsel. 
However, a Commission employee emailed a copy of the motion to Petitioner’s
counsel on November 15, 2023, and invited Petitioner to respond by December 11,
2023, which he did.  (AR 898-899.)  


[2]
Petitioner states in his opening brief that “LAUSD terminated
Gomez’ employment solely based on a charge that Gomez violated Personnel
Commission Rule 902(A)(6), and (21).”  (OB
9:17-18.)  Petitioner is incorrect.  In
fact, the charges were based on Commission Rule 902(A)(4), (6), (21), and
(23).  (AR 961-965; see also AR
871.)
