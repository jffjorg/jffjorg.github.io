And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendants' petition to release the stale mechanics' lien and requests attorney's fees. The defendants, Ravit and Sharon Ohana, seek an order releasing the mechanics' lien from real property located at 4806 Topeka Avenue, Tarzana, California 91356. The plaintiff, Faustino Pacheco Morales, recorded the mechanics' lien on February 3, 2022, but failed to bring an action to enforce the lien within the 90-day window set forth under Civil Code section 8460. The defendants sent a written demand to release the mechanics' lien on August 12, 2022, and the plaintiff filed a complaint on August 15, 2022, which is six months after the recordation of the claim lien. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to commence an action to enforce the mechanics' lien within the mandatory 90-day window and therefore grants the petition to release the mechanics' lien. The court also awards the defendants $3,255.00 in attorney's fees.
