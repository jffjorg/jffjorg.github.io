BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Faustino
Pacheco Morales and Defendants
Ravit and Sharon Ohana entered into an agreement whereby Plaintiff was to
transport dirt from one of Defendants’ properties to another. Plaintiff
submitted invoices for payments; however, Defendants have failed to pay. 
 
On August 15, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint against
Defendants asserting causes of action for breach of contract, common counts,
and quantum meruit.  
 
Request for entry of default was entered February 14, 2023.
The court then denied Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment. Plaintiff
then sought request for entry of default again on June 12, 2023. 
 
On April 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint. Request for entry of default was again entered June 12, 2023 for
Ravit Ohana and June 15, 2023 for Sharon Ohana. The court entered default
judgment on November 9, 2023. On March 13, 2024, the court set aside the entry
of default and default judgment. 
 
Ravit and Sharon Ohana filed a cross-complaint against
Plaintiff for violation of Business and Professions Code §7031 on March 25,
2024. 
 
[TENTATIVE] RULING:
 
Defendants’ Petition to Release Stale Mechanics’ Lien and
Request for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants Ravit Ohana and Sharon Ohana will petition the
Court for: (1) an order releasing the stale mechanics lien recorded by
Plaintiff Faustino Pacheco Morales; and (2) an order awarding Defendants
$4,380.00 in attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to Civil Code § 8488.
 
After a mechanic’s lien has been recorded, “[t]he owner of
property or the owner of any interest in property subject to a claim of lien
may petition the court for an order to release the property from the claim of
lien if the claimant has not commenced an action to enforce the lien within the
time provided in Section 8460.”¿ (Civ. Code, § 8480(a).)¿ A claimant must
commence an action to enforce a lien within 90 days of recording the lien,
otherwise, “the claim of lien expires and is unenforceable.”¿ (Civ. Code, §
8460(a).)¿ However, the 90-day time limit to commence an action to enforce a
lien does not apply if there was an agreement to extend credit and a notice of
that fact was recorded within 90 days after recordation of the claim of lien or
more than 90 days after recordation of the claim of lien but before a purchaser
or encumbrancer for value and in good faith acquires rights in the property.¿
(Civ. Code, § 8460(b).)¿ 
 
Defendants Ravit Ohana and Sharon Ohana seeks an order
releasing the Mechanics’ Lien from real property located at 4806 Topeka Avenue,
Tarzana, California 91356 (the “Property”). 
 
Plaintiff recorded the Mechanics’ Lien against the Property
on February 3, 2022.  (See Petition, Exh.
3.)  Plaintiff thereafter failed to bring
an action to enforce the Mechanics’ Lien within 90 days, as required under
Civil Code section 8460. 
 
On August 12, 2022, Defendants sent Plaintiff a written
demand to release the Mechanics’ Lien. 
(See Petition, Exhs. 1-2.)  Following
a discussion with Plaintiff’s counsel, Plaintiff’s filed their complaint on
August 15, 2022. This is six months from the recordation of the claim lien,
well over the 90 day requirement.   
 
As Plaintiff failed to commence an action to enforce the
Mechanics’ Lien within the mandatory 90-day window set forth under Civil Code
section 8460, Defendants are entitled to an order releasing the Mechanics’ Lien
from the Property.  (See Civ. Code, §
8460 (a).)  The Petition will be granted,
and the Mechanics’ Lien will be released. 
 
Petitioner is entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys'
fees.  (See Civ. Code, § 8488 (c)
(prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees); see PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096 (court awards reasonable attorneys’
fees according to the lodestar).)
 
Here, counsel for Defendants states that their rate is $450.00/hour
and that she spent 6.1 hours researching and drafting the petition, anticipates
2.5 hours reviewing and analyzing Plaintiff’s opposition, 1 hour appearing for
the hearing, and spent $60 on filing fees, for a total of $4,380.00. 
 
The court award the attorney fees in the reduced amount of,
$3,255.00. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ petition for release of mechanics’
lien from real property located at 4806 Topeka Avenue, Tarzana, California
91356 recorded on February 3, 2022, by Plaintiff is GRANTED and the mechanics’
lien is hereby RELEASED. 
 
Defendants are AWARDED its costs and reasonable attorneys’
fees against Plaintiff in the total amount of $3,255.00.  These sanctions are payable within 30 days of
this order.
