And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns the case of Pary Al Zahawi vs. Jouriy Grkikian, DDS and Y2K Dentistry. The defendants filed a demurrer with motion to strike the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff's cause of action for medical malpractice is uncertain and time-barred. The court grants the defendants' request for judicial notice of related documents. The court finds that the plaintiff was on notice of the alleged negligence more than a year prior to filing the complaint, and therefore the claim is barred by the statute of limitations. The court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend. The court also grants the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages, as the demurrer is sustained.
