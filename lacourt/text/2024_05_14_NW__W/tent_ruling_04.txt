for Damages filed in another case, Pary al Zahawi v. Jouriy Grkikian, et al.,

January 30, 2024.
 
The court
GRANTS Defendants’ request for judicial notice. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendants Jouriy Grkikian, DDS and Y2K
Dentistry demur to Plaintiff’s complaint on the grounds Plaintiff’s cause of
action for medical malpractice is uncertain and time barred. 
 
A cause of action arising out of the
alleged professional negligence of a healthcare provider is governed by the
statute of limitations set forth in section 340.5 of the Code of Civil
Procedure. (Drexler v. Petersen (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 1181, 1189.) Except
under certain exceptions not applicable here, such a cause of action must be
brought either (1) within one year of the date plaintiff discovers, or through
the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, or (2)
within three years of the injury, whichever comes first. (Code Civ. Proc., §
340.5.) Under this ‘discovery rule,’ “the statute of limitations begins to run
when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that her injury was caused by
wrongdoing, that someone has done something wrong to her.” (Jolly v. Eli
Lilly & Co. (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1103, 1110.) The rule contains “two
alternate tests for triggering the limitations period,” one subjective, and the
other objective. (Kitzig v. Nordquist (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1391.)
Under the subjective test, the one-year limitations period begins to run when
“the plaintiff discovers both his or her injury and its negligent cause.” (Drexler,
supra, 4 Cal.App.5th at p. 1189.) Under the objective test, the limitations
period begins to run when the plaintiff “has notice or information of
circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry.” (Jolly, supra, 44
Cal.3d at p. 1110-11.) It is not necessary under either test, however, that the
plaintiff be aware of the “specific facts necessary to establish the claim.” (Id.
at p. 1111.) 
 
Defendants argue the “general
negligence” cause of action is vague and insufficient on the grounds
Plaintiff’s conclusory allegations that Defendant failed to act within the
standard of care provides zero insight as to what standard of care was
allegedly breached and how any such breach occurred. While the complaint might
be bare, demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and should only be sustained
where the complaint is so uncertain that the demurring defendant cannot
reasonably respond thereto. (See Khoury v. Maly's of Calif., Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Plaintiff's Complaint is not so uncertain that
Defendant cannot reasonably respond thereto. 
 
Defendants next argue Plaintiff’s
claims are barred by the statute of limitations. According to Defendants, Plaintiff
clearly confirms her understanding on each of the dates identified in 2019,
2020, 2021 and 2022 that she had sustained injury/damage as a result of the
alleged negligent rendering of dental services by the Defendants. She also
specifically states that between July 30, 2020 and June 9, 2022, no less than 7
dentists had reportedly informed her that the dental work done by the
Defendants was a “bad job.” As such she was clearly aware of the alleged
negligence (“bad job”) of the Defendants more than 1 year prior to the filing
of the Complaint, on February 27, 2024. Defendants contend the alleged
discovery in 2023 of additional alleged breaches of the standard of care by the
Defendants does not negate that the Plaintiff was placed on inquiry notice of
dental malpractice well more than a year prior to when suit was filed. 
 
Plaintiff argues they have a five-year
warranty and Defendants have refused to honor it. This argument does not
counter Defendants’ contention that the medical malpractice claim is barred. As
noted above, under the subjective test, the one-year limitations period begins
to run when “the plaintiff discovers both his or her injury and its negligent
cause.” (Drexler, supra, 4 Cal.App.5th at p. 1189.) Under the objective
test, the limitations period begins to run when the plaintiff “has notice or
information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry.” (Jolly,
supra, 44 Cal.3d at p. 1110-11.) It is not necessary under either test,
however, that the plaintiff be aware of the “specific facts necessary to
establish the claim.” (Id. at p. 1111.) As alleged, Plaintiff was
aware of the alleged negligence well before one year of the filing of this
complaint. Plaintiff continuing to seek help in fixing the alleged injury does
not extend Plaintiff’s inquiry notice. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the
complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
Motion to Strike 
 
Defendants move to strike Plaintiff’s
prayer for punitive damages. As the court has sustained without leave
Defendants’ demurrer, the motion to strike is MOOT. The court notes Plaintiff
also improperly added a prayer for punitive damages pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.13.
