BACKGROUND
 
On
December 22, 2023, Plaintiffs Connie Brockman a/k/a Constance Brockman (“Mrs.
Brockman”), an individual and trustee of The Brockman Trust Dated October 24,
2000 (“Brockman Trust”), and trustee of the Provident Trust Group, LLC FBO: Connie
Brockman Solo 401K (“Provident”); and Adam Brockman as trustee of the Adam and
Charity Brockman Trust Dated 9-28-07 (“ACBT”) filed a complaint against
Defendants Kravetz Capital Funding, LLC, Norman J. Kravetz, Douglas Jacobsen and
Diversified Business Operations (“DBO”) for breach of written contract,
fraudulent inducement – misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, breach
of oral contract, and quantum meruit. Plaintiffs allege they provided Defendant
Kravetz with $1,110,000.00 to be repaid by Defendants who made interest
payments on each of the Promissory Notes. After Defendants defaulted on the
Notes in 2022, Defendants made repeated assurances to Plaintiffs that they
would repay them. Plaintiffs allege to date, they have not. 
 
On
February 14, 2024, Kravetz Capital Funding, LLC, Norman J. Kravetz, Douglas Jacobsen
filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiffs for usury. 
 
[Tentative]
Ruling
 
 Plaintiff’s
Writ of Attachment is GRANTED. 
 
OBJECTIONS
 
Plaintiffs submit evidentiary objections to the
declaration of Norman J. Kravetz. Objection Nos 1-3 are OVERRULED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiffs
request the court grant the Application and issue a Right to Attach Order and a
Writ of Attachment against Defendants Kravetz Capital Funding, LLC, Norman J.
Kravetz, Douglas Jacobsen on the grounds Plaintiffs’ Applications
meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 483.010. 
 
A writ of attachment may be issued only
in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a
contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is
a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars
($500). (CCP §483.010(a).) A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the amount
due may be clearly ascertained from the contract and calculated by evidence;
the fact that damages are unliquidated is not determinative. (CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 [attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment].) 
 
The application shall be executed under
oath and must include: (1) a statement showing that the attachment is sought to
secure the recovery on a claim upon which an attachment may be issued; (2) a
statement of the amount to be secured by the attachment; (3) a statement that
the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim
upon which the attachment is based;  (4)
a statement that the applicant has no information or belief that the claim is
discharged or that the prosecution of the action is stayed in a proceeding
under the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. section 101 et seq.); and  (5) a description of the property to be
attached under the writ of attachment and a statement that the plaintiff is informed
and believes that such property is subject to attachment. (CCP § 484.020.) Code
Civil Procedure section 487.010(a) provides that “[w]here the defendant is a corporation,
all corporate property for which a method of levy is provided” is subject to
attachment.
 
“The declarations in the moving papers
must contain evidentiary facts, stated ‘with particularity,’ and based on
actual personal knowledge with all documentary evidence properly identified and
authenticated.” (Hobbs v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 79-80 [citing CCP
§ 482.040].) “In contested applications, the court must consider the relative
merits of the positions of the respective parties and make a determination
of¿the probable outcome of the litigation.” (Id. at p. 80.) 
 
Procedural Issues 
 
In reply, Plaintiffs note Defendant’s
opposition is untimely. The court agrees the opposition has been untimely
filed. However, given Plaintiff’s ability to respond to the opposition, the
court continues to hear the opposition. 
 
Probable Validity of Plaintiff’s Claim 
 
As noted above, the court may issue an
attachment on a claim for money arising under contract, so long as the amount
claimed by the party seeking attachment is reasonably ascertainable in an
amount greater than $500.00.  (CCP §
483.010 (a).) 
 
Here, Plaintiffs allege a breach of
written contract claim against each of the Defendants. Plaintiffs provide
copies of each Note entered into: October 1, 2015 Promissory Note between
Defendant Kravetz Capital Funding, LLC (“Kravetz Capital”) and the Brockman
Trust (the “First Note”); October 29, 2015 Promissory Note between ACBT and
Kravetz Capital (the “Second Note”); December 1, 2015 Promissory Note between
Provident and Kravetz Capital (the “Third Note”); and March 22, 2017 Promissory
Note between Linda R. Asher and Kravetz Capital (the “Fourth Note”) along with
the Commercial Guaranty’s. (Exhs. 1-8.) For Plaintiffs’ oral agreement with
DBO, Plaintiff presents the declaration of Connie Brockman, trustee of
Plaintiff The Brockman Trust Dated October 24, 2000 (the “Brockman Trust”) and
Plaintiff Provident Trust Group, LLC FBO: the Connie Brockman Solo 401k
(“Provident”). Ms. Brockman testifies she agreed to provide DBO with accounting
services as an independent contractor at the request of Defendants Norman
Kravetz and Douglas Jacobsen (the “Individual Defendants”), in their capacities
as a principals of DBO, in exchange for DBO’s promise to pay me for my services.
(C. Brockman Decl. ¶21.) Accordingly, Ms. Brockman prepared and sent DBO
monthly invoices for her accounting services and initially, DBO paid her the
amounts owed. (Brockman ¶22, Exh. 16.) Ms. Brockman testifies Defendants
breached the agreements and guarantees by failing to make payments thereunder,
which caused Plaintiffs to suffer damages in at least the amount of $1,674,297.39,
or in the alternative, $1,484,630.94 resulting from Defendant Kravetz, DBO and
the Individual Defendants’ breach of the Notes and guarantees thereof, and
DBO’s breach of the Oral Contract. (C. Brockman Decl. ¶¶24-25; A. Brockman ¶18;
COE Exh. 19; Koczara Decl. ¶7.) 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claim is of a type for which attachment
may be issued. (See CCP § 483.010 (a).  Additionally, Plaintiff’s
submitted evidence is sufficient to establish the probable validity of
Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim. (See Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178 (necessary elements for breach of
contract are: (1) valid contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance obligations
thereunder; (3) defendant’s breach; and (4) damages).)

 
In opposition, Defendants argue Plaintiffs have not demonstrated
“probable validity” of their claims. According to Defendants, because each of
the Notes provides for interest at a rate of 12% per annum, Plaintiffs are only
entitled to repayment of the principal amount. All payments made by Defendants
are required to be credited against the principal balance. As Plaintiffs have
not taken into account the impact of such usurious interest on their claims, Plaintiffs
have not established that it is more likely than not that they will obtain
judgment on their claims.
 
Defendants in their intro point out Plaintiffs have not submitted
an Application for Right to Attach Order and Order for Issuance of Writ of
Attachment against defendant Douglas Jacobsen (“Jacobsen”). In reply,
Plaintiffs state that’s wrong and Plaintiffs filed and served the Application
as to Defendant Jacobsen on April 17, 2024 and received a conformed copy of
this Application on same day with a timestamp of 10:48 a.m. The applications
shows up on eCourt on May 3, 2024.
 
The parties dispute whether Defendants
may use the defense of usury. Plaintiffs argue Defendant Kravetz and the
Individual Parties – sophisticated business parties - authored the Notes and
the Guaranties to include the interest rates set forth therein. Based on these
terms, Plaintiffs provided the requested funds. Defendants are therefore
estopped from citing the very interest rate they drafted as a usury defense to
avoid attachment altogether for their failure to adhere to their contractual
obligations. (See Lakeview Meadows Ranch v. Bintliff (1973) 36 Cal.App.3d
418, 420; see also Fitch v. Pacific Fid. Life Ins. Co. (1975) 54
Cal.App.3d 140, 148.) 
 
In opposition, Defendants argue mere
“authorship” of a note by a borrower does not give rise to a defense of
estoppel. (Martin v. Ajaz Const. Co. (1954) 124 Cal.App.2d 425, 431
(“The findings that [borrower and guarantors] solicited the money and they
prepared the contract for its repayment . . . do not diminish the rigor of
usury.”) 
 
The court agrees case law supports a
finding that a borrower who suggested and initiated loan terms and the interest
rate is not always estopped from claiming that loan is usurious. In the cases
cited by Plaintiff, the court found estoppel of the usury defense may exist
when the plaintiff either relied on the drafter of the agreement and believed
the defendant would draft the agreement according to law, when the borrower misrepresented
to an inexperienced lender his intention to repay and value of property
securing loan, or when the drafter fraudulently insert a usurious rate of
interest for the purpose of defeating an action for interest on the note. (See Lakeview
Meadows Ranch, supra, 36 Cal.App.3d at p. 425; Buck v. Dahlgren
(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 779, 789; Paillet v. Vroman (1942) 52 Cal.App.2d
297.) Here, Plaintiff does not argue they relied on Defendant when drafting the
agreement or that Defendant fraudulently inserted the usurious rate. 
 
However, based on Defendants admitted
default on the Notes, Plaintiffs satisfy their initial burden to establish the
probable validity of their claims.  In
order to defeat this showing, Defendants must present evidence that it is more
likely than not or equally likely that they will defeat Plaintiffs claims based
on their defense of usury.  They have
not. 
 
Amount to be Secured 
 
As noted above, “an attachment may be
issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based
upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or
claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars
($500) exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney's fees.”  (CCP § 483.010(a).)  “An attachment may not be issued on a claim
which is secured by any interest in real property arising from agreement
….”  (CCP § 483.010(b).)   
 
“It is a well-recognized rule of law in
this state that an attachment will lie upon a cause of action for damages for a
breach of contract where the damages are readily ascertainable by reference to
the contract and the basis of the computation of damages appears to be
reasonable and definite. [Citations.] The fact that the damages are
unliquidated is not determinative. [Citations.] But the contract sued on must
furnish a standard by which the amount due may be clearly ascertained and there
must exist a basis upon which the damages can be determined by proof.’¿” (See CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc. (2004) 115 Cal.App. 4th
537, 541.)    
 
Plaintiffs argue the amounts owed are
readily ascertainable from the contracts attached to Plaintiff's Declaration
including the Notes, Guaranties, and Invoices. Plaintiffs contend Defendant
Kravetz is liable for its default of the First Note of $400,000.00, and monthly
interest and late fees as of October 2022 totaling $75,600.00. (C. Brockman
Dec. ¿ 24.) Defendant Kravetz is liable under the Second Note in
the amount of $200,000.00, plus monthly interest and late fees as of October 2022
totaling $37,800.00. (C. Brockman Dec. ¿ 24.)
Under the Third Note, Defendant Kravetz liable is in the amount of $325,000,
plus monthly interest and late fees as of October 2022 totaling $61,425.00. (C.
Brockman Dec. ¿ 24.) Under the Fourth Note, Defendant Kravetz is liable in the
amount of $185,000, plus monthly interest and late fees as of October 2022
totaling $34,965, for a total of $1,110,000.00 owing in principal amounts and
$209,790.00 in interest and late fees under all Notes. (C. Brockman Dec. ¿ 24.) The Individual Defendants are liable for each of these
amounts pursuant to the Guaranties. Plaintiffs have also modified the interest and
late fee amounts due per the express provision of the Notes is as follows:
$63,000.00 pursuant to the First Note; $31,500.06 pursuant to the Second Note;
$51,187.44 pursuant the Third Note; $29,137.56 pursuant to the Fourth Note, for
a total of $174,825.06. (C. Brockman Dec. ¿ 24.) In
sum, Plaintiffs are each entitled attachment as follows: $408,333.06 on the
First Note, $398,263.11 on the Second and Fourth Notes, $194,096.11 on the
Third Note, and $33,498.50 on the DBO Oral Breach. Plaintiffs also seek $321,681.89in
attorney fees and costs. (Koczara Dec. ¶ 7.) 
 
In opposition, Defendants argue several
years of interest at a usurious rate have been paid by Defendants to
Plaintiffs. Furthermore, Defendants are entitled to recover all usurious
interest payments made in the 2 years preceding the date of Plaintiff’s
Complaint. (Civ. Code § 1916-3(a).) As such, this needs to be taken into
account when determining the amount of Plaintiffs’ claims, making the amount of
the claims not readily ascertainable. Furthermore, while Defendants concede “usury
savings clause” is contained in the promissory notes submitted by Plaintiffs, Defendants
dispute that such usury savings clause is valid. Defendants contend they do not
appear until the third and fourth notes and therefore, it does not affect any
of the Loans before it first appears in the applicable Notes, and all payments
on such Loans before the addition of the usury savings clause language are
deemed to be payments of principal. 
 
The court finds the amount readily
ascertainable. As noted by Plaintiffs, it is not required to fix the amount of
its damages with certainty at this juncture. (See Bringas v. Sullivan
(1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 693, 699 (the attachment statute “does not suggest that
the amount owing must be fixed with absolute certainty”) (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted).) Rather, “an attachment is proper although the
exact amount due is unknown to the attaching party.” (Id.) Here, we know
Defendants’ payment obligations under the Note and DBO Contract and what the
reduced interest rate is. 
 
Reduced Amount
 
Defendants argue the amount of any RTAO
must be reduced by Defendants’ cross-claims. (CCP § 483.015(b).) Specifically, Defendants
have established cross-claims totaling not less than $36,000.00 on the Brockman
Trust Note, $29,250.00 on the Provident Note, $18,000 on the ACBT Note and
$16,560 on the Asher Note). 
 
The amount to be secured by an
attachment shall be reduced by the sum of (1) the amount of indebtedness that
the defendant has in a money judgment against plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed
in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown would be subject to
attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any security interest
held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together with the amount by
which the acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the security interest)
have decreased that security interest’s value. 
(CCP §483.015(b).) A defendant claiming that the amount to be secured should be
reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must make a prima
facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment against the
plaintiff. (Lydig Construction, Inc. v. Martinez Steel (2015) 234
Cal.App.4th 937; Pos-A-Traction, Inc. v. Kelly Springfield (C.D. Cal.
(1999) 112 F.Supp.2d 1178, 1183.)
 
Defendants have failed to present a prima
facie claim of offset. Defendants do not provide any documentation
supporting Defendants’ contention they overpaid interest. Defendants do not
provide any documentation reconciling the overpaid interest with the 10%
interest. 
 
Moreover, Defendants argue the amount
of legal fees and costs secured by the RTAO must be reduced. Pursuant to Los
Angeles Superior Court Rule 3.214(a), when a promissory note provides for the
recovery of attorneys’ fees the amount allowed (in cases where the damages are
in excess of $100,000, is $5,270 plus 2% of the excess over $100,000. Accordingly,
Defendants argue that based on that formula Plaintiffs are, at most, entitled
to attorneys’ fees of $29,665.80.
 
“In the discretion of the court, the
amount to be secured by the attachment may include an estimated amount for
costs and allowable attorney's fees.” (CCP § 482.110.) The court agrees
that under this provision Plaintiff will be entitled to reasonable attorneys’
fees if it prevails.  However, Plaintiff’s estimated attorneys’ fees of $76,809.02
are not reasonable.  Local Rule 3.214(a) states that “[w]hen a promissory
note, contract, or statute provides for the recovery of reasonable attorneys’
fees,” the following formula will be used to calculate fees in a contested case
over $100,000: $2,890 plus 1% of the excess over $100,000. Accordingly, the court
limits Plaintiff’s estimated attorney’s fees to $30,000.00.  The court
also limits Plaintiff’s estimated costs to $2,672.87 in incurred costs and
$3,000 in estimated costs (Koczara Decl. ¶¶5-6.)
 
Exemption
 
Plaintiffs argue Kravetz’s claims of
exemption should be denied. Specifically, Kravetz is not entitled to the
homestead exemption of the entire value of the property. At most, he is
entitled to an exemption in the maximum amount of $600,000.00. Moreover, Kravetz
generally claims the motor vehicles exemption under Code of Civil Procedure §
704.010 (for his Bentley and Cadillac Escalade), which authorizes up to
$7,500.00 of the aggregate value in motor vehicles as exempt. However, the
Kravetz Statement of Financial Condition self-reports his net worth much
higher. Lastly, with respect to Kravetz’s “necessities of life” exemption, he
fails to show how the amounts Plaintiffs are seeking to levy on are necessary
for his or his family’s support.
 
As for the homestead exemption, the
amount of the homestead exemption is limited to either $300,00.00 or
$600,000.00, depending on the median countywide home price.  (See CCP § 704.730 (a).)  Accordingly, the court applies the exemption
in the amount of $600,000.00.
 
As for the ‘necessities of life’
exemption, the court finds Defendants have not shown that his income and liquid
assets are insufficient to cover the reasonable expenses necessary to support
him and his family. (CCP §703.115.) The exemption is denied.
