And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants the petition of defendants Ravit Ohana and Sharon Ohana to release a stale mechanics' lien recorded by plaintiff Faustino Pacheco Morales. The lien was recorded on February 3, 2022, but plaintiff failed to bring an action to enforce the lien within 90 days as required by Civil Code section 8460. Despite a written demand to release the lien, plaintiff failed to take action. As a result, the court finds that the lien has expired and is unenforceable. The court also awards defendants $3,255.00 in attorney's fees for their efforts in seeking to release the lien.
