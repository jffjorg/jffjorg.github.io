And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the Plaintiff's Writ of Attachment, as the Plaintiff's Application meets the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 483.010. The judge finds that the amount of the claim is readily ascertainable and that the Plaintiff has demonstrated probable validity of their claims. The judge also finds that the Defendant's defense of usury is not valid and that the Plaintiff's claims are not barred by the defense of usury.

The judge limits the amount of attorney's fees to $30,000.00 and the amount of costs to $2,672.87. The judge also denies the Defendant's claim of exemption for homestead and necessities of life.
