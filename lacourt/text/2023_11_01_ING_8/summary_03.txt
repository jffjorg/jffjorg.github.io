Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to compel further responses to discovery requests is continued to a date to be discussed after a court-ordered meet-and-confer process. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not sufficiently met and conferred prior to filing the motion, and that the defendant has produced some responsive documents but has not fully complied with the discovery requests. The judge sets forth parameters for what is typically ordered in a Song-Beverly consumer warranty case, including the production of certain documents and information. The judge also notes that the parties will need to discuss the scope of permissible discovery and the format for production of documents.
