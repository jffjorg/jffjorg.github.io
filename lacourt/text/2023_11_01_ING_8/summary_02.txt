Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to transfer the case to a different court. The plaintiff had argued that the case was related to another case pending in Torrance and that transferring the case would promote the ends of justice. However, the judge found that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the earlier-filed and lower-numbered Inglewood case because it was removed to federal court and the federal district judge denied the plaintiff's motion to remand. The judge also found that the plaintiff was engaged in forum shopping and that transferring the case would not serve the interests of justice.
