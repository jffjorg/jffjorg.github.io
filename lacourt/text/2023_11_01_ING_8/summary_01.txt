And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the defendant's motion for new trial or to set aside judgment and has found that the defendant has failed to present sufficient evidence to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial. The Court is willing to consider the defendant's mistake and neglect in failing to make arrangements to attend the trial in person on August 1, 2023, but the defendant must satisfy certain conditions in order to set aside the judgment.

The conditions include:

1. The defendant must be sworn as a witness at the hearing on this motion and explain to the satisfaction of the Court how he had sufficient funds to travel to Torrance, California by September 14 but was unable to travel to Inglewood on August 1, 2023 to attend trial.
2. The defendant must specify a date during the week of November 20 (before Thanksgiving) or November 28-December 1 when he could attend in person a trial commencing at 10:30 a.m. in Inglewood.
3. The defendant must not seek to change his previous stipulation to have a court trial rather than a jury trial of this matter.
4. The defendant must email to Plaintiff's counsel copies of any exhibits he intends to use for the upcoming trial no later than 5 calendar days before that trial date.
5. The defendant must agree to pay to Mr. Christy the amount the Court determines to be the reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by Mr. Christy's counsel for the August 1 trial and the post-trial filings, including Plaintiff's opposition to this Motion. That amount shall be paid before the trial commences.

The Court has also required the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the amount of reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the plaintiff's counsel for the August 1 trial and the post-trial filings.
