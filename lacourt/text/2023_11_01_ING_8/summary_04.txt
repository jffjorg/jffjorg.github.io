Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is issued by the judge regarding the motion for contempt against defendant David Avedon and the motion for a permanent injunction. The case has been pending for over 25 years, and multiple judges have attempted to address the dispute. The defendant has repeatedly violated court orders, and the plaintiffs have sought contempt proceedings and permanent injunctions.

The judge grants the motion for contempt in part, setting a hearing on an Order to Show Cause re contempt, but requires additional evidence before ordering the defendant to be held in contempt. The judge denies the motion for a permanent injunction without prejudice to being renewed in the future depending on the defendant's actions or inactions.

The judge notes that the parties' frustration with the litigation process is understandable, but the current judge's approach requires an education process. The judge will allow oral argument regarding the lack of evidence and whether the parties should solicit the help of their neutral arborist again.
