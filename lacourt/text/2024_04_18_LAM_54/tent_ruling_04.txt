[1] At oral argument on
April 4, 2024, Defendant objected to declarations filed by Plaintiff in
opposition to the motion because the declarations failed to state they were
made "under penalty of perjury." Plaintiff says this was a
typographical error and filed corrected declarations on April 8, 2024. In
supplemental briefing the parties agree that this error and the filing of
corrected declarations caused no prejudice. The Court considers the corrected
declarations, except the Court does not consider the last sentence in paragraph
9 of Plaintiff’s corrected declaration, which was not included in the original
declaration.
