And here is the English-text summary:

On April 18, 2024, Judge Maurice A. Leiter issued a tentative ruling in the case of Zia Abhari and Donya Entertainment, Inc. v. Farmers Insurance Exchange and Truck Insurance Exchange. The case concerns a breach of fiduciary duty by the defendants, which led to the closing of a business. Plaintiffs moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the defendants' denials were "sham denials" and that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court denied the motion, ruling that the defendants' denials raised a material issue and that the extrinsic evidence relied upon by the plaintiffs was not properly before the court.
