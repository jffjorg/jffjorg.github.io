BACKGROUND
                
On August 1, 2022, Plaintiffs Zia
Abhari and Donya Entertainment, Inc. sued Defendants Farmers Insurance Exchange
and Truck Insurance Exchange, asserting causes of action for breach of
fiduciary duty. Plaintiffs allege Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to
Plaintiffs by failing to inspect the premises of the business Plaintiff
purchased. Plaintiffs allege that had Defendants properly inspected the
premises, they would have seen contaminated water intrusion defects that later
led to the closing of the business. 
 
REQUEST FOR
JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Plaintiffs’ requests for judicial
notice Parts I and III are DENIED as matters not properly subject to judicial
notice. Plaintiffs’ request for judicial notice Part II is GRANTED as to the
existence of the documents, but not as to the truth of the contents.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings is an appropriate means of
obtaining an adjudication of the rights of the parties in a declaratory relief
action if those rights can be determined as a matter of law from the face of
the pleading attacked, together with those matters of which the court may
properly take judicial notice. (Silver v. Beverly Hills Nat. Bank (1967)
253 Cal.App.2d 1000, 1005 [61 Cal.Rptr. 751].) A plaintiff's motion for
judgment on the pleadings is analogous to a plaintiff's demurrer to an answer
and is evaluated by the same standards. (See Hardy v. Admiral Oil Co.
(1961) 56 Cal.2d 836, 840-842 [16 Cal.Rptr. 894, 366 P.2d 310]; 4 Witkin, Cal.
Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Proceedings Without Trial, § 165, pp. 2819-2820.) The
motion should be denied if the defendant's pleadings raise a material issue or
set up affirmative matter constituting a defense; for purposes of ruling on the
motion, the trial court must treat all of the defendant's allegations as
being true. (MacIsaac v. Pozzo (1945) 26 Cal.2d 809, 813 [161 P.2d
449].)
(Allstate Ins. Co. v. Kim
W. (1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 326, 330–331.)
Plaintiffs move for judgment on the
pleadings on the grounds that Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter
of law and that Defendants’ denials are “sham denials.” Plaintiffs rely on
extrinsic evidence, such as the subscription agreements between Plaintiffs and
Defendants, emails between the parties, discovery responses, and letter
correspondence. These documents are not subject to judicial notice and cannot
be considered on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. A motion for judgment
on the pleadings is not a motion for summary judgment. 
 
Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the
pleadings is DENIED.
