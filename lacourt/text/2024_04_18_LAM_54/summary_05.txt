Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted in part a motion to compel discovery for inclusion in the administrative record. The Petitioner, Crane Boulevard Safety Coalition, sought to compel the deposition of the City of Los Angeles's person most knowledgeable on the adequacy of the search for records, alleged pattern and practice of the City in drafting ordinances, and alleged pattern and practice of the pre-PLUM process. The Court has allowed the deposition on these topics. The Respondent, City of Los Angeles, is ordered to produce documents withheld under the deliberative process privilege and to serve a compliant privilege log within 10 days. The Court has also ordered the Respondent to serve a compliant privilege log for documents withheld under the attorney-client privilege.
