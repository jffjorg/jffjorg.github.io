And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The Judge found that the plaintiff, Sajith Weerasignhe, has presented triable issues of fact in his claims of discrimination and retaliation. The Judge noted that the defendant, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, et al., had failed to meet their burden of proof in showing that the plaintiff's claims were without merit. The Judge also noted that the plaintiff had presented evidence of a causal link between his complaints and his termination. The Judge's tentative ruling suggests that the case will proceed to trial.
