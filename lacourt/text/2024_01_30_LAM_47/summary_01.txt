Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $47,840. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants forged her signature on a check and is seeking an award of attorney's fees. The judge finds that the plaintiff is the prevailing party and is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees under Penal Code section 496. The judge reduces the plaintiff's requested fee award of $73,600 by 35% due to concerns about the accuracy of the plaintiff's counsel's estimates of time spent on the case. The judge also notes that certain ministerial tasks performed by the plaintiff's counsel should be performed by legal assistants or billed at lower rates. The judge's tentative ruling will be adopted unless a party submits written opposition to the tentative ruling by the deadline.
