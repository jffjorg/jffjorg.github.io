DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves for an award of
attorney’s fees. 
 
Entitlement to Fees
 
Plaintiff pled causes
of action for forgery, conversion and theft in violation of Penal Code section
496, and unfair competition in violation of Business & Professions Code
section 17200 et seq. (See generally FAC.) Penal Code section 496
authorizes an award of reasonable attorney’s fees to any person who has been
injured by, inter alia, the knowing purchase or receipt of stolen
property. (Penal Code § 496 (a), (c).) Defendants contend that Plaintiff is not
the prevailing party because the Court set aside the original judgment entered
March 30, 2023, with respect to punitive damages and reduced the punitive
damage award. (See September 27, 2023 Minute Order.) According to Defendants,
Plaintiff did not obtain a net recovery because most of the punitive damages
were eliminated. This claim is specious. First, a reduction in the punitive
damages award does not constitute a recovery for Defendants that may be counted
against Plaintiff’s recovery. Second, the default judgment stands with respect
to Defendants’ liability—it was merely the amount of damages that was modified.
Plaintiff is the prevailing party and is entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees
under Penal Code section 496(c). 
Further, Defendants’ reliance on a case construing the Court’s authority
to deny prevailing party status under Civil Code § 1717 is misplaced.  (See Opposition, pp. 4-5.)  The basis here for Plaintiff’s fee award is a
Penal Code statute designed to encourage private enforcement of a statute
barring illegal conduct.  Even so, it
cannot be said that Plaintiff failed to achieve her litigation objective since
she obtained full relieve on all claims asserted. 
 
Reasonableness of
Fees
 
            Plaintiff requests a fee award of $73,600,
based on a combined total of 177 hours incurred since entry of the default
judgment at an hourly rate of $400. 
 
Reasonable attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the Court and
shall be an element of the costs of suit. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(5)(B).)
Reasonable attorney’s fees are ordinarily determined by the Court pursuant to
the “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied
by the reasonable hourly rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982)
134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004 [“California courts have consistently held that a computation
of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to
a determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”].) “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Ibid.)
In setting the hourly rate for a fee award, courts are entitled to consider the
“fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for
similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th
976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin
v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden
is on the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove the reasonableness of the
fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) 
The Court has
broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee
award, which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a
prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial
evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1379, 1393-1394.)  The Court need not explain its calculation of the
amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered
in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc.
(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-275.)
Plaintiff requests a fee award of $73,600, based on a combined total of
177 hours incurred since entry of the default judgment at an hourly rate of
$400, plus an additional 7-hour estimate for preparing a reply brief and
attending oral argument. 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Attorney Timothy Otte, has provided a declaration
attesting to his skills, experience, and hourly rate. (Declaration of Timothy
Otte ISO Mot. ¶ 4.) Attorney Otte does not provide billing records
demonstrating the amount of time actually incurred. Instead, Attorney Otte
estimates that he has spent 177 hours across three categories of activity.
(Otte Decl. ¶¶ 4-7.) Attorney Otte bases his estimate on research times
provided by Lexis/Nexis, date stamps recorded in computer files, and “some
contemporaneous time notes.” (Id. ¶ 5.) Attorney Otte also seeks 7 hours
of anticipated time to review the opposition, prepare the reply, and attend the
hearing on this motion.  
 
Defendants argue in opposition that Plaintiff has not adequately
justified the fee request because it is unsupported by any billing records and
the hours claimed are not broken down into the tasks performed.  Defendants also complain about ministerial
tasks undertaken by Plaintiff’s attorney and billed at the same $400 per hour
rate.  While it is true that “trial
courts have discretion to award fees based on declarations of counsel
describing the work they have done and the court’s own view of the number of
hours reasonably spent” (Syers Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698-699), the Court is skeptical of the hours
claimed by Plaintiff’s counsel.  Attorney
Otte’s estimate for the hours required to review the opposition, prepare a
reply, and attend the hearing on this matter is most telling: 7 hours on a
routine response and reply to a fee motion is excessive for an attorney of Mr.
Otte’s experience.  Attorney Otte’s
claims to such inflated hours broadly suggest that the balance of the claimed
hours is similarly inflated. Moreover, the Court agrees with Defendants that
certain activities described such as preparing proposed judgments or preparing
sheriff’s instructions are largely ministerial and, thus, should be performed
by legal assistants or, in the alternative, should be billed at lower rates. 
 
            Based on
this assessment, the Court will impose a 35% reduction in fees, equivalent to a
0.65x multiplier, resulting in a fee award of $47,840.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $47,840.
 
             Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
