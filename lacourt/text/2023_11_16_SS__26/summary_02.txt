The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Metropolitan Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (MAB), granting their motion to compel answers to form interrogatories and requests for sanctions. MAB had propounded the discovery requests on May 3, 2023, but the defendant, Eddie Lee Dennis, Jr., failed to respond. As a result, MAB filed motions to compel responses and deem admissions admitted, which the court has granted. The defendant is ordered to serve verified responses to the interrogatories without objection within 20 days of service of this order. Additionally, the defendant is ordered to pay sanctions of $530.00 to MAB's counsel within 20 days of service of this order.
