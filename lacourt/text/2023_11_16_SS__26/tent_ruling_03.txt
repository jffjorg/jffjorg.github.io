REQUEST
FOR SANCTIONS
(CCP
§ 2033.280)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            
Defendant Mercury Insurance
Company’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for
Sanctions is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF ERNESTO GONZALEZ IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $361.65 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN

ANALYSIS:
 
On June 12, 2023, Defendant Mercury Insurance Company
(“Defendant”) served Requests for Admission, Set One, on Plaintiff Ernesto Gonzalez
(“Plaintiff”) (Motion, Pelanda Decl.,
Exh. 1.) Despite a meet and confer effort extending the deadline to serve
verified responses without objections, Plaintiff has not done so. (Id.
at Exh. 2.) Defendant filed the instant Motion to Deem Requests for Admission,
Set One, Admitted and Request for Sanctions, on October 20, 2023. No opposition
has been filed to date.
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Plaintiff’s failure to timely serve responses and resultant waiver of
objections, Defendant is entitled to an order deeming the Requests for
Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Under a lodestar
calculation, sanctions are granted against Plaintiff in the amount of $361.65
based on one hour of attorney time billed at $300.00 per hour, plus the filing
fee of $61.65. (Motion, Pelanda Decl., ¶6.)
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Mercury Insurance Company’s Motion to Deem
Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF
ERNESTO GONZALEZ IS ORDERED TO
PAY SANCTIONS OF $361.65 TO DEFENDANT’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER.
