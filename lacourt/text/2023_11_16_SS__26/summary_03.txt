And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion filed by Mercury Insurance Company (Defendant) to deem requests for admission admitted and to request sanctions against Plaintiff Ernesto Gonzalez. The judge has granted the motion, ordering Plaintiff to pay sanctions of $361.65 to Defendant's counsel within 20 days of service of this order.

The judge's analysis states that there was no requirement for a meet and confer effort before filing the motion, and that the motion can be brought at any time after the responding party fails to provide responses. Since Plaintiff failed to serve verified responses to the requests for admission, Defendant is entitled to an order deeming the requests admitted. The judge also awarded sanctions against Plaintiff, based on a lodestar calculation, in the amount of $361.65.
