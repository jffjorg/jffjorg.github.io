And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel supplemental responses and requests for sanctions. The motions are moot since the defendant has received supplemental responses, but the issue of sanctions remains. The plaintiff's counsel made an administrative error that caused them to miss the deadline for responding to the supplemental discovery requests. The court accepts the counsel's declaration regarding the error and grants sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $1,500 payable by the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days. The court reduces the requested sanctions because the motions are largely duplicative and the plaintiff's counsel promptly took corrective action after discovering the error.
