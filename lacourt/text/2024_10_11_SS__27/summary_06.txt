And here is a brief summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses in part. The Court finds that the surveillance footage taken by Ethos Risk on April 23, 2024, is protected as the work product of defense counsel, but not absolutely protected. The Court will conduct an in-camera inspection of the Ethos Report to determine whether any of the writings and comments reflect defense counsel's impressions, conclusions, opinions, legal research, or theories, and whether any portion of the report is entitled to absolute privilege. For parts of the report that are subject to only qualified privilege, the Court will order the production of those portions of the Ethos Report, after Plaintiff's deposition, provided that Defendant intends to use such evidence, pre-trial or at trial. The Court denies the Request for Sanctions, finding that the parties had a legitimate dispute as to whether the sub rosa evidence should be produced.
