CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV03495 Josiah Orellana et al. vs.
Ovig Vartanian et al.
Moving Party: Defendants OVIG VARTANIAN AND RUZANNA TAGVORYAN 
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS
GRANTED.
 
On January 28, 2022,
Plaintiffs Josiah Orellana and Vanessa Smith filed their lawsuit arising from
motor vehicle collisions involving eight separate vehicles and multiple
defendants. On June 7, 2022, Jorge Zamora Lopez, Hipolito R. Lopez, and
Pleasant Furniture filed their Answer. On October 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an
Amendment to the Complaint identifying Defendant Ruzanna Tagvoryan as DOE 1. On
December 5, 2023, Defendants Ovig Vartanian and Ruzanna Tagvoryan filed their
Answer.
Defendants Ovig
Vartanian and Ruzanna Tagvoryan move to continue the trial date by
approximately 119 days, to March 17, 2025, or a date thereafter that is
convenient for the Court, along with a request to adjust all related deadlines
accordingly. The primary reason for this request is that Plaintiff Vanessa
Smith disclosed a traumatic brain injury (TBI) claim for the first time during
her deposition on September 12, 2024. Defendants need additional time to
conduct discovery related to this newly asserted TBI, including obtaining
medical records, conducting an independent medical examination (IME), and
deposing the neurologist involved in Plaintiff’s diagnosis.
The parties have filed
a stipulation agreeing to continue the trial. No party would be prejudiced by
the continuance. Although the case was filed in 2022, some Defendants were not
served or able to file their answers until December 2023, resulting in limited
time for discovery involving these Defendants. The complexity of the case,
involving multiple defendants and contested issues of liability and damages,
has made discovery more time-consuming. A continuance is warranted to ensure
adequate time for the parties to fully develop their case. Furthermore,
Plaintiff’s recent disclosure of traumatic brain injury further justifies a
continuance to address these new issues. Based on the foregoing reasons, the
motion is granted. 
The new Trial Date is
set for March __, 2025,
at 8:30 a.m. The Final Status Conference is continued to March __, 2025, at 10:00
a.m.  All case-related deadlines will
follow the new trial date.
