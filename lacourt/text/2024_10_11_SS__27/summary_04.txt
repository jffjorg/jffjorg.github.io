And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to continue the trial date from October 11, 2024 to March 17, 2025, or a date thereafter that is convenient for the court. The defendants, Ovig Vartanian and Ruzanna Tagvoryan, had requested the continuance due to the recent disclosure by plaintiff Vanessa Smith of a traumatic brain injury claim during her deposition on September 12, 2024. The defendants need additional time to conduct discovery related to this new claim, including obtaining medical records, conducting an independent medical examination, and deposing the neurologist involved in plaintiff's diagnosis. The parties have stipulated to the continuance, and the judge has found that no party would be prejudiced by the delay. The complexity of the case, involving multiple defendants and contested issues of liability and damages, has also made discovery more time-consuming.
