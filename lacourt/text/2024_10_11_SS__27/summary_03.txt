And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' motion for terminating sanctions, striking the defendant's answer, and entering his default. The defendant has failed to comply with court orders to provide discovery responses and has failed to pay the ordered sanctions. The court finds that the defendant's failure to comply was willful and that lesser sanctions would not be effective. The court also denies the plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions, finding that terminating sanctions alone are sufficient. The plaintiffs are ordered to submit a default judgment package within 30 days of the date of this order.
