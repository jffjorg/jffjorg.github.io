MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs Dan Gao and Cheng Wang
 
I.           
INTRODUCTION
On January 7, 2022, Plaintiffs Dan Gao (“Gao”)
and Cheng Wang (“Wang”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against
Defendant Julian Joseph Nour (“Defendant”) for injuries and damages arising
from a motor vehicle collision.
On May 21, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiffs’
motions: 1) to compel Defendant’s responses to Requests for Production and
sanctions; 2) to compel Defendant’s responses to Form Interrogatories and
sanctions; and 3) to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted by Defendant. Defendant
was ordered to pay $1,500 in sanctions. 
 
On
September 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion for terminating
sanctions and an Order striking Defendant’s answer and rendering judgment by
Default against Defendant based on his willful failure to comply with the
Court’s orders compelling Defendant’s responses to Plaintiffs’ Interrogatories
and failure to pay sanctions. This motion is unopposed.   
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
Where a party misuses the discovery
process, courts have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or
monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2023.010(g), 2030.290(c); R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.)
Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to respond to an authorized
method of discovery or disobeying a court order to provide discovery. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010(d), (g).) 
Ultimate discovery sanctions are
justified where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of
abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance with discovery rules. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not
authorized where noncompliance with discovery is caused by an inability to
comply rather than willfulness or bad faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986)
180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) Further, preventing parties from presenting their
cases on the merits is a drastic measure; terminating sanctions should only be
ordered when there has been previous noncompliance with a rule or order and it
appears a less severe sanction would not be effective. (Link v. Cater
(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1326.) 
 
Before any sanctions may be imposed the
court must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of the
party to serve the required answers. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los
Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack of diligence may be
deemed willful where the party understood its obligation, had the ability to
comply, and failed to comply. (Deyo v. Killbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 787.) The party who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the
burden of showing that the failure was not willful. (Id. at 788.) 
DISCUSSION
The Court has read and considered the
moving party’s papers and finding no opposition filed grants the motion as
follows:
On January 3, 2023, Plaintiffs served
Defendant with Form Interrogatories, Set One. (Cuevas Declaration, ¶ 2.) On
May 21, 2024, because Defendant had not served responses and following motion
practice, the Court ordered Defendant to serve responses within twenty (20)
days and to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,500. (Cuevas Decl., ¶ 10.) Defendant
disobeyed the Court’s Order by failing to file any Discovery Responses and
failing to pay the sanctions. (Cuevas Decl., ¶ 11.)
By failing to provide responses to
written discovery, Defendant has willfully disobeyed the Court’s May 21, 2024 order.
(Fairfield, 246 Cal.App.2d at 118.) This action is a misuse of the
discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010(d), (g).)  
 
While the Court recognizes that
terminating sanctions is a harsh remedy, a review of the record shows that
Defendant was properly served with the Court’s May 21, 2024 order on June 10,
2024 per Plaintiff’s filing of Notice of Ruling on June 10, 2024. 
Almost two years have passed without
Defendant’s responses to standard Form Interrogatories. Given Defendant’s history
of misuse and apparent lack of interest in this matter, the Court finds lesser
sanctions would not curb the abuse. In fact, Defendant’s failure to participate
by failing to oppose any of the discovery motions or the instant motion suggests
that Defendant has abandoned his defense of this case. Absent compliance with
this Court’s May 21, 2024 order, Plaintiffs cannot prosecute this matter.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for terminating
sanctions.  
Given that it is granting terminating
sanctions, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions. Terminating
sanctions alone are a sufficient sanction.
CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS the Motion for Terminating
Sanctions.
The Court DENIES the Request for
Monetary Sanctions in the amount of $455.
The Court hereby strikes Defendant’s Answer
and enters his default. Plaintiffs are ordered to submit a default judgment
package within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order. 
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice
of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
