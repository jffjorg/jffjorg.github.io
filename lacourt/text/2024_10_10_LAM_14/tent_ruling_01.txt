  Case Number:  22STCV11222    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2024    Dept:  14 #7Case Background
This is an action for violations of the FEHA and the
Labor Code and unfair business practices. Plaintiff alleges that while she was
employed as a housekeeper, Defendants paid Plaintiff less than minimum wage,
denied her uninterrupted breaks, failed to pay overtime, and committed other
violations of the Labor Code.
On May 3, 2024, Plaintiff Elsa Archila filed her
Complaint against Defendants LM Orchid Investments, LLC (Orchid) and Lidia
Khorsandi. 
On September 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for
reimbursement of service costs against Defendants.
Instant Pleading
Plaintiff moves for reimbursement of service costs
under Code Civ. Proc., section 415.30 against Defendants.
Decision
Plaintiff’s motion for reimbursement of service costs
is GRANTED. Defendants are to pay Plaintiff $2,486.85 within 30 days of
receiving notice of this order.
Legal Standard
A summons may be served by mail to the person to be
served as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30. (Code Civ. Proc.,
section 415.30, subd. (a).) 
If a person to whom a copy of the summons and of the
complaint are mailed pursuant to section 415.30 fails to complete and return
the acknowledgement form set forth in subdivision (b) within 20 days from the
date of such mailing, the party to whom the summons was mailed shall be liable
for reasonable expenses thereafter incurred in serving or attempting to serve
the party by another method permitted by this chapter, and, except for good
cause shown, the court in which the action is pending, upon motion, with or
without notice, shall award the party such expenses whether or not he is
otherwise entitled to recover his costs in the action. (Code Civ. Proc., section
415.30, subd. (d).) 
Discussion
Plaintiff moves for reimbursement of $2,486.85 in
service costs under Code Civ. Proc., section 415.30. Plaintiff’s counsel
testifies that after Defendant Khorsandi (“Khorsandi”) represented she was no
longer represented by her previous counsel, Plaintiff’s counsel served
Khorsandi and Orchid by mailing the summons, complaint, and acknowledgement
forms to Khorsandi’s home. (Decl., ¶7.) Khorsandi is the agent for service for
Defendant Orchid (“Orchid”) (Id., ¶2.) After Khorsandi refused to execute
and return the acknowledgement forms, Plaintiff’s counsel attempted service
through the Sheriff’s Department before hiring a private investigator. (Id.,
¶¶10-11.) The investigator successfully served Khorsandi and Orchid on August
15, 2024 after staking out the service address. (Id., ¶¶12-13.) The cost
of the service attempt made through the Sheriff’s office was $100. (Id.,
¶15.) The cost of the private investigator was $2,386.85. (Id., ¶14.) 
Plaintiff provides sufficient evidence that she served
Khorsandi and Orchid via mail, Khorsandi refused to execute the acknowledgement
forms, and Plaintiff thereafter incurred service costs. Khorsandi failed to
oppose this motion and thus fails to show there was good cause for her failure to
complete the acknowledgement forms. The lack of an opposition amounts to a
concession that the motion is meritorious. (See California Rules of Court Rule
3.1113(a); see also Rule 3.1320(f); Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005)
133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20 (the party who fails to argue an issue
abandons that issue).) Here, Defendants are liable for the cost Plaintiff’s
service expenses incurred after July 3, 2024 because Khorsandi failed to
complete the acknowledgement forms. Therefore, the Court awards Plaintiff $2,486.85
in costs as required under Code Civ. Proc., section 415.30.
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for reimbursement of service costs
is GRANTED. Defendants are to pay Plaintiff $2,486.85 within 30 days of
receiving notice of this order.
