And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling issued by Judge Holly J. Fujie denies, without prejudice, the motion filed by plaintiff Norma Orozco for leave to file a first amended complaint. The motion was unopposed, but the court finds that it is procedurally deficient. The court's order requires the moving party to give notice of the ruling. The motion was filed in support of adding two additional claims to the complaint, alleging FEHA Retaliation and Constructive Discharge in Violation of FEHA. The court's denial is based on the failure of the motion to comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires a separate declaration specifying the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier.
