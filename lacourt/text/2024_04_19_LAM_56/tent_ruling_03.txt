[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE PLAINTIFF’S
  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
Jury Trial: September 30, 2024
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
Norma Orozco 
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Unopposed
 
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition papers were filed. Any opposition papers were required to
have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing
pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 1005(b). 
 
BACKGROUND
            This
action arises from Plaintiff Norma Orozco (“Plaintiff”) being subject to an
allegedly hostile work environment. On December 7, 2021, Plaintiff filed a
Complaint against Defendants Bodega Latina Corporation (“Bodega”), Mario
Morales (“Morales”) (collectively “Defendants”), and DOES 1 through 10,
inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) hostile work environment
harassment; and (2) failure to prevent and/or remedy harassment.  
            
            On
January 12, 2022, Defendant Bodega filed an Answer to the Complaint. On
February 2, 2022, Defendant Morales filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
 
            On
January 10, 2024, pursuant to a joint stipulation for leave to amend the
Complaint and continue trial, the Court entered an order granting Plaintiff
leave to file a First Amended Complaint and the Court ordered Plaintiff to file
the First Amended Complaint within 14 days from the date of the Court signing
the order granting leave to amend. (01/10/24 Order.) 
 
            On
January 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint; however, such
pleading was rejected on January 31, 2024, due to the First Amended Complaint
not being timely filed as ordered on January 10, 2024. (01/31/24 Notice of
Rejection – Pleadings.) 
 
            On
March 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant unopposed Motion for
Leave to File Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (the “Motion”). Plaintiff
moves for an order granting Plaintiff leave to amend the Complaint for the
purpose of adding two additional claims of FEHA Retaliation and Constructive
Discharge in Violation of FEHA. In support of the Motion, counsel for
Plaintiff, Nick A. Yasman (“Yasman”), declares that due to a clerical error
within his office, Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint was not filed and served
until January 30, 2024. (Yasman Decl., ¶ 18.) 
 
            Although
unopposed, the Court finds that the Motion is procedurally deficient, and the
Court therefore cannot grant the Motion. California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1324(b) requires that a motion to amend a pleading before trial must include
a separate declaration specifying: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier. The Court has reviewed the declaration of
Yasman in support of the Motion and the declaration of Yasman does not indicate:
(1) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (2) why the request for
amendment was not made earlier; and (3) exactly when the facts giving rise to
the amended allegations were discovered. The Motion is not compliant with
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324.
 
Therefore, the Motion is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
        
    Dated this 19th day of April 2024
