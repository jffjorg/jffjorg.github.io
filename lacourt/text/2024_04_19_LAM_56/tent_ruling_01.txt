Dept. 56 
 



 
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants Ash Auto Services, Inc. and Ali Shawket Habib  (“Defendants”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: None 
 
The Court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition has been filed as of April 17, 2024.  
 
BACKGROUND 
This action arises out of an
employment relationship. On April 16, 2021, Juan R. Andrades filed his
Complaint against Defendants and Does 1 through 20, asserting 13 causes of
action. On February 14, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion to compel the
deposition of Plaintiff and request for sanctions.  Defendants filed notice of non-opposition.  No opposition has been filed as of April 17,
2024. 
 
DISCUSSION  
Under CCP section 2025.450, where a
deponent fails to attend a deposition and produce documents, an opposing party
can ask the court to order the deponent’s attendance and testimony at a
deposition, as well the production of the documents specified in the deposition
notice.  The motion must include: (1)
facts showing good cause justifying the production of documents; and (2) where
a deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, a
declaration must accompany the motion indicating that the party seeking the
order to compel contacted the deponent to inquire about the deponent’s
nonappearance.  (CCP § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1)-(2).)  
 
CCP section¿2025.450(c) provides, “(1)
If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction . . . in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ 
 
Defendants have presented evidence showing
that they properly noticed Plaintiff’s deposition and that Plaintiff failed to
appear at his duly-scheduled and noticed deposition. Plaintiff did not assert and
has not asserted any valid objections to his notice of deposition.  Because Plaintiff has failed to proceed with his
deposition and because Plaintiff has failed to file an opposition contending
why the motion should be denied, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion.  Plaintiff’s deposition is ordered to be taken
at a time and place to be set and noticed by Defendants within thirty days of
the date of this order.
 
Defendants request monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff in the amount of $4,035.15 comprised of $3,433.36 in attorney’s fees
and costs associated with Plaintiff’s non-appearance and this motion (7.8 hours
incurred at hourly rate of $430, plus $61.65 reservation fee and $19.71 filing
fees) and $599.79 in court reporter fees associated with Plaintiff’s
non-attendance as indicated by the amended deposition notice.  (Westcott Decl. ¶¶ 8, 15-18.)  The Court GRANTS
Defendants’ request in a reasonable amount of 3 hours for the preparation of
this motion, plus costs, for a total amount of $1,371.36.  The Court orders Plaintiff to pay this amount
to Defendants and their counsel within thirty days of the date of this order.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice
of this ruling.             
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If
the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
