Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to strike and demurrer filed by the defendants, Landi Pinckard Papazian and Jared Papazian. The defendants sought to strike the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Paul Pinckard and Theresa Urman, on the grounds that it fails to comply with California Rules of Court and Code of Civil Procedure. The court agrees with the defendants and strikes the complaint in its entirety. The court finds that the complaint does not identify specific causes of action, does not comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 2.112, and does not provide sufficient information to allow the court to understand the allegations. The court also finds that the complaint is unclear and does not provide sufficient facts to support the claims. As a result, the court grants the defendants' motion to strike and allows them to obtain dismissal of the action by ex parte application if the plaintiffs fail to file an amended complaint within 20 days.
