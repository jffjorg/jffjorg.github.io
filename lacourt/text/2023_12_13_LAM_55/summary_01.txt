And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant argued that the revival of lapsed claims of childhood sexual abuse is unconstitutional. The plaintiff, on the other hand, alleged that the claims are exempt from the claims presentation requirement due to Assembly Bill 218. The judge concluded that the amendments to Section 340.1 and Section 905 by AB 218 are constitutional. The judge cited several cases that have held that legislation may constitutionally revive lapsed civil limitations periods to restore common law remedies that existed at the time of alleged misconduct. The judge also noted that the Legislature's intent is clear, and that the retroactive application of the statute is intended to promote treatment for lifelong injuries and deter future sexual abuse.
