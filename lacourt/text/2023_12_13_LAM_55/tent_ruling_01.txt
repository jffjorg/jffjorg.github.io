  Case Number:  23STCV12006    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion of Defendant for Judgment on the
Pleadings.
 
The motion is denied.
Both parties’ requests for judicial notice of other
trial court rulings are denied.  E.g., Schachter v. Citigroup, Inc. (2005)
126 Cal.App.4th 726, 738  (trial court
rulings are not binding precedent);   Drummond v. Desmarais (2009) 176
Cal.App.4th 439, 448  (rulings in other
trial court cases are irrelevant absent some additional showing like the
elements of claim or issue preclusion).  

 
 
On 6/23/23, “S.W.” (“Plaintiff”) filed a First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) against LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (“Defendant”), alleging
that this is a revival action filed pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure Section 340.1 (“Section 340.1”), for damages arising from childhood
sexual abuse while under the custody and care of defendants at George
Washington Carver Middle School, in “approximately 1976.”  (FAC, ¶¶ 1-31). Plaintiff alleges that,
pursuant to California Government Code Section 905(m) (“Section 905(m)”), this
action brought under Section 340.1 is exempt from the claims presentation
requirement in the California Government Claims Act. (Id., ¶ 61.) Defendant
filed this motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that Plaintiff’s FAC
fails because Assembly Bill 218 (“AB 218”), which amended Section 340.1 and Section
905(m), violates the California Constitution’s prohibition against the gift of
public funds found in Article XVI, section 6 of the Constitution. Plaintiff
opposes the motion. 
Subject to exceptions set forth in Section 905, “[b]efore
suing a public entity, the plaintiff must present a timely written claim for
damages to the entity.” Shirk v. Vista Unified Sch. Dist. (2007) 42 Cal.
4th 201, 208. Prior to AB 218, Section 905(m) exempted claims of childhood
sexual abuse occurring on or after January 1, 2009, from the claims
presentation requirements. Rubenstein v. Doe No. 1 (2017) 3 Cal.5 903,
914. With the enactment of AB 218, effective January 1, 2020, the Legislature removed
the language in Section 905(m) that limited the exception to claims that
occurred after 2009 and added subdivision (p), which made this change
retroactive. See Gov’t Code § 905(m), (p). The Legislature thus retroactively
eliminated the claims presentation requirement for new claims of sexual abuse
that occurred before 2009. AB 218 amended Section 340.1 to, inter alia,
create a revival window for lapsed claims and that provides relief from the claims
presentation requirement in Section 905. See Code Civ. Proc. § 340.1(q).
Defendant contends that these changes mean public
entities like Defendant no longer have immunity from claims of childhood sexual
abuse occurring before 2009, and resurrecting such claims is an unconstitutional
gift of public funds.  
The Court agrees with Plaintiff, however, that AB 218’s
amendments to Section 340.1 and Section 905 are constitutional. Courts presume that
a statute is constitutional, and all presumptions and intendments will favor
its validity, unless unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably
is evident.  In re D.L. (2023) 93
Cal. App. 5th 144, 156. California opinions have addressed issue types of
unconstitutionality as to Section 340.1, beyond the instant issue of gifted
public funds, and have rejected the challenges. 
For example, cases have held that legislation may constitutionally revive
lapsed civil limitations periods to restore common law remedies that existed at
the time of alleged misconduct.  Coats
v. New Haven Unified School District (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, 427,
428  (“In Assembly Bill 218, the
Legislature made clear its intent to revive causes of action previously barred
by government claims presentation requirements.”).  “It is apparent from the history of
amendments to these statutes … that the Legislature has consistently worked to
expand the ability of victims of childhood sexual abuse to seek compensation
from the responsible parties, on several occasions in direct response to
restrictive judicial opinions.”  Ibid.
at 430.   
Further, “expenditures of public funds or property
which involve a benefit to private persons are not gifts within the meaning of
the constitutional prohibition, if those funds are expended for a public
purpose.” Schettler v. County of Santa Clara (1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 990,
1003.  Accord  Page v. MiraCosta Community College Dist. (2009)
180 Cal.App.4th 471, 495  (public funds
used for a public purpose are not a gift within the meaning of constitutional
prohibition). The Legislature primarily determines what constitutes a public
purpose and “its discretion will not be disturbed by the courts so long as that
determination has a reasonable basis.” County of Alameda v. Carleson
(1971) 5 Cal.2d 730, 745-46. 
The parties’ respective case citations and the Court’s
independent research, support the Court’s conclusion that the Legislature may
lawfully enact a statute providing for retroactive application of a longer
Statute of Limitations, and for dispensing with the government claims
requirement, where based upon expressed public purposes.  Here, legislative intent is very clear as to
multiple public purposes for removing the timely government claims requirement,
including promoting treatment for lifelong injuries and deterring future sexual
abuse, as has been well-briefed in the opposition (opp., pp. 5-10). The Legislature
determined these are valid public purposes and the Court cannot say the Legislature
lacked a reasonable basis to do so. The motion for judgment on the pleadings
therefore is denied.
