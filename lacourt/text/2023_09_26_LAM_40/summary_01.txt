English Summary:
The case is 19STCV09659, scheduled for a hearing on September 26, 2023. The plaintiff, Mehdi Yahyanejad, sued 1812 Investments, LLC, and other defendants for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, real estate seller's nondisclosure of material facts, intentional fraud, negligent misrepresentation and concealment, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence. The dispute arose from the plaintiff's purchase of a property from 1812 Investments without disclosure of unpermitted construction work and defective conditions. On May 9, 2023, the court held an informal discovery conference, and the parties agreed to produce supplemental responses to discovery requests by June 5, 2023. However, 1812 Investments failed to comply with the agreement.

The plaintiff filed a motion to compel 1812 Investments' compliance with the discovery order and sought monetary, issue, and evidence sanctions. The court granted the motion in part and ordered 1812 Investments to serve supplemental, full, and complete verified responses to certain form interrogatories and requests for admission no later than Monday, October 2, 2023. The court also granted monetary sanctions in the amount of $9,410 against 1812 Investments and its counsel, Law Office of Winston K. McKesson, jointly and severally.

The court noted that any further failure to comply with its orders could result in issue, evidence, or even terminating sanctions against 1812 Investments. The plaintiff's motion was granted, and 1812 Investments was ordered to pay the monetary sanctions within 14 calendar days. The court also granted the plaintiff's request for issue and/or evidentiary sanctions in part, ordering that 1812 Investments will not be permitted to use documents responsive to the Inspection Demands which are or were in the possession of agents of 1812 Investments and/or its principal, Robert J. Oshodin, Joseph Soaris, and Godstime Erhahon, and 1812 Investments shall not be permitted to introduce at trial any documents responsive to the Inspection Demands which have not been produced to Mr. Yahyanejad in the discovery process, from whatever source they are alleged to have been obtained by 1812 Investments.

The summary displayed below was created by an LLM named:  "mixtral-8x7b-32768":
**Case Number:** 19STCV09659

**Plaintiff:** Mehdi Yahyanejad

**Defendants:** 1812 Investments, LLC, Joseph Harrison Soaris, Godstime Eghosa Erhahon, Rodeo Realty Inc, Gregory Daniel Medsker, and Does 1 through 100

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Trial Date:** October 31, 2023

**Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Mehdi Yahyanejad's motion to compel 1812 Investments, LLC's compliance with an informal discovery conference order and the request for monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, and evidentiary sanctions against the defendant and its counsel. The dispute arises from the purchase of a property in 2016, where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to disclose construction work performed without permits and defective conditions.

The court grants the motion to compel further responses to specific form interrogatories and requests for admission, but denies the request to compel 1812 Investments to execute an Inspection Demand Stipulation. Monetary sanctions of $9,410 are granted against 1812 Investments and its counsel for disobedience of a court order to provide discovery. Issue and evidence sanctions are granted in part, and the court orders 1812 Investments not to use or introduce certain documents in evidence. Further failure to comply with this Court's orders may result in additional sanctions.

Key events and factors include:

- Property purchased by Plaintiff Yahyanejad in 2016
- Undisclosed construction work and defective conditions
- Informal discovery conference and stipulation agreement on May 9, 2023
- 1812 Investments' failure to provide further responses and execute the stipulation
- Plaintiff's motion to compel compliance and request for sanctions
- Court's grant of monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, and evidentiary sanctions
