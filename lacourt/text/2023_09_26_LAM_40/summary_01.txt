English Summary:
The case is 19STCV09659, scheduled for a hearing on September 26, 2023. The plaintiff, Mehdi Yahyanejad, sued 1812 Investments, LLC, and other defendants for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, real estate seller's nondisclosure of material facts, intentional fraud, negligent misrepresentation and concealment, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence. The dispute arose from the plaintiff's purchase of a property from 1812 Investments without disclosure of unpermitted construction work and defective conditions. On May 9, 2023, the court held an informal discovery conference, and the parties agreed to produce supplemental responses to discovery requests by June 5, 2023. However, 1812 Investments failed to comply with the agreement.

The plaintiff filed a motion to compel 1812 Investments' compliance with the discovery order and sought monetary, issue, and evidence sanctions. The court granted the motion in part and ordered 1812 Investments to serve supplemental, full, and complete verified responses to certain form interrogatories and requests for admission no later than Monday, October 2, 2023. The court also granted monetary sanctions in the amount of $9,410 against 1812 Investments and its counsel, Law Office of Winston K. McKesson, jointly and severally.

The court noted that any further failure to comply with its orders could result in issue, evidence, or even terminating sanctions against 1812 Investments. The plaintiff's motion was granted, and 1812 Investments was ordered to pay the monetary sanctions within 14 calendar days. The court also granted the plaintiff's request for issue and/or evidentiary sanctions in part, ordering that 1812 Investments will not be permitted to use documents responsive to the Inspection Demands which are or were in the possession of agents of 1812 Investments and/or its principal, Robert J. Oshodin, Joseph Soaris, and Godstime Erhahon, and 1812 Investments shall not be permitted to introduce at trial any documents responsive to the Inspection Demands which have not been produced to Mr. Yahyanejad in the discovery process, from whatever source they are alleged to have been obtained by 1812 Investments.
