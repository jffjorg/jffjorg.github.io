 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Mehdi
  Yahyanejad’s Motion to Compel re Defendant 1812 Investments, LLC’s Failure to
  Comply with Informal Discovery Conference Order, for an Award of Monetary
  Sanctions Against Defendant and its Counsel, and Issue and/or Evidentiary
  Sanctions Against Defendant.



 
Background
Plaintiff Mehdi Yahyanejad (Yahyanejad) sues Defendants 1812 Investments,
LLC (1812 Investments), Joseph Harrison Soaris (Soaris), Godstime Eghosa
Erhahon (Erhahon), Rodeo Realty Inc. (Rodeo Realty), Gregory Daniel Medsker
(Medsker), and Does 1 through 100 pursuant to a March 20, 2019 Complaint
alleging claims of (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Implied Covenant of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (3) Real Estate Seller’s Nondisclosure of Material
Facts, (4) Intentional Fraud (Misrepresentation and Concealment), (5) Negligent
Misrepresentation and Concealment, (6) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and (7) Negligence.
The claims arise from allegations that, among other things, on or about
March 1, 2016, Plaintiff Yahyanejad purchased from 1812 Investments the real
property known as 1553/1555 South Sierra Bonita Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90019
(Property) and that the Property was sold by 1812 Investments without
disclosing construction work that had been performed on the Property without
permits in 2015 or the defective conditions arising from that construction, i.e.,
windows that leaked when it rained. Plaintiff alleges not to have been aware of
the window defects until 2017, and not to have been aware of the illegal
construction performed on the Property until May 2018 when he received a Notice
and Order to Comply from the City of Los Angeles that related to building violations
in both units on the Property.
On May 9, 2023, the Court held an
informal discovery conference (IDC) in this action pertaining to discovery that
Plaintiff sought from 1812 Investments. Specifically, the IDC concerned two
things. First, Plaintiffs sought an unequivocal confirmation from 1812
Investments that it had produced all documents responsive to certain inspection
demands. The confirmation would be provided in an Inspection Demand Stipulation
to be signed and submitted with the Court. Second, Plaintiff sought further
responses to certain form interrogatories and requests for admission served by
Plaintiff on 1812 Investments. At the IDC, “Defendant [1812 Investments] agree[d]
to provide Plaintiff’s Counsel … further responses … [to this discovery] no
later than June 5, 2023.”
On May 12, 2023, the parties filed
a stipulation and proposed order informed by the outcome of the IDC. In
addition to agreeing to produce supplemental responses to the form interrogatories
and RFAs by June 5, 2023, the parties agreed that “1812 Investments shall enter
into a stipulation with Mr. Yahyanejad agreeing that 1812 Investments will not
obtain and/or seek to use documents responsive to the Inspection Demands which
are in the possession of agents of 1812 Investments and/or its principal, Robert
J. Oshodin. . .Joseph Soaris and Godstime Erhahon [and that] 1812 Investments .
. . do not have possession, custody or control, or ability to access documents
responsive to the Inspection Demands (other than those already produced.) [and
that it] shall not seek to introduce at trial any documents responsive to the
Inspection Demands which were not produced to Mr. Yahyanejad.” (June 8, 2023
Stipulation at ¶ 1, signed by the parties’ attorneys on May 12, 2023.
On June 8, 2023, the Court signed
the proposed order relating to the May 12th stipulation. 
On August 23, 2023, 1812
Investments’ counsel’s office emailed Plaintiff’s counsel “[t]he requested
documents.” The attachment to the email included discovery responses by 1812
Investments dated January 19, 2023 or earlier.
On August 29, 2023, Plaintiff moved
to compel 1812 Investments’ compliance with the June 8th order on the grounds
that 1812 Investments has failed to enter the stipulation regarding production and
has failed to serve responses to the form interrogatories and requests for
admission. The motion also seeks monetary, issue, and evidence sanctions.
On September 18, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a reply, noting the fact that 1812 Investments had failed to oppose the
motion to compel compliance.
Plaintiff’s motion is now before
the Court.
 
Motion to Compel Compliance
Legal
Standard
Every
California court has the power to compel obedience to its judgments, orders,
and process, and to the orders of a judge out of court, in an action or
proceeding pending therein. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(4).)
I.
Order
Compelling Compliance: GRANTED in part.
The
Court first notes that it inadvertently signed the stipulation order on June 8,
2023 even though it orders 1812 Investments to comply with the parties’
stipulation on or before June 5, 2023, i.e., three days prior to the execution
of the order. (See 6/8/23 Stipulation Order, p. 4.)
The
Court nevertheless GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion insofar as it seeks to compel
further responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 12.5, 50.1, 50.2, and 50.3. (See
Mot., pp. 8-9.) These further responses were ordered by the Court on June 8,
2023. (6/8/23 Stipulation Order, pp. 3 [further production specified at ¶ 3], 4
[Court’s order executed].) Yet no such responses were provided by 1812
Investments as of August 29, 2023, when Plaintiff made the motion before the
Court.
The
Court similarly GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion insofar as it seeks to compel further
responses to Requests for Admission Nos. 27, 28, and 63. (Mot., p. 9.) These
further responses were ordered by the Court on June 8, 2023. (6/8/23
Stipulation Order, pp. 3 [further production specified at ¶ 4], 4 [Court’s
order executed].) Yet no such responses were provided by 1812 Investments as of
August 29, 2023, when Plaintiff made the motion before the Court.
However,
rather than grant Plaintiff’s motion to compel 1812 Investments to execute an
Inspection Demand Stipulation between the parties, as agreed to and then ordered
by the Court on June 8, 2023, the Court will instead issue evidentiary
sanctions effectively resulting in the same relief (see below, Section III.)
The
Court briefly notes that the August 23, 2023 email does not comply with the
Court’s June 8th order because that email merely attaches discovery responses
that had already been served on Plaintiff on or prior to January 19, 2023.
(Mot., Light Decl., Ex. K; see Mot., p. 7, Light Decl., ¶ 16.)
Defendant
1812 Investments is ORDERED to serve on Plaintiff supplemental, full, and
complete verified responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 12.5, 50.1, 50.2, and
50.3 no later than Monday, October 2, 2023. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd.
(a)(4).)
Defendant
1812 Investments is also ORDERED to serve on Plaintiff supplemental, verified
responses to Requests for Admission Nos. 27, 28, and 63 no later than Monday,
October 2, 2023. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(4).)
II.
Monetary
Sanctions: GRANTED, in Part.
Unless
the party to be sanctioned has acted with substantial justification or other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust, the court may impose
a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
A
misuse of the discovery process includes disobeying a court order to provide
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (g).)
On
June 8, 2023, the Court ordered 1812 Investments to serve on Plaintiff further
responses to certain form interrogatories and requests for production, and to
execute an Inspection Demand Stipulation to be filed with the Court. (6/8/23
Stipulation Order, pp. 2-4.) As of August 29, 2023, 1812 Investments had still
failed to comply with that court order. All that 1812 Investments has done is
produce already-served responses to the discovery at issue. (Mot., Light Decl.,
Ex. K.) As of this time, 1812 Investments has not filed an opposition or other
paper explaining its failure to comply with the June 8th order. Accordingly,
monetary sanctions are justified against 1812 investments for disobedience of a
court order to provide discovery.
 Monetary sanctions are GRANTED, in Part, in
the amount of $9,410 against 1812 Investments and its counsel, Law Office of
Winston K. McKesson, jointly and severally. The sanctions are comprised of (1)
at least 10 hours expended by Plaintiff’s counsel meeting and conferring with
1812 Investments’ counsel to secure compliance with the June 8th order and
drafting this motion, at a rate of $425 per hour, (2) 12 additional hours in preparation
for the May 9, 2023 IDC, at a rate of $425 per hour, and (3) a $60 motion
filing fee. The Court does not grant the additional five hours Plaintiff’s
counsel expected to expend on preparing a reply in support of Plaintiff’s
motion because Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed. (Mot., Light Decl., ¶ 17.)
III.
Evidentiary
Sanctions: GRANTED in part.
The
court may impose an issue sanction ordering that designated facts shall be
taken as established in the action in accordance with the claim of the party
adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process. The court may also
impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing designated claims
or defenses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (b).)
The
court may also impose an evidence sanction by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated
matters in evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (c).)
A
misuse of the discovery process includes disobeying a court order to provide
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (g).)
Here,
the Court finds that issue and evidence sanctions are premature as to the form interrogatories
and the RFAs. While the parties made an agreement pursuant to an IDC, the Court
had not yet ruled on a motion to compel compliance until this hearing. Should
Defendant fail to respond to the current order, the Court will consider further
sanctions, if needed.
As
to the requested order that 1812 Investments sign the stipulation it has agreed
to sign, the Court finds it more effective to simply order what that party had
already agreed to. This could be styled as an evidentiary sanction, though here,
the other party has already agreed to it. Thus, the Court will order that: 
1)    
1812 Investments will not be permitted to use documents
responsive to the Inspection Demands which are or were in the possession of
agents of 1812 Investments and/or its principal, Robert J. Oshodin, Joseph
Soaris, and Godstime Erhahon; and
2)    
1812 Investments shall not be permitted to introduce at
trial any documents responsive to the Inspection Demands which have not been produced
to Mr. Yahyanejad in the discovery process, from whatever source they are
alleged to have been obtained by 1812 Investments.
The
Court will request clarification as to identification of those documents
already produced, whether they can be identified by bates-stamp or as produced
on August 23, 2023, to be included in this order.
Finally,
the Court notes that any further failure to comply with this Court’s orders
could result in issue, evidence, or even terminating sanctions against 1812
Investments.
