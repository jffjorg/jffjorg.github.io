The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for award of prejudgment interest brought by Plaintiff Chia Ying Lin. The court has determined that Plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest for dates between October 31, 2017 and the date of this hearing. The court has granted Plaintiff's motion for an award of prejudgment interest in the amount of $45,083.24. The court has also ordered Defendant Keny Chang to remit payment of $45,083.24 to Plaintiff Chia Ying Lin within 90 days of this ruling. The court's decision is based on the facts that Plaintiff secured a non-jury trial award of $76,323.66, a sum certain, and that Plaintiff's right to recover such damages vested on October 31, 2017, the date of the breach. The court has also rejected Defendant Chang's arguments that the delays in trial in this action constitute grounds to reduce any prejudgment interest award.
