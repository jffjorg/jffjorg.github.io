 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Petitioner Robin Hood Funding, LLC’s
  Verified Petition for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights
  Pursuant to California Insurance Code § 10134 et seq.



 
MOVING
PARTY:               Petitioner Robin Hood Funding, LLC.
 
RESPONDING
PARTY:      Los Angeles Child Support Services Department.
 
Background
In exchange for a one-time payment of
$541,475, Petitioner Robin Hood
Funding, LLC (RH Funding) seeks a transfer of $1,836,596.97 in
structured settlement payment rights belonging to Real Party in Interest J.T.,
where the discounted present value of
the structured settlement is $873,267.18.
A
response to the Petition was filed on August 29, 2023 by the County of Los
Angeles Child Support Services Department, noting child support arrearages in
three cases.
A
supplemental declaration was filed by J.T. who stated that “with the proceeds
of this transaction, I will pay off the arrearages totaling $30,353.07 for all
three cases.” (Trulove Dec. at ¶ 5.)
RH Funding’s Petition came before the Court
on September 12, 2023, at which time the Court continued the hearing to
September 26, 2023 to give RH Funding time to correct deficiencies in its
Petition.
The Petition is now before the Court again.
Petition
to Transfer Structured Settlement Rights
Legal Standard
A transfer of structured settlement payment
rights is void unless a court reviews and approves the transfer and finds that
(a) the transfer of the structured settlement payment rights is fair and
reasonable and in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the
welfare and support of his or her dependents, and (b) the transfer complies
with the requirements of Insurance Code Sections 10134 to 10139.5, will not
contravene other applicable law, and that the court has reviewed and approved
the transfer as provided in Section 10139.5. (See Ins. Code, § 10137, subds.
(a)-(b).)

Section 10136 Requirements
No
direct or indirect transfer of structured settlement payment rights by a payee
to which Section 10136 applies shall be effective, and no structured settlement
obligor or annuity issuer shall be required to make any payment directly or
indirectly to a transferee, unless all of the provisions of Section 10136 of
the Insurance Code are satisfied. (Ins.
Code, § 10136, subd. (a).)

First,
the transfer agreement satisfies the
disclosure form requirements set out in Insurance Code section 10136,
subdivision (b) because the transfer agreement is accompanied by a disclosure
addressed to J.T. and the disclosure contains all the statutorily required
language of section 10136, subdivision (b). (See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (b);
see also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Amended Ex. A, California Disclosure Statement.)
Second,
the transfer agreement satisfies the transfer-agreement requirements set out in
Insurance Code section 10136, subdivision (c) because the transfer agreement
contains all the necessary language required from this statutory subdivision.
(See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (c); see also 8/21/23 Amended Petition, Ex. A, Absolute Assignment Agreement and
Security Agreement, pp. 1-3 at §§ B.1-B.12 and 8 [right to cancel].)
Third,
the transfer agreement does not violate Section 10138 as none of the contents
prohibited by this statutory section are contained in the transfer agreement.
(See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (d); see also 8/21/23 Amended Petition, Ex. A, Absolute Assignment Agreement and
Security Agreement.)
Fourth,
J.T. has not sought cancellation of the transfer agreement as of the date of
this hearing. (See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (e); see also 9/25/23 Supp.
Filings, Ex. K, J.T. Decl., ¶ 14.)
Accordingly,
the Court finds that RH Funding’s proposed transfer of J.T.’s settlement rights
satisfies the requirements of Insurance Code section 10136, subdivisions (a)
through (e).
Section
10139.5 Requirements
A direct or indirect transfer of structured
settlement payment rights is not effective and a structured settlement obligor
or annuity issuer is not required to make any payment directly or indirectly to
any transferee of structured settlement payment rights unless the transfer has
been approved in advance in a final court order based on express written
findings by the court subject to Section 10139.5. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a).)
First,
the transfer agreement satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5,
subdivision (f)(1), because Petitioner RH Funding made the instant petition and
the petition was brought in the county in which the payee, J.T., resides. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(1); see
8/21/23 Amended Petition, p. 1
[showing Petitioner RH Funding brings this Petition]; 9/25/23 Supp. Filings,
Ex. K, J.T. Decl., ¶ 4 [“I [J.T.] live at … Los Angeles, CA …”].)
Second, the petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (f)(2).
Formal notice of this transfer and a copy of
the petition itself was filed by RH Funding with the Court and served on all
interested parties more than 20 days before this hearing. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (f)(2) [notice of the proposed transfer and the petition for its
authorization to be filed with the court and served on all interested parties no
less than 20 days prior to hearing]; see also 7/20/23 Motion for Order
Approving Transfer, Notice, pp. 1-2; 7/20/23 Proof of Service [service on

Proof of Service [service on 8/21/23].) 
Further, the notice and petition have
attached all the necessary documents required from this subdivision. (See Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(A)-(L).) The notice and petition: 
(A) Include a copy
of the instant petition and need not attach prior petitions made outside of
five years from the date of this petition. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(f)(2)(A) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(6), which in turn is
framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring information only
for petitions in last five years]; see also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Ex. K, J.T. Decl., ¶ 3, 8 [J.T. has “never
assigned a portion of [his] structured settlement payment rights,” which he acquired
in 2019].)
(B) Include a copy
of the proposed transfer agreement and disclosure form required by paragraph
(3) of subdivision (a). (See Ins. Code,
§ 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(B); see also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Amended Ex. A,
California Disclosure Statement & 8/21/23 Amended Petition, Ex. A, Absolute Assignment Agreement and
Security Agreement.)
(C) Include
information regarding J.T.’s dependents and their ages. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(C); see
also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Ex. K, J.T. Decl., ¶¶ 5-5(c) [single with
children and names and age of children].)
(D) Include a copy
of the disclosure required in subdivision (b) of Section 10136. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(D); see
also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Amended Ex. A, California Disclosure Statement.)
(E) Include copies
of the annuity contract, any qualified assignment agreement, and underlying
structured settlement agreement, if available, and if not available, a showing
of reasonable efforts to locate and secure a copy of the document have been
made, including making inquiry with the payee. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(E)-(H); see also 8/21/23 Amended Petition,
Ex. A, Sub-Ex. B [Full and Final Release Payment to J.T. as Payee, but text
garbled], Ex. F [Qualified Assignment
and Release settlement agreement though blank and exhibit text garbled].)
(F) Include copies
of the proofs of service made for notice of this petition. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(I); see
also 7/20/23 Proofs of Service; 8/21/23
Amended Petition, Proof of Service.)
(G) Include a
notification that any interested party is entitled to support, oppose, or
otherwise respond to the transferee’s petition, either in person or by counsel,
by submitting written comments to the court or by participating in the hearing.
(See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(f)(2)(J); see also 7/20/23 Motion for Order Approving Transfer,
2:8-10.)
(H) Include a
notification of the time and place of the hearing and notification of the
manner in which and the time by which written responses to the petition must be
filed, which may not be less than 15 days after service of the transferee’s
notice, in order to be considered by the court. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(K); see also 7/20/23 Motion for
Order Approving Transfer, 1:23-28.)
(I) If the payee
entered into the structured settlement at issue within five years prior to the
date of the transfer agreement, then the transferee shall provide the specified
notice to the payee’s attorney of record at the time the structured settlement
was created, if the attorney is licensed to practice in California, at the
attorney’s address on file with the State Bar of California. Notice to the
former attorney described in this section is not required to be provided if the
payee in the transaction was not a party to the original structured settlement
at issue (for example, if the payee is an heir or beneficiary of the person who
was a party to the original structured settlement). Also, if the payee cannot
recall or identify his or her former attorney and if the identity of the former
attorney cannot be ascertained from the available structured settlement
documents, then the notice described in this subparagraph is not required to be
provided and the transfer may proceed without the notice. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(L); see
also 7/20/23 Proofs of Service; 8/21/23 Amended Petition, Proof of
Service [notice to settling attorney, Nick Brustin, Esq. of New York].)
Third, the petition satisfies all the payee
information required from Section 10139.5, subdivision (c) as follows (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)):
(1) Included the
payee’s name and age (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (c)(1); see also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Ex. K, J.T. Decl.,
¶¶ Intro [name is J.T.], 5 [38 years old].)
(2) Included the
payee’s marital status, and, if married or separated, the name of the payee’s
spouse. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (c)(2); see also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Ex. K, J.T. Decl., ¶ 5
[“single”].)
(3) Included the
names, ages, and place or places of residence of the payee’s minor children or
other dependents, if any. (See Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(3); see also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Ex. K, J.T.
Decl., ¶¶ 5-5(c) [names, ages, and places of residence of J.T.’s three
children].)
(4) Included the
amounts and sources of the payee’s monthly income and financial resources and,
if presently married, the amounts and sources of the monthly income and
financial resources of the payee’s spouse. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(4); see also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings,
Ex. K, J.T. Decl., ¶ 4 [summary of J.T.’s employed status and sources of
income/financial resources, with Sub.-Ex. 1 attachment showing a Net Worth
Statement for J.T., a 2021 Individual Income Tax Return, K-1 for Bloomfield
Ranch Estates, LLC, and a Settlement Statement from Old Republic Title Company].)
(5) Included information
permitting the determination of whether the payee is currently obligated under
any child support or spousal support order, and, if so, the names, addresses,
and telephone numbers of any individual, entity, or agency that is receiving
child or spousal support from the payee under that order or that has
jurisdiction over the order or the payments in question. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(5); see
also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Ex. K, J.T. Decl., ¶¶ 6-6(c) [summary of
child-support obligations]; accord. 8/29/23 Response to Petitioner’s Motion, ¶¶
3-9 [Sworn declaration by Los Angles Child Support Staff Services Department
Staff Attorney indicating that J.T. has child support arrears in three
different California counties amounting $30,353.07 as of September 1, 2023].)
(6) Included
information regarding previous transfers or attempted transfers, as described
in paragraph (11), (12), or (13) of subdivision (b). (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(6) [framed by Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring information only for petitions in last
five years]; see also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Ex. K, J.T. Decl.,
¶ 3, 8 [J.T. has “never assigned a portion of [his] structured settlement
payment rights,” which he acquired in 2019].)
Fourth, the petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (g) requiring that transferees
bear the costs of transfer petitions of structured settlement rights. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (g); see also
9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Amended Ex. A, California Disclosure Statement,
p. 2 [“[W]e have charged [J.T.] for the following expenses: [None] for a total
of $0.00 in expenses].)
Fifth, the petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5(h) because, when the petition was filed,
Petitioner advised J.T. of his right to seek independent counsel and financial
advice in connection with this transfer petition and advised J.T. of his right
to a reimbursement of $1,500 for incurring such costs. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (h); see also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings,
Amended Ex. A, California Disclosure Statement, p. 2 [necessary
disclosure]; 8/21/23 Amended Petition, Ex. A, Absolute Assignment Agreement and
Security Agreement, p. 3 at § B.10 [same]; 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Ex. K, J.T.
Decl., ¶ 11 [J.T. acknowledges receipt of admonition]; 8/21/23 Amended Petition, Ex. E [Statement of Professional
Representation signed by J.T. indicating he has received independent
representation and fully understands transfer’s implications].)
Finally, the Court finds that the petition satisfies
the entirety of the findings requirements set out in Insurance Code section
10139.5, subdivisions (a)(1) to (a)(6). These findings, which the Court
expressly makes by the following language, are that:
(1) The Court determines
that the transfer is fair and reasonable in the best interest of the payee,
taking into account the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents. J.T. is
collecting $541,475 for future payments of $1,836,596.97, whose discounted present value is $873,267.18.
J.T. is employed and seeks the transfer to “[i]nvest in high yield investment
opportunities that yield higher and consistent returns.” The Petition includes
a declaration from Oliver Kupe, a FINRA registered investment adviser, who supports
the transfer. Admittedly, the Petition does not clarify what type of “high
yield” investments will be sought by J.T. However, given the desire of J.T. to
proceed with the transaction, the well-funded financial and economic situation
of J.T., the fact that J.T.’s payment rights are/were not intended for future
medical care relating to the incident that led to the settlement payout in his
favor, and the fact that J.T. has a financial adviser that has provided a
summary of J.T.’s net worth and investments, the Court finds that sufficient
factors exist to determine that this transaction is fair and reasonable in the
best interest of J.T. and his dependents.
(See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(1) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subds. (b)(1)-(15)]; see also 8/21/23
Amended Petition, Ex. A,
Absolute Assignment Agreement and Security Agreement, p. 2-3 at §§ 3, 5-6; 9/25/23
Supp. Filings, Ex. K, J.T. Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, 14 & Sub. Ex. 1, Net Worth
Statement; 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Ex.
L, Kupe Decl.)
(2) The payee has
been advised in writing by the transferee to seek independent professional
advice regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly
waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(2); see
also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Amended Ex. A, California Disclosure Statement,
p. 2 [necessary disclosure]; 8/21/23
Amended Petition, Ex. A,
Absolute Assignment Agreement and Security Agreement, p. 3 at § B.10 [same]; 9/25/23
Supp. Filings, Ex. K, J.T. Decl., ¶ 11 [J.T. acknowledges receipt of
admonition]; 8/21/23 Amended Petition, Ex. E [Statement of Professional
Representation signed by J.T. indicating he has received independent
representation and fully understands transfer’s implications].)
(3) The transferee,
i.e., RH Funding, has complied with the notification requirements pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), has provided the payee with a disclosure form
that complies with Section 10136, and the transfer agreement complies with
Sections 10136 and 10138. (See Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(3); see also Ins. Code, §§ 10136, subds. (b)-(e),
10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(A)-(L) discussions supra & 9/25/23 Supp. Filings,
Amended Ex. A, California Disclosure Statement & 8/21/23 Amended Petition, Ex. A, Absolute Assignment Agreement and
Security Agreement.)
(4) The transfer
does not contravene any applicable statute or the order of any court or other
government authority. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (a)(4).)
(5) The payee
understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms set forth
in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(5); see also 9/25/23 Supp.
Filings, Ex. K, J.T. Decl., ¶¶ 10 [“I understand the terms of the [California]
Disclosure [Statement]”], 13 [“I understand the nature and terms of the
transaction”].)
(6) The Payee
understands and does not wish to exercise the payee’s right to cancel the
transfer agreement. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (a)(6); see also 9/25/23 Supp. Filings, Ex. K, J.T.
Decl., ¶ 14 [“I understand that I have a right to cancel the Transfer Agreement
up until the time the Judge approves the sale, and I do not wish to exercise
the right to cancel”].)
