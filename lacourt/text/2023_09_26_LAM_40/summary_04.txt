	* The transfer complies with the requirements of Insurance Code Sections 10134 to 10139.5.

**Section 10136 Requirements:**
	* The transfer agreement satisfies the disclosure form requirements set out in Insurance Code section 10136.
	* The transfer agreement satisfies the transfer-agreement requirements set out in Insurance Code section 10136.

**Findings:**
	* The transfer is fair and reasonable in the best interest of J.T. and his dependents.
	* J.T. has been advised in writing by RH Funding to seek independent professional advice regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice.
