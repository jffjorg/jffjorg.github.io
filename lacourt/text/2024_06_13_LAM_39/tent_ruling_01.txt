BACKGROUND
Defendants Choice
Hotels International Inc., Paladin Equity Capital LLC, Philip Powers, and Hotel
Management and Consulting HMC (“Defendants”) specially appear and move to quash
service of summons.  Plaintiff Gregory
Langadinos (“Plaintiff”) has not opposed the motion. 
 
ANALYSIS
Defendants move to dismiss this action under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1167.1. 
Section 1167.1 authorizes the Court to dismiss an unlawful detainer
action without prejudice if the plaintiff fails to serve the defendant with the
summons and complaint within 60 days of filing the complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1167.1.)  However, this is not an unlawful detainer
proceeding.  Based on Plaintiff’s
allegations, it is a general civil action to which the summary and expedited
proceedings involved in unlawful detainer actions do not apply.  As such, section 1167.1 is not the proper statutory
basis for Defendants’ motion.  Therefore,
the motion to quash is denied.
Defendants also argue Plaintiff has not
properly served Defendants.  Plaintiff
has not filed proofs of service reflecting service on Defendants.  Therefore, this contention is premature.
Defendants are ordered to provide notice of
this order and to file proof of service of same.
