Significant Statements:
  - "When jurisdiction is challenged by a nonresident defendant, the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to demonstrate that 'minimum contacts' exist between defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of personal jurisdiction." (Elkman v. National States Ins. Co. (2009))
  - "For claims sounding in contract, courts generally apply a purposeful availment analysis, where the focus is on the defendant's intentionality. This inquiry is only satisfied when the defendant purposefully and voluntarily directs his activities toward the forum so that he should expect, by virtue of the benefit he receives, to be subject to the court's jurisdiction based on his contacts with the forum." (Casey v. Hill (2022))
