And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is issued by the judge regarding a motion to dismiss the complaint filed by the defendants, Lisa Kim and Un Chong Kim, against the plaintiff, Do Young Kim. The plaintiff, a self-represented litigant, claims that the defendants failed to pay sums due under a divorce agreement between the plaintiff and defendant Lisa Kim. The defendants demur to the plaintiff's complaint and move to strike portions of the complaint.

The court rules that the demurrer to the plaintiff's first cause of action is sustained without leave to amend, as the claim belongs in family court and is not suitable for resolution in a civil action. The court also sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action with leave to amend, requiring the plaintiff to clarify that the claim is unrelated to the divorce action and to provide documentation and certifications as required by the California Rules of Court.

The court notes that the motion to strike is rendered moot by the sustaining of the demurrer. The court also strikes the prayer for attorney fees, as the plaintiff did not allege a basis for an award of attorney fees in the complaint. The plaintiff is ordered to file an amended complaint within 10 days of notice of the order.
