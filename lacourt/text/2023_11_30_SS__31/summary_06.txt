And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the unopposed motions to compel discovery responses from the plaintiff, Debra Cortez. The defendant, Robert Ortega, had propounded discovery requests on December 5, 2022, and the plaintiff failed to serve timely responses despite a meet and confer letter from the defendant's counsel. The Judge finds that the plaintiff was properly served with discovery requests and that the plaintiff failed to provide a timely response, waiving any objections to the requests. As a result, the Judge grants the motions to compel and orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days.

The Judge also awards sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $675, including $555 in attorney fees and $120 in costs. The sanctions are mandatory against any party that fails to comply with discovery requests without a court's permission.

The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement before the hearing date of November 30, 2023. If a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
