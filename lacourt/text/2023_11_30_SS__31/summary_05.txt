Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant Christian Jonathan Mejia's motion for a Protective Order to avoid responding to written discovery. Mejia, who is homeless, claimed that he had not had an opportunity to meet with his counsel and therefore should not be required to respond to discovery. However, the Judge found that Mejia's counsel had attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff's counsel, and that Mejia was aware that he had counsel and was aware of the pending lawsuit against him. The Judge concluded that Mejia's decision on when, if ever, he decides to cooperate with the litigation process is not good cause for a protective order to prevent Plaintiff from obtaining discovery. The Judge ordered Mejia to respond to discovery, and encouraged the parties to meet and confer to resolve the issue.
