And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michelle C. Kim in the case of Donna Lopez vs. Kathy Tepa, Julie Anne Miranda, and Rachel Anne Miranda. The case revolves around an automobile incident and the Plaintiff's attempt to add Rachel Anne Miranda as a defendant after initially identifying her as "Doe 1". Miranda is seeking to dismiss the Amendment to Complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff knew of her identity at the time the complaint was filed. The Judge has denied this motion, finding that the Plaintiff was genuinely ignorant of Miranda's identity at the time the complaint was filed. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff was under the mistaken belief that Rachel Anne Miranda was the same person as Defendant Julie Anne Miranda, the owner of the vehicle, and that the Plaintiff's learning disability and inability to read and write also contributed to her ignorance. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff did not unreasonably delay in substituting Miranda as a defendant, and that the requirements of CCP § 474 were met.
