And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel three independent medical examinations of the plaintiff, Jose Menchaca. The motion is brought by the defendants, Calitex, LLC, and Chadron Terrace, LLC, who seek to have the plaintiff examined by three separate specialists: a neuropsychologist, a general dentistry and orofacial pain specialist, and an otolaryngologist with a specialty in neurotology. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the examinations are duplicative or unnecessary, and that the defendants failed to make good faith efforts to resolve the issues prior to bringing the motion.

The judge finds that the defendants have shown good cause for the examinations, as the plaintiff's injuries are complex and involve multiple body parts. However, the judge also notes that the plaintiff is correct that the defendants did not comply with the requirement to provide a meet and confer declaration under CCP § 2016.040. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice at this time, and the parties are ordered to meet and confer on this matter.

The judge is hopeful that the parties will be able to come to an agreement and reach a stipulation, without the necessity of the court's intervention. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" and include the hearing date and time, counsel's contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.
