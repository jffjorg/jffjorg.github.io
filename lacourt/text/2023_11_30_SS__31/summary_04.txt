The Judge finds that the Defendant properly served the discovery requests and that the Plaintiffs failed to provide a timely response, compelling the Judge to order the Plaintiffs to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections. The Judge also awards sanctions to the Defendant in the amount of $840, which includes attorney fees and costs, for the Plaintiffs' failure to respond. Additionally, the Judge orders the Defendant to pay two additional filing fees and notes that the parties should meet and confer to reach an agreement before the hearing date.
