Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees and grants the plaintiff's motion to tax costs in part. The defendants sought to recover attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 and Civil Code section 1717, but the court found that the defendants failed to show that they were entitled to fees under these statutes. The court also denied the defendants' argument that they were entitled to fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 because their defense was in the public interest. The court awarded the defendants $2,126.83 in costs, including filing and motion fees, jury fees, and document retrieval fees.
