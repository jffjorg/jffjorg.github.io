Plaintiff’s Motion to Tax CostsThe court considered the moving papers, oppositions, and replies related to each motion.RULINGDefendants’ motion for attorneys’ fees is denied.Plaintiff’s motion to strike or tax costs is granted in part.BACKGROUNDPlaintiff The Hild Corporation dba Industrial High Voltage sued defendants Jason Paul Guillen, Tyson B. Schilz, Industrial Line Voltage LLC, and Gectwo, Inc. on February 9, 2022 for (1) conversion, (2) intentional interference with contractual relations, (3) intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, (4) negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, and (5) unfair competition.On September 11, 2023, the Court entered summary judgment in favor of defendants Schilz and Gectwo, Inc. (“Defendants”).On January 5, 2024, Defendants moved for attorneys’ fees. On the same date, they filed their first memorandum of costs.On January 22, 2024, Plaintiff moved to strike or tax Defendants’ costs. On February 21, 2024, Defendants opposed, and on February 27, 2024, Plaintiff replied.On March 5, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on the motion to tax to June 14, 2024, and set Defendants’ fees motion to be heard concurrently. The two motions were later continued again and set to be heard on this date.On April 24, 2024, Defendants filed a second memorandum of costs On May 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a second motion to strike or tax costs. After a continuance, the Court set the second motion to tax for hearing on this date also.On July 2, 2024, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiff’s second motion to tax costs. On July 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed its reply.On July 9, 2024, Defendants filed their reply in support of their motion for attorneys’ fees.LEGAL AUTHORITYRecovery of Attorneys’ FeesCode of Civil Procedure section 1021 codifies the “American Rule”, that each party to litigation presumptively bears its own fees: “Except as attorney's fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to their costs, as hereinafter provided.”Notwithstanding the “American Rule”, the Code of Civil Procedure and Civil Code both permit recovery of fees by statute or contract. Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 includes attorneys’ fees among recoverable costs “when authorized by ... (A) Contract. (B) Statute. [or] (C)Law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(10).) And Civil Code section 1717(a) states that “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other costs. [¶] ... [¶] Reasonable attorney's fees shall be fixed by the court, and shall be an element of the costs of suit.”Recovery of CostsThe rule for cost-shifting turns the rule for fee-shifting on its head: “Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b), emphasis added.) A party claiming costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a).) The opposing party may then contest the costs by filing a motion to tax costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1034; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b).) “If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.)TIMELINESSDefendants argue Plaintiff’s opposition to their motion for fees should be disregarded as untimely. The Court declines to disregard Defendants’ filing. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 128(a)(8) [discretion to amend procedures to conform to justice].) Plaintiff was able to file a substantive reply, and after several continuances had ample opportunity to sur-reply as necessary.DISCUSSIONThe parties have filed cross-motions. Defendants move to recover attorneys’ fees, which they have also included in their post-judgment memorandum of costs. Plaintiff has opposed Defendants’ fees claim and independently moved to strike Defendants’ cost memorandum.The Court discusses the overlapping motions in turn.Attorneys’ FeesDefendants argue they are entitled to recover costs based on Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 and Civil Code section 1717. They point to no contract between Plaintiff and Defendants that might authorize the Court to award fees in this instance. Instead, they argue “[t]he court may[] in its discretion award all costs and attorney’s fees to [an] injured person ... .” (Mot., 4:3-4, citing Chinn v. KMR Property Management (2008) 166 Caql.App.4th 175, 194 (Chinn).) Defendants also propose a broad reading of the phrase “on the contract” in Civil Code section 1717, suggesting that Plaintiff’s suit is on a contract because “ ‘the action involves a contract’ ”. (Mot., 4:10-16, citing Dell Merk, Inc. v. Franzia (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 443, 455.) In their Reply, Defendants also raise the argument that they are entitled to fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, which allows the Court to award fees to a party who litigates in the public interest. (See Reply, 3:1-6.)As to Defendants’ first argument: Defendants’ case law does not suggest the Court has discretion to award fees whenever it wants. The case discusses the Court’s well-established discretion to determine who is a prevailing party in order to shift fees or costs. (Chinn, supra, at p. 194.) Defendants do not show the Court has discretion to depart from the American Rule at will, nor does the Court believe it has such discretion.As to Civil Code section 1717: this action is not “on a contract”. Although the complaint refers to several contracts with third parties, none of Plaintiff’s claims rely on any contract with Defendants. Apparently Plaintiff produced some of these third-party contracts in discovery, and those contracts contain fee provisions. But none of those contracts are agreements between Plaintiff and Defendants, and none applies to this case.Defendants misstate the law when they suggest an action is “on a contract” whenever it “involves the contract”. Rather, “[a]n action is ‘on the contract’ when it is brought to enforce the provisions of the contract.” (MBNA America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006) 147 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 7.) That was the case in Dell Merk, Inc. v. Franzia (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 443, the only case Defendants cite in support of their argument. It is not the case here.Plaintiff’s own (mistaken) prayer for fees in its complaint does not amount to any waiver or concession on this point. The question for purposes of Civil Code 1717 is not whether either party demands fees, but whether “[either] party would have been liable for the fees of theopposing party if the opposing party had prevailed.” (Real Property Services Corp. v. City of Pasadena (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 375, 382.) Whether or not Plaintiff prayed for fees, they couldn’t recover them on any apparent contract. Neither can Defendants.Defendants raise their section 1021.5 argument only in Reply, but given the continuances of the motion Plaintiff has had an opportunity respond, and the Court considers the point. It is not persuasive.“[E]ligibility for section 1021.5 attorney fees is established when ‘(1) plaintiffs’ action “has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,” (2) “a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons” and (3) “the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.” ’ [Citation.]” (Conservatorship of Whitley (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1206, 1214.)Defendants argue their defense was in the public interest because by successfully defending themselves, they have thwarted Plaintiff’s hypothetical attempts to thwart third parties’ rights to contract. Even accepted as true, this hypothetical benefit to a small subset of third parties satisfies none of the requirements for fee-shifting under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.Defendants’ motion for attorneys’ fees is denied.Motion to Tax Costs“A prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal ... .” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a)(1).)The Court entered judgment for Defendants on April 11, 2024. The Court did not mail formal notice to the parties; the Court mailed its order to Defendants’ counsel and ordered Defendants to give notice of the ruling. (See 09-11-2024 Minute Order, p. 8.)On April 16, 2024, Defendants filed their Notice of entry of judgment with the Court with proof of electronic service and service by mail. (11-20-2023 Notice of Ruling.) While Defendants had previously filed a memorandum of costs on January 5, 2024, the court disregards it as it was premature. This ruling is predicated upon the memorandum of costs timely filed on April 24, 2024.Having considered that memorandum as well as the motion to tax costs, the court awards the following costs: Filing and motion fees in the amount of $1830.74, Jury Fees in the amount of $164.76, and Document retrieval fees in the amount of $131.33. The total costs awarded are: $2,126.83.RULINGDefendants’ motion for attorneys’ fees is denied.Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs is granted in part.
