And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to file a fourth amended complaint (4AC) that adds a new cause of action under California Civil Code § 16600.5. The plaintiffs, Matthew Miller, Donald Bake, Saad Khan, Mark Iroha, Joey Keane, Nathan Abebe, Christian Merchain, and Adam Stone, seek to add this new cause of action to their original complaint. The defendants, Manpow, LLC, United Investexusa 7, Inc., and United Investexusa 11, Inc., oppose the amendment, arguing that the new statute was not intended to be applied retroactively and that there is a strong presumption in California against the retroactive application of a new statute.

The judge believes that the amendment is proper because Civ. Code § 16600.5 plainly states that it applies "regardless of where and when the contract was signed" and that a "former employee" may bring a private action. The judge also finds that there is no indication in the new statute that it applies only to contracts signed after a certain date, unlike Civ. Code § 16600.1.

Therefore, the judge grants the motion and orders that the 4AC be filed separately. The judge also encourages counsel to submit on the tentative ruling and to use LACourtConnect rather than appearing in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
