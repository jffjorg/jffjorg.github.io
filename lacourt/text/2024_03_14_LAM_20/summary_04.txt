And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, granting the motion for summary judgment. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's claim is time-barred, as she filed her complaint on February 13, 2020, more than one year after she first suspected that Dr. Dorr had made a mistake in her care. The Judge concludes that the plaintiff knew or should have known of the alleged negligence as early as December 28, 2017, and that she continued to rely on Dr. Dorr's professional skill and judgment for six months after the purported "I made a mistake" statement. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's reliance on Dr. Dorr's care does not toll the statute of limitations, as she was already told of the mistake and did not discover her injury through lack of due diligence. The Judge also finds that the defendant has met its burden of showing that the treatment provided to the plaintiff met the applicable standard of care and that there is no evidence of causation. The proposed judgment will be provided within 10 days.
