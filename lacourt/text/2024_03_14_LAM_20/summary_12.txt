And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by TransUnion Rental Screening Solutions, Inc. (TURSS) to the Complaint filed by the Plaintiffs. The Complaint alleges violations of the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA), invasion of privacy, and declaratory relief. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the first cause of action, which alleges violations by TURSS acting as a landlord. The judge has also sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the second and third causes of action, which are derivative of the first cause of action. The judge has given the Plaintiffs 20 days to amend their Complaint. The judge has also denied TURSS's Motion to Strike as moot, given the ruling on the demurrer. The judge encourages counsel to submit on the tentative ruling and notes that in-person appearances are strongly discouraged due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
