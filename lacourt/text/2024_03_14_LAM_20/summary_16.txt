And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiff to compel the defendant (the plaintiff's sister) to produce their father, Clinton Richmond Jr., at trial. The plaintiff claims that they have been unable to serve their father with a trial subpoena due to the defendant's control over his whereabouts and intentional efforts to prevent service. The defendant argues that there is no authority to compel her to produce their father at trial. The judge finds that the plaintiff's showing of numerous prior failed attempts at service warrants some remedial action by the court. The judge grants the motion and requires the defendant to either produce their father at trial, reveal his location to the plaintiff, or accept an order that the father's testimony will be deemed to be in favor of the plaintiff.
