Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to strike references to punitive damages from Plaintiff Crystal Baires' complaint. The motion was filed by the defendants, Pueblo Restaurant Inc., dba Casa Torres Restaurant Y Cantina; Albert Gonzalez, Jr.; and Daniel Torres, who argue that Plaintiff's factual allegations against them fail to identify any wrongful conduct that meets the description of despicable conduct. The Judge disagrees, finding that the Complaint sufficiently pleads a basis for punitive damages against the Moving Defendants based on malice or oppression. The Judge concludes that the alleged conduct by Moving Defendants' security personnel in restraining Plaintiff and leaving her unattended and unable to escape the assault by the assailant constitutes a "conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others" and therefore supports a prayer for punitive damages. The Judge orders the Moving Defendants to file and serve their answer to Plaintiff's complaint within 30 days.
