  Case Number:  23CHCV03311    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2024    Dept:  F51  SEPTEMBER 19, 2024    MOTIONS TO COMPEL  DISCOVERY RESPONSES  (Form Interrogatories, Special  Interrogatories, Requests for Admission, and Requests for Production of  Documents, Set One) Los Angeles Superior Court Case  # 23CHCV03311     Motions Filed: 5/10/24   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Claudia Perez  (“Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant FCA US, LLC (“Defendant”) NOTICE: OK   RELIEF REQUESTED: Orders compelling Defendant’s  objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Requests for  Production of Documents (“RFPs”), Special Interrogatories, and Requests for  Admission (“RFAs”), Set One. Plaintiff further requests that the Court order  monetary sanctions against Defendant in the combined amount of $6,400.00.   TENTATIVE RULING: The motions to compel Defendant’s  objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first set of Form Interrogatories,  Special Interrogatories, and RFPs are granted. Defendant is ordered to provide  objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first set of discovery requests within  30 days. The motion to deem Plaintiff’s RFAs, Set One, as admitted, is denied. The  Court imposes sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $500.00, payable  within 45 days.   BACKGROUND   Plaintiff brings this action under  the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Civil Code § 1790 et seq.) for a  vehicle she purchased on or around 8/28/20, for which Defendant issued the  manufacturer’s express warranty. (Compl. ¶¶ 10–11.) Plaintiff alleges that the  subject vehicle exhibited “defective powertrain system; defective engine;  defective transmission; defective electrical system; and/or additional defects,”  and Defendant was “unable to service or repair the Vehicle to conform to the  applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of opportunities.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 12–13.)   On 10/30/23, Plaintiff filed her  complaint, alleging against the Defendant the following causes of action: (1)  Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (2) Violation of  Subdivision (b) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (3) Violation of Subdivision  (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (4) Breach of Express Written Warranty; (5)  Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability; and (6) Violation of Tanner  Consumer Protection Act. On 12/7/23, Defendant filed its answer.   On 12/8/23, Plaintiff served her  first set of Form Interrogatories, RFPs, Special Interrogatories, and RFAs on  Defendant. (Decl. of Jonathan Mora ¶ 3.) On 5/10/24, Plaintiff filed the  instant motions to compel Defendant’s responses thereto. On 8/27/24 and 8/28/24,  Defendant filed its oppositions thereto. On 9/9/24, Plaintiff filed her reply.   ANALYSIS   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to interrogatories if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd.  (b); 2030.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings  under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to a request for production of documents if the  responding party fails to serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ.  Proc. §§ 2031.300, subd. (b); 2031.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding  party who fails to serve a timely response “waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order deeming the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters  specified in the requests be deemed admitted if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2033.280, subd.  (b); 2033.250, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any objection to the requests, including one based on  privilege or on the protection for work product” unless the Court grants it  relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall  make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for  admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a  proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial  compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id. at subd. (c).)   Here, as Plaintiff electronically served  her first set of discovery requests on Defendant on 12/8/23, the last day for Defendant  to respond was 1/10/24. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6.) Defendant argues that the instant motions  are moot because on 5/28/24, Defendant served responses to Plaintiff’s  discovery requests, with verifications served on 7/7/24. (Decl. of Gregory G.  Brezovec ¶¶ 5–6.) Plaintiff  argues in reply that because Defendant has included objections in its discovery  responses, the responses are therefore not code-compliant, and the Court should  grant the instant motions. (Pl.’s Reply 3:24–4:2.)   The Court agrees, and reiterates  its above finding that Defendant failed to timely respond to Plaintiff’s  validly served discovery requests. The Court therefore finds that by 1/10/24,  Defendant had waived any objections to the discovery requests, as reminded by  Plaintiff’s counsel on multiple occasions. (Mora Decl. ¶¶ 6–8.)   Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motions to  compel Defendant’s objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first set of Form  Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and RFPs are granted.  As Defendant served responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs “in  substantial compliance” with the code, barring the inclusion of objections that  it has now waived, the motion to deem Plaintiff’s RFAs, Set One, as admitted,  is denied. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).)   Sanctions¿    “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.  Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).)   “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).)   “It is mandatory that the court  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)  on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests  for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd.  (c).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one  engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that  conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred  by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd.  (a).)   Here, Plaintiff requests a total of  $6,400.00 in monetary sanctions to be imposed against Defendant. Defendant  argues in opposition that sanctions should not be awarded, as “there is simply  no justification for sanctions in this case against FCA US given good faith  efforts to address its mistake by counsel.” (Def.’s Opp. 5:24–25.) Plaintiff  disagrees, arguing that “Defendant was afforded ample opportunity to comply  with its obligations under the California Code of Civil Procedure, but rather  than engage in good faith discovery Defendant chose to willfully ignore  Plaintiff’s requests for responses, Defendant chose to ignore Plaintiff’s meet  and confer efforts, and Defendant disregarded Plaintiff’s multiple extensions  to provide responses.” (Pl.’s Reply 5:15–19.)   In granting the instant motions, the  Court finds it reasonable to award Plaintiff sanctions against Defendant in the  amount of $500.00.    CONCLUSION  The motions to compel Defendant’s  objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first set of Form Interrogatories,  Special Interrogatories, and RFPs are granted. Defendant is ordered to provide  objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first set of discovery requests within  30 days. The motion to deem Plaintiff’s RFAs, Set One, as admitted, is denied. The  Court imposes sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $500.00, payable  within 45 days.
