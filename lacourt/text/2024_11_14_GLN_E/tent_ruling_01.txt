TENTATIVE RULINGS – COMPEL RESPONSES
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff, Peter Oliver, filed the instant action on 1/6/2021,
against Defendants, Karim Boumajdi aka Kevin Boumajdi (Boumajdi), and Tesla
Reseller Group.
 
The caption of the Complaint lists the causes of action as:
(1) Breach of Contract, (2) Common Counts, and (3) Conversion and Constructive
Trust. 
 
This dispute allegedly arose from Plaintiff investing in
Tesla Reseller (wholly owned by Boumajdi), wherein Tesla Reseller was to sell
used Tesla vehicles, and in exchange for Plaintiff’s investment, Plaintiff was
to receive ownership interest in Tesla Reseller. (See Compl. ¶ 5.)
 
On 6/2/2021, judgment by default was entered against Defendants.
 
On 3/24/2023, this Court vacated the default judgment that
was entered against Defendants.
 
Along with the two motions to compel on calendar for 11/14/2024,
two motions to be relieved as counsel are also scheduled for 11/14/2024. Trial
is set for 12/9/2024. 

MOTION 1
 
Moving Party:  Plaintiff, Peter Oliver
 
Responding Party: No response by Defendant Karim Boumajdi
aka Kevin Boumajdi (Boumajdi)
 
Moving Papers: Notice/Motion; Proposed Order
 
Opposition Papers: No Opposition by Defendant 
 
Reply: No Reply
 
RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 
“Plaintiff PETER OLIVER ("Plaintiff "), hereby moves the Court for an
order compelling Defendant KARIM BOUMAJDI aka KEVIN BOUMAJDI
("Defendant") to respond to Plaintiff's Request for Production of
Documents without objection as set forth herein. Defendant failed to respond in
any manner whatsoever to the Request for Production of Documents despite
further request of Plaintiff and despite Plaintiff’s meet and confer attempts
with Defendant’s counsel, all following Defendant’s failure to execute an
agreed upon Stipulation to for Entry of Judgment (with an accompanying
agreement to a moratorium on serving responses to discovery while settlement
and stipulation to judgment was pending). (See Declaration of Michael N.
Berke).
 
This Motion is made pursuant to CCP
§2031.300, et seq. on the grounds that Defendant has failed to submit any
responses whatsoever to the most basic and relevant discovery to this action,
all in an apparent attempt to circumvent the discovery process following his
failure to execute the previously agreed upon Stipulation to for Entry of
Judgment and his disregard and abuse for the moratorium on discovery responses.
With a pending trial date of December 9, 2024, rapidly approaching, Defendant
should be ordered to immediately comply with the discovery responses and
documents, without objection. Further, Plaintiff seeks a request for monetary
sanctions against Defendant in the sum of $3,860.00 for attorney fees and costs
incurred in bringing forth this motion.
 
This Motion is based upon all
pleadings, papers, and records filed in this action, this Notice of Motion, the
Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the Declaration of Michael N. Berke and
any further oral and/or documentary evidence that may be presented at the
hearing.
 
The Attorneys’ of record are to meet
and confer in a phone call before the hearing. Mr. Woo may appear remote by LA
Court Connect link.”
 
(Pl. Mot. p. 1-2.)


PROCEDURAL ANALYSIS
16/21 Day Lapse (CCP § 12c and § 1005(b): No – “Unless otherwise
ordered or specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting papers shall
be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing....However…if the
notice is served by facsimile transmission, express mail, or another method of
delivery providing for overnight delivery, the required 16-day period of notice
before the hearing shall be increased by two calendar days.” (See CCP §
1005(b).)
Here, 16 court days before the November 14, 2024
hearing would be October, 22, 2024. The moving papers were served via mail and
email/electronic transmission on October 22, 2024. Two calendar days should
have been added to October 22, 2024; however, Plaintiff did not do so.
Plaintiff’s moving papers are untimely.

Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC, Rule 3.1300): Ok
Correct Address (CCP § 1013, § 1013a, §1013b): Ok

LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INSPECTION DEMANDS
Within
30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the original of
the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of the response
on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on motion of the
party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for response, or
unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been directed, the court
has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2031.260(a).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). (CCP § 2031.300(a).) “The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions
are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240,
and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404
citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489,
pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)
SUBSTANTIVE ANALYSIS
Plaintiff’s Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, was served on Defendant, Boumajdi, on either
July 6, 2023, or July 26, 2023. The Court notes there is uncertainty as to when
the instant discovery was served on Defendant because Plaintiff’s proof of
service for the instant discovery lists that it was served on July 6, 2023;
however, Plaintiff’s motion, and Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration, states that
the instant discovery was served on July 26, 2023. (See Mot. p. 3, Berke Decl.
¶ 2, & Ex. A.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel, Michael N. Berke, states that no responses have been served to the
instant discovery request, as of 10/22/2024. (See Berke Decl. ¶ 2.)
Therefore,
here, it is clear that Defendant did not serve timely responses.
Typically, the Court would compel responses because of
the lack of timely responses; however, the Court would like Plaintiff’s counsel
to address the potential issue that the Court spotted on page four of
Plaintiff’s motion. 
 
Plaintiff’s motion stated:
 
Upon service of
the discovery, Defendant’s responses were accordingly due by no later than
August 28, 2023. Following the service of the discovery, Plaintiff’s counsel
engaged in settlement discussions with Defendant’s counsel Mr. Woo by which
counsel agreed to a moratorium on serving responses to discovery while the
parties discussed settlement. Notwithstanding the fact that Defendant Boumajdi
lives in both Morocco and Switzerland while Plaintiff resides in New Zealand
and that the communications between counsel and the parties has been difficult,
the parties agreed to stipulate to judgment on August 14, 2024. Counsel for
Plaintiff thereafter sent the Stipulation to Defendant’s counsel Mr. Woo the
next day in Word format, with Mr. Woo stating that he had no objection to the
proposed Stipulation. 
 
The Stipulation in
pertinent part provided: 
 
“Plaintiff shall
enter Judgment against Defendants KARIM BOUMAJDI aka KEVIN BOUMAJDI and TESLA
RESELLER GROUP, INC., a California corporation, in the amount of $226,000.00
forthwith.” 
 
Thereafter, on
October 3, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel was informed by Defendants’ counsel Mr.
Woo that despite his forwarding the Stipulation to his client for signature, he
was unable to contact Mr. Boumajdi and has been unable to obtain his signature
on the Stipulation for Entry of Judgment. (Declaration of Michael N. Berke).
 
(Pl. Mot. p. 4.)
 
The Court would
like Plaintiff’s counsel to address the fact that Plaintiff’s motion stated,
“Following the service of the discovery, Plaintiff’s counsel engaged in
settlement discussions with Defendant’s counsel Mr. Woo by which counsel agreed
to a moratorium on serving responses to discovery while the parties discussed
settlement.” (Pl. Mot. p. 4.)
 
The Court would
like Plaintiff’s counsel to discuss the issue mentioned above because it
appears as if Plaintiff’s counsel is admitting that the parties entered into a
moratorium on serving discovery responses. Therefore, maybe Defendant did not
serve responses because, as Plaintiff’s motion stated, the parties agreed to a
moratorium on serving discovery responses. At the hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel
should come forward with the alleged agreement/moratorium between the parties,
or if this is not a signed document, Plaintiff’s counsel should come forward
with whatever documents they have or explain what this moratorium was/is.
 
Further, the Court
fails to see what Defendants not signing the Stipulation for Entry of Judgment
has to do with this motion. The fact that the parties have not come to a
resolution on how they want to resolve this matter via stipulation is not
before this Court.
 

TENTATIVE RULING MOTION 1
Generally
speaking, the Court would typically grant a motion like this because Defendant
did not serve timely responses to the instant discovery request.
However, the instant motion is untimely under CCP §
1005(b) and can be denied on those grounds alone.
Further, as discussed above, the Court would like
Plaintiff’s counsel to address the issue the Court pointed out with respect to
the discovery moratorium that the parties allegedly agreed to.
Further, the Court would like Plaintiff to discuss any
potential discovery cutoff issues since the trial date is currently set for
12/9/2024.
As stated in CCP § 2024.020:
(a) Except as otherwise provided in
this chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete
discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning
discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially set for
the trial of the action.
(b) Except as provided in Section
2024.050, a continuance or postponement of the trial date does not operate to
reopen discovery proceedings.
(CCP § 2024.020(a)-(b).)
Further, the Court notes
that it appears that Defendants’ counsel appears to have two motions to be
relieved as counsel scheduled for 11/14/2024, which is the day that the instant
motion is scheduled to be heard.
The Court to hear
argument.
Sanctions
In relevant part, 2031.300(c) states as follows:
Except as provided
in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP
§2031.300(c).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Plaintiff’s
counsel seeks a request for monetary sanctions against Defendant in the sum of
$3,860.00 for attorney fees and costs incurred in bringing forth this motion. 
 
The Berke
Declaration requests sanctions as follows:
 
I have spent 4.5 hours preparing the
motion, i.e., including legal research and the drafting the motion and
declaration along with a proposed order. My regular billing rate is $400.00 per
hour. I estimate that I will spend 2.0 hours reviewing any opposition and
preparing a reply to that opposition. Appearance time, arguing the motion and
preparing a notice of ruling will require another 3.0 hours. The total hours
expended for this motion is estimated at 9.5 hours at $400.00 per hour which
equals $3,800.00 plus the filing fee of $60.00 for the filing of this Motion,
which aggregate a total of $3,860.00 in sanctions which are appropriate to be
ordered against Defendant Boumajdi.
 
(Berke Decl. ¶ 8.)
 
The Court points out that the Berke
declaration requested 2 hours reviewing opposition and preparing a reply;
however, no opposition was submitted, and no reply has been submitted.
 
 
MOTION 2
 
Moving Party:  Plaintiff, Peter Oliver
 
Responding Party: No response by Defendant Karim Boumajdi
aka Kevin Boumajdi (Boumajdi)
 
Moving Papers: Notice/Motion; Proposed Order
 
Opposition Papers: No Opposition by Defendant

PROCEDURAL ANALYSIS
16/21 Day Lapse (CCP § 12c and § 1005(b): No – “Unless otherwise
ordered or specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting papers shall
be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing....However…if the

delivery providing for overnight delivery, the required 16-day period of notice
before the hearing shall be increased by two calendar days.” (See CCP §
1005(b).)
Here, 16 court days before the November 14, 2024
hearing would be October, 22, 2024. The moving papers were served via mail and
email/electronic transmission on October 22, 2024. Two calendar days should
have been added to October 22, 2024; however, moving Plaintiff did not do so.
Plaintiff’s moving papers are untimely.

Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC, Rule 3.1300): Ok
Correct Address (CCP § 1013, § 1013a, §1013b): Ok

LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INTERROGATORIES
Within
30 days after service of interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories
are propounded shall serve the original of the response to them on the
propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court has
shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding party
the court has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2030.260(a).)
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (CCP § 2030.290(b).)
“The party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial
compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The

motion is scheduled to be heard.
The Court to hear

Sanctions
CCP
§ 2030.290 states in relevant part:
The court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response
to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.
(CCP §2030.290(c).)
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Plaintiff’s
counsel seeks a request for monetary sanctions against Defendant in the sum of
$3,860.00 for attorney fees and costs incurred in bringing forth this motion. 
 
The Berke
Declaration requests sanctions as follows:
 
I have spent 4.5 hours preparing the
motion, i.e., including legal research and the drafting the motion and
declaration along with a proposed order. My regular billing rate is $400.00 per
hour. I estimate that I will spend 2.0 hours reviewing any opposition and
preparing a reply to that opposition. Appearance time, arguing the motion and
preparing a notice of ruling will require another 3.0 hours. The total hours
expended for this motion is estimated at 9.5 hours at $400.00 per hour which
equals $3,800.00 plus the filing fee of $60.00 for the filing of this Motion,
which aggregate a total of $3,860.00 in sanctions which are appropriate to be
ordered against Defendant Boumajdi.
 
(Berke Decl. ¶ 8.)
 
The Court points out that the Berke
declaration requested 2 hours reviewing opposition and preparing a reply;
however, no opposition was submitted, and no reply has been submitted.
