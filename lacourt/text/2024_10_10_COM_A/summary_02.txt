Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the defendant's document requests. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant issued an express warranty for the 2021 Jeep Wrangler, which suffered from defects that the defendant failed to repair within a reasonable number of attempts, in violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The defendant's responses to the plaintiff's document requests were untimely and incomplete, and the judge finds that all objections are waived. The judge orders the defendant to serve amended substantive, verified, and Code-compliant responses without any objections, as well as production of the requested documents, within 10 days. The plaintiff is entitled to discover information about the same defects in vehicles of the same year, make, and model, as well as civil penalties, which is relevant to the defendant's knowledge of the defect and their policies and procedures.
