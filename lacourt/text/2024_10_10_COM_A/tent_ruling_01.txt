[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANT PETITION FOR  MINOR’S COMPROMISE 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING APPLICATION FOR DETERMINATION OF GOOD FAITH SETTLEMENT BETWEEN
PLAINTIFF, KALI WILLIAMS, A MINOR, AND DEFENDANT, TRUSTAFF MANAGEMENT, INC
 
      The first amended
complaint (“FAC") alleges claims for negligence against Defendants for
birth injuries suffered by the minor claimant (“Claimant”). The FAC also
alleges injuries suffered by Claimant’s mother for negligence and intentional
tort arising from the use of a vacuum extractor without her consent. 
      All
three Plaintiffs globally settled their claims for $700,000 with Defendants, St
Francis Medical Center (“St. Francis”) and Trustaff Management, Inc. in
exchange for the dismissal of all claims asserted by Plaintiffs. The parties
will apportion $560,000 to the Claimant and $70,000 to each parent. 
      Counsel
requests attorney’s fees of $135,879.55 according to the fee structure required
by the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (“MICRA”), and which is 24.3
percent of the minor’s share. (Bus.
& Prof. Code, § 6146.) The court also considers the factors under California
Rules of Court 7.955, in concluding that counsel’s fee request is reasonable. CA
Rules of Court, Rule  7.955 . The
court has reviewed Plaintiffs’ counsel cost ledger and finds that $63,141.80 in
costs is reasonable. 
      The settlement
involves medical expenses of $63,362.64. Medi-Cal has placed a lien on that
amount, and the parties have not finally resolved the amount of the lien.
Plaintiffs’ counsel requests that the court permit the preliminary lien amount
to remain in Plaintiffs' counsel’s client trust account until counsel can
reduce the lien. Plaintiffs’ counsel will disburse the funds to Medi-Cal when
the lien is finalized; any remaining amount will be added to the Claimant’
annuity.

[TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING APPLICATION FOR DETERMINATION OF GOOD FAITH SETTLEMENT BETWEEN
PLAINTIFF, KALI WILLIAMS, A MINOR, AND DEFENDANT, TRUSTAFF MANAGEMENT, INC.
 
      Defendant,
Trustaff Management, Inc., (“Trustaff”) requests an order determining that its
settlement with Plaintiffs for $550,000 in exchange for dismissal with
prejudice was made in good faith. 
      The
parties previously sought an order determining that the settlement was made in
good faith based on stipulation filed August 9, 2024, which did not comply with
the requirements for good faith determination. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 877.6 subd. (a)(2).) Gregory A. Sargenti, counsel for
Trustaff, then filed a supplemental declaration filed on August 30, 2024, in
support of the application. The court notes that no other party has filed a
motion to contest settlement.  
      Where
the motion is not opposed, a “barebones” motion and declaration setting forth
the background and grounds for good faith is sufficient. (City
of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261.)
Accordingly, the court GRANTS the application.
