The judge, Hon. Eric Harmon, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of LVNV Funding LLC v. Jeffrey C Shelton. The plaintiff, LVNV Funding LLC, had filed a default judgment application, but the judge has denied it without prejudice due to the plaintiff's failure to file a brief summary of the case, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800(a)(1). The judge considers the default judgment application to be valid in all respects except for this technicality. The judge's tentative ruling indicates that the case will proceed with the requirement for the plaintiff to file a brief summary of the case before the default judgment application can be re-submitted.
