And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Wesley Health Clinic, to the first amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Assetan Sylla. The defendant argues that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to sustain a cause of action for medical negligence. The judge agrees, finding that the complaint does not allege any breach of the standard of care or injury resulting from the defendant's actions. The judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot revise the complaint to address the defendant's concerns. The hearing has been scheduled for February 5, 2024, and the parties are advised to submit their positions on the tentative ruling by email before the hearing.
