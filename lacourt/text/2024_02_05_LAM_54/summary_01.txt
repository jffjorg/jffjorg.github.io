And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the Petitioner's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $212,958.00. The Petitioner, EHM Productions, Inc. dba TMZ, seeks to recover attorney's fees incurred to enforce a contract against the Respondent, Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. The Respondent opposes the motion, arguing that the Petitioner cannot recover fees due to non-compliance with Business & Professions Code reporting requirements and that counsel's hours and hourly rates are excessive. The court finds that the Petitioner's counsel's rates are commensurate with their experience and expertise, and that counsel's fees are reasonable. Additionally, the court finds that the Respondent's "dba" argument is unpersuasive, as the Petitioner has prosecuted the action under its true name, EHM, and the Respondent has not challenged the use of TMZ as a "dba" prior to opposition.
