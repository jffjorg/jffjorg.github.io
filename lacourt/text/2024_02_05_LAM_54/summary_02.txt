And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to set aside judgment and for attorney's fees. The defendant's motion to set aside judgment is denied because the defendant had adequate notice and opportunity to be heard, despite alleged attorney error and excusable neglect. The plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees is granted in the reduced amount of $58,269.75 in attorney's fees and $3,302.44 in costs. The court finds that the fees incurred after the May 2, 2023 hearing denying the plaintiff's first motion to enforce settlement are reasonable and timely.
