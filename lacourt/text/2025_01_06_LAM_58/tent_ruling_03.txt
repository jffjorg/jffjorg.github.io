[1] Defendants take the undisputed position that the Federal Arbitration Act
(FAA) applies to its Arbitration Agreement with Plaintiff. (Mot., 5:19-21.) 


[2] Defendant also argues that, even if the EFAA applies,
it only applies to the sexual harassment related claim and Plaintiffâ€™s other
claims must be compelled to arbitration. That is, the sexual harassment claim should
be severed. This argument is not well taken; when the EFAA applies, it precludes
arbitration of all the other claims of the complaint as well. (See Doe v. Second Street Corp. (2024) 105
Cal.App.5th 552, 574; Liu v. Minoso Depot CA, Inc. (2024) 105 Cal.App.5th
791, 802-805; Johnson v. Everyrealm, Inc. (S.D.N.Y. 2023) 657 F.Supp.3d
