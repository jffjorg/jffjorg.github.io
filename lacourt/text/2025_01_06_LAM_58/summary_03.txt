And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to the arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant argued that the FAA only applies to the sexual harassment claim, but the judge disagrees, citing multiple court decisions that the FAA precludes arbitration of all claims, not just the sexual harassment claim. The judge has also rejected the defendant's request to sever the sexual harassment claim from the other claims, stating that all claims must be compelled to arbitration.
