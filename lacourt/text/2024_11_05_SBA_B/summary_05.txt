And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling holds that the motion to compel responses and production of documents is moot because the defendant has already served responses and produced documents. However, the judge finds that the defendant failed to timely respond to the discovery requests and orders the defendant and its attorney to pay a monetary sanction of $1,560 to the plaintiff. The judge also orders the parties to meet and confer regarding the claimed insufficiency of the late responses.
