And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the defendant, Hyundai Motor America, granting its motion to compel arbitration in the case brought by plaintiff, Carlos Vasquez. The dispute arises from a warranty claim related to a 2021 Genesis G80 vehicle that was leased by Vasquez and had serious defects and nonconformities.

The Court found that the arbitration agreements exist and are enforceable, and that the arbitration provision in the Warranty's booklet covers the scope of Vasquez's claims. The Court also found that the arbitration provision is not procedurally unconscionable, as Vasquez had the opportunity to opt out of the arbitration clause, and that the provision is not substantively unconscionable, as it does not lack mutuality and discovery rules apply equally to both parties.

As a result, the Court granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration.
