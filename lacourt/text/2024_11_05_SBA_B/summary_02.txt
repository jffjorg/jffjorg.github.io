Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel binding arbitration and stayed the case. The plaintiff, Yingnan Cui, filed a complaint against Tesla Motors, Inc. alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration, arguing that the plaintiff agreed to arbitration in the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement (MVOA) and the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC).

The judge found that the arbitration agreements exist between the plaintiff and defendant and that the plaintiff did not opt-out. The judge also found that the scope of the arbitration provisions cover the plaintiff's claims against the defendant as they relate to the condition of the vehicle and arise out of the relationship.

The judge rejected the plaintiff's argument that the arbitration provisions are unconscionable, citing the California Supreme Court case Sanchez v. Valencia Holding, Co., LLC, which upheld the enforceability of a similar arbitration provision. The judge also found that the plaintiff had the ability to opt-out of the arbitration provision and that there is little to no substantive unconscionability.

As a result, the motion to compel arbitration is granted, and the action is stayed. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
