Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion for terminating sanctions against defendant Rosalba Quiroz. The plaintiff, KIG Properties, LLC, had filed a complaint against the defendant for nuisance, negligence, and preliminary and permanent injunction. The defendant had failed to provide discovery responses and pay sanctions ordered by the court, despite multiple attempts to compel compliance. The judge found that the defendant's conduct was a misuse of the discovery process and that the defendant had willfully failed to comply with the court's orders. As a result, the judge ordered that the defendant's answer be stricken and a default be entered against the defendant. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for additional monetary sanctions, finding that the terminating sanction was sufficient.
