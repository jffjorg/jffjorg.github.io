```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer hearing and has ruled that the demurrer is sustained with twenty days leave to amend as to the first and second causes of action in the complaint. The first cause of action alleges breach of contract, and the second cause of action alleges breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The court finds that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to establish the existence of an enforceable contract between the parties. The contract identifies a different name as the "client" than the defendant, and it is unclear whether this is a scrivener's error or otherwise.

The court also finds that the allegations are sufficient to establish consideration for the contract, as the written instrument is presumptive evidence of consideration.

The court notes that the second cause of action is not duplicative of the first cause of action, and that the demurrer is defective in that it does not comply with Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1320(a).

The court orders that the demurrer is sustained with twenty days leave to amend as to the first and second causes of action, and that defendant is ordered to give notice.
