Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion for summary judgment/adjudication brought by defendants Brian L. Flowers and Rachel B. Flowers, individually and as trustees for The Brian and Rachel Flowers Revocable Trust. The motion was filed in response to a lawsuit brought by plaintiff Willie Redmond, who claims to have been injured on a sidewalk behind the defendants' property. The defendants argued that they did not create a dangerous condition on the sidewalk and that the City of Los Angeles was responsible for maintaining the tree that injured plaintiff. The court found that there are triable issues of fact and that the defendants failed to establish that they had no notice of the dangerous condition.
