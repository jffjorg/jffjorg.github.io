And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Plaintiff's Frankeska Wilson's counsel, G. Seth Mitchell and the Barnes Firm, L.C. The motion was unopposed and was filed on September 6, 2023. The judge found that the attorney-client relationship had broken down and that the client's address was unknown. However, the judge also found that the plaintiff would suffer prejudice if counsel was to withdraw right before a discovery motion was scheduled for November 15, 2023. Therefore, the judge delayed the effective date of the order relieving counsel until after the November 15 hearing. The motion to be relieved as counsel is granted as of December 1, 2023.
