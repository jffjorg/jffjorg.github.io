And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the Person Most Knowledgeable for Futronics Corporation. The motion was filed after the initial trial date, and the Court finds that the motion is untimely. Additionally, the Court finds that the motion violates the Court's August 25, 2023 minute order, which stated that discovery would remain tied to the current trial date. The Court also declines to award monetary sanctions. The ruling concludes that Defendant's motion to compel the deposition is denied, and moving party must give notice.
