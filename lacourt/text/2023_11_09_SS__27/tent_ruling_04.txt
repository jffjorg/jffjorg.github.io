I.           
BACKGROUND
          Devin Gaston (“Plaintiff”) files the
instant action against First Transit Inc. (“Defendant”) after she was injured
while riding Defendant’s buses on December 10, 2019. (Complaint, ¶¶ 8-9.)
Plaintiff filed suit on December 13, 2021 alleging a single cause of action for
negligence. 
          Defendant filed (1) a Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Verified Response to Request for Production of Documents (Set One)
and a Request for Monetary Sanctions and (2) a Motion for an Order that the
Truth of the Matters Specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One)
be Deemed Admitted and for Monetary Sanctions (“Motions”). No opposition was
filed to either motion. 
II. LEGAL
STANDARDS
           Legal Standard for Requests for Production 
          “If a party to whom a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve
a timely response to it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The party to whom
the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4…(b) The party making the demand may move for
an order compelling response to the demand. (c) Except as provided in
subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2031.300)
          “The court may impose a
monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”
(CCP § 2023.030(a).)
          “Misuses of the discovery
process include, but are not limited to, the following: (d) Failing to respond
or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010)
          Legal Standard for
Requests for Admissions being Deemed Admitted
          Code of Civil Procedure §
2033.250, provides, in pertinent part, that “[w]ithin 30 days after service of
the request for admissions . . . the party to whom the requests are directed
shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party.” A
motion to deem admitted requests for admissions lies based upon a showing of
failure to respond timely. (CCP §2033.280(b); Demyer v. Costa Mesa Mobile
Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, disapproved on other grounds
by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 983.) Requests for
admissions must be deemed admitted where no responses in substantial compliance
was served before the hearing. (CCP §2033.280(c).) As to motions to deem
matters admitted, no meet and confer is required. (Demyer v. Costa Mesa
Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal. App. 4th 393, 395, overruled on other
grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal. 4th 973, 983. Also see Leach
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 904–906, 169 Cal.Rptr. 42 [rejecting
argument that state rule of court requiring informal meet and confer applied to
motion where no response at all had been made to interrogatory requests,
reasoning that because objections had been waived for failure to timely answer,
there was “nothing to ‘resolve’ with the meaning” of the rule)].) 
          “[A] motion to have
admission requests deemed admitted may not be granted where the record
establishes ... that (1) proposed responses to the requests have been served
prior to the hearing on the motion and (2) such responses are in substantial
compliance with the provisions of section 2033, subdivision (f)(1).” (Tobin
v. Oris (1992) 3 Cal. App. 4th 814, 828, overruled on other grounds by Wilcox
v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal. 4th 973, 983 n.12.) Courts evaluate tardy
responses to requests for admissions, in toto, to determine whether they
substantially comply with the code, and do not evaluate each individual
response. (St. Mary v. Sup. Ct. (2013) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 779-80.)
III. DISCUSSION 
          Here, Defendant presents the
Declaration of Sean Mintie (“Mintie Dec.”) which states that discovery requests
for both Request for Production of Documents and Request for Admissions were served
on June 8, 2022, while another colleague Ms. Soheila Mazdeh was with Defense counsel’s
firm. (Mintie Dec., ¶¶ 4 and 7.) After several attempts to contact Plaintiff’s
counsel, Ms. Mazdeh reached Plaintiff’s counsel by telephone and a deadline of August
3, 2022, was set for responses; however, no responses were ever received by
Defense counsel. (Mintie Dec., ¶ 7.) Ms. Mazdeh attempted to contact
Plaintiff’s counsel three more times, in April 2023, June 2023, and in August
2023, but to no avail. (Mintie Dec., ¶ 8.) After current Defense counsel Sean
Mintie attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel on September 28,
2023, no responses were received. (Mintie Dec., ¶ 10.)Therefore, the Motions
will both be granted, and sanctions imposed on Plaintiff, pursuant to Defense
counsel’s calculations as follows:
·        
Counsel’s
hourly rate is $225.00
·        
Counsel
spent 4 hours preparing each Motion
·        
Counsel
anticipated another 2 hours to review opposition briefs and prepare a reply. 
Considering the
similarities between the Motions, and the fact that no opposition was filed nor
reply submitted, the Court will impose sanctions on Plaintiff, and award
monetary sanctions to Defendant, in the amount of $1,500.00, in total
for both Motions together.
IV. CONCLUSION
Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Verified Response to Request for
Production of Documents (Set One) and the Motion for an Order that the Truth of
the Matters Specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One) be Deemed
Admitted are both GRANTED. The Court orders sanctions against
Plaintiff to Defendant in the amount of $1,500.00.  Responses are to be made and sanctions paid
within 30 days of this Order.
