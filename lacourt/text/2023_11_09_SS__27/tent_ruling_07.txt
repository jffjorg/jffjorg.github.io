          On January
20, 2022, Plaintiffs Obelo Federico Carbajal and Malissa Carbajal (“Plaintiffs”)
filed this action against Defendants Gomez Transportation LLC (“Gomez
Transportation”) and Jose Alfredo Mejia (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging:  (1) Motor Vehicle; (2) General Negligence;
and (3) General Negligence/Loss of Consortium. 

          Plaintiff
Obleo Carbajal was riding a bicycle at or near the curb on the Highway 110 Ramp
at or near Pacific Coast Highway when he was struck by a a 2008 Freightliner
Truck operated by Defendant Jose Mejia. 
Defendant Mejia was allegedly operating the vehicle as an employee of
Defendant Gomez Transportation LLC.  Defendant
Gomez Transportation is also the alleged owner of the 2008 Freightliner Truck
that struck Plaintiff Obleo.  Plaintiff
Obleo suffered catastrophic injuries due to the accident.  Plaintiff Malissa Carbajal is the wife of
Plaintiff Obleo and alleges loss of consortium. 

          On June 24,
2022, Plaintiff Obleo served (1) Defendant Gomez Transportation with Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for
Admission (Set One) and (2) Defendant Mejia with Form Interrogatories (Set
One).  On September 9, 2022, (1) Defendant
Gomez served unverified objections to the Form Interrogatories (Set One),
Special Interrogatories (Set One) and RFAs (Set One) Nos. 5-17; and (2)
Defendant Mejia served unverified objections to the Form Interrogatories (Set
One). 
          On June 27,
2023, Plaintiff Obleo filed three motions to compel further responses:  (1) a Motion to Compel Further Responses from
Defendant Gomez Transportation to Form and Special Interrogatories (Sets One);
(2) a Motion to Compel Further Responses from Defendant Gomez Transportation to
RFAs (Set One) Nos. 5-17; and (3) a Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set One) from Defendant Mejia (collectively referred to herein
as the “June 27, 2023 Motions”).  
          On August 29,
2023, the Court held an Informal Discovery Conference regarding the June 27,
2023 Motions.  Per the Court’s IDC order,
counsel were directed to meet and confer regarding supplemental responses by
September 8, 2023.  Plaintiff’s counsel
was directed to file supplemental questions/responses by September 15,
2023.  Defense counsel was directed to
file responses by October 6, 2023. 
Plaintiff’s counsel was also ordered to prepare and submit a Notice of
Outcome within five court days after the meet and confer.  
          On October
18, 2023, Plaintiff Obleo filed a “Supplemental Motion to Compel Supplemental
Amended Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) from Defendant Gomez
Transportation, LLC” (the “Supplemental Motion”).  Based on Plaintiff’s Reply in support of the
Supplemental Motion, the June 27, 2023 Motions are withdrawn and the only
motion before the Court is the Supplemental Motion.  (Reply filed on November 6, 2023, 3:3-5,
8-10.)
          Defendants
Gomez Transportation and Mejia filed oppositions to the June 27, 2023 Motions, arguing
they are moot.  Defendant Gomez
Transportation did not file an opposition to the Supplemental Motion but argues
in its oppositions to the June 27, 2023 Motions that the Supplemental Motion is
unauthorized and improper.  On November
6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a reply in support of the Supplemental Motion.  
          LEGAL
STANDARD — Compel Further Responses
CCP §2030.300
(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding
party deems that any of the following apply:
          (1) An answer
to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
          (2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate.
          (3) An
objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.
(b)(1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under the
California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.
(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the interrogatories.
(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter
7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.
(e) If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
further response to interrogatories, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
          If a timely
motion to compel has been filed, the burden is on the responding party to
justify any objection or failure to fully answer the interrogatories and RFAs.
(Coy v. Sup.Ct. (Wolcher) (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221; Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Stendell) (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
          ANALYSIS
          The June 27,
2023 Motions are off calendar.  This is
undisputed.  
          However,
there is a dispute as to whether the Supplemental Motion is properly on
calendar for hearing today, November 9, 2023. 
Plaintiff maintains the Supplemental Motion is allowed per the Court’s
August 29, 2023 IDC order; Defendant Gomez argues it is not.  
          On September
15, 2023, Plaintiff Obleo served Supplemental Amended Form Interrogatories (“SA
Form Rogs”) to Gomez Transportation.  (Supplemental
Motion, Low Dec., ¶9.)  On October 6,
2023, Gomez Transportation filed supplemental answers to the SA Form Rogs.  (Id. at ¶9.)  Plaintiff filed the Supplemental Motion on
October 18, 2023, seeking further responses from Gomez Transportation to SA
Form Rogs 7.0, 12.0 and 15.0.  
          Plaintiff’s
Supplemental Motion is not properly before the Court.  The Supplemental Motion is an entirely
different motion from those filed on June 27, 2023.  The Supplemental Motion pertains to SA Form
Rogs served on September 15, 2023, and responses thereto served on October 6,
2023.  The SA Form Rogs were never the
subject of the June 27, 2023 motions or the August 29, 2023 IDC.  
          In its August
29, 2023 IDC Order, no provision was made for Plaintiff to file a new
Supplemental Motion to be heard on November 9, 2023.  The Court only provided that if “a hearing
was necessary,” the June 27, 2023 Motions were continued to November 9,
2023.  (Minute Order dated August 29,
2023.)  The Supplemental Motion is
therefore not properly before the Court or on calendar for hearing on November
9, 2023.  
          In addition,
Plaintiff fails to testify to any meet and confer efforts on Defendant Gomez
Transportation’s responses served on October 6, 2023, to the SA Form Rogs.  Plaintiff cannot move to compel further
responses to the newly served SA Form Rogs until after he has met and conferred
in good faith pursuant to CCP §2030.300(b). 

          CONCLUSION
          Plaintiff
Obleo Carbajal’s (1) Motion to Compel Further Responses from Defendant Gomez
Transportation to Form and Special Interrogatories (Sets One)(CRS No. 9933);
(2) Motion to Compel Further Responses from Defendant Gomez Transportation to
RFAs Nos. 5-17 (Set One)(CRS No. 8586); and (3) Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One)(CRS No. 5124) from Defendant Mejia
are off calendar.  
          Plaintiff
Obelo Carbajal’s “Supplemental Motion to Compel Supplemental Amended Responses
to Form Interrogatories (Set One) from Defendant Gomez Transporation, LLC” is
not on calendar for hearing today.  Plaintiff
Obelo failed to obtain a hearing date on the motion through CRS and pay a
filing fee, nor was he authorized to file the Supplemental Motion for hearing
on today’s date, November 9, 2023.
