And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion by Plaintiff Nasir Amaya to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) and has granted the motion. The Court has ordered Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District to provide further responses to Interrogatories 12.1-12.3 and provide the witness information requested within 20 days. The Court has also overruled Defendant's objection based on Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 USC §1232g), HIPAA, California Education Code, and Los Angeles Unified School District Policy Bulletin 1077.1.

The Court has considered the parties' arguments and has determined that the Defendant's objection is overruled because the witness information is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 USC §1232g) and the California Education Code. The Court has also considered the parties' agreement that a court order would allow the Defendant to provide the witness information with the exception of phone numbers.

The Court has not imposed any sanctions because Plaintiff withdrew the request for sanctions on reply.
