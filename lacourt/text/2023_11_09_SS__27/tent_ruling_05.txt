Court approval is required for
all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.) 
The Court has reviewed the proposed settlements and finds that they are fair
and reasonable.  Further, the requested attorney’s fees, which in each
settlement amounts to approximately 25% of the total settlement, is fair and
reasonable. 
 
The unopposed Petitions to
approve minors’ compromise are GRANTED. 
 
The Court sets an OSC for
________________ for proof of deposit.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
7.953(a).)  If an acknowledgement of receipt by the financial institution
is filed before that date, no appearance will be required. 
 
Per California Rules of Court,
Rule 7.952, Petitioner and Claimants must appear at the hearing, unless the
Court finds good cause to excuse their appearance.  The Court finds that
Claimants’ appearance is not necessary, but will require Petitioner to
appear.
