And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, and 17.1, Set One. The motion is unopposed, and the judge construes the defendant's lack of opposition as a concession that the plaintiff's arguments are meritorious. The judge finds that the Form Interrogatories are on a standard form approved by the Judicial Council and that the requested information is directly relevant to the case. The judge orders the defendant to provide further code-compliant verified responses within 20 days of the order.

The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $2,206.41, which includes the cost of preparing the motion and appearing at the hearing. The plaintiff and their counsel must pay the monetary sanctions within 20 days of the order.

The judge's ruling is based on the facts that the plaintiff filed the action on September 19, 2022, and propounded Form Interrogatories on October 27, 2022. The defendant provided a set of supplemental responses on April 13, 2023, but failed to respond to the plaintiff's meet and confer letter regarding deficiencies in the responses. The judge finds that the defendant's objections to the interrogatories are improper and that the plaintiff is entitled to further responses.
