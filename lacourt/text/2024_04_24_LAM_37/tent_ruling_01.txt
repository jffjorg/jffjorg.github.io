Background
 
On June
8, 2023, Donald Rubio (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against the County of Los
Angeles (“Defendant”). 
 
The
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), filed November 3, 2023, alleges
three causes of action: 1) Unlawful Retaliation (Lab. Code § 1102.5.); 2) Breach
of Contract (Oral and Written); and 3) Malicious and Unlawful Violation of
Officer’s Bill of Rights. 
 
Defendant
County now demurs and moves to strike the FAC. Plaintiff has filed opposing
papers. The matter is now before the court. 
 
discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
            A.        Preliminary
Manner – Plaintiff’s Opposition
 
Defendant County points out that
Plaintiff’s opposition violates California Rules of Court, rule 1.208(4)
because line numbers on the left margin are not separated from the text by a
vertical column of space of at least 1/5 inch wide or a single or double
vertical line. In addition, the court notes that Plaintiff’s spacing is 1.2
rather than the 1.5 or double space permitted by rule 1.208(1).
 
The court agrees that had
Plaintiff’s counsel conformed to the formatting rules, Plaintiff’s opposition
would have exceeded the 15-page limit. (CRC, rule 3.1113(d).) The resources of
this court are limited. It is disrespectful to the court and Defendants’ counsel
that Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to circumvent the rules of the court.
Although the court considered Plaintiff’s opposition on the merits, if
Plaintiff’s counsel continues to fail to abide by the rules of the court,
Plaintiff faces the risk that his papers will not be considered or he will be
forced to refile his papers to confirm to the rules of the court.
 
B.        Summary
of Allegations in FAC
 
The FAC alleges that Defendants
retaliated against Plaintiff with a false investigation and by  wrongfully discharging him for filing a
grievance on illegally withheld salary and for reporting, resisting, and
stopping unlawful conduct related to a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department
(“LASD”) contract. (FAC ¶ 4.) 
 
                        i.
         The IAB Investigation
 
The FAC alleges that
Plaintiff reported Chief Laura Lecrivain (“Lecrivain”) for illegal conduct.
(FAC ¶ 5.) Specifically, that Lecrivain was “engaged in forgery under Penal
Code 470 and fraudulent misrepresentation under Penal Code 115, as she
attempted to cancel an LASD contract with the Community College Board.” (FAC ¶¶
7, 17, 84.) Plaintiff alleges that after he reported
the illegal conduct, LASD retaliated against him by destroying his career
through a meritless Internal Affairs Bureau (“IAB”) investigation in November
2020. (FAC ¶¶ 5, 7.) 
 
The FAC alleges that
before the IAB investigation, there was a criminal investigation related to
allegations made by the mother of Plaintiff’s son alleging that Plaintiff had
sexually assaulted her. (FAC ¶ 10.) Pending the criminal investigation, Plaintiff
was permitted to remain a Captain. (FAC ¶ 10.) The criminal investigation was
closed on or about October 28, 2020. (FAC ¶¶ 82, 83.) After the criminal
investigation was concluded and Plaintiff was cleared of criminal wrongdoing,
Lecrivain and Sheriff Alex Villanueva (“Villanueva”) initiated a follow-up IAB
interview. (FAC ¶ 96.) Plaintiff alleges that the IAB administrative charges
were concocted specifically to keep Plaintiff relieved of duty. (FAC ¶ 95.) 
 
The first IAB
interview was scheduled for February 11, 2021. (FAC ¶ 96.) After the first
interview, Plaintiff was told the investigation was completed and a summary
sent to Lecrivain. In March 2021, Lecrivain asked the IAB investigator to
reinterview Plaintiff about a potential violation of LASD Policy of Prohibited
Association. (FAC ¶ 99.) “This is the only policy out of all the
Department policies that has one disposition option if it is founded, which is
discharge of the employee.” (FAC ¶ 99.) Plaintiff was found guilty of violating
of the Prohibited Association by associating with the mother
of his son, which Plaintiff alleges was erroneous because LASD knew that due to
a court order for custody and visitation, Plaintiff needed to interact with his
son’s mother. (FAC ¶¶ 16, 34.) Due to substance abuse by his son’s mother,
Plaintiff had primary custody of his son and he was required by court order to
communicate with the mother to arrange visitation. (FAC ¶ 34.) 
 
Plaintiff argues the
IAB investigation should not have taken place because Lecrivain should have
stopped after the first interview instead of pursuing a Prohibited Association
policy violation. (FAC ¶ 100.) Plaintiff asserts that he only met with the mother
of his son three times a year, LASD was aware of his son’s mother’s prior
arrests and substance abuse, and the Prohibited Association violation was
pretextual and a retaliatory act against Plaintiff. Plaintiff further asserts
that on or around May 19, 2021, he was also investigated for not reporting a
temporary restraining order (TRO) in 2014, which Plaintiff asserts he did. (FAC
¶¶ 107-112.) Plaintiff was also charged with giving a false statement during an
IAB interview in relation to the TRO. (FAC ¶ 114.) 
 
On October 15, 2021,
tPlaintiff was served with a letter of intent to discharge for not reporting
the TRO and for violating the Prohibited Association policy. (FAC ¶ 113.) After
receiving the letter of intent to discharge based on the IAB investigation, on
November 24, 2021, Plaintiff attended his Skelly Hearing at IAB Headquarters.
(FAC ¶ 119.) Plaintiff asserts the Skelley hearing should have been conducted
by Lecrivain, but it was instead conducted by Chief Porowski. (FAC ¶ 119.) At
the Skelly hearing, Chief Porowski agreed to reopen the investigation based on
a prior defect that a key witness was not interviewed. (FAC ¶¶ 18, 120.)
Despite the IAB investigation reopening, Villanueva refused to overturn the IAB
decision. (FAC ¶ 19.) Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that on March 10, 2022,
after key witnesses were reinterviewed, Chief Porowski found that the
interviews were not enough to overturn the discharge. (FAC ¶ 123.) Chief
Porowski advised Plaintiff that he should settle and retire in lieu of termination.
(FAC ¶ 125.) 
 
Plaintiff asserts on
March 30, 2022, it was discovered that the interviews conducted by Internal
Affairs supported Plaintiff’s facts that he did not violate the Prohibited
Association policy nor made a false statement about the TRO.  This meant the discharge could be reversed
but Villanueva refused. (FAC ¶ 132.) 
 
                        ii.         Pay Grievance
 
Plaintiff also
alleges that in July 2020, he filed a pay grievance and that LASD retaliated by
relieving him of duty the next month. (FAC ¶ 6.) Plaintiff alleges that while
he was promoted to Captain in 2020, he was not being paid the same wage as
other Captains and, on the advice of his union, he filed a pay grievance. (FAC
¶¶ 12, 62, 63.) 
 
Plaintiff alleges
that on August 18, 2020, while on a paid vacation, Lecrivain informed him that
he was being relieved of duty.  She
arrived at this home and took away his gun and badge along with his county car.
(FAC ¶ 72.) Plaintiff alleges this was retaliation for the pay grievance and
the fact that a criminal investigation was pending at the time, despite LASD
being on notice some 16 months earlier about the investigation. (FAC ¶¶ 72, 77,
87.) 
 
iii.       Revocation
of Concealed Weapons (“CCW”) License
 
Plaintiff alleges
that the retaliation continued through the end of 2022 when he was denied his
CCW license and into the Spring of 2023 when his appeal was heard, and he was
granted his CCW license. (FAC ¶ 8.) 
 
                        iv.        Plaintiff’s Promotion and Subsequent
Demotion 
 
Plaintiff also
alleges he suffered a demotion after his promotion to Captain was reversed.
(FAC ¶ 8.) On June 2, 2020, Plaintiff was appointed to the rank of Captain at
Community College Bureau by Villanueva, despite the criminal investigation
still pending. (FAC ¶ 57.) Plaintiff alleges on March 19, 2021, Plaintiff was
demoted from the rank of Captain and removed from the department’s
Intent-to-Promote list. (FAC ¶ 104.) 
 
                        v.         Breach of Settlement Agreement 
 
Plaintiff also
alleges the county reneged on a settlement agreement that would allow him to
return to good standing and maintain a job in law enforcement. (FAC ¶ 8.)
Plaintiff alleges that due to the IAB findings, rather than waiting three years
for a civil service hearing, Plaintiff decided to “accept a proposed settlement
from the County” that, pending a background check, would allow him to retire
and then accept a position in another city that would pay $200,000.00 a year. (FAC
¶¶ 20, 121.) Plaintiff also alleges that due to some negative internet press,
the City required a background check. (FAC ¶ 122.)
 
The FAC asserts that
due to COVID-19, Plaintiff would have to wait three years for a civil service hearing,
so Plaintiff opted to seek settlement and retirement. (FAC ¶ 125.) Chief Porowski
presented Plaintiff with a settlement agreement that gave Plaintiff his retirement
credentials, allowed him to purchase his duty weapon, and have the case sealed.
(FAC ¶ 125.) Plaintiff further asserts that it was essential that any
settlement allowed Plaintiff to have his CCW license as it was a job
requirement for the City job. (FAC ¶ 125.) The FAC alleges that due to Lecrivain’s
intervention, Plaintiff’s CCW permit was revoked which sabotaged Plaintiff’s
employment opportunity and destroyed his career permanently. (FAC ¶ 20.)
 
The FAC alleges that
on or about March 17, 2022, Chief Porowski continued to communicate with
Plaintiff’s attorney about a settlement and that on March 14, 2022, Plaintiff
agreed with the settlement and agreed to not fight the case in a civil service
hearing. (FAC ¶ 127.) On March 25, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel inquired if
Plaintiff would receive his Captain credentials, but no response was provided.
(FAC ¶ 131.) The FAC also alleges that Plaintiff received the settlement
agreement on March 31, 2022, which required that Plaintiff retire at the end of
business day on March 31, 2022, which Plaintiff did.  Plaintiff would then be allowed to maintain
his CCW, be able to purchase his duty weapon, and receive his retirement credentials.
(FAC ¶ 22.) Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Chief Porowski asked Plaintiff
to show proof he was retiring on March 31, 2022, as a prerequisite to her providing
the settlement agreement. (FAC ¶ 127.)
                                                                                                                             
Plaintiff
also alleges that on March 31, 2021 [sic], LASD’s counsel confirmed that
Plaintiff would be allowed to retire in lieu of discharge and that LASD would
not interfere with Plaintiff’s application for a CCW license and/or retirement
credentials. (FAC ¶ 133.) On March 31, 2022, Plaintiff’s attorney confirmed
that Plaintiff would accept the terms of the settlement agreement. (FAC ¶¶ 135,
142.) Plaintiff asserts that under the settlement agreement, his retirement
paperwork was processed and delivered to Lecrivain for final approval on about
April 6, 2022. (FAC ¶ 143, 145.) Plaintiff asserts that on April 7, 2022,
Plaintiff learned that Lecrivain denied his credentials and the City put his
background check on hold. (FAC ¶¶ 147, 148.) 

 
On
April 11, 2022, County Counsel Ranasinghe Pirjo informed Plaintiff’s counsel by
email that because Plaintiff had retired without signing the settlement
agreement, there was no settlement agreement. (FAC ¶ 149.) Plaintiff asserts
that even if there was no written agreement, there was an oral agreement as all
terms were set out on March 31, 2022. (FAC ¶¶ 133, 149.) According to
Plaintiff, County Counsel Pirjo claims that Plaintiff’s counsel in the last
email had asked if LASD could change the false statement charge to unresolved
over the phone on March 31, 2022, and that such a request for a form of
renegotiation that negated the settlement agreement. (FAC ¶ 150.) On April 14,
2022, Plaintiff emailed County Counsel Pirjo asking her to confirm the
settlement agreement. (FAC ¶ 151.) 
 
Plaintiff
states that he would never have retired and fought his case in a civil service
hearing if Plaintiff had known that his credentials were going to be denied.
(FAC ¶ 152.) Plaintiff maintains that he received the settlement agreement on
March 31, 2022, and that the first item of the settlement required Plaintiff to
retire at the end of business day on March 31, 2022, which Plaintiff did. (FAC
¶ 152.) Plaintiff further asserts that Lecrivain should not have been the
ultimate decision maker over Plaintiff’s credentials as Lecrivain had been
taken off Plaintiff’s case and was not in charge of his case Review was not the
Chief in charge of his Skelly hearing. Instead, Chief Kelly Porowski was put on
his case review and Skelly hearing. (FAC ¶ 153.) Plaintiff asserts that
Lecrivain denied his retirement credentials at the direction of Sheriff Villanueva.
(FAC ¶ 163.) 
 
On April 22, 2022, the
City informed Plaintiff that it had reopened the position to other candidates
until Plaintiff got the situation resolved. (FAC ¶ 155.) On April 26, 2022,
County Counsel Pirjo informed Plaintiff that the matter had been elevated to Undersheriff
Murakami and that it would be resolved in favor of Plaintiff in a few days.
(FAC ¶ 156.) Six months later, Undersheriff Murakami made their decision and
County Counsel Pirjo informed Plaintiff that LASD was denying Plaintiff his
retirement credentials and CCW license. (FAC ¶ 156.) On June 19, 2022, the City
hired another Public Safety Director. (FAC ¶ 159.) 
 
On June 3, 2022,
Lieutenant Brian Moriguchi and former PPOA President inquired on behalf of
Plaintiff about the status of his retirement credentials.  Undersheriff Murakami informed them that
Lecrivain was upset about the emails Plaintiff had sent County Counsel Pirjo
about Lecrivain. (FAC ¶ 160.) Undersheriff Murakami asked that Plaintiff’s
counsel call him, but Murakami never returned the calls or emails. (FAC ¶¶ 160,
161.) 
 
On or about October
11, 2022, County Counsel Pirjo sent an email stating that LASD would not
overturn the denial of the CCW license and retirement credentials. (FAC ¶ 162.)
Plaintiff asserts that when asked why Undersheriff Murakami had not approved
the credentials and CCW license, County Counsel replied that they did not know.
(FAC ¶ 162.) Plaintiff decided to appeal the decision but to date has not
gotten an appeal hearing. (FAC ¶ 165.) 
 
Plaintiff alleges the
County failed to honor the agreement by failing to allow Plaintiff to keep his
CCW license and his retirement credentials. (FAC ¶¶ 23.) Plaintiff asserts he
was tricked into a constructive termination with the promise that would receive
his CCW license and retirement badge. (FAC ¶ 163.) Plaintiff asserts that after
he filed this action, an appeal hearing was held and LASD officials
acknowledged Plaintiff should not have been denied his full retirement
credentials with his CCW license. (FAC ¶ 166.) Plaintiff asserts that the LASD
and the Couty are responsible for all acts of discrimination, harassment, and
retaliation commencing in 2020 under the continuing violation doctrine. (FAC ¶
168.) 
 
Defendant County now
demurs to all three causes of action alleged in the FAC on the basis that it
fails to plead sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. (CCP §
430.10(e).) 
 
C.
       First Cause of Action – Retaliation
under Lab. Code § 1102.5
 
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Labor
Code § 1102.5, “a plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in a protected
activity, (2) his employer subjected him to an adverse employment action, and
(3) there is a causal connection between the two.” (Mokler v. County of
Orange (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 121, 138.) The McDonnell Douglass
burden-shifting framework does not apply to section 1102.5.  Instead an employee-whistleblower must
establish “by a preponderance of the evidence that retaliation was a
contributing factor in the employee's termination, demotion, or other adverse
action, the employer then bears the burden of demonstrating by clear and
convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action ‘for legitimate,
independent reasons.’” (Lawson v. PPG
Architectural Finishes, Inc. (2022)
12 Cal.5th 703, 707 (Lawson).)
 
The FAC states that Plaintiff’s retaliation claim is
premised on filing a pay grievance in July 2020 and reporting illegal conduct
by Lecrivain on November 14, 2020. (FAC ¶¶ 178, 179.) Labor Code § 1102.5
requires the employee share information “the employee ‘has reasonable cause to believe ... discloses a violation of
state or federal statute’ or of ‘a local, state, or federal rule or regulation’
with a government agency, with a person with authority over the employee, or
with another employee who has authority to investigate or correct the
violation.” (Lawson, supra, 12
Cal.5th at p. 709 citing Lab. Code § 1102.)
 
As to the pay grievance, Plaintiff alleges a
wage violation because he was not paid full wages when he was acting as Captain.  Plaintiff fails, however, to state what
government agency or the name of the person with authority to fix the wage
violation or to whom he made the wage complaint. (FAC ¶ 6, 63.) Similarly,
Plaintiff fails to name the government agency or the name of the person with
authority to investigate and correct the illegal actions of Lecrivain to whom he
reported Lecrivain’s illegal conduct. Hence, there are no facts to show that
Plaintiff engaged in whistleblowing.
 
Similarly, Plaintiff fails to allege facts to
show a temporal proximity between Plaintiff reporting the wage violation and
Lecrivain’s illegal conduct to support the finding that Plaintiff experienced
retaliation causally connected to his whistleblowing activity. Plaintiff fails
to show that on August 18, 2020, when he was relieved of duty and his gun and
badge were taken away, it was due to Lecrivain being aware that Plaintiff had
reported her illegal conduct. (FAC ¶ 72.) Plaintiff also fails to allege facts
that this conduct was retaliation by Lecrivain for Plaintiff having made a pay
grievance and that Lecrivain knew Plaintiff had made a pay grievance. (FAC ¶
72.) 
 
Furthermore, although Plaintiff alleges Lecrivain
was responsible for the faulty IAB investigation, the ultimate decision-makers
are alleged to have been Chief Porowski and Sheriff Alex Villanueva and not
Lecrivain. (FAC ¶¶ 123, 153.) There are also no facts to show that Lecrivain
controlled the findings of the IAB investigation or directed the IAB investigators
to find against Plaintiff. As to the denial of Plaintiff’s retirement
credentials and CCW license, the FAC alleges Undersheriff Murakami was the
ultimate decision maker, not Lecrivain. (FAC ¶ 160.) 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to allege facts to
show that the pay grievance and the reporting of Lecrivain's illegal conduct
were contributing factors to Plaintiff’s retaliation.  Plaintiff fails to allege facts to show a
causal connection between the whistleblowing activity and the retaliatory acts.
(See Lawson, supra, 12 Cal.5th at p. 707.) Therefore, the
demurrer to the first cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
            D.         Second
Cause of Action – Breach of Contract (Oral and Written)
 
The elements of a claim for breach of
contract are: “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance
or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting
damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51
Cal. 4th 811, 821.) In addition, the complaint must demonstrate damages
proximately caused by the breach. (St. Paul Ins. v. American Dynasty (2002)
101 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1060.) Furthermore, “the complaint must [also] indicate
on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct.” (Otworth
v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458-59
citing CCP, § 430.10(g).)
“If the action is
based on alleged breach of written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim
in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be
attached and incorporated by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman &
Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 308.) Alternatively, “a plaintiff may
plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.”¿ (Construction
Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,
198-199.)¿¿“[A]ll essential elements of a breach of contract cause of action []
must be pleaded with specificity.”¿(Levy v. State Farm Mutual Automobile
Ins. Co. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1, 5.) 
 
Defendants argue that the alleged
contract is not sufficiently definite to be enforceable. “Whether a contract
term is sufficiently definite to be enforceable is a question of law for the
court.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19
Cal.App.4th 761, 770, fn. 2.) The FAC does not include a copy of the written
settlement agreement nor are the full terms of the said agreement set out
verbatim in the complaint. Although the FAC references some of the terms of
the agreement being set out by email in Paragraph 133, the FAC also alleges
County Counsel Pirjo believed that the agreement was still to be renegotiated
as confirmed by email. (FAC ¶ 150.) Consequently, the FAC fails to allege facts
that there was mutual asset between the parties to show the existence of an
express or an implied contract. (See Allied Anesthesia
Medical Group, Inc. v. Inland Empire Health Plan
(2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 794, 808 [mutual assent is a requirement for both an
express contract and an implied in fact contract].) 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the second cause of action is
sustained with leave to amend. 
 
E.        Third
Cause of Action – Unlawful Violations of the Public Safety Officers Procedural
Bill of Rights Act (POBRA): Failure to Comply with One-Year Statute of
Limitation 
Government Code § 3304(d)(1)
states: 
 
Except as provided in this subdivision and subdivision (g),
no punitive action, nor denial of promotion on grounds other than merit, shall
be undertaken for any act, omission, or other allegation of misconduct if the
investigation of the allegation is not completed within one year of the public
agency's discovery by a person authorized to initiate an investigation of the
allegation of an act, omission, or other misconduct. This one-year limitation
period shall apply only if the act, omission, or other misconduct occurred on
or after January 1, 1998. In the event that the public agency determines that
discipline may be taken, it shall complete its investigation and notify the
public safety officer of its proposed discipline by a Letter of Intent or
Notice of Adverse Action articulating the discipline that year, except as
provided in paragraph (2). The public agency shall not be required to impose
the discipline within that one-year period.


“Notice of ‘proposed disciplinary action’
must be given to the public safety officer within the 1-year period required
for investigation. However, the public agency is not required to impose the
discipline within that 1-year period.” (8 Witkin, Summary 11th Const Law §
1079(c) (2023).) Moreover, section 3304(d) does not “require notice of specific
proposed punishment” “but “simply notice that the public agency, having
completed its investigation into the alleged misconduct within the statutory
period, has decided that it may take disciplinary action against the officer
for specified misconduct. Although the agency is not precluded
from proposing specific discipline at that time, it is not required by section
3304(d) to do so.” (Mays v. City of Los Angeles (2008)
43 Cal.4th 313, 318 [italics original].)
 
The POBRA statute of limitations is
tolled during the period the misconduct in question is the subject of a
criminal investigation or prosecution. (Gov. Code, §§ 3304(d)(2)(A),
3254(d)(2); Richardson v. City & County of San Francisco (2013) 214
Cal.App.4th 671, 691-699 [upholding trial court's findings that criminal
investigations were ongoing so that POBRA limitations period was tolled]; Department
of Corrections & Rehabilitation v. State Personnel Bd. (2016) 247
Cal.4th 700, 708 [tolling applies to a criminal investigation by an employer as
well as by outside agencies].) 
 
Here, the FAC alleges that the charges
against Plaintiff were dropped on October 30, 2020, in relation to the criminal
investigation by the District Attorney’s office. (FAC ¶¶ 61, 83.) Accordingly,
October 30, 2020, was the date the criminal investigation was completed. As
Plaintiff was served with the Letter of Intent to discharge on October 15,
2021, Defendant’s letter complied with the one-year statute of limitation. (FAC
¶ 113.) The IAB investigation began on February 11, 2021, thus making the October
15, 2021, Letter of Intent to Discharge still timely as the IAB investigation
was still pending well into March 10, 2022. (FAC ¶¶ 96, 123.) 
 
Therefore, based on the allegations in
the FAC the October 15, 2021, letter of intent for discharge was timely, and
the statute of limitations was tolled pending the IAB investigation.
Plaintiff’s opposition fails to allege any facts to permit the finding that the
October 15, 2021, letter was untimely and in violation of Government Code § 3304(d).
Therefore, the demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained without leave
to amend. 
 
III.      Motion to Strike
 
As the demurrer to the FAC has
been sustained, Defendant County’s motion to strike is denied as moot. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
County’s demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to the first cause of
action for unlawful retaliation (Lab. Code, § 1102.5) and second cause of
action for breach of contract and sustained without leave to amend as to the
third cause of action for violation of the Peace Officer’s Bill of Rights.
Plaintiff is granted 30 days leave to amend. The court sets the OSC RE: Amended
Complaint for May 31, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Defendant County to give notice.
