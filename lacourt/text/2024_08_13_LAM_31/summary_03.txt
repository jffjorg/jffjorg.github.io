And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel arbitration in a case involving sexual harassment claims. The plaintiff's complaint lacks factual specificity, which the defendant argues should be sufficient to dismiss the complaint. However, the judge is not persuaded by this argument, citing differences in pleading standards between federal and California state courts. The judge also rejects the defendant's alternative request to sever the sexual harassment claims from the non-sexual harassment claims, as the factual deficiencies in the complaint prevent a ruling on this request. The judge defers its ruling on the motion to compel arbitration and will consider additional evidence before making a final decision.
