And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case Fermin Garcia v. Quik Tow LLC, et al. (Case No. 22STCV31358). The case involves wage and hour violations by Quik Tow LLC and Ignacio Gonzalez. The plaintiff, Fermin Garcia, served Gonzalez with discovery requests in January 2024, but Gonzalez failed to respond. Garcia filed motions to compel Gonzalez's responses and to deem requests for admissions admitted against Gonzalez. The defendants filed substitutions of attorney, and Gonzalez remains self-represented.

The judge has continued the motion to September 16, 2024, to allow Garcia to personally serve Gonzalez with the motions. The judge directs Garcia to serve Gonzalez with the motions unless the parties agree to electronic service, file proof of agreement with the court, and serve Gonzalez with the motions along with proof of service.
