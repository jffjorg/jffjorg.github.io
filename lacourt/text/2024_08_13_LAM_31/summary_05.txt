And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case, which does not favor the plaintiff. The plaintiff's opposition to the defendant's motion has not helped its case, as it suggests that the plaintiff intentionally omitted a term from the notice and deviated from the statutory language. The judge notes that the definition of "person in the course of doing business" excludes certain entities, including those with fewer than 10 employees. The judge also rules that a private enforcer may file suit only if a public prosecutor has not commenced an enforcement action within 60 days of the notice period. The plaintiff's contention that a Proposition 65 claim must be filed within a year after the notice period ends is not supported by authority.
