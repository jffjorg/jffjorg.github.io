And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Healthy California LLC v. Shan Foods PVT. LTD, et al. The court has granted Walmart's demurrer to the fifth cause of action, which alleges that Walmart failed to provide Proposition 65 warnings for certain food products. The court has also granted leave to amend the pleading. However, the court is inclined to stay the case pending the appeal in Kreassive, which involves a similar issue regarding the certificate of merit. The court has further ruled that the statute of limitations for the claim is not yet expired, as the alleged violations are ongoing.
