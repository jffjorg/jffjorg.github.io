Fermin Garcia
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On September 26, 2022, Plaintiff, Fermin Garcia, filed this
action against Defendants, Quik Tow LLC (“Quik Tow”) and Ignacio Gonzalez
(“Gonzalez”), for wage and hour violations.
 
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff served Gonzalez with the
First Set of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for
Production of Documents, and Request for Admissions (RFA).  Gonzalez did not serve responses.
 
On April 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed these motions to compel Gonzalez’s
responses to the interrogatories and production demands, and to deem the RFAs admitted
against Gonzalez.  The motions were
served to Gonzalez’s counsel. 
 
On June 20, 2024, Defendants filed a Substitution of
Attorney indicating that Defendants were now self-represented.
 
On July 9, 2024, Quik Tow filed a Substitution of Attorney
indicating it had retained new counsel. 
Gonzalez remains self-represented. 

 
Given that Gonzalez is a self-represented litigant, the
court directs Plaintiff to personally serve Gonzalez with these motions unless the
parties agree to electronic service, file proof of agreement with the court,
and serve Defendant Gonzalez with these motions along with proof of service.  
 
II.        CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s discovery motions are
CONTINUED to September 16, 2024, to allow Plaintiff to personally serve
Defendant Ignacio Gonzalez with these motions. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
