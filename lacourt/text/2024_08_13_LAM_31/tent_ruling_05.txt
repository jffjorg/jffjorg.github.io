[1] Plaintiff’s opposition does not
help its cause.  Indeed, Plaintiff’s
opposition suggests it omitted the term intentionally and specifically choose
to deviate from the statutory language.  (Opp.,
p. 3:27-28.)  .


[2] (b) “Person in the course of doing
business” does not include any person employing fewer than 10 employees in his
or her business; any city, county, or district or any department or agency
thereof or the state or any department or agency thereof or the federal
government or any department or agency thereof; or any entity in its operation
of a public water system as defined in Section 116275.  (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.11, subd.
(b).)


[3] (f) For purposes of
subsection (e)(5):
(1) “Actual
knowledge” means the retail seller receives information from any reliable
source that allows it to identify the specific product or products that cause
the consumer product exposure. Such knowledge must be received by the retail
seller, its authorized agent or a person whose knowledge can be imputed to the
retail seller.
 
(2) Where
the source of a retail seller's knowledge is a notice pursuant to
Section 25249.7(d)(1) of the Act, the retail seller shall not be
deemed to have actual knowledge of any consumer product exposure alleged in the
notice until five business days after the retail seller receives the notice.
The notice must provide sufficient specificity for the retail seller to readily
identify the product or products subject to the notice, in accordance with
Article 9, section 25903(b)(2)(D).
 


[4] A private enforcer may file suit
only if, after the 60-day notice period, no public prosecutor has commenced an
enforcement action on the claim identified in the notice.  (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.7, subd. (d).)
 Plaintiff contends that a Proposition 65
claim must be filed within a year after the 60-day pre-suit notice period
ends.   However, Plaintiff does not cite any authority
in support of that proposition.
