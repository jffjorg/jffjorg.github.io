 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Petitioner Erika Lopez’s Petitions for Minor’s
  Compromise
 



 
This action involves a breach of
warranty of habitability action brought by tenant Plaintiffs Charlie Jordan,
Erika Lopez, and minors, Eliezer Danilo Franco Lopez, and Massieli Adriana
Franco Lopez, against Defendants Dikran Keskerian, and Anny Keskerian, as
trustees of the Keskerian Family Trust.  
The Complaint alleges that the
residential property leased by plaintiffs from defendants was plagued with
vermin, insects and rodent infestations, had defective and deteriorated
flooring, was improperly maintained, failed to conform to code regulations, did
not have operable, clean and sanitary windows and doors, had loose plumbing
fixtures, and lacked the required electrical lighting.  Plaintiffs filed
their complaint in October of 2023, and the first amended complaint alleges causes
of action for: (1) Breach of Warranty of Habitability; (2) Breach of Covenant
of Quiet Enjoyment; (3) Negligence; and (4) Breach of Contract. 
            On
July 1, 2024, Petitioner and Guardian Ad Litem Erika Lopez filed two unopposed
Petitions for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action for Minors (the
“Petitions”) Eliezer Danilo Franco Lopez and Massieli Adriana Franco Lopez.  The
Petitions detail a gross $95,000 Settlement between the Parties, with a
distribution of $60,000 to Charlie Jordan, and $25,000 to Erika Lopez, and $5,000
for each of Claimant, and a final net settlement of $3,438.35 for each Claimant. 

 Petitions
to Approve Compromise for Minor or Person with Disability: GRANTED 
 
Legal Standard: Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 372, any settlement of a claim made by a minor or adult with a
disability must be approved by the Court.  (See also Prob. Code § 3600,
subd. (b) [a compromise or covenant for a disputed claim or damages, money, or
other property of a minor or person who lacks legal capacity is valid only
after it has been approved by the superior court].) ¿A petition for court
approval of a compromise of a minor or disabled adult’s compromise or
settlement of a pending action or proceeding to which this person is a party
must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise,
covenant, settlement, or disposition.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950;
see also Cal. Rules of Court, rules 7.951-52.)  The petition is generally
submitted on a completed Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or
Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with a
Disability (form MC-350).  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  If
the Court is satisfied that the settlement is in the best interest of
the¿person, then the Court should approve the settlement.¿¿(See Pearson v.
Superior Ct.¿(2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)¿¿¿¿  
 
Procedural Requirements: A review of the instant Petition
shows that it meets the requirements of California Rules of Court, rules 7.950
to 7.955. 
            The
Petitions satisfy California Rules of Court, rule 7.950.  Petitioner
submits a verified Civil Form MC-350 seeking approval of a settlement between
Defendants and Claimants.  (See Petitions, p. 10 [Petitioner
verification].)  Further, the Petition contains a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise,
covenant, settlement, or disposition, in satisfaction of California Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.  The Petition details $95,000 in gross settlement funds
to be distributed to Plaintiffs.  (Petitions, ¶¶ 11, 12.)  Plaintiffs
Jordan and Lopez are set to receive gross settlements of $60,000 and $25,000,
respectively.  (Petitions, Attach. 12.)  Claimants are each to
receive a gross settlement of $5,000 and net compromise of $3,438.35. 
(Petitions, ¶ 17(f), Attach. 12.)  The remaining $1,250 of the Claimants’
net settlement will be used to pay attorney’s fees, and $311.65 will be used
for costs.  (Petitions, ¶ 17(c), 17(e); see also Petitions, ¶ 14(b).)
            The
Petitions satisfy California Rules of Court, rule 7.951.  This requirement
provides that where a petitioner that has been represented or assisted by an
attorney in preparing the petition to compromise the claim or in any other
respect with regard to the claim, the petition must disclose specific
information, which the Petitions contain as follows: 
 
(1) The name, state bar number, law
firm, if any, and business address of the attorney.  (Petitions, ¶¿17(b)(1)-(3)
[Daniel Gibalevich/Rachel Fishenfeld, 217116/270310, DAG LAW FIRM APC 12711
Ventura Blvd., Suite 220, Studio City, CA 91604].) 
(2) Whether the attorney has received
any attorney’s fees or other compensation for services provided in connection
with the claim giving rise to the petition or with the preparation of the
Petitions, and, if so, the amounts and the identity of the person who paid the
fees or other compensation.  (Petitions, ¶¿17(c) [has not]). 
(3) Whether the attorney became
involved with the Petitions, directly or indirectly, at the instance of any
party against whom the claim is asserted or of any party’s insurance
carrier.  (Petitions, ¶¿17(d) [did not so become involved]). 
(4) Whether the attorney represents or
is employed by any other party or any insurance carrier involved in the
matter.  (Petition ¶¿17(e), Attach. 18(e) [is representing another party,
i.e., both Macias-Vasquez Children and their parents, Plaintiffs Claudia Macias
and Omar Vasquez]). 
(5) If the attorney has not received
any attorney’s fees or other compensation for services provided in connection
with the claim giving rise to the petition or with the preparation of the
Petitions, whether the attorney expects to receive any fees or other
compensation for these services, and, if so, the amounts and the identity of
the person who is expected to pay the fees or other compensation. 
(Petitions, ¶¿17(f), is being compensated by another party, i.e., Defendants in
the amount of $35,250.]). 
(6) The terms of any agreement between
the petitioner and the attorney.  (Petitions, Attach. 17a(2)
[Attorney-Client Retainer Agreement].) 
 
The Guardian Ad Litem Petitioner and
Plaintiffs satisfy California Rules of Court, rule 7.952.  The Court presumes
the Guardian will attend the hearing, and Claimants are excused for good cause
given academic timing restrictions and their ages, i.e., eleven (11) years old
(Massieli) and (14) years old (Eliezer). 
The
Petitions need not satisfy California Rules of Court, rule 7.953 as the net
settlement is being delivered to the parent.
            The Petitions need not satisfy California Rules of Court, rule
7.954.  This rule provides the requirements for requesting the withdrawal
of funds already deposited in favor of a minor or person with a disability
pursuant to a prior compromise, which is not the case here.  (See
Petitions generally.) 
            The
Petitions satisfy California Rules of Court, rule 7.955.  This rule
requires that the Court determine whether the attorney’s fees charged of a
minor or a person with a disability are reasonable.  Here, the Petitions
contain a Declaration from Rachel Fishenfeld, Esq.—the attorney who represents Plaintiffs—indicating
that Claimants will be paying 25% of their $5,000 gross settlements—i.e., $1,250—toward
legal services.  (Petitions, Attach. 13(a).)  The Court finds that a
25% recovery for the type of action at bar is reasonable. 
Substantive Requirements: The Court finds that the settlement
is in the best interests of Claimants.  (See Pearson, supra,
202 Cal.App.4th at p. 1338.)  Claimants will each receive a gross
settlement of $3,438.35, to be held by the parent in trust.  The remaining
$85,000 of the Settlement will be distributed to their parents, who are best
positioned to care for their children and can use the remaining proceeds of the
Settlement to further the economic welfare and physical wellbeing of Claimants.
Conclusion: Accordingly, the Petitions for Approval of Compromise are
GRANTED.  
Conclusion 
Petitioner’s Petitions for Approval of
Compromise for Minor on behalf of Claimants are GRANTED because the Petitions
meet all requirements set forth in California Rules of Court rules 7.590 to
7.595 and the Court is satisfied that the Settlement is in the best interests
of Claimants.
