And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by the defendants, Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc., Hilton Franchise Holding LLC, and Hilton Domestic Operating Company, Inc. (collectively referred to as "Hilton"). The defendants argue that the Court has neither general nor specific jurisdiction over them, and therefore the action against them should be dismissed.

The Plaintiff, Damon Scott Stansbury, alleges that the incident occurred on property owned by the Maya Hotel, which is a franchisee of Hilton. The Plaintiff contends that the franchise agreement between Hilton and Maya Hotel provides numerous standards that the franchisee is required to uphold, thus showing that Hilton retains control over the property. The Plaintiff also argues that Hilton has purposely availed themselves of the benefits of this jurisdiction by virtue of their franchise relationships, and that Hilton's acts in the forum state are directly relevant to this lawsuit.

The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's supplemental opposition papers were untimely filed and served, but has read and considered them as a courtesy. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff did not file a motion to seal the redacted portions of the franchise agreement, and that the Court cannot simply review the redacted points and authorities and redacted agreement and rule on the motion.

The Judge grants the motion to quash, but continues the hearing for 90 days to permit the Plaintiff to conduct jurisdictional discovery. The Plaintiff is permitted to conduct jurisdictional discovery only in support of his case against the moving defendants during this time. The parties are ordered to file supplemental opposition and supplemental reply as directed by the Court.
