The court has seen a significant increase in motions to compel further responses and finds that counsel for both parties fail to meet and confer in good faith. The court has ruled on similar issues in other cases and expects counsel to meet and confer with its prior rulings in mind. The court notes that counsel incur attorneys' fees in connection with discovery disputes and finds that they are acting in a way that does not benefit their clients.

The court also notes that the FSC and trial dates are scheduled for July 19 and 22, respectively, and will consider briefly continuing them if the parties are unable to swiftly resolve their discovery dispute.
