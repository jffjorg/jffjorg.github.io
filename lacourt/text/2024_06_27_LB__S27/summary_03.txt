And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Uber's motion to compel arbitration in a case filed by Tracy McCrackin against Uber Technologies, Inc. and William Doe. The case involves allegations of negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, violation of the Bane Act, and violation of the Ralph Act. The dispute centers on whether the arbitration agreement between McCrackin and Uber is enforceable. The Court finds that McCrackin agreed to the 2021 terms of service, which included an arbitration provision, and that the FAA governs the parties' relationship. The Court also finds that the arbitrator must determine arbitrability, and that the risk of inconsistent rulings is not a sufficient reason to deny the motion. The motion is therefore granted, and the action against Uber is stayed pending the outcome of arbitration.
