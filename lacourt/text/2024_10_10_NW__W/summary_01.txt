Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District. The first motion is to compel the plaintiff, Jane Doe, to provide further responses to requests for production of documents, set two. The court grants this motion in part, finding that some of the requests are relevant and not overly broad. The court also finds that some of the requests invade Jane Doe's privacy rights, and therefore, are not granted.

The second motion is to compel Jane Doe to provide further responses to special interrogatories, set two. The court grants this motion in part, finding that some of the interrogatories are relevant and not overly broad. The court also finds that some of the interrogatories invade Jane Doe's privacy rights and the privacy rights of third parties, and therefore, are not granted.

The court notes that the parties have met and conferred before the hearing, and that the motions were filed in good faith. The court also notes that some of the requests for production and special interrogatories are overly broad and invade privacy rights, and therefore, are not granted.
