And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to transfer the case to the proper venue, the Superior Court of California for the County of Imperial. The plaintiff, Dean Gettleson, filed the petition to confirm an arbitration award in Los Angeles County, while the defendant, Mervat Kelada, resides in Imperial County and argues that the claims underlying the petition arose and occurred in Imperial County. The court concludes that the retainer agreement was entered into in Imperial County, and although the plaintiff performed work in Los Angeles County, the agreement was to handle a matter in Imperial County and Kelada was expected to pay Gettleson his fees in Imperial County. The court finds that the proper venue for the action is Imperial County and orders the case to be transferred there.
