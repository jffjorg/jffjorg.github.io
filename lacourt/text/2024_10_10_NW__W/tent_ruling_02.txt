Defendant
County of Los Angeles’ Motion to Deem Facts Admitted from Defendant’s Request
for Admission, Set One to Victoria Lopez de Gamboa and Request for Monetary
Sanctions is GRANTED.  
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant County of Los Angeles moves
the court for an order stating that the truth of all specified matters in the
Requests for Admissions, Set One served on Plaintiffs Julio Gamboa and Victoria
Lopez de Gamboa be deemed admitted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.080, et seq. Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs
and their attorneys of record, Fred Hanassab, Esq. and the Law Offices of Fred
Hanassab in the amount of $1,050.00.  
 
Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).) Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(c)
states, in relevant part: “The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.
 
On June 25, 2024, Defendant County of Los Angeles propounded Requests
for Admissions, Set One on Plaintiffs Victoria Lopez de Gamboa and Julio Gamboa.
(Keller Decl., p. 8:15-18, Exh. 1.) Plaintiffs’ responses to the requests were
originally due on July 25, 2024. (Thomas Decl., p. 8: 19-20.) However, no
response was received. (Keller Decl., p. 8:21.) On August 20, 2024, Plaintiffs’
counsel requested a three-week extension to respond to the discovery (Thomas
Decl. p. 8:20-23, Exh. 2.) The extension was granted. (Keller Decl. p. 8:24-27,
Exh. 3.) To date, Plaintiffs have not responded to said discovery or requested
a further extension. (Keller Decl., p. 9:1-2.) 
 
No opposition has been filed. Based on the foregoing, Defendant County
of Los Angeles’ Motions to Deem Facts Admitted from Defendant’s Request for Admission, Set One to
Julio Gamboa and Victoria Lopez de Gamboa are GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to produce responses, without objection, within 30
days. 
 
Sanctions 
 
Defendant seeks $1,050.00 in attorney fees per motion. If a propounding
party moves for and obtains a court order compelling a response, the court
shall impose monetary sanctions against the party failing to timely respond to
interrogatories and demands for inspection unless that party acted with
substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§
2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
404.) 
 
The court GRANTS the request for attorney fees in the reduced amount of
$900.00, total. No opposition was filed and the court finds only one appearance
was necessary for the motions.
