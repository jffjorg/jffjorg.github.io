This is a tentative ruling by Judge Julio Gamboa regarding a motion by the County of Los Angeles to deem facts admitted and seek monetary sanctions against plaintiffs Julio Gamboa and Victoria Lopez de Gamboa. The motion was granted. The County of Los Angeles propounded Requests for Admissions, Set One on the plaintiffs, but they failed to respond. The court found that the plaintiffs did not serve a proposed response to the requests for admission before the hearing, as required by law. As a result, the court deemed the truth of the specified matters in the requests for admission admitted. The court also awarded the County of Los Angeles $900.00 in attorney fees. The plaintiffs are ordered to produce responses to the requests for admission within 30 days.
