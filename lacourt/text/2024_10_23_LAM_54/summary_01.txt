And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication filed by the defendant, County of Los Angeles. The plaintiff, Alison Oley, alleges that her supervisor, Mario Rangel, sexually harassed her and that the County is liable for his actions. The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the second cause of action, which alleges quid pro quo sexual harassment, finding that there is sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact.

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the fourth and sixth causes of action, which allege violation of the Bane Act and distribution of private sexually explicit materials, respectively. The judge found that the plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to show that these actions were within the scope of Rangel's employment.

The judge's ruling is tentative and is subject to change after the parties have had an opportunity to review and respond to the ruling.
