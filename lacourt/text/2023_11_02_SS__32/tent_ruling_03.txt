TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


November
  2, 2023




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV04147




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to be Relieved as Counsel




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Maria Solares’ Counsel




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiff
Maria Solares’ (Plaintiff) counsel of
record, Jerold “Gene” Sullivan (Counsel), moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff.
Counsel contends relief is necessary because there has been a breakdown in cooperation.
 
 
            No
opposition has been filed for this motion. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
To be granted relief as counsel, counsel must comply with California
Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362. Even where grounds for termination exist,
attorneys seeking to withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in
California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and are subject to
discipline for failure to do so. CRPC 3.700(B) lists various grounds for
mandatory withdrawal. 
 
An attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and
withdraw from a case is not absolute. (See Vann v. Shilleh (1975) 54
Cal.App.3d 192, 197; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.) The
decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the
court's discretion, and it does not abuse that discretion by denying the
application on the ground that the attorney's withdrawal would work injustice
upon a third party. (Hodcarriers, Bldg. and Common Laborers Local Union No.
89 v. Miller (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 391.)
 
The rules have been liberally construed to protect clients. (Vann
v. Shilleh, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d 192.) An attorney, either with client's
consent or court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to client's interests; however, an
attorney “shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken
reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the
client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment
of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable
laws and rules.” (CRPC 3.700(A)(2).) A lawyer violates his or her ethical
mandate by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d
753, 758 759), or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing
the client’s case. (CRPC 3.700(A)(2); Vann v. Shilleh, supra.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Counsel has
filed forms MC-051 and MC-052 and has lodged with the Court a copy of the
proposed order on form MC-053 as required. 
(Cal Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.) 
Counsel states the instant motion is filed for the following reason: “[t]here
has been a significant breakdown in cooperation and in the direction of this
case, rendering it impossible for counsel to continue in representation of
Plaintiff.” (MC-052.) Counsel requests an in camera hearing in the event the
Court asks for more information. This reason appears to implicate Rules of
Professional Conduct 3-700(C)(1)(d), which is a permissive withdrawal. However,
the Court notes that the Final Status Conference is scheduled for November 30,
2023, with a trial date of December 15, 2023. Given the proximity to the trial
date, the Court finds that relieving counsel will likely prejudice Plaintiff’s
rights.
 
            Accordingly,
the Court DENIES the motion to relieve counsel. 
 
Counsel for moving party shall
provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service of such.
