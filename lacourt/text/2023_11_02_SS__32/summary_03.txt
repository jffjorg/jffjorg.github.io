And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maria Solares v. Unknown Defendant, denying the motion of Plaintiff's counsel, Jerold "Gene" Sullivan, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in cooperation between counsel and client, but the court finds that relieving counsel would likely prejudice Plaintiff's rights, given the proximity to the trial date. The court notes that the Final Status Conference is scheduled for November 30, 2023, with a trial date of December 15, 2023. The judge has denied the motion and ordered counsel to provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service.
