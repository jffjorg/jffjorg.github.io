The Court denied the petition due to lack of information on claimant's treatment and injuries, improperly filled-out forms, and apportionment of settlement. The previous petition was denied on September 12, 2023 for failing to attach medical records. In this amended petition, the Petitioner includes a letter from the Department of Health Care Services, but it does not indicate the extent of Claimant's injuries. The Court requires more information on Claimant's treatment and injuries sustained. The Petitioner must correct the forms and provide additional information to support the petition. The Court orders the Petitioner to give notice.
