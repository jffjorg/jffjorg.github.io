And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Plaintiff Susan Fountain's motion to set aside the dismissal of her case against Defendant Brian Hugh Warner and Does 1 to 10. The case was dismissed on February 15, 2023, after Plaintiff's counsel failed to appear at the jury trial. However, Plaintiff's counsel has filed a declaration stating that she did not attend the trial due to a mistake in calendaring the date, caused by her medical condition. The Judge has found that this is an excusable ground for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) and has granted the motion. The case is set for an Order to Show Cause Re Dismissal/Monetary Sanctions re Failure to Serve on January 3, 2024.
