And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff, PR SM Livorno LLC, is seeking to reinstate the case against the defendant, So Yun Song, et al. The case was originally dismissed without prejudice after the plaintiff's counsel mistakenly believed that the stipulated continuance of the trial would be granted. The judge finds that the mandatory relief provision of Code Civ. Proc. ยง473(b) applies, as the dismissal was not due to any of the excluded reasons such as failure to prosecute or serve a complaint. The judge grants the motion, reinstates the case, and sets a case management conference for May 27, 2024.
