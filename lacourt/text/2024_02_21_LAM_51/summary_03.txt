And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The defendant, Danny Joseph Chahayed, argues that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint. The proof of service indicates that Chahayed was served personally by Areg A. Sarkissian on September 8, 2023, but Chahayed contends that this is invalid because Sarkissian was out of the country on the purported service date, the service did not occur at Chahayed's workplace or home address, there was no subsequent mailing of the documents, and there was no declaration of diligence. The judge finds that the proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper, but as the declarations in support indicate, Chahayed was not personally served, his attorney had not consented to accept service on his behalf, and his attorney was out of the country when the purported personal service on him occurred. The judge concludes that Chahayed was not properly served and therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction over him. The motion to quash service of summons is granted.
