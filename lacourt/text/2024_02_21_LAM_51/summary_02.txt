And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the arguments presented by the parties in this case. The defendant has raised the issue of statute of limitations, which the court will consider. The plaintiffs have also raised a will dispute concerning Mr. Harold Budd, but this is not relevant to the current matter. The court will disregard this argument. The defendant does not dispute that Priscilla has standing, but contests the individual standing of Nicholas and Michael. The court notes that the plaintiffs did not address the claim for personal injuries, specifically Priscilla's bedsores. The court will consider these issues further before making a final ruling.
