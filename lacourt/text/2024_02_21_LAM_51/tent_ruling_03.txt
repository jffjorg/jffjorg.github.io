STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On February 2, 2023, Plaintiff Steven Hea Chung
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Danny Joseph Chahayed and
Busy Man LA Ave., LLC (“Defendants.”) The complaint alleged three causes of
action: (1) Contractual Fraud, (2) Breach of Contract – Purchasing Agreement,
and (3) Breach of Contract – Lease Termination Agreement. The complaint alleges
that Plaintiff and Defendant entered a purchase agreement, which was through an
Escrow that indicated the initial deposit was to be $5,000 of the $75,000
selling price. However, Plaintiff alleges that the escrow was intentionally not
closed on time.
 
On March 30, 2023, Defendant Busy Man, LA Ave, LLC, filed an
Answer. 
 
On September 5, 2023, the court GRANTED Defendant Chahayed’s
unopposed Motion to Quash Service of Summons.
 
On September 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed Proof of Personal
Service as to Defendant Chahayed.
 
On September 29, 2023, Defendant Chahayed filed the instant
Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint. Plaintiff’s opposition was
due on or before February 6, 2024. On February 7, 2024, Defendant Chahayed
filed a Notice of Non-Opposition. As of February 15, 2024, Plaintiff has not
filed an opposition. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“A defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of motion for
one or more of the following purposes:  (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).)  “[C]ompliance with the
statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal
jurisdiction. [Citation.]”  (Dill v.
Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.)  “[T]he filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that
the service was proper” but only if it “complies with the statutory
requirements regarding such proofs.”  (Id.
at 1441-1442.)  When a defendant moves to quash service of the summons and
complaint, the plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the
court jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective service.” 
(Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245
Cal.App.2d 866, 868.)  “A court lacks jurisdiction over a party if there
has not been proper service of process.”  (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 801, 808.) 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Defendant Danny Joseph Chahayed moves to quash the service
of summons on the grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over him as he was
not properly served. 
 
Under CCP § 418.10(a)(1), a defendant may move to quash the
service of summons on the grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over him or
her. Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to effect proper service of
process. Under CCP § 415.10, a summons “may be served by personal delivery of a
copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be served. Service of
summons in this manner is deemed complete at the time of such delivery.”
 
Here, the Proof of Service indicates personal service of Defendant
Chahayed via Areg A. Sarkissian on September 8, 2023, at 2:10 p.m. at 6345
Balboa Blvd., #114, Encino, California 91316. Defendant contends this is
invalid for several reasons. First, Plaintiff did not personally serve
Defendant Chahayed and Mr. Sarkissian was out of the country on the purported
service date. Second, the service attempt did not occur at Defendant Chahayed’s
workplace or home address. Third, there was no subsequent mailing of the
documents. Fourth, there was no declaration of diligence. Fifth, there was no
service via first class mail. 
 
“When a
defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of
improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan¿(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.) “The filing of a proof
of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper.
However, the presumption arises only if the proof of service complies with the
applicable statutory requirements.” (Floveyor
Internat., Ltd. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 795.)
“Evidence Code section 647 provides that a registered process server's
declaration of service establishes a presumption that the facts stated in the
declaration are true.” (Rodriguez v. Cho
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742, 750.)
 
Here, the Court
finds that Plaintiff’s proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that
service was proper. However, as Defendant argues, service was not sufficiently
effected. As the declarations in support indicate, Defendant Chahayed was not
personally served, his attorney had not consented to accept service on his
behalf, and his attorney was out of the country when the purported personal
service on him occurred. (Chahayed Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5, 6, 7; Sarkissian Decl. ¶¶ 4,
5, 6, 7, 8; Kilinyan Decl. ¶¶ 4, 5, 6.) Additionally, the Proof of Service does
not comply with the requirements for substituted service under CCP § 415.20. There
is no indication of subsequent mailing and Mr. Sarkissian’s office is hardly
the “place of business, or usual mailing address” for Defendant Chahayed.[1]
Thus,
Defendant Chahayed was not personally served and therefore, the court lacks
jurisdiction over him. 
 
Accordingly,
the court GRANTS Defendant Chahayed’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons. 
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
Motion to Quash Service of Summons
is GRANTED.  
 
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
