And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for summary judgment filed by Tishbi, a cross-defendant, seeking to grant judgment in his favor as to the entire cross-complaint filed by Baek, a cross-complainant. The cross-complaint is based on a mutual non-disclosure agreement (NDA) between Baek and Tishbi, which provides for the payment of accounts payable and initial investment.

The judge finds that there are triable issues of material fact, and therefore, Tishbi is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The judge concludes that Baek's seemingly contradictory discovery and deposition responses did not carry Tishbi's burden of demonstrating the absence of a factual dispute.

The judge also finds that Baek's ownership interest in Curious Apparel is a disputed fact, and therefore, the NDA is not unenforceable as argued by Tishbi. Finally, the judge declines to grant Tishbi's motion for summary judgment and instead denies the motion.
