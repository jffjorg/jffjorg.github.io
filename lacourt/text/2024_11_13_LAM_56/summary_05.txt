And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration of individual PAGA claims and stay non-individual PAGA claims. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the arbitration agreement does not apply to individual PAGA claims and that the non-individual PAGA claim is not arbitrable. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has standing to bring a PAGA action, despite not having an individual PAGA claim. The judge's ruling is based on recent California Supreme Court cases, including Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. and Balderas v. Fresh Start Harvesting, Inc. The judge's ruling is a significant development in the case, as it rejects the defendant's attempt to compel arbitration of individual PAGA claims and allows the plaintiff to pursue a non-individual PAGA claim.
