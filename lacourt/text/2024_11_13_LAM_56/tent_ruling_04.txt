MOVING PARTY: Defendant
DOROTHY J. JEUNG (“Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers.  No opposition has been
filed.  Any opposition was required to
have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)
 
BACKGROUND
              This
action arises from a multi-dwelling fire which allegedly occurred on March 14,
2023.  On February 27, 2024, Plaintiff
filed his Complaint for Personal Injuries.
 
On August 14, 2024 , Defendant filed
the following discovery motions: (1) Motion
for Order Compelling Plaintiff, Mario Guerra to Respond to Demand for Production,
Set No. One (“RFPs Motion”); (2) Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff, Mario Guerra
to Answer Special Interrogatories, Set No. One (“SIs Motion”); and (3) Motion
for Order Compelling Plaintiff, Mario Guerra to Answer Form Interrogatories, Set
No. One (“FIs Motion”) (collectively,
“Discovery Motions”).
 
            No
opposition to the Discovery Motions has been filed.
 
DISCUSSION
A
party to whom interrogatories or demands for production have been propounded
shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory or demand
by providing an answer or a statement of compliance, or by providing an
objection.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.210, 2031.210.)  Responses should be
served within 30 days of service.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, 2031.260.)  A
motion to compel responses may be brought where a responding party fails to
timely respond to written discovery, and the party who failed to serve timely
responses waives any objections.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)¿¿ 
¿ 
Unsuccessfully
making or opposing a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or requests
for production of documents can subject a party to sanctions unless that party
acted with substantial justification¿or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanctions¿unjust.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,¿subd. (c), 2031.300,¿subd. (c).)¿¿¿ 
 
Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a) provides that “[t]he court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.”
 
Here, on
June 3, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One (“RFPs”), Form Interrogatories, Set One (“FIs”) and Special
Interrogatories, Set One (“SIs”). 
(Declarations of Leon A. Victor in support of the RFPs Motion, FIs
Motion and SIs Motion.)  Defendant has
not received responses to the discovery requests as of the date of filing of the
Discovery Motions.  (Id.)
 
Defendant now moves for an order compelling
responses to the discovery requests, without objections. 
Defendant also requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $435 for
each of the Discovery Motions, with Defendant’s
counsel stating that his standard hourly billing rate is $250 per hour, that he
had spent one hour preparing each of the Discovery Motions and anticipates
spending at least half an hour attending the hearing, and that he had incurred $60
filing fee for each of the three motions.  (Id.) 
The Court exercises its discretion and limits sanctions to the amount of
$875 representing one hour spent for each of the three Discovery Motions and a
half hour attending the hearing for all three motions at a rate of $250/per
hour, plus $180 filing fees for the three Discovery Motions, for a total amount
of $1,055. 
 
RULING
Accordingly, the Discovery Motions are GRANTED.  
 
Plaintiff
is ORDERED to serve complete, Code-compliant and verified responses to the SIs,
FIs and RFPs, without objections, and to produce all responsive documents to
the RFPs, within 20 days of this Order.  Plaintiff
is further ORDERED to pay Defendant $1,055 in monetary
sanctions within 20 days of this Order.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 13th day of November 2024
