BACKGROUND
            This is an action for toxic injuries
– personal injury and loss of consortium. 
The operative third amended complaint asserts the following causes of
action: (1) negligence; (2) products liability – failure to warn; (3) products
liability – design defect; (4) fraudulent concealment; (5) breach of implied warranties;
and (6) loss of consortium.
 
On
October 14, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Motion for an Order Admitting Dennis
E. Vega to Appear Pro Hac Vice (the “Motion”), seeking an order
admitting attorney Dennis E. Vega to appear as counsel pro hac vice on
behalf of Defendants in association with their counsel of record, Foley &
Mansfield, PLLP, pursuant to Rule 9.40 of the California Rules of Court. 
The
Court has considered the Motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at least nine
court days prior to the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section
1005, subdivision (b).
 
DISCUSSION
California
Rules of Court (“CRC”) rule 9.40 provides that an attorney in good standing in
another jurisdiction may apply to appear pro hac vice in this State by
way of written application upon due notice to all interested parties, as well as
service on the State Bar in San Francisco with payment of a $50 fee, provided
that the attorney (a) is not a California resident, (b) does not work in
California, and (c) does not perform regular or substantial business,
professional or other activities in California. 
 
An
application for pro hac vice admission must set forth: (1) the applicant
attorney’s residence and office addresses; (2) the courts to which the
applicant attorney has been admitted and dates of admission; (3) a
representation that the attorney applicant is a member in good standing in the
courts of admission and is not currently suspended or disbarred in any court;
(4) the title of each court and action in which the applicant attorney has
appeared pro hac vice in this State in the prior two years; and (5) the
name, address and phone number of the active California State Bar member with
whom the applicant is associated.  (CRC, rule
9.40(d).)
 
The
Court finds that Defendants have satisfied the requirements for allowing
attorney Dennis E. Vega to appear as counsel pro hac vice pursuant to
CRC, rule 9.40.
 
The
Court, therefore, GRANTS the Motion.
 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling.       
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
