Seung Jae Baek’s declaration is difficult to understand and in some places
unintelligible.  Moreover, he does not
clarify that he is apparently also known as “Andrew Baek” and/or “Andrew Bak.”  Nevertheless, giving him the benefit of the
doubt only for the purpose of this Motion, the Court extrapolates from what is
presented to make this ruling.  This will
not be the case at trial.
