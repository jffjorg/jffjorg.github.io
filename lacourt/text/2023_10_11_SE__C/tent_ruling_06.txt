Plaintiff’s Petition to Confirm the
Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff Caliber Construction and Restoration,
Inc. (Plaintiff) moves for an order confirming contractual arbitration
award.  
Background
Plaintiff
filed a Complaint against Defendant Aaron Villalobos (Defendant) for breach of
contract alleging that Defendant failed to pay the balance due on its contract
for improvements to Defendant’s property. The contract included a mechanics
lien on the property.
Legal
Standard
A
petition to confirm an arbitration award must set forth the substance of or
attach the arbitration agreement, include the name of the arbitrator, and
attach a copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrator, if any.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The petition must be served no earlier than 10
days, but no later than 4 years, after service of the award on the petitioner.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) The petition, written notice of the time
and place of the hearing on the petition, and any other papers upon which the
petition is based must be served in the manner provided in the arbitration
agreement for service of such petition and notice. (CCP § 1290.4(a).)  
Discussion

Here, Plaintiff’s Petition meets all the
procedural requirements. Plaintiff attached the contract with the arbitration
agreement, states that Retired Judge Craig S. Kamansky was the arbitrator, and
attached the Arbitration Award and Amended Award. The Petition was served on
September 14, 2023, which is more than 10 days after service of the amended
award on August 30, 2023 and less than 4 years from that date. Additionally,
the Amended Arbitration Award includes the correct date for the interest
calculation. The Award calculated interest from October 23, 2021 to July 6,
2023, however, the correct end date is July 6, 2021. Finally, the mechanics
lien included in the Arbitrator’s Award is approved. Thus, Plaintiff’s Petition
for confirmation of the Amended Arbitration Award filed with this Court on
August 30, 2023 and attached to this Petition is granted, with the above
amendment as to the date for the interest calculation.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Petition to Confirm the Arbitration Award is GRANTED, with the above amendment.
