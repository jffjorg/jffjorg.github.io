And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses to His Requests for Production (set one) in part and denies it in part. The Plaintiff seeks further responses to Requests Nos. 20, 23, 24, and 53-60, while the Defendant argues that some of these requests are overly broad and seeks to limit the scope of the requests. The Court grants the motion in part, ordering the Defendant to provide further responses to Requests Nos. 53 and 54 as to 2021 Honda Civics sold in California. However, the Court denies the motion in part, finding that Requests Nos. 20, 56-60 are moot and that Request No. 55 is overbroad. The Court also denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the Defendant acted with substantial justification.
