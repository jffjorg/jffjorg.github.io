Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further
Responses to His Requests for Production (set one) is GRANTED in part and
DENIED in part. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff moves for an order compelling further
responses to his Requests for Production (set one).
Background
On
November 14, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant American Honda
Motor Co., Inc. (Defendant) for violation of the Song-Beverly Act and fraud.
Legal
Standard
CCP
§ 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion compelling further answers to
document requests if it finds that the response is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive, or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  The motion shall be accompanied with a meet
and confer declaration.  (CCP §
2031.310(b).)  
Discussion

Plaintiff seeks further responses to Requests
Nos. 20, 23, 24, and 53-60.
Requests Nos. 20 and 56-60 are moot because
Defendant served further responses.
Defendant has properly responded to Nos. 23 and
24 because it stated that it conducted a diligent search and no responsive
documents ever existed. Further Defendant asserts that it has withdrawn its
attorney-client privilege objection.
Nos.
53 and 54 seek documents related to similar vehicles and customer complaints.
These requests are overbroad because they seek documents related to vehicles
worldwide. Therefore, these requests will be limited repairs and customer
complaints concerning 2021 Honda Civics sold in California. Defendant is
ordered to provide further responses to Requests Nos. 53 and 54 as to 2021
Honda Civics sold in California. 
No.
55 is overbroad because it seeks all documents produced in a separate case.
Plaintiff argues that the Request is relevant because it may contain customer
complaints of similar defects. However, the request is unduly burdensome
because it is not limited to documents related to complaints similar to
Plaintiff’s. Further, Nos. 53 and 54 cover the same documents. Thus,
Plaintiff’s request for further response to No. 55 is denied.
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction
against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further responses to interrogatories or demand for production of documents
unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
The
Court finds that Defendant acted with substantial justification. Thus,
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to His Requests for Production (set one) is
GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as set forth above. Defendant is ordered to
provide further responses within 30 days of this order. Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions is DENIED.
