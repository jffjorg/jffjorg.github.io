Defendant’s
Motions to Compel are GRANTED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Defendant Interinsurance Exchange of the
Automobile Club (Defendant) moves for an order compelling responses to its
discovery.
Background
Plaintiff
filed a breach of insurance contract and implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing action regarding the theft of Plaintiff’s vehicle.
Legal
Standard
“If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response
…. The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any
objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010)
…. The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories.” (CCP § 2030.290.) 
“If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it …. The party to whom the demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection
to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010) …. The party making
the demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.” (CCP §
2031.300.)
Discussion

Here, Defendant served its Form Interrogatories
(sets one and two), Special Interrogatories (set one), Requests for Admission
(set one), and Requests for Production (set one) (Written Discovery) on
February 16, 2023. Plaintiff’s responses were due on March 21, 2023. As of the
time of this hearing, despite numerous meet and confer efforts, Plaintiff has
not served responses to the Written Discovery. Thus, Plaintiff is ordered to
serve verified responses to the Written Discovery without objections.
Sanctions
Sanctions are mandatory against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to interrogatories unless the one subject to sanctions acted with
substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of
sanctions unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)  Sanctions may be awarded, even though no
opposition is filed pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a).
Defendant seeks $5,430.00 in sanctions for the
five motions against Plaintiff and her counsel of record. However, no
oppositions were filed and Defendant seeks two and a half hours to prepare for
and attend each hearing which the Court finds excessive. Sanctions will be
awarded in the reduced amount of $1,560.00.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
Motions to Compel are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses
to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories (sets one and two), Special Interrogatories (set one), Requests
for Admission (set one), and Requests for Production (set one) without
objections within twenty days of this Order. Defendant’s request for sanctions
is GRANTED and imposed against Plaintiff and her counsel of record, jointly and
severally, in the reduced amount of $1,560.00. This sanction is to be paid
within twenty days of this Order.
