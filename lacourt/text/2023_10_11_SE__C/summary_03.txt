And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Saadia's special motion to strike All-Ways' cross-complaint. The judge finds that Saadia has failed to meet its burden to prove that All-Ways' cross-complaint is based on a protected activity. Specifically, the judge finds that Saadia's claims are not based on a protected act under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 425.16(e). The judge also rejects Saadia's argument that the litigation privilege applies to Saadia's January 12, 2021 email. The judge lifts the discovery stay and orders Saadia to give notice of the court's ruling.
