The judge grants defendant's motions to compel discovery responses, ordering the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the defendant's discovery requests without objections. The judge also awards sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel of record in the amount of $1,560.00 for the plaintiff's failure to comply with the discovery requests.
