Defendant’s Motion to Consolidate is GRANTED.  This Unlawful Detainer action is stayed
pending the outcome of the Quiet Title action. 

Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Edward Santistevan moves for an order
consolidating this Unlawful Detainer action in which he is the Defendant (Case
no. 23NWUD01052) with an Unlimited Civil Quite Title action in which he is the
Plaintiff (Case no. 23NWCV01683).
Background
Plaintiff
Sean De La Rosa, Trustee of the Silva M. De La Rosa Trust filed an unlawful
detainer action against Defendant after Ms. De La Rosa’s passing. Defendant
alleges that he has a community property ownership interest in the property
because he is the surviving registered domestic partner, and the property was
maintained through comingled funds.
Legal
Standard
“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.” (CCP § 1048(a).)
Discussion
The court has the power “to consolidate an
unlawful detainer proceeding with a simultaneously pending action in which
title to the property is in issue,” because a “successful claim of title by the
tenant would defeat the landlord’s right to possession. (Martin Bragg v.
Moore (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 367, 385.) Here, Defendant is claiming title
under Family Code § 297.5(c) as the surviving registered domestic partner.
Thus, the Unlawful Detainer action, case no. 23NWUD01052 is consolidated with
the Unlimited Civil Quite Title action, case no. 23NWCV01683.  The Unlawful Detainer action is stayed
pending the outcome of the Unlimited Civil Quiet Title action. (Asuncion v.
Superior Court of San Diego County (1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 141.
