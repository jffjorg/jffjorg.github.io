And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to consolidate the unlawful detainer action (Case No. 23NWUD01052) with the quiet title action (Case No. 23NWCV01683). The unlawful detainer action, which was filed by the plaintiff, Sean De La Rosa, as the trustee of the Silva M. De La Rosa Trust, is stayed pending the outcome of the quiet title action. The defendant, Edward Santistevan, is claiming title to the property under Family Code § 297.5(c) as the surviving registered domestic partner. The court has the power to consolidate the two actions because a successful claim of title by the tenant would defeat the landlord's right to possession. The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice of the consolidation and stay.
