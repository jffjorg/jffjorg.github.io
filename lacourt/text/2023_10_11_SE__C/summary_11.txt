And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant's counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was based on an alleged irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, but no specific details were provided due to the privileged nature of the communications. The judge is not willing to grant the motion without a more specific factual showing, especially given the age of the case. Defendant's counsel is invited to supplement his declaration at a hearing to be held on October 11, 2023.
