 Case Number:  21NWCV00133    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  C Saadia Square v.
All-Ways PacificCASE NO.:  21NWCV00133HEARING:   10/11/23 @ 10:30 AM#6 Saadia’s Special Motion to Strike the
Complaint is DENIED.  The discovery stay is lifted upon notice of entry of the
court’s ruling.  Moving Party to give NOTICE. Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Saadia Square
(Saadia) moves to specially strike Defendant/Cross-Complaints All-Ways’ First
Amended Cross Complaint (FAXC).BackgroundSaadia
filed a complaint against numerous Square Mile (SM) and Rialto Merrill
Holdings, LLC and All-Ways entities (All-Ways) (collectively Defendants) for:
(1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing;
(3) Intentional Interference; (4) Specific Performance and Injunctive Relief;
and (5) Declaratory Relief. Saadia alleges that Defendants interfered with its
Right of First Offer (ROFO) for a property located in Rialto, California when
the Square Mile Defendants sold the property to All-Ways. All-Ways filed a FAXC
against Saadia for interference with prospective economic and contractual
relations. All-Ways alleges that Saadia, in an email to SM on January 12, 2021,
used its undisclosed ROFO to interfere with All-Ways closing its purchase of
the property. This
Court previously determined on August 2, 2023, that the January 12, 2021 email
was not subject to the litigation privilege.Legal
StandardCCP
§ 425.16 permits the court to strike causes of action arising from an act in
furtherance of the defendant's right of free speech or petition, unless the
plaintiff establishes that there is a probability that the plaintiff will
prevail on the claim.The
defendant bears the initial burden of showing that the plaintiff's claim is
based on an act of defendant in furtherance of his right to free speech and,
thus, falls within the class of suits subject to a motion to strike under CCP §
425.16.¿(Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc. v. Paladino (2001) 89 Cal. App.
4th 294, 304.) Under CCP § 425.16(b)(2), the Court may consider the pleadings
and supporting affidavits in making its determination.¿A defendant meets his
initial burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff’s case
fits one of the categories identified in CCP § 425.16(e).¿(City of Cotati v.
Cashman (2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 78.)¿Subdivision (e) defines the protected
acts as the following:1)
any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive,
or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law;2)
any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under
consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any
other official proceeding authorized by law;3)
any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or
a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest; or4)
any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of
petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public
issue or an issue of public interest.DiscussionSaadia fails to meet its burden to prove the
first prong under CCP § 425.16. Saadia first asserts that the FAXC is based
upon Saadia’s lawsuit and lis pendens. However, the FAXC bases its allegations
on Jack Saadia’s actions during lease negotiations -- including attempts to
derail the sale to All-Ways (FAXC ¶ 9) and the January 12, 2021 email (FAXC ¶
10) – all of which occurred before Saadia filed its lawsuit and recorded a lis
pendens.  The FAXC never mentions
Saadia’s lawsuit or the lis pendens.  Second, Saadia asserts that the January 12,
2021 email was a protected activity. Saadia has failed to show that the January
12, 2021 email is a protected act under CCP § 425.16(e). “Courts ‘look to the
litigation privilege [section 47] as an aid in construing the scope of [section
425.16,] subdivision [(e)(2)] with respect to the first step of the two-step
anti-SLAPP inquiry…’ ” (Neville v. Chudacoff (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1263.) Here, this Court
previously determined that the litigation privilege does not apply to the
January 12, 2021 email because Saadia failed to demonstrate that litigation was
seriously proposed and actually contemplated when the email was sent.  Moreover, Saadia’s contemporaneous emails and
letters disclaimed the possibility or desire for litigation against SM.  “Such an act is protected under the
anti-SLAPP statute only if done when a lawsuit related to that act was
contemplated in good faith and given serious consideration.” (A.F. Brown Electrical
Contractor, Inc. v. Rhino Electric Supply, Inc. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1129.)Third, Saadia contends that Civil Code § 3387 creates
a statutory presumption that disputes over the transfer or realty anticipate
litigation.  Civil Code § 3387 states,“It is to be presumed that the breach of an
agreement to transfer real property cannot be adequately relieved by pecuniary
compensation. In the case of a single-family dwelling which the party seeking
performance intends to occupy, this presumption is conclusive. In all other
cases, this presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of proof.”Nothing in this section, however, speaks to the
possibility of litigation or the litigation privilege.  Rather, Civil Code § 3387 relates to the
adequacy of damages; specifically, whether monetary damages or specific
performance is the appropriate remedy in any given case.  (Real Estate Analytics, LLC v. Vallas
(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 463. 
Even if the presumption operates in the manner suggested by Saadia, the
court would find that the presumption was overcome by Saadia’s contemporaneous
emails and letters.   Accordingly, Saadia’s Special Motion to
Strike the Complaint is DENIED.  The discovery stay is lifted upon notice of
entry of the court’s ruling.
