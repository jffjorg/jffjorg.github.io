Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash the trial subpoena issued by the plaintiff. The subpoena sought financial records from the defendant's expert witness, Dr. Amandeep Bhalla, including tax filings, profit and loss statements, and supporting documents. The judge ruled that the tax returns are privileged and that the plaintiff has not shown that a public policy greater than that of the confidentiality of tax returns is implicated in these circumstances. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to specify the exact matters or things desired to be produced or set forth in full detail the materiality thereof to the issues involved in the case, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1985. Therefore, the judge has quashed the trial subpoena.
