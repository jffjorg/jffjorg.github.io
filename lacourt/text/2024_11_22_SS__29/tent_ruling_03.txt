Motion to Compel Deposition of Defendants’ Employee Henry Cruz
 
Tentative
The motion to compel is granted.
The request for sanctions is granted in part.
Background
On November 8, 2021, Michele Edison
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Burton Plaza Apartments, LLC (“Burton
Plaza”), Statewide Enterprises, Inc. (“Statewide”), Arturo Serna (“Serna”), Serna
Maintenance (“Serna Maintenance”), and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of
action for premises liability and general negligence arising out of an alleged slip
and fall on May 20, 2020.
On December 28, 2021, Burton Plaza and
Statewide filed an answer.  On the same
day, they filed a cross-complaint against Serna and Serna Maintenance. The
cross-complaint was dismissed on April 18, 2022.
On April 6, 2022, Serna and Serna Maintenance
filed an answer to the complaint.
On October 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to
compel the deposition of Defendants’ employee Henry
Cruz.
 
No opposition was filed.
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280,
subd. (a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
Plaintiff
seeks to depose Henry Cruz, a witness and employee of Serna and Serna
Maintenance.
 
On three
separate occasions, Plaintiff has noticed Mr. Cruz’s deposition.  (Ahn Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh. 1.) The most
recent deposition date, set based on the agreement of counsel, was August 8,
2024.  (Id., ¶¶ 4-5 & Exhs. 1-2.)  
 
Defendants
did not object to the deposition notice, and Mr. Cruz did not appear for
deposition.  (See id., ¶ 2.)  Approximately one hour before the deposition
was scheduled to begin, Defendants emailed to state that Mr. Cruz was not available.  (Id., Exh. 2.)  Plaintiff followed up to inquire about the
nonappearance, but no response was received. 
(Id., ¶¶ 2-3 & Exh. 2.)
 
Plaintiff
need not show anything more.  All
substantive and procedural requirements are satisfied.  The motion to compel is granted.
 
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is granted in part. 
Given the straightforward nature of this motion, the Court sets
sanctions in the amount of $2,316.65, calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney
time, multiplied by a reasonable billing rate for work of this nature of $300
per hour, plus a $61.65 filing fee, plus the late cancellation fees for the
reporter and interpreter actually incurred by Plaintiff in the amount of
$1,805.  (See id., ¶¶ 7-9 & Exh. 3.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant Arturo
Serna and Serna Maintenance to produce their employee Henry Cruz for
deposition.
 
The

Maintenance to produce their employee Henry Cruz for deposition on
December __, 2024, at 10:00 am, by video conference.  Plaintiff is ordered to provide the link for

The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in part.
 
The
