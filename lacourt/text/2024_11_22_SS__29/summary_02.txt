Summary:
The tentative ruling grants the motion for summary judgment filed by Jamie D. Hernandez, M.D., and Jamie D. Hernandez, M.D., Inc. The defendants argue that they met the standard of care when treating Decedent Edith Bedigian and that their treatment was not a substantial factor in causing her injuries. The court finds that the defendants' expert witness, Dr. Gregorious, has presented evidence that the defendants complied with their duties under California law and the standard of care for a reasonably careful medical professional under similar circumstances. As a result, the court grants the motion for summary judgment, finding that there is no triable issue of material fact and that the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
