 Case Number:  22STCV16423    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  29 Miranda v. Melkonian
22STCV16423 
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Anthony T. Nehme, Esq.
Tentative
The motion is granted,
subject to the submission of a revised proposed order.
Background
On May 17, 2022, Isla Miranda, Bryan Miranda,
and Erick Ojeda filed a complaint against Vardui Melkonian (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 through10 for motor vehicle negligence arising out of an automobile
accident occurring on December 19, 2019. Plaintiffs filed the First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) on July 17, 2023.
On October 4, 2023, Defendant filed an answer
to the complaint.
In December 2023 and February 2024,
Plaintiffs amended the FAC to name Wanda Ivascyn as Doe 1 and John Ivascyn as
Doe 2. 
On March 22, 2024, Wanda Ivascyn and John
Ivascyn filed an answer and cross-complaint against Defendant. The
cross-complaint was dismissed on May 1, 2024.
On September 24, 2024, Anthony T. Nehme, Esq.
(“Counsel”) moved to be relieved as attorney of record for all three
plaintiffs.
As set forth in the Minute Order dated
October 22, 2024, the Court granted the motion as to Plaintiffs Plaintiffs Isla
Miranda and Erick Ojeda and denied the motion, without prejudice, as to
Plaintiff Bryan Miranda.
On October 23, 2024, Counsel filed this
motion to be relieved as attorney of record for Plaintiff Bryan Miranda.  No opposition has been filed.
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved on Plaintiff and
Defendants in this matter. Counsel contends he can no longer ethically
represent Plaintiff after reviewing written discovery.  
The Court finds
Counsel has established good cause to be relieved as attorney of record for
Plaintiff due to the breakdown to the attorney-client relationship. 
All substantive
and procedural requirements are satisfied.
Following the
filing of this motion, however, Defendant filed 12 discovery motions.  As a result, the proposed Order, which (in
paragraphs 7 and 8) must identify all future hearings, is now longer complete and
accurate.
Accordingly, the
motion to be relieved as counsel is granted, subject to the submission of a
revised proposed Order that identifies all future hearings.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Bryan Miranda, subject
to the conditions set forth in this ruling.
 
Counsel is
ordered to submit a revised proposed Order that lists all future hearings,
including, but not limited to, the hearings on the 12 discovery motions filed
by Defendant.
 
The order granting
the motion to be relieved is not effective until (1) Counsel submits the revised
proposed Order; (2) the Court signs it; (3) the signed order is served on
Plaintiff Bryan Miranda; and (4) a proof of service showing service of the
signed order on Plaintiff Bryan Miranda is filed with the Court.
 
Moving Counsel
to give notice.
