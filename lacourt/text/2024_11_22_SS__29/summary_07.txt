And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, City of Los Angeles, has requested a trial continuance to allow its motion for summary judgment to be heard before trial. The plaintiff, Gregory Blaine Heffron, has not opposed this motion. The court has considered the factors listed in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d), including the proximity of the trial date, the availability of alternative means to address the problem, and the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance. After weighing these factors, the court grants the defendant's motion to continue trial and continues the trial to a date on or after July 15, 2025.
