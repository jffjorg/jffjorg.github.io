 Case Number:  22STCV30142    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  29 Sanchez v. US VI Downey, LLC
22STCV30142 
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Lance C. Behringer
Tentative
The Court will
call this matter.
Among other
issues, the Court will discuss whether, if the Court grants the motion, the
Court should also continue the trial date for approximately 90 days to give
Plaintiff additional time to retain new counsel.
Background
On September 15, 2022, Elizabeth Sanchez (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against US VI Downey LLC (“Defendant”), City of Downey, and
Does 1 through 25 for negligence and dangerous condition of public property
arising out of an alleged fall on November 21, 2021. 
 
Defendant filed an answer on October 28, 2022.
 
On September 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a substitution of
counsel, replacing her former attorney with Lance C. Behringer (“Counsel”).
 
Less than two months later, on October 28,
2024, Counsel filed this motion to be relieved as attorney of record for
Plaintiff. An Amended Declaration and proof of electronic service was filed on
November 1, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed an untimely opposition on
November 20, 2024.
Legal Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be Relieved as Counsel.  The substantive and procedural requirements
for the motion have been satisfied. 
According to counsel, the client insists upon asserting an unwarranted
claim or defense; Counsel reasonably anticipates that continued representation could
lead to a violation of the rules of professional conduct; and the client has made
the continued representation unreasonably difficult.
In her late filed
opposition, Plaintiff denies Counsel’s representations.
The Court will
call this matter.
Conclusion
The Court will
call this matter.
