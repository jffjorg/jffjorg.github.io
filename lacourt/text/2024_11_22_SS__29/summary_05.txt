And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Lance C. Behringer, who is representing Elizabeth Sanchez in a case against US VI Downey LLC. The judge will discuss whether to grant the motion and, if so, whether to continue the trial date for approximately 90 days to give Plaintiff additional time to retain new counsel. The motion was filed after less than two months of representation, and Plaintiff has filed an untimely opposition. The judge will consider the legal standards for granting a motion to withdraw as counsel, including whether the client is insisting on an unwarranted claim or defense, whether the attorney reasonably anticipates a violation of the rules of professional conduct, and whether the client has made the continued representation unreasonably difficult.
