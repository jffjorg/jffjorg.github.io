And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion for leave to conduct a second physical examination of the plaintiff. The examination will be performed by Dr. Edwin C. Amos, a neurologist, on December 10, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. at 2021 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 525E, Santa Monica, California 90404. The examination will assess the existence, nature, and causation of the damages claimed by the plaintiff, who has experienced complex neurological injuries. The judge finds that the examination is not duplicative of the previous examination conducted by Dr. Luke Macyszyn and that good cause has been shown to justify the second examination.
