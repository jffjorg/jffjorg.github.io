And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the defendants' motion to seal certain documents containing confidential and commercially sensitive business information. The Judge found that the defendants did not provide sufficient justification to seal the entire documents, and instead suggested that the defendants redact the specific portions that contain sensitive material and include the remaining portions in the public file. The Judge also noted that the defendants' motion to seal was not properly supported by a prior court order, and that a motion to seal must be accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing. The Judge has given the defendants the opportunity to revise their motion and has ordered them to give notice of the tentative ruling.
