  Case Number:  19STCV38785    Hearing Date:   February 21, 2024    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  STEPHANIE DE LA ROSA, Plaintiff(s),  vs.  HAMZA KROFESS, ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 19STCV38785  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE (1) GRANTING MOTION TO COMPEL, (2) DENYING MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  February 21, 2024  I.  Motion to Compel Defendant Rasier, LLC (“Rasier”) propounded requests for production of documents (RPDs), set two, on Plaintiff Stephanie De La Rosa (“Plaintiff”) on March 7, 2023. Additionally, Rasier propounded supplemental interrogatories and supplemental RPDs on Plaintiff on May 31, 2023. After receiving no responses, Defendant requested responses by July 31, 2023. To date, Plaintiff has not served responses. Rasier therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery, and to pay sanctions.  Any opposition was due on or before February 7, 2024; none was filed.  A party may propound a supplemental interrogatory or supplemental demand for production of documents to elicit any later acquired information bearing on all answers previously made by any party.  (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.070, subd. (a), 2031.050, subd. (a).) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §2030.290, §2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); §2031.300, subd. (a).)    Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff was properly served with discovery and failed to respond, Rasier’s motions are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to Rasier’s (1) RPDs, set two, (2) supplemental interrogatories, and (3) supplemental RPDs, without objections, within twenty (20) days. (CCP § 2030.290 (a),(b); §2031.300 (a), (b).)  II. Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted Under Code of Civil Procedure 2033.280(b), failure to respond to requests for admission in a timely manner allows the requesting party to “move for an order that…the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted” by the party that failed to respond.  The requesting party’s motion must be granted by the court, “unless [the court] finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)    Rasier contends it propounded requests for admissions (“RFAs”), set two, on Plaintiff on February 28, 2023. (Lee Decl. ¶ 2.) The Court notes that the proof of service demonstrates service on March 7, 2023. (Lee Decl.; Exh. 10.) Additionally, the Notice of Rasier’s improper omnibus motion provides that Rasier is seeking an order to compel Plaintiff “to respond to Defendant’s Request for Admissions, Set Two.” There is no language in the Notice indicating that Rasier is in fact seeking to deem the RFAs, set two, admitted against Plaintiff.  Therefore, due to the procedural deficiencies, the motion is denied without prejudice.     III. Sanctions Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c); §2031.300(c).)¿ Plaintiff did not file any oppositions. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition is filed pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Rasier requests $1,320 for the motion.   Rasier is awarded 1 hour to prepare the motion and one hour to appear at the hearing at the requested rate of $210 per hour, for a total of $420 in attorney fees. Further, Rasier is awarded one motion filing fee of $60, as costs.  Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney of record, jointly and severally.  Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Defendant, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $480, within fifteen (15) days.  IV.  Additional Filing Fees The Court notes that Rasier filed a single motion for what should have been four separate motions as to the motions to compel RPDs, supplemental interrogatories, supplemental RPDs, and motion to deem RFAs admitted. Combining discovery motions allows the moving party to avoid paying the requisite filing fees. Filing fees are jurisdictional and it is mandatory for court clerks to demand and receive them. (See Duran v. St. Luke’s Hospital (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 457, 460.) Rasier is therefore ordered to pay three additional filing fees. This ruling will be final only upon proof of payment of the filing fee.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 20th day of February 2024      Hon. Michelle C. Kim Judge of the Superior Court
