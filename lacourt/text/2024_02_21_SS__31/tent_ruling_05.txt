 Case Number:  22STCV07324    Hearing Date:   February 21, 2024    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  MELISSA JIMENEZ, Plaintiff(s), vs.  ZIGGY CAPAPAS FORTICH, ET AL., Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) Case No.: 22STCV07324  [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL   Dept. 31 1:30 p.m. February 21, 2024   Plaintiff Melissa Jimenez’s (“Plaintiff”) attorney of record, Arman Saakyan of Arman Sahakyan & Associates (“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. Counsel contends there has been an irreconcilable breakdown of the attorney-relationship, and Counsel is unable to represent Plaintiff in the manner Plaintiff wishes. Counsel avers Plaintiff is uncooperative and unresponsive to Counsel’s request to seek a substitution of attorney.  Counsel declares the moving papers were served at Plaintiff’s last known address, which was confirmed within the past 30 days as current by conversation. Counsel provides proof of service of only the motion and declaration on Plaintiff and Defendant. There is no proof of service for the proposed order. Pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d), the proposed order must also be served on Plaintiff and Defendant.   Lastly, the Court notes that Trial is currently set for March 22, 2024, which is one month after the instant hearing. Unlike their clients, attorneys do not have an absolute right to withdraw from representation at any time with or without cause. Even where grounds for termination exist, attorneys seeking to withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and are subject to discipline for failure to do so. CRPC 3.700(B) lists various grounds for mandatory withdrawal, none of which are asserted here. An attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and withdraw from a case is not absolute. (See Vann v. Shilleh (1975) 54 Cal.App.3d 192, 197; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.) The decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the court's discretion, and it does not abuse that discretion by denying the application on the ground that the attorney's withdrawal would work injustice upon a third party. (Hodcarriers, Bldg. and Common Laborers Local Union No. 89 v. Miller (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 391; Heple v. Kluge (1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461.)   The rules have been liberally construed to protect clients. (Vann v. Shilleh, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d 192; Chaleff v. Superior Court (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 721; Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) An attorney, either with client's consent or court's approval, may withdraw from case when withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to client's interests; however, an attorney “shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable laws and rules.” (CRPC 3.700(A)(2).) A lawyer violates his or her ethical mandate by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d 753, 758 759), or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing the client’s case. (CRPC 3.700(A)(2); Vann v. Shilleh, supra.) Given that trial is set for one month after the hearing on this matter, Plaintiff will be prejudiced if Counsel is permitted to withdraw. Absent a mandatory ground for relief, the motion will be denied without prejudice as to Counsel’s ability to re-file the motion if and when there is a trial continuance.  Moving Counsel is ordered to give notice.  PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 20th day of February 2024      Hon. Michelle C. Kim Judge of the Superior Court
