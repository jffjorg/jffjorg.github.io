And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) filed by Reginald Dyer (RDG) is overruled in its entirety. The FACC was filed by Apex Mechanical Services, Inc. (Apex) against RDG, alleging that RDG failed to perform its duties as the structural engineer and breached its duty to ensure the property's roof could handle the weight load of the air handling units. The judge found that Apex's FACC is not barred by the doctrine of laches and that Apex has met its obligation by filing its initial cross-complaint against RDG on October 25, 2021. The judge also noted that RDG's argument that Apex had notice of the Dunn Action by way of the filing of the complaint, yet Plaintiff Dunn did not serve Apex with the complaint until March 2, 2022, is deficient.
