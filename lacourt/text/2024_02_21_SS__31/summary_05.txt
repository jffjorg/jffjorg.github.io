And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel due to an irreconcilable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Counsel contends that the relationship has broken down and that they are unable to represent Plaintiff in the manner Plaintiff wishes. However, the judge finds that Counsel has not complied with the procedures set forth in California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and has not served the proposed order on Plaintiff and Defendant. The judge notes that trial is set for one month after the hearing and that Plaintiff may be prejudiced if Counsel withdraws. The judge also cites various legal precedents, including Vann v. Shilleh and People v. Prince, in support of their decision. The judge orders Counsel to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If the parties do not submit or appear at the hearing, the judge may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
