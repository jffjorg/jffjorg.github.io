And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses two motions: one to compel Plaintiff Stephanie De La Rosa to respond to discovery requests and another to deem requests for admission admitted. The discovery requests were propounded by Defendant Rasier, LLC, and the Plaintiff failed to respond. The Court grants the motion to compel, ordering the Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days. The Court denies the motion to deem requests for admission admitted due to procedural deficiencies. The Court also awards sanctions to Defendant Rasier, LLC, in the amount of $480, for the Plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests. Additionally, the Court orders Defendant Rasier, LLC to pay three additional filing fees and to pay attorney fees in the amount of $420. The Court notes that the Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel are jointly and severally liable for the sanctions and that the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court if the parties neither submit nor appear at the hearing.
