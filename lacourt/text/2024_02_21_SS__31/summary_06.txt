Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion to continue the trial date from July 11, 2024 to a new date, likely January 2025, to allow the defendant Hollywood Chamber of Commerce (HCC) to hear its motion for summary adjudication (MSA) prior to trial. The MSA was filed on November 21, 2023, and the trial continuance is granted due to good cause, as the HCC filed the motion seven months before the current trial date and there are no alternative means to address the issues. The ruling also continues the final status conference and all discovery and expert cutoff dates to reflect the new trial date.
