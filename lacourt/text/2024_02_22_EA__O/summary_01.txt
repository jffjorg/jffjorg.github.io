And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Counsel Eugene S. Alkana's motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Jing Li. The motion is granted due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and an inability to communicate with the client. The court notes that there are no pending motions on calendar, and the next court appearance is for an MSC on April 18, 2024, allowing about two months to retain new counsel. The court also finds that Counsel has filed all mandatory filings, provided notice to all parties, and has not received an opposition from Plaintiff to indicate any prejudice with granting the motion.
