```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for leave to conduct psychological evaluations in part, but denied it in part. The judge has ordered the defendants to release raw data and testing materials to the plaintiffs' attorney, subject to a protective order. The judge has also ordered the defendants to provide an entire audio recording of the examination, but has not modified the scope of questioning. The judge has ruled that the defendants' concerns about test security and integrity are not sufficient to prevent the release of the raw data and testing materials. The judge has also ruled that the plaintiffs have demonstrated a need for the materials and that a protective order would address the defendants' concerns. The judge's ruling is based on the applicable law and the facts of the case, and is intended to ensure that the plaintiffs have a fair opportunity to present their case.
