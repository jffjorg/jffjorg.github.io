Discussion
 
Counsel EUGENE
S. ALKANA seeks to be relieved as counsel for JING LI because there has been a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and an inability to communicate
with the client. According to Counsel, Plaintiff has ample time to obtain
replacement counsel. 
 
Here, considering that (1) there are no pending motions on
calendar and the next court appearance is for an MSC on 4/18/2024, allowing
about two months to retain new counsel, (2) Counsel has filed all the mandatory
filings (MC-051, 052, and 053 forms), (3) Counsel has provided all parties
with notice of the motion, and (4) Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to
indicate any prejudice with granting the motion, the court finds good cause to
grant the motion. 
 
Therefore, the motion is granted. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted, effective
upon serving this court’s order
relieving Counsel sent to Plaintiff, Defendants, and all other parties who have
appeared in the case.
