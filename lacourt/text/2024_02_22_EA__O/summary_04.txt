And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues related to the scope of examination and audio recording in a case involving alleged psychological harm. The judge notes that while the defendants cite to Carlton v. Quint (2000) for the proposition that the plaintiff's filing of an opposition serves as a waiver of inadequate notice, the court finds that this is premature as the non-moving party's appearance is uncertain. The judge also finds that the defendants' failure to provide a list of proposed tests and examination parameters is not prejudicial, as the information is provided in the notices of examination.

The judge notes that the issue of audio recording is moot as the defendants concede that the entire examination will be produced. However, the judge finds that the scope of examination is unclear and that the plaintiffs have placed their mental condition in controversy. The judge also finds that the defendants' reliance on Roe v. Superior Court (2015) is misplaced, as Randy's Trucking (2020) established that a trial court has discretion to order the production of testing material.

The judge concludes that there is no statutory authority precluding a trial court from ordering the disclosure of written test questions and answers, and that the testing material has not been largely disseminated and otherwise comprised.
