The court finds that Quinn failed to allege facts establishing that Siwell is not one of the institutions excluded from the provisions in Civil Code sections 2924.18, subd. (b) and 2923.7, subd. (g)(1). As a result, Quinn cannot establish that these code provisions are applicable to Siwell. The court has given Quinn 10 days to amend the SAC to address these issues.

## English Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding Siwell Inc.'s demurrer to Plaintiff Briana Quinn's Second Amended Complaint. The demurrer challenges Quinn's claims of wrongful foreclosure based on alleged violations of several Civil Code sections. The Judge agrees with Siwell that Quinn's complaint fails to establish that Siwell falls outside the exemptions provided in these sections. 

Therefore, the Judge sustains Siwell's demurrer with leave to amend, allowing Quinn ten days to revise her complaint and address the identified deficiencies.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed Siwell's demurrer to Quinn's Second Amended Complaint and has made a tentative ruling. The demurrer was filed by Siwell, who argues that Quinn's causes of action are not applicable to it because it is a depository institution that foreclosed on 175 or fewer residential real properties in the immediately preceding annual reporting period. The court agrees with Siwell's argument and sustains the demurrer in its entirety with leave to amend. Quinn's causes of action allege that Siwell failed to comply with certain California Civil Code sections, but the court finds that these sections do not apply to Siwell as a depository institution. The court gives Quinn ten (10) days leave to amend its complaint.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to sustain the defendant Siwell Inc.'s demurrer to the plaintiff Briana Quinn's Second Amended Complaint, with leave to amend. The court found that Quinn's causes of action for violation of Civil Code sections 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924.9, and 2924.10 fail because they are not applicable to Siwell, as Siwell is a depository institution chartered under state or federal law that is exempt from these provisions. The court also found that Quinn failed to allege facts establishing that Siwell is not one of the institutions excluded from these provisions. The judge has given Quinn 10 days to amend the complaint. The hearing on the demurrer and a case management conference are set for September 20, 2023.

English summary:
The tentative ruling states that Defendant Siwell Inc.’s demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Briana Quinn is sustained with ten (10) days leave to amend. This is a wrongful foreclosure action regarding real property in Covina obtained by Quinn through a mortgage from AHL Funding. An assignment of deed of trust was recorded on April 29, 2022, and the Covina Property was sold on December 22. Quinn filed a complaint against Siwell and Does 1-10 on December 20, 2022, alleging several causes of action related to violations of Civil Code sections. Siwell demurred to Quinn’s third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action, arguing they are not applicable. The court agrees with Siwell, as Quinn failed to allege facts establishing Siwell is not one of the institutions excluded from these provisions. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained, and Quinn has ten days to amend.
