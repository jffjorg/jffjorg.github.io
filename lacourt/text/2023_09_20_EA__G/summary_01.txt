And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by Siwell Inc. to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by Briana Quinn. The demurrer challenges the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action in the SAC. The court has sustained Siwell's demurrer in its entirety with leave to amend. The court finds that Quinn failed to allege facts establishing that Siwell is not one of the institutions excluded from the provisions in Civil Code sections 2924.18, subd. (b) and 2923.7, subd. (g)(1). As a result, Quinn cannot establish that these code provisions are applicable to Siwell. The court has given Quinn 10 days to amend the SAC to address these issues.
