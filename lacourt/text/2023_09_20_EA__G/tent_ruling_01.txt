  Case Number:  22PSCV03009    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  G Defendant Siwell Inc.’s Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint   Respondent: Plaintiff Briana Quinn   TENTATIVE  RULING  Defendant Siwell Inc.’s Demurrer to Second Amended Complaint is  SUSTAINED with ten (10) days leave to amend.   BACKGROUND   This is a wrongful foreclosure action. On July 23, 2020,  Plaintiff Briana Quinn obtained a mortgage from AHL Funding on real property in  Covina (Covina Property) in the amount of $414,631. On April 29, 2022, an  assignment of deed of trust was recorded that allegedly assigned the deed of  trust from AHL Funding to Defendant Siwell Inc. On the same day, a notice of default and election to  sell under deed of trust was recorded. On July 29, a notice of trustee’s sale  was recorded. The Covina Property was subsequently sold on December 22.   On December 20, 2022, Quinn filed a complaint against Siwell  and Does 1-10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) violation of Civil  Code section 2923.5; (2) violation of Civil Code section 2924, subdivision  (a)(1); (3) violation of Civil Code section 2923.6, subdivision (c); (4)  violation of Civil Code section 2923.7; (5) violation of Civil Code section  2924.9; (6) violation of Civil Code section 2924.10; (7) unfair business  practices; and (8) cancellation of written instruments.   On February 21, 2023, Quinn filed a First Amended Complaint  (FAC) against the same defendants alleging the same causes of action in  addition to a ninth cause of action for wrongful foreclosure. On June 16, the  court sustained Siwell’s demurrer with leave to amend as to Quinn’s first,  third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action and  without leave to amend as to Quinn’s second cause of action.   On July 7, 2023, Quinn filed a Second Amended Complaint  (SAC) against the same defendants alleging the same causes of action minus the  second one.   On August 4, 2023, Siwell filed the present  demurrer. Prior to filing on August 2, Siwell’s counsel met and conferred  telephonically with Quinn’s counsel and was unable to reach a resolution. (Vermillion  Decl., ¶ 2.)   A hearing on the demurrer and a case  management conference are set for September 20, 2023. A motion to be relieved  as counsel is also set for October 5.   ANALYSIS  Siwell demurs to Quinn’s third cause of  action (­violation of Civil Code section 2923.6, subdivision (c)), fourth cause  of action (­violation of Civil Code section 2923.7), fifth cause of action (­violation  of Civil Code section 2924.9), and sixth cause of action (­violation of Civil  Code section 2924.10). For the following reasons, the court SUSTAINS Siwell’s demurrer in its entirety with leave amend.   Legal Standard  A party may demur to a complaint on the  grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of  action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the  complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147  Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering demurrers, courts accept  all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185  Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent  on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.  Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the  pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it  lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are  judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d  902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the  complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of  action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)   Discussion  Siwell argues Quinn’s causes of action fail  because they are not applicable to Siwell. The court agrees.   The requirements of the Civil Code sections  in Quinn’s third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action do not apply “to a  depository institution chartered under state or federal law, a person licensed  pursuant to Division 9 (commencing with Section 22000) or Division 20  (commencing with Section 50000) of the Financial Code, or a person licensed  pursuant to Part 1 (commencing with Section 10000) of Division 4 of the  Business and Professions Code, that, during its immediately preceding annual  reporting period, as established with its primary regulator, foreclosed on 175  or fewer residential real properties, containing no more than four dwelling  units, that are located in California. (Civ. Code, § 2923.6, subd. (i), citing Civ.  Code, § 2924.18, subd. (b); Civ. Code, § 2923.7, subd. (g)(1); Civ. Code, §  2924.9, subd. (b), citing Civ. Code, § 2924.18, subd. (b); Civ. Code, §  2924.10, subd. (c), citing Civ. Code, § 2924.18, subd, (b).)   In this case, Quinn fails to allege facts  establishing Siwell is not one of the institutions excluded from these  provisions in Civil Code sections 2924.18, subd. (b) and 2923.7, subd. (g)(1).  Because Quinn fails to do so, Quinn cannot establish any of these code  provisions are applicable to Siwell.   Accordingly, Siwell’s demurrer to Quinn’s SAC  is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.   CONCLUSION Based on the  foregoing, Siwell’s demurrer to Quinn’s SAC is SUSTAINED in its entirety  with ten (10) days leave to amend.
