And here is a brief summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a product liability action filed by Carlos Aguilar against P.F. Chang's III, LLC. Aguilar alleges that he bit into a metal object while consuming fried rice from a P.F. Chang's restaurant in Sherman Oaks, California, and seeks damages from the defendant. P.F. Chang's has demurred to the amended complaint, arguing that Aguilar's allegations are insufficient to support a claim for negligent misrepresentation. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, giving Aguilar one more chance to allege the required elements of a negligent misrepresentation claim. The court has also granted P.F. Chang's motion to strike Aguilar's claims for attorney fees and allegations against Christine Doe, a supervisor or manager at the restaurant at the time of the incident.
