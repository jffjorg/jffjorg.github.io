And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in plain English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion filed by the defendant's counsel, William R. Bailey, to be relieved as counsel for Prestige Media Group, Inc. The court has granted the motion, allowing Counsel to withdraw as attorney of record.

The court's decision is based on the fact that Counsel has complied with all procedural requirements and has provided a valid reason for withdrawal, namely a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The court has also determined that Counsel's withdrawal will not prejudice the defendant and will not disrupt the orderly process of justice.

As a result of the court's decision, Prestige Media Group, Inc. will be required to appear in court on a specified date and show cause why its operative answer to the complaint should not be stricken due to its status as an unrepresented entity.
