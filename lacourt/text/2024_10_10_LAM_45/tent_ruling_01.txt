Background
            William
R. Bailey and Bailey Law Corporation (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as
counsel of record for defendant Prestige Media Group, Inc. (“Defendant”). 
On January 2,
2024, Plaintiff Viktor Vilotijevic (“Plaintiff”) filed their complaint against
Defendant asserting the following causes of action: 1) Retaliation under Labor
Code section 1102.5; 2) Retaliation under Labor Code section 98.6; 3)
Retaliation (FEHA); 4) Wrongful Termination; 5) Harassment (FEHA); 6)
Defamation (Slander per se); 7) Failure to Produce Employment Records; 8)
Failure to Produce Wage Statements; and 9) Negligence. On May 2, 2024,
Defendant filed their answer. 
 
Legal
Standard
            The
court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should
be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398.) 
CRC, Rule 3.1362
(Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to
be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general
terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship why a motion under CCP § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a
consent under CCP § 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the
notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who have
appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on
the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-053)). 
 
Discussion
Counsel complied
with CRC, Rule 3.1362 for its motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant.
Counsel properly served Defendant by mail at their last known address,
confirmed current by conversation, and on Plaintiff by electronic service. (Counsel
Decl., ¶ 3(a)(2).) Defendant and Plaintiff were served with copies of the
motion papers, including Notice of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
(Civil form MC-051), declaration in support of the motion (Form MC-052), and
the proposed order. (Counsel Decl., ¶ 3(a)(2).)
Prof. Conduct,
Rule 1.16(b)(10) provides that a permissive request for withdrawal may be
properly granted where an attorney believes that the tribunal will find good
cause for withdrawal. In the attorney declaration (Form MC-052), Counsel
indicates that there has been a complete breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship but the facts giving rise to this motion are confidential under
Business and Professions Code §6068(e), rule 3-100(A), California Rules of
Professional Conduct, and by the attorney-client privilege (Evid. C., §§950 et
seq.). (Counsel Decl., ¶ 2.) This is a proper basis for
withdrawal. Further, trial has not yet been set. There is no reason to
believe that Counsel’s withdrawal will prejudice Defendant. No opposition has
been filed by Defendant to the contrary. 
The Court finds
that Counsel has complied with all procedural requirements set out in Cal.
Rules of Court 3.1362.  No opposition has been filed to show that
withdrawal would cause an injustice or undue delay in the proceedings. 
The Court finds that withdrawal of Counsel as attorney of record for Defendant
can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the Defendant’s interests. 
The court
therefore GRANTS Counsel’s motions to be relieved as counsel. Counsel shall be
relieved as counsel of record effective upon the filing of the proof of service
of the signed order on Defendant.
 
The court orders
Defendant Prestige Media Group, Inc. to appear on _________________, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.,
in Department 45, and show cause as to why its operative Answer to the
Complaint should not be stricken on account of its status as an unrepresented
entity. 
 
            It
is so ordered.
