On November
3, 2020, plaintiff Dale Lue (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants
Hong Zhu (“Zhu”) and Global Freight Services, Inc. (“GFS”) to recover past due
rent for the business premises located at 9035 Telstar Avenue, El Monte, CA
91731, and for monetary damages incurred to repair the property. The Complaint
prays for past due rent in the amount of $22,678 and damages in the amount of
$16,800, in addition to prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney’s fees. 
The requests for court judgment against
each defendant demand $34,978 in damages, which is the amount demanded in the
complaint ($39,478) less the security deposit of $4,500, along with $13,991.20
in prejudgment interest, for a total of $48,969.20. 
Plaintiff’s application for default
judgment is deficient in several ways. First, Plaintiff declares that he
incurred damages to the rental property in the amount of $16,800, but the
evidence attached does not support this claim. Specifically, the receipt for
“All Haul Tires” does not list a charge of $2,500. 
Also, Plaintiff’s calculation of
prejudgment interest is incomplete because Plaintiff does not state the
principal amount used to calculate interest or explain why the interest rate is
10% for the entire amount when some of Plaintiff’s damages arise not from
contract, but from tort. Interest rates for tort damages are limited to 7
percent per annum. Last, Plaintiff should have submitted only one proposed
judgment indicating that Zhu and GFS are jointly and severally liable.
Accordingly, the hearing is continued to _______ at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3
of the Alhambra Courthouse so that Plaintiff provide a revised calculation of
damages and prejudgment interest, as well as a revised proposed judgment.
