And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the Plaintiff's application for default judgment against the Defendants, Hong Zhu and Global Freight Services, Inc. The Plaintiff seeks damages of $22,678 for past due rent and $16,800 for damages to the rental property, as well as prejudgment interest and costs. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff's application is deficient in several ways. Specifically, the Plaintiff's evidence does not support its claim of damages, the calculation of prejudgment interest is incomplete, and the Plaintiff failed to submit a single proposed judgment indicating that the Defendants are jointly and severally liable. As a result, the Judge is continuing the hearing to allow the Plaintiff to revise its proposal and provide a revised calculation of damages and prejudgment interest.
