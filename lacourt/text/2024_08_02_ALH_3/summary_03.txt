And here is the English-text summary:

This is the Judge's tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration in a case involving the estate of Marilyn J. Mulkey, who was admitted to Santa Anita Convalescent Hospital and stayed from October 4, 2022, to May 25, 2023, when she died. The hospital filed a petition to compel arbitration, arguing that Mulkey signed an arbitration agreement prior to her admission. The court found that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and that certain claims are subject to arbitration, including Mulkey's first and second causes of action for elder abuse and negligence, and the heirs' wrongful death claim. The court ordered these claims to arbitration and stayed the third cause of action for violation of Health & Safety Code section 1430 pending the completion of arbitration.
