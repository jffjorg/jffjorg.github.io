Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered Defendant 1661, Inc. dba GOAT's unopposed motion to continue trial and all related dates. The Court finds good cause to continue trial due to the upcoming summary judgment motion, expert deadlines, and the lack of opposition. However, the Court does not find good cause to continue fact discovery deadlines. The Court grants in part the motion to continue trial and all related dates, continuing the Final Status Conference to January 14, 2025, and trial to January 28, 2025. The Court also orders that only expert discovery cut-off dates shall be in accordance with the new trial date.
