[1] In
ruling on Cartage’s motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, the Court
considered the standard regarding the filing of cross-complaints, not the
standard regarding motions for judgment on the pleadings. Indeed, Cartage
itself expressly argued that the Court need not determine at that stage whether
the cross-complaint lacked merit and that Cartage “should be afforded the
opportunity to distinguish the Difko case from this case in response to
any opposition from the anticipated cross-complaint,” (Reply at p. 5.) and that
the “sufficiency of the cross-complaint is not a factor to be considered in
granting leave to file a permissive cross-complaint.” (Motion for Leave to File
Cross-Complaint at p. 4.)
