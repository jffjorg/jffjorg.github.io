Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to the demand for production of documents and form interrogatories. The defendant had served these discovery requests on the plaintiff on June 13, 2024, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The defendant emailed the plaintiff's counsel regarding the overdue discovery, but no response was received. The court has ordered the plaintiff to provide verified responses, without objection, within 30 days.

The court has also awarded the defendant monetary sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $870.00. This amount is reduced from the defendant's initial request of $810.00. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond is a discovery abuse, but notes that the plaintiff's counsel did not advise the plaintiff to engage in this abuse.

The court has also ordered the defendant to provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.
