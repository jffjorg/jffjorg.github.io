[1] On
August 20, 2024 the Chen Family Trust filed a document entitled “Notice of
Motion and Motion for Leave to Amend Summary Judgment.” In it, Jack Chen and
Shirley Chen declare that they “are the sole trustees of the trust in
question,” and also are the “beneficiaries of the trust.” However, it is
unclear whether they are the sole beneficiaries, sole settlors, or whether the
trust is a revocable trust. Accordingly, the Court cannot determine that only
their interests are involved.
