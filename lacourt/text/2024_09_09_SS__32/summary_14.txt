The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Plaintiff Eric Perine to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories from Defendant BIS Logistics Inc. The motion was opposed by Defendant. The judge notes that the parties attended an informal discovery conference (IDC) on June 12, 2024, where Defendant's counsel stated that he was having trouble communicating with Defendant and intended to move to intervene. The judge also notes that amended responses to the discovery requests were served on August 26, 2024. Since the amended responses have been served, the judge denies the motion to compel further responses as moot. The judge orders Plaintiff to provide notice of the court's orders and file proof of service of such.
