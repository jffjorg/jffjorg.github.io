Significant Statements:

  - A party who chooses to allege that he has mental and emotional difficulties can hardly deny his mental state is in controversy.
  - The examination will be limited to whatever condition is “in controversy” in the action.
  - A showing of good cause generally requires “that the party produce specific facts justifying discovery and that the inquiry be relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to submit to an independent medical examination in California. The plaintiff had objected to the examination on the basis that it was more than 75 miles from his residence in Texas, and the defendants had not shown sufficient good cause for the travel. The court finds that the defendants failed to set forth specific facts showing how they would suffer extreme prejudice and undue hardship by retaining a Texas-based examiner. As a result, the court denies the motion and orders the defendants to provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.
