And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering Cartage's motion to file a cross-complaint and has determined that the standard regarding the filing of cross-complaints should be applied, not the standard regarding motions for judgment on the pleadings. The judge notes that Cartage itself has argued that the sufficiency of the cross-complaint is not a relevant factor in granting leave to file a permissive cross-complaint, and that Cartage should be given the opportunity to distinguish the Difko case from this case. The plaintiff has not provided any binding, applicable authority to refute this argument. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that Cartage's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint may be granted.
