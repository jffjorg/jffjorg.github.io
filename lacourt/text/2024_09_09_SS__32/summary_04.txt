And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The motion was filed late, as it was not served electronically until June 28, 2024, which is after the minimum statutory timeframe of June 24, 2024. Additionally, the motion was filed in pro per, without the representation of a licensed attorney. The Court notes that a trustee or executor who is not a lawyer cannot appear in pro per in legal proceedings to protect assets of the estate or trust, and that the Defendant has not filed an answer with licensed counsel. The Court further notes that the motion does not address the propriety of filing the motion without licensed representation. Therefore, the motion is denied, and the Defendant shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
