OPPOSING PARTY:

BACKGROUND
 
On January 12, 2024, Plaintiff Eric Perine (“Plaintiff”) propounded Form
Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant BIS
Logistics Inc. (“Defendant”). (Montes de Oca Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. 1.) 
 
Plaintiff granted several extensions. On March 26, 2024, Defendant
served responses to Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories; the
responses contained only objections. (Id. ¶ 6, Exh. 6.) Plaintiff
granted extensions to provide further responses until April 23, 2024. On that
day, Defendant failed to provide responses. (Id. ¶ 10.) 
 
On June 12, 2024, the parties attended an informal discovery
conference (“IDC”). According to Plaintiff, Defendant’s counsel represented
issues communicating with Defendant and stated an intention to move to
intervene. The minute order for the IDC states that the matter is resolved. (Min.
Order, 6/12/24.) 
 
Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses from Defendant to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, numbers 3.1–3.7, 4.1–4.2, 7.1–7.3, 12.1–12.7,
13.1–13.2, 14.1–14.2, 15.1, 16.1–16.10, 20.1–20.11 and Special Interrogatories,
Set One, numbers 1 to 4. Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions. Defendant
opposes. No reply has been filed. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
The
Court’s Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub
requires counsel to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”)
before the Court will hear any motion to compel further responses to discovery,
and provides that PI Hub Courts may deny or continue any motion if parties fail
to schedule and complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing. 
 
In opposition,
Defendant’s counsel (“Counsel”) asserts that throughout February and August
2024, he emailed and called Defendant multiple times, requesting assistance in
the defense of this action. (Pollack Decl. ¶ 7.) Counsel states that he
retained an investigator to contact Defendant. On August 25, 2024, Defendant
responded to counsel and signed the verifications for the discovery. (Id.
¶ 8.) The amended responses were served on August 26, 2024. (Id. ¶ 9.) 
 
No reply has
been filed. Therefore, since amended responses have been served, the motions to
compel further are denied as moot. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the motions to compel further responses to Form
Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories, are denied as moot.  
 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s orders and file
a proof of service of such.
