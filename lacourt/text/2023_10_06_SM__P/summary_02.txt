And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's application for a temporary restraining order and appointment of a receiver. The plaintiff, Lone Oak Fund, LLC, alleges that the defendant, 1046 Genesee, LLC, defaulted on its mortgage and seeks to prevent the use of rental income for purposes other than discharging the mortgage debt. The plaintiff argues that a receiver should be appointed to manage the property and collect rent, citing the deed of trust's provision for appointment of a receiver upon default. The defendant argues that the appointment of a receiver would be improper, citing Barclay's Bank of California v. Superior Court, and that there is no risk of irreparable injury. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing of likelihood of irreparable harm and that the appointment of a receiver is an extreme measure unjustifiable in this case.
