 Case Number:  22STCV38250    Hearing Date:   May 31, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS: Defendants’
Demurrer to Third Amended Complaint. Defendants’ Motion to Strike Third Amended
Complaint.
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff SIOF 1 Properties, LLC (“SIOF”) filed a Third
Amended Complaint (“TAC”), in consolidated case number 22STCV38250, against
Defendants Phood Farmacy 2 LLC, Robert Ancill, and Thelma Ancill (collectively
“Defendants”), asserting seven claims based on allegations that SIOF, as
commercial lessor and lender, agreed to provide over $350,000 for Phood Farmacy
tenant’s improvements to prepare 1000 E. 60th Street, Los Angeles for occupancy,
but Phood Farmacy abandoned the premises after about 7 months of possession and
refuses to repay the loan or pay the rent. 
The causes of action are: 1) Breach of Lease; 2) Failure to Repay Loan;
3) Common Counts: Money Owed; 4) Unjust Enrichment; 5) Intentional Interference
with Prospective Economic Advantage; 6) Intentional Interference with
Contractual Relations; and 7) Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic
Advantage.  
Defendants demur to the second, third, fourth, fifth,
sixth, and seventh causes of action of the TAC. Additionally, they move to
strike the second, third and fourth causes of action, and attorneys’ fees
allegations. SIOF opposes the demurrer and motion to strike. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Demurrers are to be sustained where a pleading fails
to plead adequately any essential element of the cause of action. Cantu v.
Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 879-880. “Because a
demurrer challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to
matters outside the pleading that are subject to judicial notice.” Arce ex
rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471,
556. In
ruling upon demurrers, courts treat as being true “not only the complaint’s
material factual allegations, but also facts that may be implied or inferred
from those expressly alleged.” Poseidon Development, Inc. v. Woodland Lane
Estates, LLC (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1106, 1111-1112.
The grounds for a motion to strike are that the
pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with laws. Code Civ. Proc., § 436.
ANALYSIS- DEMURRER
Second Cause of Action- Failure
to Repay Loan
SIOF’s second cause of action alleges that SIOF loaned
Defendants $350,000 for tenant improvements and Defendants failed to pay back
the loan. TAC, ¶¶ 19, 29-31. Defendants argue that this claim, akin to a breach
of contract claim, fails to allege the verbatim terms of the agreement or
attach it to the pleading. The elements of a claim for contract breach are (1)
existence of contract, (2) plaintiffs’ performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendants’ breach, and (4) resulting damage. E.g., Wall
Street Network, Ltd. v. N. Y. Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178. 
A party does not need to attach the contract or to
plead terms verbatim. E.g., Miles v. Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust Co.
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 402. “In an action based on a written contract, the
plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise
language.” Ochs v. PacifiCare of Cal. (2004) 115 Cal. App.4th 782, 795. The
case relied upon by Defendants deals with the standard for pleading fraud, and not
a contract claim as here. See Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 993. Thus, SIOF was not required to attach a
contract to the TAC and the described agreement to repay the tenant improvement
loans and the attached contract (which references the tenant improvements) together
suffice to allege this claim. 
Defendants next argue that allegations of performance
or excuse have not addressed that Defendants allegedly were not provided access
to the premises or the performance or non-performance of other guarantees under
the contract. An allegation of performance may be stated generally to the
effect that plaintiffs performed all the conditions. Careau & Co. v.
Sec. Pac. Bus. Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1389-1390. It is
permissible to allege the conclusion of performance of a condition, if not
contradicted by specific facts. Melican v. Regents of Univ. of Cal.
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 168, 174. Here, SIOF adequately alleged performance or
excuse by way of alleging that SIOF provided the loans, TAC, ¶¶ 19 and 29-30, and
SIOF need not anticipate asserted facts that are extrinsic to the pleading. 
Defendants also argue that this claim is not
cognizable under California law. But of course, the claim label is not
determinative. In ruling upon demurrers, courts consider whether any cause of
action has been alleged sufficiently, notwithstanding that a cause of action is
labeled otherwise. E.g., Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan,
Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 482. “[T]he allegations in the body of the
complaint, not the caption, constitute the cause of action against the
defendant.” Davaloo v. State Farm Ins. Co. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 409,
418. Here, the body of the pleading adequately alleges Defendants’ breach by
not paying for tenant improvements. Specifically, exhibit B to the lease
(attached to the TAC) states in section 2.1 that the tenant (i.e., Defendants) shall
pay for costs of tenant improvements. That obligation differs from the first cause
of action for breach of contract based on Defendants’ alleged failure to pay
rent as provided in the lease. 
Hence, the Court overrules the demurrer as to this
claim.
Third Cause of Action - Common
Counts: Money Owed
Defendants contend that this
claim lacks the necessary allegations of indebtedness and fails to address SIOF’s
non-performance. The elements of a claim for money expended for defendant are
(1) defendant is indebted to plaintiff in a certain sum, and (2) for money expended
for the defendant. Moya v. Northrup (1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 276, 280.  
Procedurally, “a common
count, by long continued practice is not subject to attack by general demurrer
or by a special demurrer for uncertainty.” E.g., Auckland v. Conlin
(1928) 203 Cal. 776, 778. “When a common count is used as an alternative way of
seeking the same recovery demanded in a specific cause of action, and is based
on the same facts, the common count is demurrable if the cause of action is
demurrable.” Berryman v. Merit Property Management, Inc. (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 1544, 1560.
Here, the TAC alleges
indebtedness for money expended for Defendants’ tenant improvements. TAC, ¶¶ 19
and 29-33. SIOF need not anticipate and negate the issue of non-performance, as
it is not one of the claim elements. SIOF is not required to address and
anticipate affirmative defenses in their pleadings unless already revealed.
E.g., Gentry v. eBay, Inc. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 816, 825. 
Therefore, the demurrer
is overruled as to this claim.
Fourth Cause of Action - Unjust
Enrichment
Defendants argue that SIOF’s alleged spending over
$350,000 for tenant improvements is not a benefit received by Defendants, but
instead an obligation to repay a loan that could lead to liability.
Defendants construe applicable law too narrowly. The
test is not whether complainants might ultimately recover a judgment for a
retained benefit. The elements of a claim for unjust enrichment are (1) receipt
of a benefit, (2) unjust or wrongful retention of the benefit, and (3) at the
expense of another. Peterson v. Cellco Partnership (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 1583, 1593. See also Ghirardo v. Antonioli (1996) 14 Cal.4th
39, 51 (receipt of a benefit includes being saved from an expense or loss).
Here, the TAC sufficiently alleges that Defendants were
saved the expenses of paying for tenant improvements and rent. TAC, ¶¶ 35-41.
Hence, the Court overrules the demurrer as to this
cause of action.
Fifth and Seventh Causes
of Action - Intentional and Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic
Advantage
SIOF’s fifth and seventh causes of action allege that Defendants
intentionally or negligently disrupted SIOF’s economic opportunities with third
party investors by providing defamatory information about SIOF to those
investors. TAC, ¶¶ 42-52, 62-69. Defendants contend that the claims fail to
demonstrate how Defendants’ alleged defamation disrupted any economic
relationship SIOF had with a third party and caused actual damages, based on concrete
evidence or detailed explanations. 
The elements of a claim for intentional interference
with prospective economic advantage are: (1) economic relationship existing
between the plaintiff and third party, (2) probability of future economic
benefit to the plaintiff, (3) defendant's knowledge of the relationship, (4) defendant's
intentional acts designed to disrupt the relationship, (5) defendant engaged in
an independently wrongful act in disrupting the relationship beyond just
inducing disruption of economic advantage, (6) actual disruption of the
relationship, and (7)  economic harm to
the plaintiff caused by the acts. E.g., Salma v. Capon (2008) 161
Cal.App.4th 1275, 1290. 
The elements of a claim for negligent interference
with prospective economic advantage are (1) economic relationship between the
plaintiff and a third party, (2) that contained a reasonably probable future
economic benefit or advantage to plaintiff, (3) defendant knew of the existence
of the relationship and was aware, or should have been, that if it did not act
with due care, its actions would interfere with the relationship and cause
plaintiff to lose in whole or in part the probable future economic benefit or
advantage, (4) defendant was negligent, (5) negligence caused damage to
plaintiff because of actual interference or disruption, and (6) plaintiff lost
in whole or in part the economic benefits or advantage reasonably expected from
the relationship. North Amer. Chem. Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 764, 786. 
Specific facts are not required to allege disruption
and loss. Cf. J'Aire Corp. v. Gregory (1979) 24 Cal.3d 799, 803 (“court
must assume the truth of all material allegations in the complaint…, including
the allegations of negligence and cause in fact. The only question … is whether
a cause of action for negligent loss of expected economic advantage may be
maintained under these facts.”)
Here, the TAC sufficiently alleges Defendants’
anonymous efforts in making defamatory communications to investors that disrupted
SIOF’s relationships by causing lost investor benefits, business, and income.
E.g., TAC, ¶¶ 46-51, 66-69.
In sum, the Court overrules the demurrer as to these
claims.
Sixth
Cause of Action - Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations

SIOF’s sixth cause of action alleges that Defendants
intentionally disrupted agreements that existed between SIOF and its investors
by spreading defamatory statements about SIOF to investors. TAC, ¶¶ 53-60. Defendants
contend that SIOF failed to specifically allege known contracts that were disrupted
and that caused concrete damages. 
The elements of a claim for intentional interference
with contractual relations are (1) plaintiff had a valid and existing contract
with a third party, (2) defendant had knowledge of the contract, (3) defendant
committed intentional and unjustified acts designed to interfere with or
disrupt the contract, (4) actual interference with or disruption of the
relationship, and (5) resulting damages. E.g., Davis v. Nadrich (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 1, 10.
Specific pleading of those claim elements is not
required. Cf. Elder v. Pac. Bell Tel. Co. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 841,
858 (as to interference with contract, allegations sufficed in alleging,
“contractual relationships with Pacific Bell, that OAN knew of the contractual
relationships, and ‘intended to and did induce a breach or disruption of those
relationships,’ by ‘knowingly and/or recklessly continually causing
unauthorized charges,…’ and plaintiff … suffered a loss as a direct result….”).
Here, SIOF sufficiently alleges that it had actual
agreements with investors that Defendants knew about, Defendants communicated defamation
that caused investors’ apprehension about continuing business dealings with
SIOF, which resulted in failures of funding to SIOF. TAC, ¶¶ 53-60. The
demurrer to this claim is overruled. 
As a result, the Court overrules the demurrer as to
this cause of action.
ANALYSIS- MOTION TO STRIKE
Defendants’ motion to strike seeks to strike the
allegations in the TAC for the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh
causes of action that are the subject of the demurrer. Defendants seek to
strike these allegations for failure to state a claim but a motion to strike
cannot be based upon the grounds that a complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Ferraro v. Camarlinghi
(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 509, 528-529.
Defendants also seek to strike the request for
attorney’s fees from the TAC, arguing that attorneys’ fees are not supported by
specific facts of contract breach or applicable statutory sections. Unsupported
attorneys’ fees allegations need not be struck pursuant to a motion to strike
because later discovery may reveal a basis for their recovery. Camenisch
v.  Superior Court (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1689, 1699. “There is no requirement that a party plead that it is
seeking attorney fees, and there is no requirement that the ground for a fee
award be specified in the pleadings.”  Yassin
v. Solis (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 524, 533. 
Accord Snatchko v. Westfield LLC (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 469, 497
(error to strike attorney fees, because there is no pleading requirement).  
Therefore, the Court denies the motion to strike.
 
CONCLUSION
The Court overrules the demurrer and denies the motion
to strike. Twenty days to answer.
