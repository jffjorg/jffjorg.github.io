And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court overrules the demurrer to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action, denying the demurrer. The Court also denies the motion to strike the allegations in the Third Amended Complaint. The Court finds that the demurrer fails to demonstrate that the causes of action lack sufficient factual allegations, and that the motion to strike is improper as it seeks to strike allegations that are not legally sufficient.
