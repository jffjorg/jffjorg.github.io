And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendants, Bounty La, LLC and Cyrus Davar, have moved to stay the action pending the completion of Labor Commission proceedings between the parties. The plaintiff, Francesca Webb, agrees that the Labor Commissioner has exclusive jurisdiction over some issues in the case and that the case should be stayed. The court finds that the Labor Commissioner has exclusive jurisdiction over some issues in the case and that staying the action would promote efficiency. Therefore, the court grants the non-opposed motion and stays the action pending a final determination by the Labor Commission.
