PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES ON APPEAL



 
MOVING
PARTY:               Plaintiff
Fabiola Vera  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Lucas Auto Center, Inc.
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On February
22, 2021, Plaintiff, Fabiola Vera, filed this action against Defendants Lucas
Auto Center Inc. (“Lucas Auto” or “Defendant”), Hudson Insurance Company, and
Does 1 through 75.  On April 5, 2021,
Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging, in relevant
part, violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) and the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act (Song-Beverly).  
 
            On June 22,
2021, the clerk entered default against Lucas Auto.
 
            On October
13, 2021, after Plaintiff dismissed Hudson Insurance Company and Doe
Defendants, the court entered default judgment against Lucas Auto in the sum of
$30,805.32, consisting of $4,936.00 in damages, $16,918.36 as a Song-Beverly
penalty, $7,409.00 in attorneys’ fees, and $1,046.96 in costs.     
 
            On May 23,
2022, after several attempts, Plaintiff obtained a writ of execution.  On the same day, Lucas Auto filed a motion to
set aside the default and default judgment. 

 
            On August
25, 2022, the court denied Lucas Auto’s motion to set aside the default and
default judgment.  
 
            On
September 20, 2022, Defendant filed a Notice of Appeal.  The appeal was denied on February 21, 2024.
 
            On April 2,
2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion for Attorney’s Fees on Appeal. 
 
            Defendant
filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied. 
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
The determination of reasonable
amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial courts. (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise
Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1134.) “The determination of
what constitutes a reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate….’”¿ “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the
community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors including, as
relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award….”¿ (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)¿ In setting the hourly rate for an attorney
fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “‘fees customarily
charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar work.’”¿ (Bihun
v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 976, 997
[affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v.
Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)¿ The burden is on the
party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees.¿ (Center
for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th
603, 615.)¿¿ 
 
It is settled “ ‘that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court .... [Citations.] The value of legal services
performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has its own expertise.
[Citation.] The trial court may make its own determination of the value of the
services contrary to, or without the necessity for, expert testimony.’ ” (PLCM
Group v. Drexler, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1096; accord, Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132 [the “ ‘ “experienced trial judge is
the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court, and
... his judgment ... will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is
convinced that it is clearly wrong” ’ ”].) 
 
“Unless specifically provided
otherwise, a statute or contract allowing recovery of attorney fees at trial
also authorizes attorney fees on appeal.” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide
Civ. Trials & Ev. (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 17:1022 citing, Serrano v.
Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 637; Evans v. Unhoui (1995) 38
Cal.App.4th 1490, 1499; see also Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc.
(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 46 citing Graciano, supra, 144
Cal.App.4th at p. 165 [“‘Statutory authorization for the recovery of attorney
fees incurred at trial necessarily includes attorney fees incurred on appeal
unless the statute specially provides otherwise’”]; Cal. Rules of Court, rule
8.278.)
 
III.       DISCUSSION           
            
 Plaintiff moves the court to recover $30,635
in attorney’s fees incurred in connection to Lucas Auto’s appeal.  This is a CLRA and Song-Beverly action, and
each statute provides for attorney’s fees to a prevailing party.  (See Civ. Code, §§ 1780(e), 1794(d).)  Given that Plaintiff is the prevailing party,
Plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees.
 
            Lucas Auto argues
the requested attorney’s fees should be reduced for the following reasons:  (1) some fees were unnecessary, unproductive,
and vague; (2) Plaintiff’s Counsel Christopher Barry’s hourly rate is excessive
and unjustified; (3) the adjustment factors are not applicable here.  
 
As a threshold issue, the court
notes that adjustment factors are typically considered to determine whether a
multiplier is warranted.  (Serrano v.
Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.) 
Here, however, Plaintiff does not seek a multiplier.  Accordingly, the court addresses only Defendant’s
first and second arguments.
 
1. 
Whether Plaintiff’s Fees On Appeal Were Unnecessary, Unproductive, or
Vague
 
Here, Defendant asserts three
challenges to the fee request.  The first
challenge is based upon unnecessary or excessive billing.  Plaintiff’s counsel expended over 60 hours in
the appeal.  Defendant argues the hours
billed are excessive.  In particular,
Defendant takes issue with Mr. Barry having billed 23.4 hours.  Plaintiff responds by stating that Mr. Barry
became more heavily involved in the appeal after Defense Counsel complained
that Plaintiff’s primary appellate attorney, Michelle Cook, who is based in
Virginia, would be unreasonably seeking to recover her travel time and expenses
if Plaintiff prevailed on appeal.  Defense Counsel expressly asked for Mr. Barry
to handle the oral argument for Plaintiff.  The foregoing exchange is supported by email
correspondence.  (Reply, Cook Decl., ¶ 10,
Ex. 13.)  At that point, Mr. Barry had
only billed 4.7 hours on the appeal.  After
Defense Counsel’s complaint, Mr. Barry became more involved in the appeal and
spent an additional 19.8 hours on the matter.   Based on the foregoing, the court finds the
hours billed by Mr. Barry were not excessive. 
Lucas Auto also argues that Plaintiff’s other counsel, Arlyne Escalante
spent excessive time on tasks such as 0.7 hours to review the notice of appeal
and request calendaring of next steps.   (Plaintiff’s
Compendium of Exhibits (COE), Ex. 5.)  The
court disagrees that this entry is excessive. 
Further, Lucas Auto fails to identify any other items which it claims to
be excessive. 
 
Defendant next argues that the
hours entered by Ms. Cook and Mr. Barry are vague. The assertion is
unfounded.  A review of Plaintiff’s
billing is sufficiently clear and, on its face, related to the appeal.  (See COE, Ex. 5.)  
 
Last, Defendant argues that some of
the time billed by Ms. Cook was duplicative of Ms. Escalante and Mr. Barry’s
billing entries.  Defendant, however,
fails to point to any entries which show duplicative billing between Ms. Cook
and Ms. Escalante.  And as to duplicative
billing between Ms. Cook and Mr. Barry, Defendant appears to refer to billing
for drafting of respondent’s brief. 
However, as discussed above, Mr. Barry became more involved in the
appeal after Lucas Auto’s counsel complained about Ms. Cook.  (See Reply, Cook Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. 13.)  Further, Ms. Cook and Mr. Barry’s billing
entries do not suggest duplicate work.  (See COE, Ex. 5.)  Rather, it shows that both attorneys worked in
the drafting and reviewing of the respondent’s brief.  The court does not find such billing to be objectionable.  (See, e.g., Horsford v. Board of Trustees
of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 349, 396-97 [disagreeing
with trial court’s determination of that prevailing party billed for
overlapping work where a senior partner and two other attorneys worked on the
research, drafting, and cite checking of an opposition to a motion for
protective order].)  Defendant does not
show the hours expended were unnecessary, unproductive, or vague.
 
2. 
Whether Mr. Barry’s Hourly Rate is Excessive
 
Mr. Barry billed at an hourly rate
of $695.  (Barry Decl. ¶ 10.)  Defendant argues that Mr. Barry does not
support the reasonableness of his hourly rate. 
However, as Plaintiff points out, the court granted Plaintiff’s Motion
for Post-Judgment Attorney Fees and Costs. 
(See Minute Order, 3/28/24.)  Mr.
Barry billed at an hourly rate of $670. 
Defendant did not challenge the reasonableness of that rate, and the
court awarded attorney fees based, in part, on that hourly rate. Since the
filing of the Motion for Post-Judgment Attorney Fees and Costs, Mr.
Barry’s  hourly rate has increased to $695.  Calculating a lodestar based on counsel’s
then-present rate is acceptable practice. 
(See Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553,
583-84 [explaining, to account for lost value of use of fees invested, courts
should (1) use counsel’s then-present rates but include interest or (2)
calculate the lodestar “based on the present hourly rate rather than the lesser
rate applicable when the services were rendered”].)  Accordingly, the court finds Mr. Barry’s rate
of $695 to be reasonable. 
 
III.      CONCLUSION
 
            Based
on the foregoing, the Motion for Attorney’s Fees on Appeal is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is awarded the total sum of $30,635.
 
            Plaintiff to give notice.
