DEMURRER
WITH MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Defendant
Stephen Snyder
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Marvin Fetalino,
as Trustee of the MF Hero Trust
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a contractual fraud case.  On June 23, 2023, Plaintiff, Marvin Fetalino,
as trustee of the MF Hero Trust, filed a Verified Complaint against Defendants Stephen
Snyder (“Snyder” or “Defendant”)[1]
and 3327 Ione, LLC (“Ione”), for (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Intentional
Misrepresentation, (3) Fraudulent Concealment, (4) Negligent Misrepresentation,
(5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and (6) Declaratory Relief.  Plaintiff alleges that he and Ione entered
into an investment agreement (the “Agreement”), secured by a promissory note
(“Note”), in the principal sum of $50,000. 
The purpose of the Agreement was to purchase, rehabilitate, and resell
the residential property located at 3327 Ione Drive, Los Angeles, CA (the
“Property”).  The Agreement is attached
to the Complaint as Exhibit 1.  Snyder is
self-represented.
 
On March 4, 2024, Snyder filed this Demurrer and Motion to
Strike.  
 
Plaintiff filed oppositions. 
Snyder filed replies. 
 
II.        DISCUSSION
RE DEMURRER
            
A.   
 Legal Standard for Demurrer 
 
            A demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and will be sustained only where
the pleading is defective on its face.¿ (City of Atascadero v. Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)¿
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.¿ We accept the factual
allegations of the complaint as true and also consider matters which may be
judicially noticed.¿ [Citation.]”¿ (Mitchell v. California Department of
Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged
in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable they may be”].)
Allegations are to be liberally construed.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)¿ In
construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to specific factual
allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory
allegations.¿ (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 764, 769.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿            
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).)¿“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint
is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.”¿(Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
Where the complaint contains substantial factual allegations
sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a
demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given leave to
amend.¿ (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135,
139, fn. 2.)¿ Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment.¿ (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)¿¿ 
 
B.    
Application 
 
1.     
 Meet and Confer  
 
Before filing a demurrer or motion to strike, the movant
shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the
party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer or a motion to strike for
the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the filings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd. (a) 435.5, subd. (a).)¿  
 
Here, Defendant has complied with the meet and confer requirement.  (See Declaration of Stephen Snyder, ¶ 2.)  The court proceeds to the merits of the Demurrer
and Motion to Strike.
 
2.     
Analysis  
 
Snyder raises three global challenges to all six causes of
action and raises specific challenges to each cause of action.  The court begins by addressing the global
arguments. 
 
a.     
Global
Challenges
 
Snyder argues the Complaint fails for three reasons: (1) the
alter-ego allegations are insufficient; (2) an
indemnification clause in the Agreement bars Plaintiff’s claims; and (3) all causes of action are time barred.
 
i.       
Alter-Ego Allegations
 
Plaintiff alleges one express alter ego allegation.  “On information and belief, at all
relevant times alleged herein, there existed and does exist a unity of interest
and ownership between Ione and Snyder such that any individuality and
separateness between the respective Defendants have ceased such that they are
each the alter ego of the other, and injustice will result if each of the
above-mentioned entities is treated as a sole actor.”  (Complaint ¶ 8.)
 
Snyder argues this one allegation is insufficient to
establish that Ione and Snyder are alter egos. 
The court disagrees.  Under
the alter ego doctrine, when a corporation is used by an individual or
individuals, or by another corporation, to perpetrate fraud, circumvent a
statute, or to accomplish some other wrongful or inequitable purpose, the
persons actually controlling the corporation. (Toho-Towa Co., Ltd. v. Morgan
Creek Productions, Inc. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1106-1107.)  Courts apply a two-prong test for application
of the alter ego doctrine: (1) there is such a unity of interest and ownership
between the corporation and the alter ego defendant that their separate
personalities no longer exist; and (2) the facts are such that if the privilege
of separate existences is recognized, i.e. if the acts are treated as those of
the corporation alone, an inequitable result will follow.  (Mesler v. Bragg Management Co. (1985)
39 Cal.3d 290, 299.)
 
Here, Snyder ignores other allegations in the Complaint
which, along with Paragraph 8, satisfy the two-pronged test.   For the
first prong, Plaintiff alleges that Snyder is the managing member of Ione
(Complaint, ¶ 5) and that he dealt “solely and
directly with Snyder for the Agreement and the loan” (Complaint, ¶ 9).  For the
second prong, Plaintiff alleges that Snyder made intentional misrepresentations
about the investment and the Property to induce Plaintiff to loan Snyder $50,000
without having the intention of ever repaying Plaintiff.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 23-25.)  Snyder induced Plaintiff to loan the money,
secured additional funding for personal gain, and did not disclose it to
Plaintiff, thereby depleting the Property’s equity.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 26-27.)  Snyder also continued to encumber the
Property for additional funds that exceeded his representations of the costs to
rehabilitate the Property and depleted its equity.  (Complaint, ¶ 27.)  The Complaint properly pleads Snyder’s alter
ego.
 
ii.                 
Indemnification Clause
 
The
Agreement contains an indemnification clause. 

 
“INDEMNIFICATION:
THE INVESTOR [MF TRUST] hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless THE BROKER
(Steve Snyder of Strategic Capital Investment Group and Private-money-loan.com)
and THE COMPANY including its officers, directors, shareholders, employees and
agents from any losses, damages, claims, expenses, including attorneys’ fees,
arising from or pertaining to the ownership, improvement, maintenance, resale,
all other aspects pertaining to ownership of the PROPERTY, and any breaches of
this Agreement, or any Addendum thereto, or failure of performance thereof by
THE MANAGER, THE COMPANY or THE BROKER.”
 
(Complaint, Ex.
1, ¶ 14.)
Snyder argues this indemnification
clause bars Plaintiff’s claims against Snyder. 

Plaintiff argues the
indemnification clause is void as against public policy.  
The court agrees with
Plaintiff.  “All contracts which have for
their object, directly or indirectly, to exempt any one from responsibility for
his own fraud, or willful injury to the person or property of another, or
violation of law, whether willful or negligent, are against the policy of the
law.”  (Civ. Code, § 1668.)  “This section made it clear a party could not
contract away liability for his fraudulent or intentional acts or for his
negligent violations of statutory law.” 
(Baker Pacific Corp. v. Suttles (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1148,
1153-1154.)  Civil Code section 2773
likewise provides, “An agreement to indemnify a person against an act
thereafter to be done, is void, if the act be known by such person at the time
of doing it to be unlawful.”  
Here, Plaintiff alleges that Snyder
fraudulently induced Plaintiff to loan Defendants $50,000 without having the
intention of ever repaying Plaintiff. 
(Complaint, ¶ 23.)  Snyder cannot
rely on the indemnification clause to shield him from liability for his alleged
acts of fraud.  Snyder, having not
responded to this argument, does not show otherwise.
iii.               
Statute of Limitations
 
Snyder contends the Complaint is time-barred.  As to the contract claim, Snyder arrives at
this conclusion based on the following reasoning: Ione and MF Trust entered
into the Agreement and Note on September 14, 2017.  (Complaint, Ex. 1.)  The Agreement is a loan which matured and
became payable on September 12, 2018. 
(Complaint, Ex. 1, Note, ¶ 1.)  The
Note provided an automatic 6-month extension period that extended the maturity
date of the loan to March 12, 2019.  “If
this NOTE has not been paid in full with the agreed upon Net Profits upon the
maturity date of September 12th, 2018 then the maturity date will be
automatically extended for a period of six (6) months, where in addition to the
Net Profits paid to the Holder, they will also receive a rate of 1.5% of the
principle sum per month until the property is paid in full.  This will be paid upon the sale or payoff of
the NOTE and not on a monthly basis.”  (Complaint,
Ex. 1, Note, ¶ 2.)  Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff contends the loan became due on March 12, 2019, which
required Plaintiff to bring this action by March 12, 2023.  Plaintiff filed this action in June
2023.  
 
Snyder selectively reads the Agreement and Note.  As Plaintiff points out, the Note provides
that 1.5% accrues per month until the property is paid in full.  The Property was not paid in full until its
foreclosure in 2021.  (Complaint, ¶ 15.)  Further, the Agreement contemplates that the
1.5% accrues on a month-to-month basis “until the property is sold.”  (Complaint, Ex. 1, Agreement, ¶ 5.d.)  Plaintiff’s contract claims are not barred.
 
As to Plaintiff’s fraud claims, Snyder relies on the same
maturity date of March 12, 2019 to argue the fraud claims are barred.  The statute of limitations for fraud is three
years.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 338, subd. (d).)  
 
In response, Plaintiff cites the delayed discovery rule
which provides that the statute of limitations is extended until the damages
have accrued.  (Neel v. Magana, Oiney,
Levy, Cathcart, & Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176, 187 [a cause of action
will not accrue until the occurrence of the last essential element].)  As discussed above, the Agreement matured
upon the sale of the Property in 2021.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s fraud cause of action accrued in 2021.  Further, Plaintiff later discovered that
Snyder received aid from various other investors that exceeded the project
costs for the Property.  According to
Plaintiff, Snyder concealed the true progress on the Property’s rehabilitation and
resale efforts.  Plaintiff’s fraud claims
are not time-barred.  
 
Finally, Snyder challenges the breach of fiduciary duty
claim based on the same date of March 12, 2019. 
The general statute of limitations applies to a breach of fiduciary duty
claim, which must be brought in four years. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 343.)  However,
Snyder’s challenge fails for the same reasons as detailed above: Plaintiff’s
damages accrued in 2021 with the sale of the Property. [2]

 
b.     
Challenges
to Each Cause of Action
 
Snyder asserts challenges to the fraud claims (Second, Third,
Fourth, and Fifth Causes of Action) as a group, and further demurs to the breach
of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and declaratory relief claims.
 
i.       
Economic Loss Rule
 
Snyder argues the fraud claims are barred by the economic
loss rule.  The court disagrees.  The economic loss rule “prevent[s] the law of
contract and the law of tort from dissolving one into the other.”  (Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana
Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988.) 
However, tort damages are permitted in contracts if the contract was
fraudulent induced.  “When one party
commits a fraud during the contract formation or performance, the injured party
may recover in contract and tort.”   (Harris
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 70, 78.)  
            
Here, Plaintiff alleges that Snyder fraudulently induced Plaintiff
to enter into the Agreement and Note. 
(Complaint, ¶¶ 23-27.)  The fraud
claims are adequately pled.
 
ii.                 
First Cause of Action for Breach of
Contract
 
The elements of a breach of contract cause of action are:
(1) the existence of a valid contract between the plaintiff and the defendant,
(2) the plaintiff’s performance, (3) the defendant’s unjustified failure to
perform, and (4) damages to the plaintiff caused by the defendant’s breach.
(CACI No. 303; Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific Business, Inc.
(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1388 (Careau); Otworth v. Southern Pac.
Transportation (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458.) “[T]he complaint must
indicate on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by
conduct.” (Otworth, 166 Cal.App.3d at pp. 458-459.)¿ The elements of a
breach of oral contract claim are the same as those for a breach of written
contract. (Careau, 222 Cal.App.3d at p. 1388.)¿ A claim for breach of
oral contract must be brought within two years of the breach.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 339.)¿  
 
Snyder argues the First Cause of Action fails for two
reasons: (1) there are no alleged breaches and (2) Snyder is not a party to the
Agreement or Note.  Each challenge
fails.  First, Snyder’s alleged breaches
include: failure to make any payments owed under the Agreement (Complaint, ¶18),
failure to disclose material facts of the Property’s refinancing and
foreclosure actions (Complaint, ¶ 19), failure to return Plaintiff’s principal
per the Agreement (Complaint, ¶ 20), failure to pay additional returns  to the Property’s refinance (Complaint, ¶
21), and failure to pay Plaintiff 1.5% per month past the one-year anniversary
of the Agreement (Complaint, ¶ 22.) 
Snyder is apprised of the basis for Plaintiff’s breach of contract
claim.
 
Second, Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim against Snyder
is based on an alter ego theory.  The
procedural vehicles available to a party asserting alter ego liability includes
“su[ing] the alter ego directly in an action for breach of contract.”  (MSY Trading, Inc. v. Saleen Automotive, Inc.
(2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 395, 402.)  Here,
the court has found that Plaintiff adequately pleads alter ego.  Plaintiff’s First Cause of Action is
adequately pled.
 
iii.               
Fifth Cause of Action for Breach of
Fiduciary Duty
 
“The elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary
duty are the existence of a 
fiduciary relationship, its breach, and damage proximately
caused by that breach.”  (Knox v. Dean (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 417,
432-33.)  No fraudulent intent is required.  (See Civ. Code, § 1573
(defining “constructive fraud”).)   
 
            Snyder
argues the breach of fiduciary duty claim fails because (1) the claim is
unclear, uncertain, and unintelligible, and (2) there is no relationship
between Snyder and Plaintiff to the loan agreement because Snyder was not a
signatory.  The challenges lack
merit.  Plaintiff alleges he was a
shareholder of Ione.  Thus, Snyder, as
the managing member of Ione, owed a fiduciary duty to Plaintiff to not deplete
the funds received for the Property’s rehabilitation project.  (Complaint, ¶ 57.)  Plaintiff’s fiduciary claim is not
uncertain.  Second, the court has found
that Plaintiff adequately allege alter ego. 
Snyder’s challenge fails.
 
iv.               
Sixth Cause of Action for
Declaratory Relief
 
A cause of action for declaratory relief should not be used
as a secondary cause of action for the determination of identical issues raised
in another cause of action.  (General of America Insurance Co. v. Lilly
(1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 465, 470.)¿ “The availability of another form of
relief that is adequate will usually justify refusal to grant declaratory
relief.”¿ (California Insurance Guarantee Association v. Superior Court
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1617, 1624).¿ Further, “there is no basis for declaratory
relief where only past wrongs are involved.”¿ (Osseous Technologies of
America, Inc. v. DiscoveryOrtho Partners LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 357,
366, quotation marks omitted.)¿ 
 
Snyder argues the Sixth Cause of Action fails because it is
derivative of the breach of the contract claim. 
The agrees the Sixth Cause of Action of action is subject to demurrer,
but for a different reason.  Declaratory
relief is based upon the fraud and breach of contract allegations.  (Complaint, ¶ 62.)  In other words, only past wrongs are
involved.  (Osseous Technologies of
America, Inc. v. DiscoveryOrtho Partners LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 357,
366, quotation marks omitted.)¿ The declaratory relief is deficient.
 
III.       DISCUSSION
RE MOTION TO STRIKE
 
A.   
Legal Standard for Motion to Strike
 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading,
may serve and file a motion to strike the whole pleading or any part thereof.¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322(b).)¿
On a motion to strike, the court may: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of
any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California, a
court rule, or an order of the court.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subds. (a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782.)¿¿¿ 
 
“The grounds for a motion to strike are limited to matters
appearing on the face of the challenged pleading or matters which must or may
be judicially noticed. (§ 437, subd. (a); Evid. Code, §§ 451, 452.)”  (Garcia
v. Sterling (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 17, 20.)¿¿ 
 
B.    
Application
 
Snyder raises three additional challenges to the
Complaint.  First, Snyder states that
various Paragraphs in the Complaint, ¶¶ 23-27, 47, 36-38, 53-55, should be
stricken based on the parol evidence rule.  (Motion, p. 4-7.)  However, as Plaintiff points out, parol
evidence rule may not be asserted as a shield to prevent proof of fraud, even
if the evidence shows a promise directly at variance.  (Riverisland Cold Storage, Inc. v.
Fresno-Madera Production Credit Assn. (2013) 55 Cal.4th 1169, 1182.)  Plaintiff pleads fraudulent inducement in the
Agreement. (Complaint, ¶ 12.)  Therefore,
the argument fails.
 
Second, Snyder seeks to strike punitive damages from the Complaint
because punitive damages are not available for breach of contract claims.  However, punitive damages are available for
fraudulent inducement claims.  (See Walker
v. Signal Companies, Inc. (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 982, 996 [punitive damages
“may be awarded where a defendant fraudulently induces the plaintiff to enter
into a contract”].)   As stated
throughout this order, Plaintiff pleads a fraudulent inducement claim.
 
Last, Snyder moves to strike allegations of “Junior DOT”
from the Complaint as irrelevant, because by a matter of law and definition of
a refinance” the Junior DOT was not a refinance.  The point is not supported by any
authority.  The motion to strike the
allegations lack merit.
 
VI.         CONCLUSION
 
            The Demurrer
to the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Causes of Action is OVERRULED.
 
            The
Demurrer to the Sixth Cause of Action is SUSTAINED.  Leave to amend is DENIED.
 
            The Motion
to Strike is DENIED. 
 
            Defendant
Stephen Snyder is ordered to serve and file an answer to the Complaint within
10 days of the date of this order.
 
            The parties are ordered to file a Notice of Related Case in
the cases listed in the Complaint.
