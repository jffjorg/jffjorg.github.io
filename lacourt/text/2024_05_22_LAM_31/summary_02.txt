And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel Defendant Calcrete Construction, Inc. to provide responses to Plaintiff Isabel Arteaga's special interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The Defendant had served responses to the discovery requests, but the Plaintiff argued that the responses were untimely. The court finds that the motions are moot since the Defendant has provided the discovery responses. However, the court will impose reduced sanctions against the Defendant in the amount of $1,120 due to Defense Counsel's illness and Plaintiff's efforts to obtain the discovery responses.
