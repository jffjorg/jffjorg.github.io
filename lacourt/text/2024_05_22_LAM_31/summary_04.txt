And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted Echeverria's motion to quash the PMQ subpoena, which was issued by Elite Veterinary Corporation. The subpoena sought information about Echeverria's work performance and reasons for termination from North Valley Veterinary Clinic, Inc. The judge ruled that the subpoena did not track Elite Veterinary's stated theory of relevance and failed to seek information related to what North Valley communicated to potential employers. The judge also imposed sanctions against Defense Counsel in the sum of $1,060, consisting of two hours at an hourly rate of $500 and $60 in filing fees. The sanctions were to be paid to Echeverria, by and through her counsel, within 30 days of the order.
