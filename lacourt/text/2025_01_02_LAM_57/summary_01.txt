And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions before the court. The judge is denying the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff's expert, Nora Ostrove. However, the judge will discuss with counsel the possibility of setting a date for the deposition at the hearing today. The judge is also denying the defendants' motions to quash the subpoenas for the employment records of the defendants from their former employers, UPS and Federal Express. This is because the defendants failed to address the fact that they had previously filed a similar motion, which was denied in October 2024. The judge will discuss the motions to quash at the hearing today and will likely deny them for the same reason as the earlier motion. No sanctions are being imposed on either side.
