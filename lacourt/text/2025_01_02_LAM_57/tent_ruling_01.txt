  Case Number:  20STCV03322    Hearing Date:   January 2, 2025    Dept:  57 The Court is denying Defendants' motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiffs' expert Nora Ostrove.  The Court will, however, at the hearing today discuss with counsel a date on which this deposition can be set.  No sanctions are being imposed on either side.The Court is denying the Defendants' motions to quash Plaintiffs' subpoenas for the employment records of (1) Defendants Triviso and Guzman from their former employer, UPS, and (2) Defendant Triviso at another of his former employer's, Federal Express.  These motions appear to be identical to the motion that the Defendants filed to quash Plaintiffs' subpoena for the employment records of Guzman from Federal Express, where, like Triviso, he previously worked.   The Court denied that earlier motion in October 2024.  Plaintiffs raised this fact in their oppositions to the motions to quash that are on calendar today.  Defendants failed to address this in their reply briefs.  The Court will deny the motions on calendar today for the same reason, and along the same lines, it denied the earlier motion.
