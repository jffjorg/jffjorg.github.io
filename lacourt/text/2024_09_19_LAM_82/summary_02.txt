And here is a summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the Judge is setting forth their thoughts on the upcoming Court Hearing. The Judge notes that the Department did not call a witness from the LAPD to authenticate text messages, but the petitioner's counsel did not object to the foundation for the text messages (except for one photograph). The Judge also states that they will not take a position on whether the Commission upholds the termination and issues new findings of fact and conclusions of law, or vacates the penalty of termination and imposes a three-day suspension, or takes some other action permitted under its rules and regulations. The Judge is citing a previous case, Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, to support their decision.
