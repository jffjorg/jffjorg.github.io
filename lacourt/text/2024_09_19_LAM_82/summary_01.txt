And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the petition for writ of mandate and remands the case to the Civil Service Commission for reconsideration. The Commission's findings and conclusions were based on insufficient evidence and did not provide adequate explanations for their decisions. The Commission relied heavily on hearsay evidence and did not adequately address the evidence presented in the case. The judge finds that the Commission's decision was an abuse of discretion and that the petitioner was not given a fair trial. The judge also notes that the Commission's findings were not supported by the evidence and that the petitioner's termination was not justified.
