And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Lawren C. Bocock, et al.'s motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents, set one, and request for sanctions, in part, and granted it, in part. The judge found that certain requests made by the plaintiffs were overly broad, vague, and burdensome, and therefore denied the motion as to those requests. The judge granted the motion as to requests 3 and 9, finding that the responses made by the defendant were not compliant with California Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.230. The judge denied the plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions. The defendant is ordered to serve further verified responses to requests 3 and 9 within 10 days of the date of this ruling.
