RULING: The hearing on the motions will be

This action arises out of automobile accident that
occurred on 6/9/22 in Santa Clarita, California.  Plaintiff Maricruz Celedon Martinez
(Plaintiff) contends that she was injured 
when Defendant Madelyn Grace Manning caused a three-vehicle collision by
failing to yield when exiting the driveway of the Midas Auto Repair Shop.
 
On 9/6/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Meagan
Renee Enbody, Shawn Douglas Enbody,  Chad
Manning and Does 1-20 for motor vehicle negligence.  On 11/30/23, Plaintiff filed the operative
First Amended Complaint for motor vehicle negligence against the foregoing
defendants and Madelyn Grace Manning.  On
2/5/24, Meagan Renee Enbody and Shawn Douglas Enbody answered the First Amended
Complaint.  On 3/15/24, Chad Manning and
Madelyn Grace Manning answered the First Amended Complaint.
 
On 5/15/24, Plaintiff served Defendant Madelyn Grace
Manning (Defendant) with Special Interrogatories, Set 1; Requests for
Admissions,  Set 1 and Form
Interrogatories, Set 1.  On 6/21/24, Defendant
served responses to the discovery. 
Plaintiff found Defendant’s responses to certain of the discovery
requests to be deficient.  Despite meet
and confer efforts, the parties were unable to resolve the discovery
disputes.  During the meet and confer
efforts, the parties agreed to extend the time to file motions to compel
further responses.  
Therefore, on 8/16/24 Plaintiff filed and served motions
seeking: 
 
(1) An order compelling Defendant Madelyn Grace Manning
to provide further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set 1, Nos. 1-4 and
8-13.  Additionally, Plaintiff requests
sanctions against Defendant and her attorney of record, Grach Bekaryan at the
Law Offices of Bensen, Johnson, Alvarez and Zakarian in the amount of $1,710.00;
 
(2) An order compelling Defendant Madelyn Grace Manning
to provide further responses to Requests for Admissions, Nos. 1, 2, 4-6 and
10.  Additionally, Plaintiff requests
sanctions against Defendant and her attorney of record, Grach Bekaryan at the
Law Offices of Bensen, Johnson, Alvarez and Zakarian in the amount of $1,710.00;
and
 
(3) An order compelling Defendant Madelyn Grace Manning
to provide further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set 1, No. 17.1.  Additionally, Plaintiff requests sanctions
against Defendant and her attorney of record, Grach Bekaryan at the Law Offices
of Bensen, Johnson, Alvarez and Zakarian in the amount of $1,710.00
  
On 11/1/24, Defendant filed oppositions to the
motions.  No replies to the opposition
have been filed.
 
The proofs of service for the opposition documents
indicate that they were served on Plaintiff’s counsel at the following email
addresses: ESchurmer@schurmerfirm.com;
Jcastellanos@schurmerfirm.com;
and SSchurmer@schurmerfirm.com.  However, the email address of record for
Plaintiff’s counsel in eCourt is ESCHURMER@SCHURMERWOOD.COM.  
  
Based on the foregoing, it cannot be determined whether
the lack of replies is due to service of the oppositions on improper email
addresses.  Therefore, the hearing on the
motions will be continued.  Defendant’s
counsel is ordered serve the oppositions on the email address of record for
Plaintiff’s counsel.  Any replies are due
to be filed and served at least 5 court days before the continued hearing
date.
