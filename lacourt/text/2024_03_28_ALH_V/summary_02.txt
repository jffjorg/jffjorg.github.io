The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Jaclyn, LLC's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. The motion seeks to add language to the complaint stating that the subject lease agreement is not subject to the Tenant Protection Act of 2019. The judge finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently complied with the requirements of the California Rules of Court and that the proposed amendments are in furtherance of justice and will not prejudice the defendant. The judge also notes that the defendant's lack of opposition to the motion is a tacit admission that the plaintiff's arguments are meritorious. As a result, the court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to file and serve the Second Amended Complaint within five days.
