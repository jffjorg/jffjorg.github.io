And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of defendant's person most qualified (PMQ) and to compel further responses to requests for production of documents.

The court grants the motion to compel deposition, ordering the PMQ to appear for deposition with the production of documents as set forth in the Third Amended Notice of Deposition within 30 days of the date of notice of this order. The court awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $750.00 to be paid by defendant to plaintiff within 30 days of the date of notice of this order.

The court denies the motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents (RPD Motion) without prejudice, finding that the plaintiff failed to present specific facts in a declaration as to why further responses should be compelled and why the documents requested will tend to prove or disprove a fact of consequence in this action.
