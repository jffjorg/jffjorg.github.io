1.     Motion to Compel Deposition
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion
to Compel Defendant to Attend and Produce Documents at Deposition, the Court
rules as follows.
 
          On
July 26, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with the Deposition Notice, noticing
the deposition for August 10, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. at 1230 Rosecrans Avenue,
Suite 200, Manhattan Beach, California 90266. 
(Decl. of Hutchins ¶5, Exh. B.)  The Deposition Notice specifies the materials
and documents required to be produced at deposition pursuant to C.C.P. §
2025.220(a)(4).  (Decl. Hutchins ¶5, Exh.
B.)  Defendant did not object to the
Deposition Notice, file a motion to stay the deposition, file a motion to quash
the Deposition Notice under C.C.P. §2025.410, or move for a Protective Order
under C.C.P. §2025.420 with respect to attendance, testimony, or the production
of documents at the deposition.  (Decl.
of Hutchins ¶6.)  Defendant did not
appear at the deposition or produce documents responsive to the Deposition
Notice.  (Decl. of Hutchins ¶7.)  On August 10, 2023, Plaintiff took a
Certificate of Nonappearance.  (Decl. of Hutchins
¶7, Exh. C.) 
On August 10, 2023, Plaintiff mailed a
letter via overnight U.S. mail to Defendant inquiring about his nonappearance
and requested a response by August 16, 2023, pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450(b)(2).
 (Decl. of Hutchins ¶8, Exh. D.) As of
the date of this hearing, Plaintiff has not heard from Defendant regarding this
inquiry.  (See Decl. of Hutchins
¶9.)
          The
Court grants the motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450(a) and orders Defendant
to appear for deposition and produce responsive documents in 20 days.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions
totaling $1,750 against Defendant. 
The Court awards sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450(g)(1) in the
amount of $1,250.00 calculated as follows:
(2.5 hours to prepare instant motion x $500.00/hour) = $1,250.00
The sanctions are payable by Defendant within 20 days of this order.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling. 
 
2.     Motion to
Compel FROG
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion to Compel Responses to FROGs,
the Court rules as follows.
          On April 26, 2023, Plaintiff
served FROG (Set One) on Defendant. 
(Decl. of Hutchins ¶4, Exh. A.)  Defendant
has not served responses to Plaintiff’s FROG. 
(Decl. of Hutchins ¶6.)   Plaintiff
now moves to compel responses.  
          The Court grants the
motion pursuant to C.C.P. § 2030.290(b) and orders Defendant to provide
verified responses to the interrogatories compliant with C.C.P. §§2030.210(a)
and 2030.220 without objections within 20 days of this order.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions totaling $1,600.00. 
          The
Court awards sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.290(c) in the amount of $.00,
calculated as follows:
(2.2 hours to prepare
instant motion x $500.00) = $1,100.00
The sanctions are payable by
Defendant within 20 days of this order.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling. 

 
3.     Motion to
Compel RFP
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion to Compel Responses to RFP,
the Court rules as follows.
          On April 26, 2023,
Plaintiff served RFP (Set One) on Defendant. 
(Decl. of Hutchins ¶4, Exh. A.) 
Defendant has not served responses to Plaintiff’s RFP.  (Decl. of Hutchins ¶6.)   Plaintiff now moves to compel
responses.  
          The Court grants the
motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2031.300(b) and orders Defendant to produce
responsive documents and provide verified responses to the requests for
production without objections within 20 days of this order.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions totaling $1,600.00. 
          In light of the fact that
the instant motion is substantively identical to Plaintiff’s motion to compel
FROGs, the Court declines to award sanctions.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.
