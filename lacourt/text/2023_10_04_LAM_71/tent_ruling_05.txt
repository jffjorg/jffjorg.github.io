Plaintiff Mir Rafiq (“Rafiq”) (“Plaintiff”) moves for this
Court to reconsider its December 20, 2022, order (“12/20/22
Ruling”) granting Defendants Mercedes-Benz USA LLC’s (“MBZ”) and Silver Star
A.G. Ltd.’s (“Silver Star”) (collectively, “Defendants”) motion to compel
arbitration.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2;
C.C.P. §1008(c).)  
 
Procedural Background
          On April 28,
2022, Plaintiff filed his operative complaint against Defendants alleging five
causes of action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Civil Code
§§1790 et seq. (“Song-Beverly”) and in common law tort: (1) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(d) [against MBZ];
(2) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(b) [against
MBZ]; (3) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(A)(3) [against MBZ];
(4) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability (Civ. Code §§1791.1, 1794,
1795.5) [against MBZ]; and (5) negligent repair [against Silver Star]
arising from Plaintiff’s March 15, 2020 entry into a warranty contract with MBZ
regarding a 2019 Mercedes GLE 63 [“Subject Vehicle”].
          On December
20, 2022, this Court granted Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration of
Plaintiff’s claims.  (12/20/22 Ruling.)
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on May 26, 2023. 
Defendant filed its opposition on September 21, 2023.  Plaintiff filed his reply on September 27,
2023.  
 
Motion for Reconsideration
C.C.P. §1008(c) provides, as follows: “If a court at
any time determines that there has been a change of law that warrants it to
reconsider a prior order it entered, it may do so on its own motion and enter a
different order.” 
(C.C.P. §1008(c).)
Defendants’ objection to Plaintiff’s motion as untimely
because it was not filed within 10 days of notice of entry of the 12/20/22
Ruling is unavailing.  In Malek v.
Blue Cross of California (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 44, the Court of
Appeal determined that a change in the law required the trial court to
reconsider its prior ruling compelling arbitration.  (Id. at pgs. 59-60.)  The Malek Court stated, “the progress
of the arbitration is not material when considering a change in the law
affecting whether the arbitral forum was a correct one.”  (Id. at pg. 60.)  
“If a court believes one of its prior interim orders was
erroneous, it should be able to correct that error no matter how it came to
acquire that belief. For example, nothing would prevent the losing party from
asking the court at a status conference to reconsider a ruling.  (See Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, supra, § 9:327.8, p.
9(1)–107.)  But a party may not file a
written motion to reconsider that has procedural significance
if it does not satisfy the requirements of section 437c, subdivision
(f)(2), or 1008. The court need not rule on any suggestion that it
should reconsider a previous ruling and, without more, another party would not
be expected to respond to such a suggestion.” 
(Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1108, as
modified (June 10, 2005).)  
          Plaintiff
requests this Court reconsider its 12/20/23 Ruling in light of the publication
of Yeh v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (Cal. Ct. App., Sept. 6, 2023, No.
A166537) 2023 WL 5741703; Kielar v. Superior Court of Placer
County (Cal. Ct. App., Aug. 16, 2023, No.
C096773) 2023 WL 5270559; Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 92
Cal.App.5th 958, review filed (Aug. 1, 2023); and Ford Motor Warranty
Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, review granted (July 19, 2023)
Here, the Court has been put on notice of new case law that
disagrees with Felisilda, the case on which this Court relied to grant
Defendants’ 12/20/22 Ruling.  Accordingly, the Court will sua sponte
reconsider its Order.
Parties are to submit
simultaneous briefs on November 20, 2023, regarding the new case law that
disagrees with Felisilda: Yeh, Kielar, Montemayor, and Ford Motor Warranty Cases.
Accordingly, the Court sua
sponte sets a hearing to reconsider Defendants’ motion to compel
arbitration for Friday, December 8, 2023, at 8:30 a.m.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is continued to Friday,
December 8, 2023, at 8:30 a.m.
The Court sua sponte sets a hearing to reconsider
Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration for Friday, December
8, 2023,
at 8:30 a.m.  Parties are to
submit simultaneous briefs on November 20, 2023.
Moving Party to
give notice.
