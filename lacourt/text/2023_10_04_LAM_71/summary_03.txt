## English Text Summary:

The judge has denied a request from Cross-Complainants Ari Resnik and ROAR Management Company for attorneys' fees. They sought fees related to their successful opposition to an Anti-SLAPP motion filed by Cross-Defendants, including Healthcare Management Associates, Inc. and others. 

The judge found that while Cross-Complainants were the prevailing party in the Anti-SLAPP motion, the motion itself wasn't entirely without merit. There were arguments on both sides, and reasonable attorneys could have disagreed on the validity of the motion. The judge also found that Cross-Complainants didn't convincingly demonstrate that the Anti-SLAPP motion was solely intended to delay the case.
