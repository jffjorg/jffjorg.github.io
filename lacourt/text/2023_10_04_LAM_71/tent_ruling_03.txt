Background
Plaintiff/Moving
Cross-Defendant HMA filed its complaint on March 29, 2022, individually and derivatively
on behalf of Healthcare Financial Solutions, LLC (“HFS”), against Defendants ROAR,
Resnik, and Non-Moving Defendant 11 Funding, LLC (“11 Funding”) (collectively, “Defendants”).
  Cross-Complainants filed their original
cross-complaint (“XC”) on May 16, 2022, alleging four causes of action against
Cross-Defendants HMA, Mary, and HFS. Cross-Complainants filed the operative
first amended cross-complaint (“FAXC”) on February 15, 2023, against
Cross-Defendants filed their Anti-SLAPP Motion on April 13, 2023, and the
joinder on May 9, 2023. 
Cross-Complainants filed their opposition May 18, 2023.  Cross-Defendants filed their replies on May
23, 2023.
On
June 5, 2023, this Court denied Cross-Defendants’ Anti-SLAPP motion to strike
portions of Cross-Complainants’ FAXC.
On
August 4, 2023, Cross-Complainants filed the instant motion for attorneys’
fees.  On September 18, 2023, HMA, Mary,
NIOM, and Orangewood filed their opposition. 
On September 18, 2023, Silva MD, Geli Silva, James, Starbase, AFI, filed
their opposition.  Cross-Complainants
filed their reply on September 25, 2023.
 
Discussion
C.C.P. §425.16(c)(1)
provides, in part, “if the court finds that a special motion to strike is
frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, the court shall
award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the
motion, pursuant to Section 128.5.”  “Section 128.5 . . . (b)(2) defines
‘frivolous’ as ‘(a) totally and completely without merit or (b) for the sole
purpose of harassing an opposing party.’” 
(Chitsazzadeh v. Kramer & Kaslow (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 676,
683, quoting C.C.P. §128.5.)  
“A motion is [frivolous] only if any
reasonable attorney would agree that the motion is totally devoid of merit.
This is an objective standard.”  (Id.
at pgs. 683-684, citing Moore v. Shaw (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 182, 199.)  “When a motion has partial merit, it is not
‘totally and completely’ without merit, nor can it be said that its ‘sole’
purpose is to harass.”  (Gerbosi v.
Gaims, Weil, W. & Epstein, LLP (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 435, 450.)   Further, if “reasonable attorneys could have
disagreed as to [the motion’s] merits…” and/or if there is “developing case law
surrounding . . . complex issues presented in the [motion],” a fees request
made by a party successfully opposing an anti-SLAPP motion must be denied.  (Area 51 Productions, Inc. v. City of
Alameda (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 581, 606.)
“Whether the sole purpose of the motion is to
harass an opposing party or the motion is solely intended
to cause unnecessary delay, in contrast, concerns the subjective motivation
of the moving defendant.”  (Chitsazzadeh,
199 Cal.App.4th at pg. 684, citing Wallis v. PHL
Associates, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 882, 893; Campbell v. Cal-Gard
Surety Services, Inc. (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 563, 574.)
Here, Cross-Complainant was the prevailing
party in the Anti-SLAPP Motion.  (See
6/5/23 Minute Order, pg. 10.)  However,
Cross-Defendants’ Anti-SLAPP motion was not frivolous, as a reasonable attorney
would not find the motion totally lacking in merit.  This Court considered each parties’ legal
positions and found merit to the case law in support of each argument.
Further, Cross-Complainants fail to
demonstrate Cross-Defendants’ anti-SLAPP motion was solely intended to cause
unnecessary delay by way of failure to provide discovery responses.  
Accordingly, Cross-Complainants’ motion for
attorneys’ fees is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
