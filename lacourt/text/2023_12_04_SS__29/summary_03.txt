And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling continues the petition to approve the minor's compromise, filed by Alyvia Lopez, to a future date in 2024. The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. The petitioner failed to address several issues identified by the court, including inconsistencies in the petition calculations, a blank field in Item 18(b)(2), a missing declaration for attorney's fees, and unclear retainer agreement signature. The court orders the petitioner to file an amended proposed order correcting these defects and gives notice to the moving party. The hearing is continued to allow the petitioner to address these issues.
