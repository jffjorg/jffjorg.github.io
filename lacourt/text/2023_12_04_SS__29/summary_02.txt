And here is the English-text summary:

The judge grants the motion to continue trial, which was filed by the defendant, Francisco Jose Maisch, on October 20, 2023. The motion was requested because the defendant has multiple discovery motions set for after the current trial date of March 13, 2024. The judge finds that good cause exists to continue the trial as the defendant's discovery motion hearing dates are set after the current trial date, and the plaintiff's counsel has not opposed the motion. The judge also notes that this is only the second continuance since the case was initiated, and that the continuance will not prejudice the plaintiff. Therefore, the judge grants the motion to continue trial and sets a new trial date in early June 2024, with the final status conference and all deadlines reset accordingly.
