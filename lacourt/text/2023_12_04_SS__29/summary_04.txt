And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court will hear argument on December 4, 2023, regarding Plaintiff Uyanga Tserenchimed's motion to compel deposition of Defendants Christophe Harbonville, Rasier LLC, and Rasier-CA LLC. The case arises from a vehicle accident on March 7, 2019, near Los Angeles International Airport. Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence, and Defendants filed an answer. Plaintiff served deposition notices, but Defendants objected to the notices. The court is unclear whether the depositions went forward on November 28, as noticed.

The court has questions for counsel regarding the motion to compel deposition, including whether the depositions went forward as noticed, whether there is evidence of a properly served deposition notice, a failure to appear, and an inquiry about the non-appearance. The court also questions why motion practice is necessary, as Plaintiff is still entitled to take the depositions of Defendants even if there is a procedural defect in the motion.

The court will consider the legal standard for taking depositions, including the requirements for serving deposition notices, the need for a party to appear for examination, and the consequences of failing to appear. The court will also consider the possibility of monetary sanctions and the need for a party to show good cause for the production of documents.

The tentative ruling sets out the court's questions for counsel and invites further briefing from the parties.
