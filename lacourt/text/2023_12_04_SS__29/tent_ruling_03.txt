 Case Number:  20STCV49186    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
The
Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad
litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call. 
 
On October
31, 2023, this matter was continued to allow Petitioner to address the identified
issues from in Court’s Minute Order. The issues were as follows:
 
1. Item 15 of the
petition lists the net balance of proceeds for the claimant $49,202.95 and Item
16(e) lists the total fees paid from proceeds of settlement or judgment
$64,947.30. However, calculations of the Item 16 section, i.e., the requested
attorney’s fees, medical expenses, and costs indicate that the net balance of
proceeds for the claimant should be $49,229.95 and total fees paid from
proceeds of settlement or judgment should be $65,770.05. This inconsistency
must be remedied; 
 
2. Item 18(b)(2)
the amount of the settlement proceeds to be deposited in the insured blocked
account is left blank; 
 
3. Petitioner did
not provide a declaration in support of the attorney’s fees requested pursuant
to Cal. Rules of Court (CRC), Rule 7.955(c). Further, the retainer agreement
only supports a fee of 40% for minors gross settlement amount, the amount
requested is 45% of the gross settlement proceeds. In addition, it is unclear
whether the guardian ad litem signed or approved the retainer agreement; 
 
4. Petitioner did
not submit a proposed order approving the petition on form MC-351; 
 
5. Petitioner did
not submit a proposed order for deposit of funds in compliance with CRC, Rule
7.953.
 
Counsel filed a new MC-351 and MC-355 on
November 1, 2023. Counsel did not address the other issues.
 
 
Accordingly,
Petitioner’s Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise (Alyvia Lopez, Age 9) is
CONTINUED to ________________________________________ _____, 2024. 
 
Counsel
is ordered to file an amended proposed order approving the compromise
correcting the above-identified defects. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
