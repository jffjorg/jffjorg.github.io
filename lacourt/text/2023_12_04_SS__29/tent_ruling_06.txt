 Case Number:  22STCV02254    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE

The Demurrer of Defendant The Giving Tree, LLC is OVERRULED.
The Motion to Strike is GRANTED with
leave to amend.
Background
This
case arises out of injuries suffered by Plaintiff Austin Parnell (“Plaintiff’) on
September 17, 2021.  Plaintiff alleges
that while he was in a rehabilitation facility, and had a known high risk of
suicide, he was allowed to access the second floor of the facility; he then jumped
from a balcony, sustaining severe and permanent injuries.
On
January 19, 2022, Plaintiff filed the complaint in this action asserting a
single cause of action for negligence against Defendants Aaron Barsalou;
Psyclarity Health Inc., LLC (“Psyclarity”); The Giving Tree LLC; Goldwing Recovery
Co.; and Does 1 through 100.
On March
20, 2022, Defendants Aaron Barsalou and Psyclarity filed an answer to the
complaint.
On
August 10, 2022, the Court, at the request of Plaintiff, dismissed all claims
against Goldwing Recovery Co. without prejudice.
On November
3, 2023, Defendant The Giving Tree LLC (“Defendant”) filed this demurrer and
motion to strike.  Plaintiff filed his
oppositions on November 17, and Defendant filed its replies on November 30.
Legal Standard
A
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint (or other pleading) and
raises only issues of law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) The Court may
consider only the allegations of the pleading (including exhibits) and
judicially noticeable matters.  (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116
Cal.App.4th at p. 994; Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.)
 The Court must accept as true all
properly pleaded facts appearing in the complaint.  (Donabedian, supra, 116
Cal.App.4th at p. 994; Barnett v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 500, 505.)
A motion
to strike challenges “any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading” or “all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.)  In ruling on a motion to
strike, the court must assume the truth of the properly pleaded facts in the
complaint or other pleading.  (Turman v. Turning
Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
Before
filing a demurrer and/or a motion to strike, the demurring or moving party must
meet and confer with the opposing party. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41(a), 435.5(a).)
Meet and Confer
Defendant
satisfied the statutory meet and confer requirements.  (Floratos Decls., ¶ 13.)
Discussion
Demurrer to Negligence Cause of Action 
Defendant demurs to the sole cause of action in the
complaint, for negligence.  Defendant’s
primary argument is that Plaintiff’s own allegations state that his injury occurred
after he left the facility operated by Defendant and while he was at a facility
operated by Defendant Psyclarity.  (See
Complaint, ¶ 15.)
Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant and Psyclarity are “sister
facilities,” both owned and operated by Defendant Barsalou, who served as Chief
Operating Officer of both entities.  (Complaint,
¶¶ 6, 14.)  And Plaintiff alleges that at
the time of the accident, Plaintiff was “under the care of” Psyclarity “and/or”
Defendant “and its staff.”  
The Court must take these allegations as true.  Plaintiff is entitled to plead in the alternative,
and the allegations in the Complaint state facts that, if true, are sufficient
to constitute a cause of action against Defendant.
Defendant’s demurrer to the cause of action for
negligence is OVERRULED.
Demurrer to Request for Punitive Damages 
A demurrer is not an appropriate pleading to challenge one
element of a prayer for relief; a demurrer may be sustained only when it
disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
A party challenging a request for punitive damages may do
so by way of a motion to strike, which Defendant has in fact filed.
Accordingly, the demurrer to the request for punitive damages
is OVERRULED on procedural grounds, not on the merits, and without prejudice to
any challenge by way of a motion to strike.
Motion to Strike 
Plaintiff asserts a cause of action against Defendant for
negligence.  Plaintiff also requests punitive
damages.  (Complaint, at p. 4:20, Prayer
for Relief, second item numbered 4.) 
Defendant moves to strike that request.
“‘In
order to state a prima facie claim for punitive damages, a complaint must set
forth the elements as stated in the general punitive damage statute, Civil Code
section 3294.’ (Citation.)” (Today IV’s Inc. v. Los Angeles County MTA
(2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 1137, 1193.) Civil Code section 3294 provides that on non-contract
causes of action, plaintiffs may recover punitive damages when they prove “by
clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression,
fraud, or malice” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).)  
“Oppression”
is defined as “despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust
hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights.”  (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(2).)  “Fraud” is defined as “an intentional
misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the
defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving
a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.” (Civ.
Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(3).)  “Malice” is
defined as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the
plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a
willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”  (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(1).)  The term “despicable,” which is used
in the definition of “oppression” and “malice” refers to actions that are
“base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (See, e.g., Shade Foods, Inc. v.
Innovative Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal. App. 4th
847, 891.) In general, punitive damages
are appropriate if the defendant's acts are reprehensible, fraudulent or in
blatant violation of law or policy. (American Airlines, Inc. v. Sheppard,
Mullin, Richter & Hampton (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1017.)
To
show that a defendant acted with “willful and conscious disregard of the rights
or safety of others,” it is not enough to establish negligence, gross
negligence or even recklessness. (Dawes v. Super. Ct. (1980) 111 Cal.
App. 3d 82, 87.) Rather, a plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating that “the
defendant acted in such an outrageous and reprehensible manner that the jury
could infer that he knowingly disregarded the substantial certainty of injury
to others.” (Id. at p. 90). Further, the allegations must be sufficient
for a reasonable jury to conclude that defendant’s conduct was “despicable,”
defined as “base, vile or contemptible.” (College
Hosp., Inc. v. Super. Ct. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 725.)
In a complaint, the plaintiff must allege specific facts showing
that the defendant has been guilty of malice,
oppression or fraud. (Id. at p. 721.) The basis for punitive damages
must be pleaded with particularity; conclusory allegations devoid of any
factual assertions are insufficient. (Smith v. Super. Ct. (1992) 10
Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.; see also Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc.
v. Snepp (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 598, 643.) 
The Court has
reviewed the Complaint and the arguments of each side and concludes that the Complaint
fails to state facts with sufficient particularity to support a claim against Defendant
for the recovery of punitive damages.  The Complaint states facts that are sufficient
to constitute a cause of action against Defendant for negligence, but that
alone is not enough to recover punitive damages.
The Court grants Plaintiff leave to amend.  Based on the arguments made by Plaintiff in
his opposition to the motion, there is at least some reasonable possibility
that he will be able to allege facts, with sufficient particularity, that would
(if proven) establish that Defendant engaged in conduct that meets the test for
oppression, fraud, or malice.  (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
349.)
