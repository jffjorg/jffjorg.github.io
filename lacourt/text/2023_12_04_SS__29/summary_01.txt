And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to continue trial in the case of Asher Kashanchi vs. Kristopher Barnachea and Christine Rehfeldt. The motion was filed by the defendants, who claimed that their assigned trial attorney, Yvonne Birch, had a replacement hip surgery scheduled for October 31, 2023, and would not be available to return to work until January 2024 at the earliest. The defendants requested a continuance to May 20, 2024. The court found that the defendants had established good cause for continuing the trial, as their counsel would be medically unavailable. The plaintiff's counsel did not oppose the motion, and the court recognized that the continuance would not prejudice the plaintiff. Therefore, the court granted the motion to continue trial, resetting the deadlines and Final Status Conference to the new trial date.
