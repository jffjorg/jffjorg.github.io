  Case Number:  20STCV07010    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
The
motion to continue trial is GRANTED.
Background
This arises from an auto accident that
occurred on December 16, 2018, between Plaintiff Asher Kashanchi (“Plaintiff”)
and Defendant Kristopher Barnachea.  Plaintiff
filed this action on February 21, 2020, asserting a cause of action for
negligence against Defendant. 
Plaintiff amended his complaint on April 13, 2020,
to add Defendant Christine Rehfeldt.
Defendants filed this Motion to Continue
Trial on October 19, 2023. This motion was original set to be heard on November
17, 2023, but was continued to December 4, 2023. Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition to this motion.
FSC is scheduled for January 11, 2024; Trial
is set for January 25, 2024.
Legal
Standard
Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the
court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make
them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance
should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue,
Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide
latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of
continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12,
18.) 
Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative
showing of good cause requiring the continuance.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets forth a list of
non-exhaustive factors to be analyzed when determining whether good cause for a
trial continuance is present. A court considers factors such as: (1) the
proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance,
extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party; (3) the prejudice that
parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (4) any
other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).)
Discussion
Defendants contend good cause exists to
continue the trial date as the assigned trial attorney, Yvonne Birch, had a
replacement hip surgery scheduled for October 31, 2023, and will not be
available to return to work until January 2024 at the earliest. (Declaration of
Yvonne Birch, ¶
3-6.) Further, the other
attorneys at Ms. Birch’s firm are not prepared to bring the case on her behalf,
as she has been the sole attorney working on this case. (Declaration of Yvonne
Birch, ¶ 8.) Defendants
request a continuance to May 20, 2024. (Declaration of Yvonne Birch, ¶
10.)
The Court finds that Defendants have
established good cause for continuing trial as Defendants counsel is medically
unavailable for trial. Further, Plaintiff’s counsel has not opposed this
motion; the Court recognizes the continuance will thus not prejudice Plaintiff.
Therefore, the Court will GRANT the motion.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
the motion to continue trial. Trial is continued to late May 2024.  The Final Status Conference and all deadlines
are reset based on the new trial date. 
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
