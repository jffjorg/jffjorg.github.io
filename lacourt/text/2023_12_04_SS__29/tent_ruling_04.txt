 Case Number:  21STCV08164    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  29 Tentative
The Court will hear argument.
Background
This case arises out of an alleged
vehicle accident on March 7, 2019 near Los Angeles International Airport
Terminal 6. Plaintiff Uyanga Tserenchimed ("Plaintiff") filed the
complaint in this action on March 2, 2021, asserting causes of action for motor
vehicle negligence and general negligence against Defendants
Christophe Harbonville, Rasier LLC, Rasier-CA, LLC, and Does 1 through 50.
 
On June 7, 2021, Defendants Christopher
Harbonville (erroneously sued as Christophe Harbonville), Rasier LLC, and Rasier-CA,
LLC each filed an answer.
 
On May 18, 2022, James River
Insurance Company, the insurer for Defendant Christopher Harbonville, filed a
complaint in intervention.
 
After two prior attempts, Plaintiff
served an amended notice of the deposition of Rasier-CA, LLC, on August 10,
2023, setting the deposition for 10 am on August 18, identifying six areas of
examination, and requesting the production of 52 categories of documents.  (Bazarjian Decl., ¶ 8 & Exh. 5.) Plaintiff
also served a second deposition, also setting the deposition of Rasier-CA, LLC
(but possibly intended to be Rasier LLC) for 1 pm on August 18, also with six
areas of examination and 52 requests for the production of documents.  (Ibid.)
 
On August 11, 2023, Rasier LLC and Rasier-CA, LLC (“Defendants”)
each served objections to the deposition notices.  (Id., ¶ 9 & Exh. 6.) 
 
The depositions apparently did not go forward on August
18.  According to Defense counsel, Plaintiff’s
counsel took the depositions off calendar. 
(Mendelson Decl., ¶ 12.)  On August
18, counsel for the Defendants sent a meet-and-confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel.  (Bazarjian Decl.,
¶¶ 10-11 & Exh. 7.)  On August 21, Plaintiff’s
counsel sent an email requesting deposition dates.  (Id., ¶ 12 & Exh. 8.)  Further correspondence between counsel
occurred on August 21 and 22.  (Id.,
¶¶ 12-13 & Exhs. 8 and 9.)  On
August 30, Defense counsel offered a deposition date of November 7.  (Id., ¶ 14 & Exh. 10.)  On September 20, Defense counsel offered deposition
dates of November 28 or 29.  (Mendelson
Decl., ¶ 18 & Exh. 19.)  Further
email correspondence did not resolve the dispute.  Plaintiff did renotice the depositions (at
least as to some of the categories) for November 28.  (Id., ¶ 28 & Exhs. 28 and 29.)  
 
The Court has not been advised regarding whether the depositions
went forward on November 28.
 
Plaintiff filed the Motion to Compel Deposition of the
Person Most Qualified for Raiser, LLC  and
Rasier-CA, LLC (“Defendants”) on September 25, 2023.  Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions.  Defendants filed their opposition and request
for sanctions on November 17, 2023. Plaintiff filed the reply on November 27,
2023.
 
Legal Standard
“Any party may obtain discovery … by
taking in California the oral deposition of any person, including any party to
the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the requirements for (among other
things) what must be included in a deposition notice, when and where
depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice must be served.  
“The service of a deposition notice …
is effective to require any deponent who is a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party to attend and to
testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing for inspection and copying.” 
(Id., § 2025.280, subd. (a).)
Section 2025.230 provides: “If the
deponent named is not a natural person, the deposition notice shall describe
with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is
requested.  In that event, the deponent
shall designate and produce at the deposition those of its officers, directors,
managing agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to testify on its
behalf as to those matters to the extent of any information known or reasonably
available to the deponent.”  
Section 2025.410, subdivision (a),
requires any party to serve a written objection at least three days before the
deposition if the party contends that a deposition notice does not comply with
the provisions of sections 2025.210 through 2025.280.
“If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or
a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid
objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.”  (Id.,  §
2025.450, subd. (a).)  Any such motion to compel must show good
cause for the production of documents and, when a deponent has failed to
appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (b).)  “Implicit in the requirement that counsel contact
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance is a requirement that counsel
listen to the reasons offered and make a good faith attempt to resolve the
issue,” including by rescheduling. (Leko v. Cornerstone Bldg. Inspection
Serv. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1124. See
also L.A.S.C.L.R. 3.26, Appendix 3.A(e) (reasonable consideration should be
given to accommodating schedules in setting depositions).) 
When a motion to compel is granted, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)  
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section
2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to
include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
Discussion
The Court has
questions for counsel.
1.     
Did the depositions go forward as
noticed on November 28?  If so, what
disputes (if any) remain?
 
2.     
To grant a motion to compel a
deposition, the Court must have evidence of the following: (a) a properly served
deposition notice; (b) the absence of a valid objection; (c) a failure to
appear; and (d) an inquiry about the non-appearance.  That is what the statute contemplates.  Is there such evidence here?
 
3.     
Even if there is a procedural defect
in the motion, Plaintiff is still entitled to take the depositions of Defendants.  Why is motion practice necessary?
