 Case Number:  20STCV15518    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
The
motion to continue trial is GRANTED.
Background
This arises from an auto accident that
occurred on April 25, 2018, between Plaintiff Brad Bello (“Plaintiff”) and Defendant
Francisco Jose Maisch (“Defendant”).  Plaintiff
filed this action on April 23, 2020, asserting a cause of action for Motor
Vehicle Negligence against Defendant. 
Defendant filed this Motion to Continue Trial
on October 20, 2023. This motion was original set to be heard on November 17,
2023, but was continued to December 4, 2023. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition
to this motion.
FSC is scheduled for February 28, 2024; Trial
is set for March 13, 2024.
Legal
Standard
Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the
court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make
them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance
should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue,
Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide
latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of
continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12,
18.) 
Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative
showing of good cause requiring the continuance.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets forth a list of
non-exhaustive factors to be analyzed when determining whether good cause for a
trial continuance is present. A court considers factors such as: (1) the
proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance,
extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party; (3) the prejudice that
parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (4) any
other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).)
Discussion
Here, Defendant Francisco Jose Maisch (hereafter
“Defendant”) moves to continue trial to a date after Defendants Motions to
Compel currently scheduled for April 3, 2024. Defendant states that the Final
Status Conference (“FSC”) is set for February 28, 2024, and the
discovery-motion cut-off date is February 12, 2024. (Declaration of Danielle D.
Mittskus at ¶ 2.)
Defendant contends good cause exists to
continue the trial date as he has multiple discovery motions set in this matter
for after the trial date. (Id., ¶ 3.)
Defendant’s to discovery motions are currently set for March 27, 2024, and
April 3, 2024. (Id.) Defendant attempted to have these motion hearings
advanced, but this request was denied without prejudice. (Id., ¶ 4.)
Defendant states this is the second request
for continuance; the trial was continued from June 23, 2023, to March 13, 2024,
by stipulation on March 1, 2023. (Id., ¶ 6.) The original trial date was October 21, 2021; however it was vacated
by the Court. (Id.) 
The Court finds that Defendants have
established good cause for continuing trial as Defendant's discovery motion
hearing dates are set after the current trial date. Further, Plaintiff’s
counsel has not opposed this motion; the Court recognizes the continuance will
thus not prejudice Plaintiff. This is also only the second continuance since
this case was initiated. 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
the motion to continue trial. Trial is continued to early June 2024.  The Final Status Conference and all deadlines
are reset based on the new trial date. 
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
