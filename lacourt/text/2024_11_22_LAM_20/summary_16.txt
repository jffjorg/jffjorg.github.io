And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a habitability matter involving the Bitri family and the Hoh family. The Hoh family has filed a motion to file a cross-complaint against the Grant Park East Homeowners Association (HOA) for indemnity, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief, alleging that the HOA is actually liable for the Bitri family's damages. The judge has determined that the proposed cross-complaint is permissive, not compulsory, and has denied the motion to file the cross-complaint. The judge has exercised discretion in making this decision, taking into account that a trial preference has already been granted and that the proposed cross-complaint is not related to the original claims.
