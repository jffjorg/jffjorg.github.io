And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Riko Wiemer International, LLC and Riko Weimer against Jeremy Pfau. The defendants have alleged that Jeremy's parents, Bruce and Amy Pfau, were involved in a conspiracy to aid Jeremy in his wage and hour complaints and settlement, and that Jeremy's own actions were fraudulent. The judge has ruled that the defendants' claims of fraud and abuse of process are defective and have sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The judge has also ruled that the defendants' claim of breach of a duty of loyalty is barred by Business and Professions Code section 16600, which prohibits an employee from engaging in a competing business. Finally, the judge has ruled that the defendants' claim under the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) is derivative of the other unsuccessful claims and has failed to plead a right to restitution or an injunction. The judge has granted the defendants' request for judicial notice and has ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
