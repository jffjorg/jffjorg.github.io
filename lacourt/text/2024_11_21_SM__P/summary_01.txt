And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a Tentative Ruling in the case of Amin v. Ahadi, Case No. 21SMCV00348. The Plaintiff, Amin, is seeking terminating and monetary sanctions against the Defendants, Ahadi and Askar, for their failure to comply with court orders and discovery requests. The Defendants failed to respond to the Plaintiff's special interrogatories and request for production, and ignored the court's order to produce discovery and attend a deposition.

The Court finds that the Defendants' actions demonstrate a willful disobedience of the court's orders and that lesser sanctions will not suffice. The Court grants the Plaintiff's request for terminating sanctions, striking the Defendants' second amended cross-complaint and answer, and entering default against both Defendants.

The Court also grants the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions of $1,420.00, which includes $2.2 hours spent preparing the motion and 1 hour for the hearing at $425/hour, plus $60 in filing costs. The Plaintiff is to pay these sanctions within 30 days.
