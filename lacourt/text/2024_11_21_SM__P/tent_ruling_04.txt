Assil v. Whole Foods Market
California, Inc., Case no. 24SMCV03285
Hearing date November 21, 2024
Defendant
Berlin Packaging’s Motion to Strike Punitive Damages
Plaintiff
Assil sues Whole Foods Market California, Inc., Sol-Ti, Inc. and Berlin
Packaging LLC for injuries sustained when a bottle of “SuperAde” beverage manufactured
and sold by defendants exploded in her hand. Defendant Berlin Packaging moves
to strike the request for punitive damages. 
Punitive
damages are allowable only when plaintiff proves oppression, fraud or malice.
Cal. Civ. Code §3294(a). Facts giving rise to a claim for punitive damages must
be pleaded specifically – vague or conclusory allegations are insufficient. G.D.
Searle & Company v. Superior Court (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 22, 29. Conclusory
requests for punitive damages without factual support are subject to a motion
to strike. E.g., Cyrus v. Haveson (1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 306,
316-317; Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.
Recklessness or negligence, even gross negligence, are insufficient to support
an award of punitive damage – carelessness or ignorance are not enough. Dawes
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 82, 88. On a motion to strike, the
allegations in a pleading must be treated as true. E.g., Clauson v.
Sup. Ct. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.
Defendant
argues plaintiff fails to satisfy the pleading standard for punitive damages. For
punitive damages to be awarded in a product liability action, it must be shown
that defendant “placed a product on the market in conscious disregard of the
safety of consumers and others.” Ehrhardt v. Brunswick, Inc. (1986) 186
Cal.App.3d 734, 741. To seek punitive damages based on a conscious disregard of
the safety of others, plaintiff must allege facts showing defendant was “aware
of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully
and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Butte
Fire Cases (2018) 24 Cal. App. 5th 1150, 1159.

Plaintiff
alleges: (1) “defendant designed and manufactured the bottle, safety mechanism,
cap, seal, labels, and other packaging material” (compl., para. 10); (2) “defendant
transported, stored, and/or maintained the bottle prior to defendant Whole
Foods taking possession of it” (Id., para. 11); (3) “defendant knew
and/or should have known that the bottle was dangerous for use, yet still
negligently allowed it to be placed into the stream of commerce. As a result of
said conduct, the bottle was not appropriate for use and the purposes for which
it was intended, and it was likely to injure people. The unreasonable and
dangerous conditions created by the conduct of defendant were not made known to
plaintiff and no warnings or inadequate warnings were provided by defendant” (Id.,
para 29); (4) the product “was unreasonably dangerous because its use carried
with it the significantly high risk of exploding, a danger that has been
confirmed and known to defendants,” (Id., para. 37); and (5) “as a
legal, direct, and proximate result of defendant willfully and deliberately and
with a conscious disregard of the safety of the public placed said product on
the market without remedying or warning of the known defects in spite of and
without making known the aforesaid knowledge gained from their research and
testing. This conscious disregard for safety constitutes malice, oppression,
and fraud under California Civil Code §3294, entitling plaintiff to punitive
damages.” (Id., para 42).
Plaintiff
sufficiently alleged defendant knew or should have known the dangers posed by
the bottle as a result of defendant’s internal testing. Compl. paras. 23, 37, 42
and 45. Plaintiff further alleged defendant failed to avoid the consequences of
those dangers by placing the bottle in the stream of commerce without adequate
warnings. Compl. para. 42. This is sufficient to survive a motion to strike
under Butte, supra.
Defendant
argues where punitive damages are sought against a corporate defendant, “the
advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act
of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or
managing agent of the corporation.” Code Civ. Proc., § 3294(b). Plaintiff fails
to allege advance knowledge or malice on the part of any particular officer or
managing agent of defendant. Plaintiff does not address this requirement in
opposition. This is a statutory requirement under California law when seeking
punitive damages from a defendant corporation. 
Plaintiff
alleged malice but failed to attribute such to a corporate officer. Plaintiff
requests leave to amend in the alternative. As plaintiff has not yet amended
the complaint, it is equitable to allow plaintiff to amend the pleading to
specify a corporate officer if possible. “When the defect which justifies
striking a complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave to
amend.” Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768.
GRANTED
with leave to amend.
