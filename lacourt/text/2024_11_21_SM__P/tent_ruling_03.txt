Price v. Entravision Communications
Corp., Case no. 24SMCV02630
Hearing date November 21, 2024
Defendant
Entravision Communications’ Demurrer to the Complaint
Plaintiff
Price sues defendant Entravision Communications Corp. for violations of the
California Trap and Trace Law (Cal. Penal Code §638.51) arising from
defendant’s alleged use of information collection software (“TikTok software”)
on its website. Defendant demurs, arguing the complaint fails to allege facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
“The
function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter
of law.” Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th
1413, 1420. A complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than
evidentiary facts,” Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
550, but plaintiff must allege essential facts “with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the] defendant with the nature,
source and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim. Doheny Park Terrace Homeowners
Ass’n., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099.
Defendant
argues plaintiff fails to allege that her data was collected. Plaintiff
alleges: (1) defendant operates TikTok software on its website (Complaint paras.
1 and 11); (2) the TikTok software collects data from every visitor of the website
(Complaint paras. 12 – 17); and (3) plaintiff visited the website on January 7,
2024 (Complaint para. 2). Plaintiff’s allegations that defendant collects data
from every visitor to its website and she visited that website establish her
claim for unlawful collection of private data.
Defendant
next argues plaintiff has not pleaded use of a pen register as required by
Penal Code §638.51 per Application of U.S. of Am. For an Ord. Authorizing
Use of a Cellular Tel. Digital Analyzer (C.D. Cal. 1995) 885 F. Supp. 197. Plaintiff
argues defendant’s reliance on federal law is misplaced and distinguishable and
“Neither CIPA nor the modern version of the federal statutes cited in Digital
Analyzer limit the definition of ‘pen register’ or ‘trap and trace device’ to
physical devices attached to telephone lines. Instead, these provisions
currently define pen register and trap and trace as a ‘device or process’
without referencing physical attachment to anything. (See Pen. Code, § 638.50;
18 U.S.C. § 3127.)” Heiting v. Taylor Fresh Foods, Inc. (July 28, 2024)
L.A. Sup Court Case No. 24STCV12891 at p. 4. No allegation of a physical pen
register device is necessary.
Defendant
argues it is an electronic communications service provider within the meaning
of Penal Code §638.51, so is exempt from liability. Penal Code §638.51(b)(1)
states: “(b) A provider of electronic or wire communication service may use a
pen register or a trap and trace device for any of the following purposes: (1)
To operate, maintain, and test a wire or electronic communication service.” 
Plaintiff
argues whether defendant is exempt is a question of fact, not suitable for the
court to determine on demurrer, where all allegations must be taken as true. The
court agrees.
Defendant
argues plaintiff failed to plead the use of a device or process as required by
Penal Code §638.51. Plaintiff alleges “The TikTok Software is a process to
identify the source of electronic communication by capturing incoming
electronic impulses and identifying dialing, routing, addressing and signaling
information generated by users, who are never informed that the Website is
collaborating with the Chinese government to obtain their phone number and other identifying
information.” Compl. para. 19. This is sufficient to allege existence and use
of a process under Penal Code §638.51.
Defendant
argues punitive damages should be dismissed because plaintiff failed to plead
oppression, fraud or malice. Plaintiff argues a reasonable jury could find
defendant’s conduct of engaging in purported criminal activity is vile or
contemptible and that intentionally invading consumers’ privacy without their
knowledge or consent was done with willful and conscious disregard to the
privacy rights of website visitors. 
Further,
courts routinely hold that there is no cause of action for punitive damages, so
punitive damages are not subject to demurrers. See, e.g., Grieves v.
Superior Ct. (1984) 157 Cal. App. 3d 159, 163. The proper method of
challenging a prayer for punitive damages is a motion to strike.
