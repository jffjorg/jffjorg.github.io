Amin v. Ahadi, Case no. 21SMCV00348
Hearing date November 21, 2024
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Terminating and Monetary Sanctions
Plaintiffs
Amin and Primex Entertainment bring a breach of contract claim against
defendants Ahadi and Askar, alleging failure to repay money owed for two loans
totaling $40,000. Defendants filed a second amended cross-complaint 12/30/21. Ahadi
was served 7/12/23 with Amin’s special interrogatories, and both defendants
with his request for production. Min. Order 9/16/24. Amin also served notice of
continued depositions. Id. Defendants failed to respond to Amin’s
discovery, and the court ordered defendants to produce discovery and granted
monetary sanctions totaling $1,479.50. Id. 
Plaintiffs
now move for terminating and financial sanctions, asserting defendants failed
to comply with the court’s 9/16/24 order. No opposition was filed.
Where
a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose
terminating, issue, evidentiary or monetary sanctions. E.g., Code Civ. Proc. §§
2023.010(g), 2030.290(c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495. Terminating sanctions are authorized where the
evidence shows less severe sanctions will not be successful in compelling
responses. Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,
279-280. Courts may require financial reimbursement for expenses incurred as to
misuse of the discovery process. Code Civ. Proc., §2023.030; Deyo v.
Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 789, superseded by statute on another
ground as stated in Guzman v. General Motors Corp. (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d
438, 444; In re Marriage of Niklas (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 28, 37.
The
court previously ordered defendants to produce discovery. Min. Order 9/16/24. Defendants
failed to respond to the ordered written discovery, attend the deposition or
pay the ordered sanctions. Decl. Jen paras. 7-10. Defendants ignored
plaintiffs’ meet and confer attempts. Decl. Jen para. 11.
Defendants’
failure to comply with the court’s order even after the court issued monetary
sanctions demonstrate lesser sanctions will not suffice. Defendants’ failure to
oppose the instant motion further demonstrates defendants’ unwillingness to
engage in the litigation process. Plaintiffs have been attempting to depose
defendants and conduct discovery for over two years to no avail, causing cost
and prejudice to plaintiffs. See Decl. Jen. Defendants repeatedly demonstrated
that lesser sanctions will not suffice, necessitating terminating sanctions.
Plaintiffs
request terminating sanctions striking defendants’ second amended
cross-complaint and defendants’ answer and that the court enter default against
both defendants. Plaintiffs also request monetary sanctions of $1,420.00 for
2.2 hours spent preparing the motion and 1 hour for the hearing at $425/hour,
including $60 in filing costs. Decl. Jen paras. 12-14. The requested sanctions
are reasonable and will be granted. 
GRANTED;
monetary sanctions payable within 30 days.
