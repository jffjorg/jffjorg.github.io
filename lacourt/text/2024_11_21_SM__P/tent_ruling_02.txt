Halimi v. Jaisinghani, Case no. 24SMCV01101
Hearing date November 21, 2024
Defendant
Jaisinghani’s Demurrer to the Complaint
Plaintiff
Halimi sues defendant Jaisinghani for failure to pay for legal services.
Defendant demurs, arguing failure to state a cause of action.
“The
function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter
of law.” Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th
1413, 1420. A complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than
evidentiary facts,” Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
550, but plaintiff must allege essential facts “with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the] defendant with the nature,
source and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim. Doheny Park Terrace Homeowners
Ass’n., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099.
The
elements of a breach of contract COA are a valid contract, performance, breach
and damages. A valid contract consists of an offer and an acceptance. Absent
any of these elements, a breach of contract claim fails. Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186. CACI 300, et seq.
Defendant
argues plaintiff fails to allege existence of a contract. Plaintiff alleges (1)
plaintiff and defendant entered into a written agreement for legal services (Compl.,
para. 5), and (2) plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral agreement that attorney
Azrin would associate in with plaintiff while representing defendant (Compl.,
para. 6). This is sufficient to establish existence of a contract at the
demurrer stage.
Defendant
argues plaintiff fails to allege either offer and acceptance or performance as
to the alleged oral agreement regarding Azrin’s services. Plaintiff alleges a
written agreement between the parties and provides a supplemental declaration,
including the written agreement (exhibit A) and the oral agreement as to
Azrin’s services. Plaintiff alleges performance under both the written and oral
agreements. Compl., paras 6-8. However, defendant is correct that plaintiff failed
to allege offer or acceptance with regards to the alleged oral agreement to
associate in counsel Azrin. 
Regarding
damages, defendant argues plaintiff fails to substantiate his claim for
$324,000. Plaintiff provides the fee agreement establishing his hourly rate (Decl.
Supp. Compl. ex. A) and alleges the value of his services is $324,000. Compl.
paras. 8-9, and 13. Defendant argues plaintiff fails to demonstrate actual
harm. Plaintiff alleged he provided services, which were worth $324,000 (Compl.
paras. 9, 13), and defendant failed to pay. Compl. paras. 10, 14. This is
sufficient to establish damages at the demurrer stage, where all facts alleged
must be accepted as true.
SUSTAINED
with 15 days leave to amend as to offer and acceptance regarding the oral
contract regarding the association of Azrin.
