Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Halimi v. Jaisinghani, Case No. 24SMCV01101. The Defendant, Jaisinghani, has filed a demurrer to the Complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff, Halimi, fails to state a cause of action. The Judge has reviewed the Complaint and finds that it is sufficient to establish a breach of contract claim. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to pay for legal services, which were valued at $324,000. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to establish the existence of a contract, performance, and damages.

However, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff failed to allege offer and acceptance regarding the oral agreement to associate in counsel Azrin. The Judge grants the Defendant 15 days to amend the demurrer to address this issue.

In summary, the Judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the offer and acceptance regarding the oral contract regarding the association of Azrin.
