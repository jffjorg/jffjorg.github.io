And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion to tax costs filed by the Plaintiff, Rosevianney C. Ogumsi, against the Defendant, Richard Dale Gentile, D.D.S. The Defendant had filed a motion for summary judgment and obtained a judgment in his favor, and then filed a memorandum of costs. The Plaintiff is seeking to strike certain costs claimed by the Defendant, including expert witness fees, records subpoena service fees, attorney service fees, and jury fees.

The Judge rules that the Plaintiff's motion to strike the expert witness fees of $3,060 is granted, as there is no indication from the record that the expert witness was ordered by the Court or that an offer to compromise was made. The Judge also denies the Plaintiff's motion to strike the costs for records subpoena service and attorney service, as these costs are recoverable under the statute and appear to be reasonable in amount. The Judge also denies the Plaintiff's motion to strike the jury fees, as they are expressly recoverable by statute.

The Judge orders that the Plaintiff's motion to tax costs is granted in part, and that the amount taxed from the Defendant's memorandum of costs is $3,306, leaving $5,705.32 as recoverable costs. The Judge notes that the parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to submit, and that if the parties do not receive a submission from all other parties, they should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.
