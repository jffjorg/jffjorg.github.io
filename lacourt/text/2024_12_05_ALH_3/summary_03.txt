And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions made by the plaintiff, Rogue Credit Union, against the defendant, Elizabeth Telfair Rivas. The plaintiff served the requests for admissions on June 24, 2024, and the defendant did not respond. The plaintiff filed the motion on August 28, 2024, and the defendant did not oppose it.

The judge is granting the motion because the defendant did not respond to the requests for admissions and it does not appear that the defendant has served substantially compliant responses before the hearing. The judge is also not imposing monetary sanctions on the defendant because the plaintiff did not request them.

The judge notes that the court may impose monetary sanctions on the defendant for failing to respond to the requests for admissions, but the plaintiff did not include a request for sanctions in its notice of motion or memorandum of points and authorities. The judge is giving notice to the parties that they must send an email to the court indicating whether they intend to submit on the tentative ruling.
