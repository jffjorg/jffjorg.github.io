ANALYSIS:  
 
On April 29, 2015, Petitioner
Western Progressive, LLC (“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition and
Declaration Regarding Unresolved Claims and Deposit of Undistributed Surplus
Proceeds of Trustee’s Sale (the “Petition”) with respect to the real property
located at 4420 West 62nd Street, Los Angeles, California (“the subject
property”). (Pet., ¶2.) The Surplus
Proceeds, in the amount of $10,809.20, were deposited with the Court on
November 12, 2015. On November 9, 2016, the Court set a hearing regarding
disbursement of the Surplus Proceeds for April 27, 2017. (Minute Order,
11/09/16.) Claimant Citibank, NA appeared and the matter was continued to June
13, 2017. (Minute Order, 04/27/17.) Following no appearances on June 13, 2017,
the Court set an Order to Show Cause re: Escheating Funds to the Los Angeles
Superior Court for June 13, 2019. (Minute Order, 06/13/17.) On July 7, 2021,
the Court ruled that no claims had been made with respect to the Surplus
Proceeds and ordered the funds to escheat according to law. (Minute Order, 07/07/21.)
 
On December 6, 2022,
the Court issued an order reconsidering its prior ruling regarding disposition
of the Surplus Proceeds and set an Order to Show Cause re:
Reconsideration of Disposition of Unclaimed Surplus Funds for January 13, 2023.
(Minute Order, 12/06/22.) The Court also. (Ibid.) 
 
On January 11, 2023,
Claimant Nicole Hrobak aka Nicole H. Truxal (“Claimant”) filed a Notice
of Objection to Transfer of Funds. At the Order to Show Cause, the Court set
the matter for Hearing Re: Claim to and Disposition of Unresolved Surplus Funds
on February 27, 2023. (Minute Order, 01/13/23.) The hearing, however, was not
placed on the Court’s calendar.
 
Following review of the court file on January 19, 2024, the
Court re-set the hearing for February 28, 2024. (Minute Order, 01/19/24.) At
the hearing on February 28, 2024, the Court ordered Claimant to file and serve
a supplemental declaration attaching copies of the orders and judgment in LASC
Case No. BD501536 that demonstrate she is entitled to the Surplus Proceeds. (Minute
Order, 02/28/24.) Claimant filed a supplemental declaration on April 12, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
The supplemental declaration attaches copies of the judgment
in LASC Case No. BD501536, the dissolution proceeding involving Claimant. The
judgment provides that Claimant is entitled to recover $85,600.00 as it
pertains to the subject property, which was the main asset in the community
property. (Supp. Hrobak Decl., Exh. A, pp. 2:23-3:4.) The judgment also found
that Claimant’s former spouse had removed $120,000.00 from the equity of the
subject property and ordered the sale of the subject property at Claimant’s
direction for her to recover the sums of $85,600.00 and $120,000.00. (Id.
at p. 3:14-18.) Pursuant to the terms of the judgment, Claimant placed a lien
on the subject property in March 2009. (Objection filed 01/11/23, ¶¶IV-V.) 
 
Based on the above evidence, which demonstrates Claimant’s
rights in the subject property, the Court order the surplus funds of $10,809.20 disbursed to Claimant Nicole
Hrobak aka Nicole H. Truxal.
 
Conclusion
 
Hearing on Disbursement of Surplus
Proceeds is CONCLUDED. SURPLUS FUNDS OF $10,809.20 ARE ORDERED DISBURSED TO CLAIMANT
NICOLE HROBAK AKA NICOLE H. TRUXAL.
