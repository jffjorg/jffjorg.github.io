  - Plaintiff (Bohdan Bahlaievskyi)

Significant Statements:

  - "The Motion also fails to attach a declaration of fault from Defendant demonstrating that default was entered due to their mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or excusable neglect."
  - "As none of the requirements for relief from the default under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) have been demonstrated, the Motion on these grounds must be denied."
```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Janet Petrosian, has filed a motion to vacate the entry of default. The court has reviewed the motion and has found that it does not meet the requirements for relief. Specifically, the motion does not demonstrate that the defendant demonstrated reasonable diligence in seeking relief, nor does it demonstrate that the default was entered due to mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The motion also fails to attach a declaration of fault from the defendant and does not attach a copy of the proposed responsive pleading. As a result, the court is denying the motion to vacate the entry of default.
