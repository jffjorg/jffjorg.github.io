And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling continues the Plaintiff Blue Moon Service Corporation's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint to June 11, 2024. The Plaintiff is required to file and serve a declaration in compliance with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324 by May 21, 2024. Failure to do so may result in the motion being denied. The Plaintiff seeks to amend the Complaint to address the Defendant's filing of the cross-complaint, but the motion does not comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 3.1324. Despite this, the Judge notes that the policy favoring amendment and resolving all matters in the same dispute is strong, and that excusable delay or probable prejudice to the opposing party is not shown.
