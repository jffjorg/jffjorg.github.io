"Defendant Ezzeddine Kebair's Motion to Vacate Entry of Default is granted. Defendant Kebair is to file and serve their proposed answer to the complaint within 20 days of this order. The court finds that Defendant Kebair's default was taken by surprise due to extensions of time to respond granted by their insurance company. The motion meets the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), and is therefore granted."
