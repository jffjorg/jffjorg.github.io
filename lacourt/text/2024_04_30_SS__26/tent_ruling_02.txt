Contractors Indemnity Company’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.

ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff American Contractors Indemnity Company (“Plaintiff”) brought this action for breach of an indemnity
agreement against Defendant Jeffrey
Irvine Wiscomb (“Defendant”) on March 1,
2023. Defendant filed an answer in properia persona on March 27, 2023. On
February 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
The Complaint alleges a
single cause of action for breach of indemnity agreement. Plaintiff alleges
that Defendant agreed to indemnify Plaintiff for losses incurred with respect
to Contractors License Bond, No. 100153718, issued on behalf of Millworx,
LLC (“Millworx”). (Compl., ¶¶3-5.) A copy of the indemnity agreement is
attached to the Complaint and provides that in consideration of the execution
of the Bond, Defendant agrees to reimburse Plaintiff “upon demand for all
payments made for and to indemnify Surety from all loss, claim payments, costs
and expenses, including attorneys’ and construction consultants’ fees, which
the Surety incurs.” (Compl., Exh. A, ¶1.) Plaintiff allegedly incurred damages
over the past four years as a result of its obligations under the Bond. (Id.
at ¶6.) Plaintiff allegedly discharged all its obligations under the Agreement
and Bond, while Defendant breached the same by failing to take appropriate
action to resolve the claims on the Bond and by failing to reimburse Plaintiff
for its losses. (Id. at ¶¶6-8.) As a result of Defendant’s breach,
Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of $8,081.95. (Id. at ¶9.)  
 
Plaintiff moves for summary judgment on the Complaint
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c. On a motion for summary judgment
or adjudication of a particular cause of action, a moving plaintiff must show that
there is no defense by proving each element of the cause of action entitling
the party to judgment on that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(1).) Then the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue
of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Additionally, in ruling on the Motion, the
Court must view the “evidence [citations] and such inferences [citations], in
the light most favorable to the opposing party.” (Intrieri v. Superior Court
(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 72, 81 [citing Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843].)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
In support of the Motion, Plaintiff requests that the court
take judicial notice of (1) the Complaint for breach of contract filed March 1,
2023; and (2) Defendant’s Answer to the Complaint filed March 27, 2023.
 
Cause of Action for Breach of Indemnity Agreement
 
The elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are
(1) the existence of contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach (or anticipatory breach); and (4)
resulting damage. (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. N. Y. Times Co. (2008)
164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.) 
 
In support of its Motion for Summary Judgment for breach of
the indemnity agreement, Plaintiff presents the following undisputed facts. It
issued and executed Contractor’s License Bond No. SC6364438 (“the Bond”),
naming Millworx as principal and the State of Washington as obligee. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact No. 2; Baciocco Decl., ¶5.) In exchange, on February
1, 2011, Defendant entered into an indemnity agreement with Plaintiff as
surety. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 1; Baciocco Decl., ¶4 and Exh.
3.) Pursuant to the indemnity agreement, Defendant agreed to reimburse Surety
“upon demand for all payments made for and to indemnify Surety from all loss,
claim payments, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ and construction
consultants’ fees, which the Surety incurs.” (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact
No. 3; Baciocco Decl., ¶6 and Exh. 1, p. 2.) 
 
On April 25, 2019, Plaintiff sent a letter to Defendant asking
he fulfill his obligation under the indemnity agreement. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact No. 4; Baciocco Decl., ¶7.) Plaintiff was served with a lawsuit
by Scott Sloan and Rebecca Sloan (“the Sloans”) against the Bond, which
included the Sloans’ documents supporting license law violations. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact No. 4; Baciocco Decl., ¶7 and Exh. 5.) On May 13,
2019, Defendant requested that Plaintiff payout from the bond to a client to
whom Defendant was in default. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 5;
Baciocco Decl., ¶8 and Exh. 6.) On May 31, 2019, Plaintiff again asked
Defendant to fulfill his obligations under the agreement because it was served
with additional lawsuits against the Bond with documents supporting license law
violations. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 6; Baciocco Decl., ¶9 and
Exh. 7.) Pursuant to an order in the Superior Court of Washington, Pierce
County, Plaintiff deposited $3,551.10 from the penal sum of the Bond with the
Pierce County Superior Court Clerk on July 14, 2021. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact Nos. 7-8; Baciocco Decl., ¶¶10-11 and Exhs. 8-9.) Plaintiff
also incurred attorney’s fees and costs of $4,530.85 defending the lawsuits
against Defendant. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 9; Baciocco Decl., ¶12
and Exh. 14.) Plaintiff sent Defendant notices of reimbursement on August 11,
2022, September 26, 2022, November 7, 2022, and February 21, 2023. (Motion,
Separate Statement, Fact No. 10; Baciocco Decl., ¶13 and Exhs. 11-13.) Interest
accruing on the $8,081.95 total loss amounts to $2,473.37 through the April 30,
2024, hearing date. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 12; Kim Decl., ¶3 and
Exh. 15.)
 
This evidence carries
Plaintiff’s initial burden of proof as to its claim for breach of the indemnity
agreement against Defendant. Plaintiff has demonstrated the existence of the
indemnity agreement between itself and Defendant, Defendant’s breach by failing
to reimburse Plaintiff, and Plaintiff’s resulting damages. The burden now
shifts to Defendant to demonstrate that a triable issue of material fact exists
as to Plaintiff’s claims. As no opposition has been filed, however, Defendant
has failed to demonstrate the existence of any triable issue of material fact. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff American
Contractors Indemnity Company’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS OF THIS
ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
