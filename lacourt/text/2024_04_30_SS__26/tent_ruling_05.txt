ANALYSIS:
 
On September 11, 2023, Plaintiffs Charles Jones and Burcin
Cartilli (“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action against Defendant Daniel West
(“Defendant West”). Plaintiffs amended the Complaint on December 14, 2023 to
add Defendant Ezzeddine Kebair (“Defendant Kebair”). When Defendant Kebair
failed to file a responsive pleading, Plaintiff obtained their default on
February 26, 2024.
 
On March 27, 2024, Defendant Kebair filed the instant Motion
to Vacate Default. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant Kebair moves to vacate the entry
of default pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
Under this statute, an application for relief must be made no more than six
months after entry of the order from which relief is sought, and must be
accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
130, 143.) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the moving
defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be
corrected if Defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the hearing
date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.) 
 
A request for relief
under the discretionary prong, based on party fault, must not only be made
within six months of entry of default but within a reasonable time. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) The Motion was timely filed one month after entry of
default and is supported by a declaration of fault from Defendant Kebair’s
insurance company, acting as his representative. Specifically, Defendant
Kebair’s insurer obtained two extensions of the time respond to the action,
first to March 1, 2024 and then to March 29, 2024. (Motion, Farley Decl., ¶¶4-7
and Exhs. 2-5.) Despite these extensions of time to respond communicated to
Defendant Kebair’s insurance company, Plaintiffs requested entry of default on
February 26, 2024. This demonstrates that Defendant Kebair’s default was taken
by surprise. 
 
The Motion also attaches
a copy of Defendant Kebair’s proposed responsive pleading. (Motion, Beach
Decl., Exh.2.) As all the requirements for relief from the default under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) have been demonstrated, the
Motion on these grounds is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Ezzeddine Kebair’s Motion to Vacate Entry of
Default is GRANTED. DEFENDANT KEBAIR IS TO FILE AND SERVE THEIR PROPOSED ANSWER
TO THE COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
