ANALYSIS:
 
On October 28, 2022, Plaintiff Qualitas
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) initiated this interpleader
action against Defendants Julli A. Conde (“Defendant
Conde”) and Richard M. Lester, a law corporation (“Defendant Lester”).
Defendant Lester answered on December 9, 2022. The Court entered default
against Defendant Conde on April 21, 2023.  
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Deposit
Funds on February 8, 2024. To date, no opposition to
the Motion has been filed. 
 
Discussion
 
The Complaint
alleges that this action arises from a dispute over a settlement in a personal
injury action. (Compl., ¶¶2-6.) Defendant Lester represented Defendant Conde in
the underlying action and asserts a $4,000.00 attorney’s fees lien on the
$10,000.00 settlement. (Ibid.) Plaintiff, Defendant Conde’s insurer concerning
the motor vehicle accident that gave rise to the personal injury settlement,
allegedly cannot resolve the dispute over the insurance money. (Id. at
¶12.) Plaintiff alleges no interest in the insurance money and upon its deposit
seeks to be discharged from liability in this action. (Id. at ¶¶13-16.) Plaintiff also requests an order that it can recover its
reasonable costs and attorney’s fees. (Id. at ¶15.) 
 
Interpleader is a procedure whereby a person holding money
or personal property to which conflicting claims are being made by others, or
may be made, can join the adverse claimants and force them to litigate their
claims among themselves. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (b).) Hancock Oil
Co. v. Hopkins (1944) 24 Cal.2d 497, 508 (i.e., an escrow-holder who
receives conflicting demands from the parties to the escrow regarding the funds
or documents he or she holds); City of Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999) 71
Cal.App.4th 1114, 1122.)
 
Once the stakeholder’s right to interplead is established
and he or she deposits the money or personal property in court, he or she may
be discharged from liability to any of the claimants. This enables the
stakeholder to avoid multiplicity of actions, and the risk of inconsistent
results if each of the claimants were to sue him or her separately. (Cantu
v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 874; City of Morgan
Hill, supra, 71 Cal.App.4th at 1122.)
 
“An interpleader action is traditionally viewed as two
suits: one between the stakeholder and the claimants to determine the
stakeholder's right to interplead, and the other among the claimants to
determine who shall receive the funds interpleaded ... As against the
stakeholder, claimants may raise only matters which go to whether the suit is
properly one for interpleader; i.e., whether the elements of an interpleader
action are present.” (State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 600, 612.)
 
The stakeholder may seek reimbursement for its costs and
reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred.  
(UAP-Columbus JV 326132 v. Nesbitt (1991) 234
Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.) The court may order payment thereof out of the funds
deposited by the stakeholder. (Ibid.) Ultimately, such payment may be
charged to one or more of the adverse claimants in the final judgment. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 386.6.) Finally, the Court may issue an “order restraining all
parties to the action from instituting or further prosecuting any other
proceeding in any court in this state affecting the rights and obligations as
between the parties to the interpleader until further order of the court.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (f).) 
 
Plaintiff’s request for an order depositing the interpleader
funds and to be discharged from liability on the Complaint in interpleader is proper.
Both Defendants have been served and have either answered or are in default. Substantively,
Plaintiff cannot determine the validity of the conflicting demands that have
been made and has no interest in the funds. (Motion, Heath Decl., ¶3; Hartman
Decl., ¶4.) Upon deposit of the funds to the court, Plaintiff may be discharged
from further liability. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 386, 386.5.) Furthermore, Plaintiff
is entitled to move to recover the fees and costs expended bringing this
interpleader action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6, subd. (a).) However, in the
interest of efficiency, Plaintiff is to file a supplemental declaration
regarding its attorney’s fees and costs, instead of a separate motion. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for an offset of the $10,000.00 from any
judgment awarded to Defendants is denied.
