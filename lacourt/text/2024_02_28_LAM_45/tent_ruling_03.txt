Legal
Standard
“A parent having
the right to compromise the disputed claim of the minor under this section may
execute a full release and satisfaction, or execute a covenant not to sue on or
a covenant not to enforce judgment on the disputed claim, after the money or
other property to be paid or delivered has been paid or delivered as provided
in subdivision (c). If the court orders that all or any part of the money to be
paid under the compromise or covenant be deposited in an insured account in a
financial institution in this state, or in a single-premium deferred annuity,
the release and satisfaction or covenant is not effective for any purpose until
the money has been deposited as directed in the order of the court.” (Prob.
Code, § 3500(d).) 
            “The
court shall schedule a hearing on a petition for compromise of a minor’s
disputed claim pursuant to Section 3500 within 30 days from the date of filing.
If the petition is unopposed, the court shall issue a decision on the petition
at the conclusion of the hearing.” (Prob. Code, § 3505.) 
            “The
court making the order or giving the judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a
part thereof, shall make a further order authorizing and directing that
reasonable expenses, medical or otherwise and including reimbursement to a
parent, guardian, or conservator, costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court
shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid from the money or other property
to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor or person with a
disability.” (Prob. Code, § 3601(a).) 
 
Discussion
Claimant Treasure Anderson (“Claimant”), a minor, by and through their
Guardian Ad Litem, Amia Little (“Petitioner”), has agreed to settle their
claims against Defendant Desert View Apartments, LP in exchange for
$4,000.00.  If approved, $1,000.00 will
be used for attorney’s fees, leaving a balance of $3,000.00 for Claimant to be
deposited into a blocked account, subject to withdrawal only upon authorization
of the court.
The Court has reviewed the proposed settlement and finds that it is fair
and reasonable.  Further, the requested
attorney’s fees, which amounts to approximately 25% of the total settlement, is
fair and reasonable.
            Therefore, the Petition to Approve
Compromise of Disputed Claim (Treasure Anderson, Age: 1) is GRANTED. 
 
The Court sets an OSC for ________________ ____, 2024 for proof of
deposit.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.953(a).)  If an
acknowledgement of receipt by the financial institution is filed before that
date, no appearance will be required. 
 
 
            It
is so ordered.
