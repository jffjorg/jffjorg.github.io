And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Devoto-Wade LLC dba Golden State Cider, has filed a motion to seal certain documents and deposition testimony. The documents at issue contain confidential and sensitive information, including negotiation strategies and confidential information exchanged between the members and partners of the defendant. The defendant argues that revealing this information to the public would put it at a competitive disadvantage if it sought to acquire or invest in a new business venture. The court granted the motion, but only to the extent that it is narrowly tailored and reasonable. However, the court denied the motion without prejudice because the defendant failed to demonstrate proof of service as required by California Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(1), and the plaintiff did not file an opposition.
