```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to consolidate the two cases without prejudice. The court's reasoning is twofold. First, the cases cannot be consolidated until they are first related, which is not the case here. Second, even if the court were to consider the merits of the motion, it's unclear whether consolidation is warranted. The two cases involve different tenants, represented by the same law firm, alleging similar problems with the property. However, the court cannot determine whether the tenants are roommates or separate individuals. The court notes that the leases are not in the record, which adds to the uncertainty. As a result, the motion is denied, and the current dates remain on the court calendar for now.
