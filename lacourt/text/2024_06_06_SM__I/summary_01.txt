And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is considering the motion for a turnover, but is not yet certain. After entering judgment in the amount of $2.8 million on December 19, 2023, the plaintiff alleges that no payment has been made despite the issuance of a writ of execution. The plaintiff seeks to transfer the defendant's stock ownership and receive any dividends paid. The defendant agrees in theory but proposes selling the stock to raise more money. The court will investigate the status of the defendant's efforts to sell the stock, which seems reasonable.
