  Case Number:  22SMCV00652    Hearing Date:   June 6, 2024    Dept:  I The motion for a turnover may be MOOT, but the court is not
sure.  The court entered judgment on
December 19, 2023, in the amount of $2.8 million pursuant to a section 998
agreement.  The judgment was later
amended to encompass other defendants. 
Plaintiff alleges that no money has yet been paid even though a writ of
execution has been issued.  According to
plaintiff, defendant owns stock and may be entitled to dividends or some form
of disbursement related to the stock ownership. 
Plaintiff seeks to have the stock transferred to a levying officer and
an order that any dividends paid be paid to plaintiff.  Plaintiff also seeks a restraining order to
prevent defendant from otherwise transferring or impairing the stock
ownership.  In response, defendant states
that it has no objection in theory, but that much more money can be raised by
selling the stock to someone in the industry. 
Defendant states that it is working with plaintiff to engage in such a
sale or transfer of shares.  The court
will inquire as to the status of that effort, which seems eminently
reasonable.
