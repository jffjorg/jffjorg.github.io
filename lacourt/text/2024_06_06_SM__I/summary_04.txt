And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the City's motion to strike certain allegations in the plaintiff's negligence action. The City seeks to strike allegations related to spoliation of evidence and a violation of the Public Records Act, as well as breaches of a mandatory duty as it relates to Streets and Highways Code sections 1806, 1921, and 5011, and Santa Monica Municipal Code and Charter sections 200 and 713 and 13.02. The court has previously granted the motion to strike these allegations, but allowed the plaintiff to amend the complaint. The plaintiff has re-alleged the same claims, apparently without reading the court's prior order. The court suggests that the plaintiff's counsel review the prior order. The court has granted the City's motion to strike the allegations related to spoliation of evidence, and denied the motion as to the allegations related to the violation of the Public Records Act. The court has also granted the motion to strike certain specific paragraphs in the complaint. The City is ordered to answer within 30 days.
