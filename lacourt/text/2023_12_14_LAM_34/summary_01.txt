The Judge finds that the Plaintiff is entitled to allege that the Defendants acted with malice, fraud, or oppression and that they should therefore be liable for punitive damages. The Judge notes that it will ultimately be the Plaintiff's burden to prove to the trier of fact that he is entitled to the relief he seeks.
