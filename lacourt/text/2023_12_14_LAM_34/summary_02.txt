And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The Motion was filed by the Defendants, Carlos Sotelo and VIP Enterprises, Inc., and seeks to strike the Plaintiff's claim for attorney's fees. The Plaintiff, Sebastian Solano, argues that the attorney's fees were incurred in prior litigation due to professional negligence and are thus allowable as damages.

The Judge has denied the Motion, finding that the Plaintiff's claim is supported by law and fact. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has alleged that the Defendants are liable for professional negligence and that part of the damages suffered was the unnecessary payment of attorney's fees in an earlier arbitration. The Judge agrees with the Plaintiff's argument that the attorney's fees are recoverable as damages resulting from a tort, citing several California cases.

The Judge also notes that the Defendants' argument lacks merit and that the Plaintiff's opposition was incomplete and lacked citations to supporting cases. The Judge expects both counsel to be more professional and precise in their future briefings. The Motion to Strike is denied.
