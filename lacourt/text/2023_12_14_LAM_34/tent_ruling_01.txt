ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond
to a pleading, may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any
part thereof. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1)). The notice of motion to
strike a portion of a pleading shall quote in full the portions sought to be
stricken except where the motion is to strike an entire paragraph, cause of
action, count or defense. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1322.)
 
The grounds for a motion to strike shall
appear on the face of the challenged pleading or form any matter of which the
court is required to take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437, subd. (a).)
The court then may strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading and strike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) 
 
When the defect which justifies striking a
complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave to amend. (Perlman
v. Mun. Ct. (1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 568, 575.)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Defendant Urschel Laboratories Inc. moves the Court to strike all
allegations of and the prayer for punitive damages from the Complaint. (Motion,
pp. ii–iv, 2:22–23, 7:9–10, 10:17–19.) 
 
        The requested relief is inappropriate
here. 
 
Plaintiff is entitled to allege that Defendants acted with malice,
fraud, or oppression and that they should therefore be liable for punitive
damages. It will ultimately be Plaintiff’s burden to prove to the trier of fact
that he is entitled to the relief he seeks. 
 
III.    
Conclusion 
 
The Motion to Strike is DENIED.
