And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that David Berke, counsel for the plaintiff, may withdraw as counsel due to an irremediable breakdown in attorney-client communication and material breach of retainer agreement. The motion is unopposed, and the Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. The Court notes that the next hearing is set for September 30, 2024, which should provide sufficient time for the plaintiff to retain new counsel. The Court will hear from the parties on June 10, 2024, to discuss whether the plaintiff's email address used for service is current.
