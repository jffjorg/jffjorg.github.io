Tentative Ruling:

The Court has denied the Defendant's motion to continue the trial date from August 1, 2024 to January 13, 2025. The Defendant sought the continuance due to the Plaintiff's recent flare-up and reopening of a workers' compensation claim. The Court finds that the four years of discovery have provided ample opportunity for both parties to gather necessary information, assess damages, and prepare their cases thoroughly. The Court concludes that additional time is not justified to evaluate new developments related to the flare-up.
