And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's motion to compel initial responses and request for sanctions. The plaintiff failed to respond to discovery requests despite several extensions granted by the defendant. The plaintiff's counsel claims they have been diligent in trying to locate the plaintiff to provide the discovery responses. The court finds that the plaintiff did not act with substantial justification and orders the plaintiff to provide complete and verified discovery responses without objections to the defendant within 20 days. The court also orders the plaintiff to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,650 to the defendant within 20 days.
