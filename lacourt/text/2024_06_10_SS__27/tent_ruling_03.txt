BRANTLINGER vs ANDRANIK DJOUKHIAN
Moving Party: Defendant ANDRANIK DJOUKHIAN
Responding Party: Plaintiff¿¿ 
Notice: Sufficient¿¿ 
Ruling: MOTION TO COMPEL MENTAL EXAMINATION IS GRANTED
 
The parties acknowledge
that good cause exists for the neuropsychological examination; however, they
disagree on whether to provide raw data directly to opposing counsel. This
Court routinely addresses motions for mental examinations. The argument that dissemination
of the test data directly to opposing counsel poses ethical concerns and risks
to the integrity of the test is not one of first impression. In such cases, the
Court balances Plaintiff's need for the data for cross-examination purposes
against Defendant's concerns regarding the integrity of the test. The Court
finds that ordering the provision of raw data to opposing counsel, subject to a
protective order, achieves an appropriate balance. Accordingly, Defendant’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s mental examination is granted. Plaintiff is
ordered to undergo the mental examination within 60 days from today, and the
raw data from the examination is to be provided directly to Plaintiff's
counsel, subject to a protective order.
