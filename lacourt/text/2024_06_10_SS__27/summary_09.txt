And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to advance the hearing date for their motion for summary judgment. The motion was filed when the trial date was set for March 21, 2024, and the defendant's motion for summary judgment was scheduled for February 27, 2025. However, the trial date was continued to April 3, 2025, and the defendant's motion for summary judgment is now scheduled for 30 days before the trial date. The judge finds that the motion is moot and therefore denied. The parties are notified that they must submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument, or the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
