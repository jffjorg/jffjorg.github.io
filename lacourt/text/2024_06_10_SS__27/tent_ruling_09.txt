 Case Number:  22STCV31283    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  27 Hon. Lee S. Arian, Dept 27¿¿ ¿¿ MOTION TO ADVANCE THE HEARING ON ITS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT¿¿ Hearing Date: 6/10/24¿¿¿ CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV31283 MANDEEP GILL, et al. vs MANUEL GALLARDO¿ Moving Party: Defendants  Responding Party: Unopposed Notice: Sufficient¿¿¿ Ruling: MOTION TO ADVANCE THE HEARING ON ITS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS DENIED.  Defendants move the Court to advance the hearing date for their motion for summary judgment or continue the trial date because when the motion was filed, the trial was set for March 21, 2024, and Defendant’s motion for summary judgment was scheduled to be heard on February 27, 2025, after the trial date. Since the filing, the trial date has been continued to April 3, 2025, and Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is now to be heard 30 days before the trial date, in compliance with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(a)(3). The present motion is thus moot and therefore denied. ¿¿ PLEASE TAKE NOTICE:¿ ¿ If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept27@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿ ¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿ ¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿
