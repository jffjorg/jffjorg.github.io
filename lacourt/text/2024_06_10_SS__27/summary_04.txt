And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by Judge Lee S. Arian addresses a motion to relieve counsel, David Berke, who represents the plaintiff, Jennifer Chen, in a case against Jason Raich. Berke seeks to withdraw as counsel due to an irremediable breakdown in attorney-client communication and a material breach of the retainer agreement. Since no opposition has been filed, the court will hear from the parties. The court notes that the motion was served on the plaintiff through electronic service, but lacks a declaration stating whether the electronic service address used is current. The court will hear from counsel on this matter. The ruling will be finalized unless all parties submit by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
