STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for breach of contract. Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant failed to perform his obligations concerning the disposition of a
parcel of real property and the distribution of funds from the sale of that
property. 
 
Defendant moves to compel responses
to form interrogatories, and for sanctions. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories is DENIED AS MOOT. 
 
            Defendant’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
//
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Defendant moves to compel responses
to form interrogatories, and for sanctions. 
 
Insufficient Notice
 
            Defendant
served this motion via electronic service on January 31, 2024. Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005(b) requires that a motion be served 16 court days before
the date of the scheduled hearing, plus two court days for electronic service.
(Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1005(b); 1010.6.) Thus, accounting for two Court holidays
on February 19 and February 12, the last day to serve this motion was January
29, 2024. However, as Plaintiff’s counsel has filed a declaration in opposition
to this motion without objecting to the deficient notice, the Court will
address the motion on its merits. 
 
Legal Standard
 
When a party to whom an inspection
demand or an interrogatory is directed fails to respond, a party making the
request may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.290(b) [interrogatories]; 2031.300(b) [requests for production].) A party
who fails to provide timely responses waives any objection, including one based
on privilege or work product. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290(a); 2031.300(a).)
For a motion to compel initial responses, no meet and confer is required. All
that must be shown is that discovery requests were properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response has
been served. (Leach v. Sup. Ct.
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-06.) 
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
served form interrogatories via email on Plaintiff’s counsel on September 21,
2023. (Declaration of Michael Lacerte ISO Mot. ¶ 3, Exh. 1 POS.) As of the date
of filing of this motion, no responses have been received. (Id. ¶ 4.) However,
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that responses
were served by mail on February 9, 2024, and included a copy of those responses
with proof of service. (Declaration of John Guy ISO Opp. Exh. A.) Thus, it
appears that this motion is moot save for the issue of sanctions.
 
Sanctions
 
            Defendant
requests sanctions against Plaintiff only in the amount of $2,614.50. This
request is based on 4 hours of attorney time actually incurred at the rate of
$375 per hour, plus 2 anticipated hours at the same rate, plus $60 in filing
fees. (Declaration of Robert Petrokofsky ISO Mot. ¶ 4.) This fee request is
unreasonably inflated on its face. It should not take four hours for an
attorney with more than three decades of experience to prepare a
straightforward motion to compel responses. The Court therefore exercises its discretion to deny this request as
unreasonably inflated. (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal. 4th 970, 989-991.) 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories is DENIED AS
MOOT. 
 
            Defendant’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
