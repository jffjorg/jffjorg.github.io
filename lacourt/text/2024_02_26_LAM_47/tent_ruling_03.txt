Legal Standard
 
A motion for judgment on the
pleadings is the functional equivalent to a general demurrer.  (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic
Indemnity Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198).  Like demurrers, motions for judgment on the
pleadings challenge the legal sufficiency of the allegations, not their
veracity.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994). Any defects must either appear on the
face of the pleading, or else be taken by judicial notice.  (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 316, 321-22).  The parties’
ability to prove their respective claims is of no concern.  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 99.)  Though
the Court must accept the allegations of the complaint and answer as true (Gerawan
Farming, Inc. v. Lyons (2000) 24 Cal.4th 468, 515), it will not do so for
“conclusions of law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to
law or [judicially noticed] facts…” (Stevenson Real Estate Servs., Inc. v.
CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Servs., Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1219-20). There is no meet and confer requirement for a motion for judgment on
the pleadings in an action for unlawful detainer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 439(d).) 
 
Timing
 
           A
motion for judgment on the pleadings may be brought by a defendant at any time
after the time to demur has expired and an answer has been filed. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 438(f)). Unless a court orders otherwise, a motion for judgment on the
pleadings may not be made after entry of a pre-trial conference order, (Cal.
Rules of Court 3.720-3.730) or 30 days before the initial trial date, whichever
is later. (Code Civ. Proc. § 438(e). No pre-trial conference order was entered
in this case, and the motion was filed more than 30 days before the initial
trial date.
 
Analysis
 
            Defendants
move for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that the 15-day Notice to Pay
Rent or Quit that is the basis for this unlawful detainer action is defective
because (1) the Notice overstates the rent due and (2) because it does not contain
language required by the COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act. 
 
“The established rule is that,
where the right to a forfeiture is created by contract or by law, ‘it has
always been considered that it was necessary to restrain it to the most
technical limits of the terms and conditions upon which the right is to be exercised.’”
(Downing v. Cutting Packing Co. (1920) 183 Cal. 91, 95.) Put
differently, unlawful detainer statutes are strictly construed, and “every
intendment and presumption is against the person seeking to enforce the
forfeiture.” (Horton-Howard v. Payton (1919) 44 Cal.App. 108, 112.) “Because
of the summary nature of an unlawful detainer action, a notice is valid only if
the lessor strictly complies with the statutorily mandated notice
requirements.” (Bevill v. Zoura (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 694, 697 [internal
citations omitted].) Valid notice is a prerequisite to an unlawful detainer
action. (See Kwok v. Bergren (1982) 130 Cal. App. 3d 596, 599-600
[citing Lawrence Barker, Inc. v. Briggs (1952) 39 Cal.2d 654, 661].) 
 
1.     
Overstated Rent
 
Defendants state that the notice is
defective because it does not state the proper amount of rent due as required
by statute. A tenant is guilty of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent when
the tenant “continues in possession . . . after default in the payment of rent .
. . and three days’ notice . . . in writing, requiring its payment, stating the
amount which is due. . . shall have been served upon him or her.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1161(2).) A notice to pay rent or quit which overstates the amount due
is defective. (See, e.g., Nourafchan v. Miner (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 746,
753.) 
 
Defendants state that the Notice
overstates the amount of rent due by $7,500. Both the Notice and the Complaint
state that Defendants agreed to pay $1,500 per month in rent. (See Complaint ¶
6(2); Exh. 2.) Both the Complaint and the Notice also claim that the total rent
due was $43,500. (Complaint ¶ 12, Exh.2). However, the Notice only states that
there are 24 months of rent outstanding: 19 months from March 1, 2020 through
September 1, 2021 at $1,500 per month, and $7,500 total for the five-month
period from April 1, 2023 through August 31, 2023. (Complaint Exh. 2.) This is
equivalent to 24 months of rent at a rate of $1,500, which is a total of
$36,000 in rent, not $43,500. Defendants, therefore, are correct in asserting
that the Notice overstates the amount of rent due. For that reason alone, the
Complaint is incurably defective, and Defendants are entitled to judgment on
the pleadings.
 
2.     
Compliance with
COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act
 
Defendants
also argue that the Notice does not comply with the COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act
because it does not contain any of the required warnings or notice required
under the Act. Any notice demanding payment of rent that came due between March
1, 2020, and September 30, 2021 must contain additional language advising the
tenant of their rights under the statute. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1179.02(a), (c);
1179.03(a).) As relevant here, the notice:
 
shall advise
the tenant that the tenant cannot be evicted for failure to comply with the
notice if the tenant delivers a signed declaration of COVID-19-related
financial distress to the landlord on or before the date that the notice to pay
rent or quit or notice to perform covenants or quit expires, by any of the
methods specified in subdivision (f).
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1179.03(b)(3). The
statute sets forth the specific language that must be included when giving this
notice. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1179.03(b)(4).) This language is not present in the
15-day Notice attached to the Complaint, and there is no mention of a
declaration of financial distress. (Complaint Exh. 2.) The Complaint is
therefore also defective on this basis, and Defendants are entitled to judgment
on the pleadings. 
 
Leave to Amend
 
            When a
demurrer is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318).  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the
general set of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should
give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff
should not “be deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that
his pleadings were defective for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman
(1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) Accordingly, California law imposes the
burden on the plaintiffs to demonstrate how they can amend their pleadings to
state their claims against a defendant.  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) “Denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of
discretion unless the complaint shows on its face it is incapable of
amendment.  [Citation.]  Liberality in permitting amendment is the
rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given."
(Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.)
 
            As the
deficiencies in the Complaint arise from legal defects in the Notice to Pay
Rent or Quit that is a prerequisite to maintaining this unlawful detainer
action, it is not possible to cure the Complaint by amendment. Leave to amend
is not proper in this instance. 
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED. 
 
            Dismissal
is entered this date as to all Defendants with prejudice. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
