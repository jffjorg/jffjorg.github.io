And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by Judge Theresa M. Traber on February 26, 2024, regarding a motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and a request for sanctions. The case is J. Lino Zelada v. Charles Magdeseian, individually and as trustee of the Charles and Catherine Magdesian Living Trust, Case No. 21STCV44806.

The motion was filed by the Defendant, Charles Magdeseian, who alleges that the Plaintiff, J. Lino Zelada, failed to respond to form interrogatories served on September 21, 2023. The Defendant requests that the Court compel the Plaintiff to respond to the interrogatories and also seeks sanctions against the Plaintiff in the amount of $2,614.50.

The Court finds that the motion is denied as moot because the Plaintiff's counsel filed a declaration stating that responses were served by mail on February 9, 2024. The Court also denies the request for sanctions, finding that the fee request is unreasonably inflated.

The Court notes that the Defendant's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories was served via electronic service on January 31, 2024, but it was not served with sufficient notice. However, the Court will address the motion on its merits because the Plaintiff's counsel did not object to the deficient notice.

The Court exercises its discretion to deny the request for sanctions as unreasonably inflated, citing Chavez v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal. 4th 970, 989-991.
