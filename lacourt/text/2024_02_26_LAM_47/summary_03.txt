And here is the summary in English text:

The defendants, Isabel Chavez and Josefina Torres, have filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in response to the unlawful detainer action brought by Susan Talman. The motion argues that the notice to pay rent or quit, which is a prerequisite to the action, is defective because it overstates the amount of rent due and does not comply with the COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act.

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion and dismissing the action with prejudice. The ruling notes that the notice does not comply with the statutory requirements for a notice to pay rent or quit, and that the defendants are entitled to judgment on the pleadings.

The judge also notes that it is not possible to cure the deficiencies in the complaint by amendment, and therefore leaves to amend is not proper. The ruling concludes that the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted, and that the action is dismissed with prejudice.
