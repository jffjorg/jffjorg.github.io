DISCUSSION:
 
Demurrer to Complaint [Elite Stone & Cabinet Inc.]
 
Defendant Elite Stone &
Cabinet, Inc. demurs to the first five causes of action for failure to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
Legal Standard
 
A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. (Marshall
v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields
v. County of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n
demurrer, pleadings are read liberally and allegations contained therein are
assumed to be true”].) “This rule of liberal construction means that the
reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.” (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th
1228, 1238.) 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a demurrer, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who has filed the pleading subject to the demurrer and file a declaration
detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).)
However, an insufficient meet and confer process is not grounds
to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a)(4).)
 
The Declaration of Attorney Jon
Turigliatto states that the parties met and conferred electronically on September
27, 2023, but were unable to reach a resolution of this dispute. (Declaration
of Jon Turigliatto ISO Demurrer ¶¶ 3-4, Exh. A.) Defendant has thus satisfied its
statutory meet-and-confer obligation.
Toxic Tort Liability Claims (Causes of Action 1-3 and 5)
 
            Defendant
Elite Stone & Cabinet, Inc. demurs to the first three causes of action for
(1) negligence; (2) failure to warn; (3) defective design, and the fifth cause
of action for breach of implied warranties for failing to allege specific facts
as to this Defendant.
 
            Defendant
argues that the Complaint as pled does not comply with the standard set forth
by our Supreme Court for pleading causation in toxic tort actions. As stated in
Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc., a Plaintiff must plead (1)
that he was exposed to each of the toxic materials claimed to have caused a
specific illness; (2) Plaintiff must identify each product that allegedly
caused the injury; (3) that each toxin, specifically identified, entered into
each plaintiff’s body as a result of the exposure; (4) that each plaintiff
suffers from a specific illness and that each toxin that entered his or her
body was a substantial factor in bringing about, prolonging, or aggravating
that illness; and (5) that each toxin absorbed by each plaintiff was
manufactured or supplied by the named defendant. (Bockrath v. Aldrich
Chemical Company, Inc. (1992) 21 Cal.4th 71, 78-80.) 
 
            A cursory
examination of the Complaint reveals that Plaintiffs allege:
 
(1) that he was
exposed to silica dust causing his silicosis (Complaint ¶ 104); 
 
(2) identifies
each of Defendant’s products that allegedly caused the injury (¶ 98 p. 37)
 
(3) that
Plaintiff Martin inhaled silica dust as a result of the exposure to the
Defendants’ products. (¶ 104)
 
(4) that
inhalation of that silica dust was a substantial factor in causing, prolonging,
and aggravating Plaintiff’s silicosis; (¶ 440)
 
(5) and that
the toxins were manufactured or supplied by the Defendants (¶ 104.)
 
The Complaint also states with respect to the fifth cause of
action, that the products were purchased by Plaintiff’s employers and delivered
to their facilities in Los Angeles County where Plaintiff Martin was exposed.
(Complaint ¶ 593.) 
 
Defendant asserts that these
allegations are not sufficient because they address all named Defendants in the
aggregate rather than referring to each individual Defendant by name. Defendant
provides no authority showing that further specificity is required where the
allegations of the complaint plainly meet the standard set forth in Bockrath.
The Court therefore finds that Defendant has failed to demonstrate that the
Complaint is defective with respect to these causes of action. 
 
//
 
Fourth Cause of Action (Fraud)
 
Defendant also demurs to the fourth
cause of action for fraudulent concealment for failure to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
“The elements of a cause of action for
fraud based on concealment are: ‘(1) the defendant must have concealed or
suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to
disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally
concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4)
the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he
did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of
the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained
damage.’” 
 
(Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th
1187, 1198.)
 
            First,
Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to allege with adequate specificity that
Defendant had a duty to disclose the properties of its products, or that it
intentionally concealed that information from Plaintiff. As to each element of
a claim for fraudulent concealment, Plaintiffs allege that:
 
(1)  
Defendants concealed the toxic properties of their
products (¶¶ 108-11, 576), several of which was identified in the Complaint. (¶
98 p.37.)
 
(2)  
 Defendants had a
duty to disclose the toxic properties of their products because of the Hazard
Communication Standard, California common law, their “knowledge of material
facts, to wit the toxic properties of their products, which were not accessible
to Plaintiff,” because they “made representations regarding their stone
products, but failed to disclose additional facts which materially qualify the
facts disclosed, and/or which rendered the disclosures made likely to mislead
Plaintiff,” and because they had a transactional relationship with Defendant,
based on their sale of toxic products to Plaintiff’s employers, with whom
Plaintiff was in privity (¶¶ 483-87, ), 
 
(3)  
Defendant “concealed said toxic hazards from Plaintiff
. . . so that Plaintiff . . . would use Defendants’ stone products” (¶ 488), 
 
(4)  
 Plaintiff “was
unaware of the toxic and fibrogenic [hazards] of Defendants’ stone products and
would not have acted as he did had he known of said concealed hazards (¶ 577),
and 
 
(5)  
As a result of Defendant’s concealment of the toxic
hazards of its stone products, Plaintiff was exposed to Defendant’s toxic hazards
and has suffered “serious injuries and disease” as a result, including “silicosis,
progressive massive fibrosis and other related and consequential medical
conditions (¶¶ 579-84)
These allegations are sufficient to allege a
fraudulent concealment claim against Defendants. (Jones, supra, 198
Cal.App.4th at 1195 [plaintiff’s complaint is not “unacceptably speculative if
a plaintiff has not specifically identified which toxin contained in a
particular product caused the alleged injury or has sued the manufacturers of
multiple products, alleging all of them contained toxins that were substantial
factors in causing his injury.”) Moreover, as the California Supreme Court
noted in Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71,
the remedy for an improperly speculative pleading is provided by Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.7(b), which permits the imposition of sanctions on an
attorney who is found to have deliberately filed a products liability suit
without a well-founded belief in the truth of a particular allegation. (Bockrath,
supra, 21 Cal. 4th at p. 82; see also Jones, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th
at 1196.) 
 
Defendants also argue that Plaintiff fails to plead (1) the identity
of the individuals who made misrepresentations to plaintiff, (2) demonstrate
that such individuals had authority to speak for the corporation, (3) identify
what such individuals said or wrote and when, and (4) specially plead that
their damages were proximately caused by the defendant's fraudulent
conduct. (Demurrer p. 7:24-8:1, citing Lazar v. Superior
Court (Rykoff-Sexton Inc.) (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) Plaintiff’s fourth
cause of action does not allege fraudulent misrepresentation, however. It
pleads fraudulent concealment. The elements cited by Defendants do not apply to
a cause of action for fraudulent concealment.   
 
Uncertainty
 
            Defendant demurs to the first five causes
of action on the ground that they are uncertain.
 
"A
demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in
some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures."  (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  "A demurrer for uncertainty will be
sustained only where the complaint is so bad that defendant cannot
reasonably respond--i.e., he or she cannot reasonable determine what issues
must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him
or her."  (Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter
Group) § 7:85 (emphasis in original).) "The objection of uncertainty does
not go to the failure to allege sufficient facts."  (Brea v. McGlashan (1934)
3 Cal.App.2d 454, 459.)
 
As should
be apparent from Defendant’s own arguments and the Court’s examination of the
allegations raised, the Complaint is not so vague that it is impossible for
Defendant to identify the claims to which it must respond. The Court therefore
finds that the Complaint is not uncertain. 
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer is OVERRULED in its
entirety. 
Motion
to Strike Portions of Complaint [Elite Stone & Cabinet, Inc.]
 
Defendant Elite Stone & Cabinet Inc. also moves to strike
portions of the Complaint pertaining to punitive damages, as well as an
allegation relating to “[o]ther products to be identified during discovery.”
 
Legal Standard
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at
any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. Code Civ.
Proc., § 436(a). The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court. Id., § 436(b). The grounds for a motion to strike
are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been
drawn or filed in conformity with laws. Id.§ 436. The grounds for moving to
strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. Id.§
437. “When the defect which justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure,
the court should allow leave to amend.” Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998)
63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768. A motion to
strike can be used where the complaint or other pleading has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with applicable rules or court orders.  Code Civ.
Proc., § 436(b). This provision is for "the striking of a pleading due to
improprieties in its form or in the procedures pursuant to which it
was filed."  Ferraro v. Camarlinghi (2008) 161
Cal.App.4th 509, 528 (emphasis in original).
 
Meet and Confer
 
 Before filing a motion to strike, the moving
party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who has
filed the pleading subject to the motion to strike and file a declaration
detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5(a).)
However, an insufficient meet and confer process is not grounds to grant or
deny a motion to strike.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5(a)(4).)
 
The Declaration of Attorney Jon
Turigliatto states that the parties met and conferred electronically on
September 27, 2023, but were unable to reach a resolution of this dispute.
(Declaration of Jon Turigliatto ISO Mot. ¶¶ 3-4, Exh. A.) Defendant has thus
satisfied its statutory meet-and-confer obligation.
 
Analysis
 
Defendant moves to strike portions of the Complaint pertaining to
punitive damages sought based on fraud, as alleged in the fourth cause of
action. Defendant also moves to strike an allegation relating to “[o]ther stone products to be
identified during the course of discovery.”
 
For the reasons discussed above as to the fourth cause of
action, Plaintiff has sufficiently pled fraud, as that term is defined in Civil
Code section 3294(c)(3) to include an intentional misrepresentation, deceit or
concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention of
depriving a person of property or legal rights.  
 
Defendants also argue that
Plaintiffs’ allegation of “[o]ther stone products to be identified during the
course of discovery” should be stricken.   (See Complaint p.37:15.) 
 
Defendant is correct that this allegation is inconsistent
with the requirements of Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. (1999)
21 Cal.4th 71, the leading case on pleading requirements in toxic tort cases.
That case requires Plaintiffs to “identify each product that allegedly caused
the injury.” (Id. at 80.) If Plaintiff had alleged only that Defendant
had manufactured something that caused the injury and that they would identify
that “something” during discovery, that would be inadequate. It is only the
naming of a specific product that saves Plaintiff’s allegations against this Defendant.
Referring to other products “to be identified during discovery” is improper. 
 
By analogy, when seeking to amend
a complaint, “a vague suggestion that additional facts might be uncovered
through discovery is insufficient to justify allowing plaintiffs further leave
to amend their complaint.” (AREI II Cases (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1004,
1020.) If that type of suggestion is inadequate to justify leave to amend, it
must be inadequate at the outset.  
 
In so ruling, the Court
emphasizes this does not mean that Plaintiff shall be forever barred from
identifying additional injury-causing products during the course of further
discovery which were not listed in his Complaint. “If discovery and
investigation develop factual grounds justifying a timely amendment to a
pleading, leave to amend must be liberally granted.” (Mabie v. Hyatt
(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 581, 596.) Plaintiff is also not categorically precluded
from pursuing evidence of other injury-causing products. The Discovery Act
specifically permits discovery “reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of
admissible evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)  Moreover, any “doubts
as to relevance should generally be resolved in favor of permitting discovery.”
(Colonial Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1982) 31
Cal.3d 785, 790.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Accordingly, the motion to strike
is GRANTED without leave to amend as to the allegation “[o]ther
stone products to be identified during the course of discovery” and is
otherwise DENIED.  Leave to amend may be granted
in the future if discovery reveals that an amendment to list another product or
products is justified. 
 
Demurrer to Complaint [Strictly Stones]
 
            Defendant
Strictly Stones demurs to the Complaint in its entirety. 
 
A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. (Marshall
v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields
v. County of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n

assumed to be true”].) “This rule of liberal construction means that the

1228, 1238.)

Before filing a demurrer, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who has filed the pleading subject to the demurrer and file a declaration
detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).)
However, an insufficient meet and confer process is not grounds
to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a)(4).)
 
The Declaration of Attorney Chariese
Solorio states that the parties met and conferred electronically between August
1 and August 9, 2023, but were unable to reach a resolution of this dispute.
(Declaration of Chariese Solorio ISO Demurrer ¶¶ 3-4, Exhs. A-B.) Defendant has
thus satisfied its statutory meet-and-confer obligation.
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant Strictly Stones demurs to the Complaint in its
entirety. Defendant raises substantially identical arguments to those raised in
Elite Stone & Cabinet, Inc.’s demurrer, save that this Defendant also
demurs to the sixth cause of action for loss of consortium on the same basis. As
Strictly Stones’s products are identified in the Complaint (see ¶ 98 p.71), for
the reasons stated above, Strictly Stones’s Demurrer is OVERRULED in its
entirety.
 
Motion to Strike Portions of Complaint [Strictly Stones]
 
            Defendant
Strictly Stones also moves to strike portions of the Complaint pertaining
to punitive damages, as well as an allegation relating to “[o]ther products to be

Analysis
 
Defendant moves to strike portions of the Complaint pertaining to
punitive damages sought on the basis of fraud, as alleged in the fourth cause
of action. Defendant also moves to strike an allegation relating to “[o]ther stone products to be
identified during the course of discovery.”
 
For the reasons discussed above as to the fourth cause of

Defendants also argues that
Plaintiffs’ allegation of “[o]ther stone products to be identified during the

above with respect to Elite Stone & Cabinet’s Motion to Strike, Defendant
is correct. 
 
Conclusion
 
Accordingly, the motion to strike
is GRANTED without leave to amend as to the allegation “[o]ther
stone products to be identified during the course of discovery” and is
otherwise DENIED.  Leave to amend may be
granted in the future if discovery reveals that an amendment to list another
