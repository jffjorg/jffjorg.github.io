And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has considered the Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration of the April 22, 2024 ruling on his Petition for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. The Plaintiff seeks reconsideration based on the alleged lack of advance notice of the Court's tentative ruling and the failure of the City to provide a briefing schedule.

The Court has reviewed the facts and arguments presented and finds that the Plaintiff's motion does not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The Court notes that the Plaintiff was represented in pro per and had an opportunity to review the tentative ruling before the hearing. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff's declaration on intended use of the subject records, which were not presented at the hearing, was available to him at or before the hearing.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff's motion is DENIED. The City is ordered to give notice.
