And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a response to defendant Maja Peci's demurrer to the plaintiff's fifth amended complaint. The plaintiff, Ocean Recovery, LLC, is suing defendants Sullivan Curtis Monroe Insurance Services, LLC, Scottsdale Indemnity Company, and Maja Peci for professional negligence. The judge notes that the plaintiff's filing of the fifth amended complaint was late, but will nonetheless address the tardy pleading.

The judge concludes that defendant Peci's demurrer is tentatively overruled subject to oral argument on certain points. The judge will allow oral argument to determine whether the allegations in the fifth amended complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for negligence by a producer or brokerage whose alleged account manager is claimed to have made a representation to the plaintiff that he purchased EPLI insurance as opposed to the D&O policy he did purchase. The judge will also seek input from defendant Peci as to why the allegations in paragraph 38 of the fifth amended complaint are insufficient at the pleading stage to survive a demurrer for uncertainty or for failing to state a viable cause of action.
