English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a lawsuit filed by plaintiff Zareh Narghizian against defendants Lithia Motors, Inc. and Van Nuys-T, Inc. The defendants move to compel arbitration and stay the action. The court finds that the arbitration agreement is binding and enforceable, and compels arbitration of certain claims. The court stays the action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding. The court also severs a provision of the arbitration agreement that prohibits consolidation of claims and waives the right to bring class or collective actions.
