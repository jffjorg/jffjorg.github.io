Significant Statements:
  - "Once a defendant files a motion to quash, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the validity of the service and the court's jurisdiction over the defendant." (Bolkiah v. Superior Court)
  - "Personal service usually contemplates actual delivery. But the person on whom service is sought may not, by merely declining to take the document offered, deny the personal service on the ground of lack of delivery..." (Crescendo Corp. v. Shelted, Inc.)
```

And here is the English text summarizing the tentative ruling:

The defendant, Min Liu, has moved to quash the service of summons on the grounds that the service was not valid. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has met its burden of proving the validity of the service. The court also rules that the plaintiff's Doe amendment is valid, as the court finds that the plaintiff did not unreasonably delay filing the amendment. The defendant fails to show prejudice as a result of the addition of the new defendant. Therefore, the defendant's motion to quash is denied, and the defendant is ordered to file a responsive pleading within 20 days.
