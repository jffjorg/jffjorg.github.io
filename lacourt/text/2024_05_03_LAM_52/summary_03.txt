And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's eighth cause of action for defamation is overruled. The plaintiff has adequately alleged the substance of the defamatory statements and has sufficiently alleged that the statements were made to third parties. The judge has also found that the defendants do not have a common interest privilege in making the statements, as the statements were not made to people with a shared interest with the defendants. The plaintiff's allegations of defamation are actionable and the defendants must answer the complaint within 20 days.
