 Case Number:  23STCV30245    Hearing Date:   July 16, 2024    Dept:  17 Superior Court of California County of Los  Angeles   DEPARTMENT 17   TENTATIVE RULING      TAE SUNG SHIN                 vs.   GENWORTH LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, et al.        Case    No.:  23STCV30245            Hearing Date:  July 16, 2024       Plaintiff’s  motion for leave to amend to file a FAC is GRANTED.                           On  12/12/2023, Plaintiff (Tae Sung Shin) filed suit against Genworth Life  Insurance Company, Hanmi Bank, Susan Cho, Michelle Kim, and John Kim, alleging:  (1) breach of life insurance contract; (2) breach of the duty of good faith and  fair dealing; (3) breach of bank account contract; (4) breach of fiduciary  duty; (5) resulting trust; (6) constructive trust; (7) tortious interference  with contractual relations; (8) unjust enrichment; (9) common counts; (10)  declaratory relief; and (11) injunctive relief.                On  4/9/2024, Plaintiff moved for leave to file a first amended complaint (FAC).    Defendants  filed a notice of non-opposition.   Discussion                Plaintiff  seeks leave to amend to file a FAC.               The  proposed amendment would clarify existing allegations, would add causes of  action against the individual defendants for Elder Abuse, Conversion, and  Cancellation of Instrument, and would remove causes of action for breach of  fiduciary duty against Hanmi Bank, and for tortious interference with  contractual relations against the individual defendants.   The  policy favoring leave to amend is so strong that it is an abuse of discretion  to deny an amendment unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice. (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.)   Here, trial  is not until 11/10/2025. Plaintiff’s motion is adequately supported by a  proposed amended pleading and a substantive explanation as to why the new  allegations are necessary. Accordingly, the Court finds no meaningful prejudice  would result from granting leave to amend.    Based on the  foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend to file a FAC is granted.      It is so ordered.    Dated:  July     , 2024                                                                                                                                                                Hon.
