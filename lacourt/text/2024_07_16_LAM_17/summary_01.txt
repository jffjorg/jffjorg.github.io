And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the judgment and dismiss the case. The plaintiff filed a first amended complaint alleging defamation, violation of due process, wrongful termination, racial discrimination, and failure to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination against the defendant, Los Angeles Community College District. The defendant's unopposed motion for summary judgment was granted, resulting in the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff then filed a motion to set aside the judgment and vacate the dismissal, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). However, the judge found that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements of the statute, as the motion was filed more than six months after the entry of judgment and was not accompanied by a proposed opposition to the motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff also failed to file any responsive filing to the motion that resulted in dismissal. Therefore, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the judgment and dismiss the case.
