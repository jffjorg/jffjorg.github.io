And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Jon R. Takasugi, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jose Guadalupe Soto-Rodriguez, et al. vs. AKG TRADING (USA) INC., et al. (Case No. 23STCV08440). The case involves allegations of negligence, strict liability, and breach of implied warranties against 39 defendants.

The Judge has granted the motions to strike filed by defendants Dal-Tile International, Inc., Dal-Tile LLC, and Mohawk Industries, Inc. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's first amended complaint (FAC) violates the toxic tort pleading requirements of Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc. The Judge agreed, citing a similar ruling in a previous case.

The Judge has also denied the motion to quash filed by defendant Cosentino, arguing that the court lacks jurisdiction. The motion was continued to allow for jurisdictional discovery, but no supplemental briefing was filed, and the Judge found no basis for granting the motion.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing. If all parties submit, the court will adopt this tentative as the final order. If not, the motion may be placed off calendar.
