  Case Number:  21CMCV00138    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  A  21CMCV00138   Joel K. Briley v. Rocket Minjizzle Tuesday,   September 26, 2023 at 8:30 a.m.   [TENTATIVE]  ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADING BY DEFENDANT   I.         BACKGROUND       The first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleges  that the parties formed a trucking company, Rocket’s Resolutions Trucking, LLC,  (the “LLC”) to provide delivery services to third parties. To that end, the LLC  bought a 2016 Peterbilt tractor truck (“the truck”). Plaintiff alleges  Defendant dissolved the Company and transferred title to the truck to herself  without Plaintiff’s consent.  Plaintiff  alleges claims for breach of contract, fraud, conversion, claim and delivery, breach  of fiduciary duty, accounting, unjust enrichment, and common counts.           II.       ARGUMENTS       Defendant argues  that all causes of action are defective and leave to amend should not be  granted. Instead of filing an opposition, Plaintiff requests 180 days to file a  written response since he is now self-represented and does not know how to  prepare a response.  III.     LEGAL STANDARDS        A party can move for  judgment on the pleadings on grounds the complaint does not state facts  sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 438 subd. (c)(B)). A motion for  judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer and  attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters  subject to judicial notice. (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep  (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064). For the purposes of this motion, all  properly alleged material facts are deemed true. (Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) IV.     DISCUSSION       Plaintiff filed a Judicial Council form  complaint while he was self-represented. The Hon. Thomas D. Long granted  Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleading with leave to amend. Plaintiff  retained counsel, who filed a first amended complaint in pleading form with  facts to support each cause of action. All causes of action are adequately  supported by the alleged facts.  Accordingly,  Plaintiff’s request for additional time to file an opposition is denied as  moot. A.      First cause of action for breach  of contract        The elements of a claim  for breach of contract are (1) the existence of a valid and existing contract  between the parties, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for non-performance,  (3) defendant’s breach; and (4) resulting damage. (Richman v. Hartley (2014)  224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) A written  contract may be pleaded either by its terms, set out verbatim in the complaint,  or Plaintiff may attach a copy of the contract the complaint and incorporate it  by reference. (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 993.) Plaintiff may also allege the  contract by its legal effect by alleging the substance of its relevant terms. Id.  at 993.        The contract claim is  adequately alleged. Plaintiff sets forth the material terms of the agreement to  form a partnership named Rocket’s Resolutions Trucking, LLC, with each party  holding equal shares. (FAC ¶ 4.)  The  parties agreed to purchase a truck on behalf of the LLC, contract with a third  party who needed trucking services, and split the profits. (FAC ¶ 5-6, 13-15.) Pursuant  to the agreement, the parties purchased a truck on behalf of the LLC with  Plaintiff making payments toward the purchase of the truck. Plaintiff subsequently  contracted with a third party and drove the truck in February and March of  2021. (FAC ¶¶6-8, 10). Defendant breached the contract by dissolving the LLC  without notice to Plaintiff and took title to the truck in her own name. (FAC ¶¶  17.)  B.       Second cause of action for  fraudulent misrepresentation        A claim for fraud requires facts to  support the following elements: (1) a misrepresentation, (2) made with  knowledge of its falsity, (3) Defendant intended to defraud Plaintiff, i.e.,  induce Plaintiff’s reliance, (4) Plaintiff justifiably relied on the  misrepresentation, (5) causing damage. (Nagy v. Nagy (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1262,  1268. Fraud claims are subject to strict requirements  of particularity in pleading. (Id.) The particularity requirements  necessitate pleading facts showing “how, when, where, to whom, and by what  means the representations were tendered." (Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73.) The  requirement “applies not only to the alleged misrepresentation, but also to the  elements of causation and damage." (Moncada v. West Coast Quartz  Corp. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 768, 776.)       Plaintiff alleges that Defendant made a  knowingly false representation stating Defendant “honor the parties’ agreement”  which was purportedly made on January 1, 2021, when the parties entered into  the partnership agreement. (FAC ¶ 13, 20.) The FAC, read as a whole, supports all  elements with specificity. (FAC ¶¶ 21-24.) C.     Third cause of action for conversion       To  prevail on a claim for conversion, Plaintiff must establish his ownership  interest at the time of the conversion and Defendant’s wrongful act or  dispossession of Plaintiff’s property rights, in a manner inconsistent with  those rights. (Moore v. Regents of University of California (1990) 51  Cal.3d 120, 136.)       Plaintiff  alleges he had a 50 percent interest in the LLC which owned the truck. (FAC ¶  5.) Defendant allegedly acted wrongfully by changing title to the truck without  Plaintiff’s consent. (FAC ¶ 27-28.) D.     Fourth cause of action for breach of fiduciary  duty        A  claim for breach of fiduciary duty requires facts to show the existence of a  fiduciary relationship, breach of that duty, causation and damages caused by  the breach. (Mosier  v. Southern California Physicians Ins. Exchange (1998)  63 Cal.App.4th 1022, 1044.)       Contrary to Defendant’s arguments,  Plaintiff is not required to allege who was the manager of the LLC, nor is the  operating agreement required to be alleged or attached to the complaint. There  is no authority for Defendant’s claim that Plaintiff must allege what payments  he made toward the truck. Plaintiff alleges the parties agreed to form an LLC  with each party holding equal shares. (FAC ¶ 4.) Business partners and joint  adventures are typically recognized as fiduciary relationships in the  commercial context. (Wolf  v. Superior Court (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 25, 30.)  E.     Sixth cause of action for accounting       A claim for  accounting requires a showing that a relationship exists between the plaintiff  and defendant that requires an accounting, and that some balance is due the  plaintiff that can only be ascertained by an accounting [citations omitted].” (Teselle v. McLoughlin (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 156, 179). The right to an accounting can arise from the  possession by the defendant of money or property which, because of the  defendant's relationship with the plaintiff, the defendant is obliged to  surrender. (Id.) The allegations support the claim.  F.      Seventh cause of action for unjust enrichment       Unjust enrichment is not a cause of action  but is an equitable principle that underlies “various legal doctrines and  remedies.” (County  of San Bernardino v. Walsh (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 533, 542.) The  elements for a claim of unjust enrichment are the receipt of a benefit and  unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another.” (Lectrodryer  v. Seoulbank (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 723, 726.)  “Benefit” means any type of advantage. (First  Nationwide Savings v. Perry (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1657, 1662.)       The inclusion of this claim does not  render the FAC defective. The allegations previously discussed adequately  support it.  G.     Eighth cause of action for common count (money  had and received.)             A common count is  properly asserted “whenever the plaintiff claims a sum of money due, either as  an indebtedness in a sum certain, or for the reasonable value of services,  goods, etc., furnished. (Kawasho  Internat., U.S.A. Inc. v. Lakewood Pipe Service, Inc. (1983)  152 Cal.App.3d 785, 793.) Defendant does not cite any  authority for the proposition that Plaintiff must allege the amount due with  certainty. Plaintiff has alleged a claim for accounting, which is asserted  whenever the amount due cannot be stated with certainty without an accounting.    V.       CONCLUSION       Based on the  foregoing, Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleading is DENIED.
