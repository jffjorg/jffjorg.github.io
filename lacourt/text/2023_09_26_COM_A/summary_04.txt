Here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is a continuation of a hearing on a motion to compel General Motors, LLC (Defendant) to provide further responses to document requests served on August 19, 2022. The Plaintiff, Lizandro Gonzalez, alleges that the vehicle he purchased from General Motors suffered from widespread defects that the company failed to repair within a reasonable number of attempts, in violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Defendant has repeatedly failed to provide code-compliant responses and has made boilerplate objections without supporting evidence.

The Court has previously addressed similar issues in other cases involving General Motors and has observed a dramatic increase in motions to compel further responses to document requests. The parties are ordered to meet and confer with the Court's prior rulings in mind and to file joint statements detailing their efforts to resolve their issues. If the parties are unable to resolve their issues, they must file short briefs and declarations detailing their efforts to meet and confer. The hearing on this motion is continued to October 31, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
