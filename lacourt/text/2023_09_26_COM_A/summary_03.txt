And here is a summary in English text of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge is considering a case where the existence of an employment relationship between the parties is disputed. The Judge has reviewed the undisputed facts (UF) and found that Brinderson LLC (BLLC) provided instrumentalities, tools, and a place of work for the individual performing services. However, the disputed facts (DP) related to the nature of the services performed and the parties' intentions are still in question.

The Judge will consider the following factors to determine if an employment relationship exists: whether the services are part of a distinct occupation or business, the skill required, the length of time the services are to be performed, the method of payment, and whether the work is a part of the regular business of the principal.

The Judge notes that the existence of an employment relationship is a complex issue and will require further analysis and evidence before a final determination can be made. The Judge will use BLLC to differentiate from other Brinderson entities and will consider the California Labor Code and relevant case law, including Ayala v. Antelope Valley Newspapers, Inc. (2014) 59 Cal.4th 522.
