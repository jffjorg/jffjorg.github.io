## English Text Summary

This tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by the Plaintiff, Sintia Garcia, and The People to unseal the complaint in a case alleging violations of the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act.  

The case involves the death of Garcia's co-parent and son, who were employed by Bayview Services, Inc. Garcia filed a worker's compensation claim after their deaths, but the claim was denied by Bayview's insurer, Great Divide Insurance Company.  

The Plaintiff alleges that employees of Bayview, named as Defendants, made false statements to support the denial of the claim, making Garcia ineligible for death benefits.  

Under Insurance Code section 1871.7, the court must allow service on the defendants after the Insurance Commissioner and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office decline to intervene. Both entities have declined to intervene in this case.

While the complaint itself was not originally filed under seal, confidential cover sheets were placed under seal. The court grants the motion to unseal the confidential cover sheets and proof of service, allowing the Plaintiff to proceed with the case.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion to unseal the complaint in the case of The People v. Juan Zaragoza, et al. The complaint alleges that the Defendants, employees of Bayview Services, Inc., made false and misleading statements to support the denial of a worker's compensation claim filed by Sintia Garcia, whose co-parent and son were killed while traveling to work for Bayview. The Judge notes that the complaint was not filed under seal initially, but the Confidential Cover Sheets and proof of service were. Since the Insurance Commissioner and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office have declined to intervene in the matter, the Court grants the motion to unseal the complaint with respect to the Confidential Cover Sheets and proof of service filed under seal. The Judge cites the Insurance Code (Ins. Code, § 1871.7) as the basis for the ruling.
