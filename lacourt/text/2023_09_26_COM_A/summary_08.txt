And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to unseal the complaint and Confidential Cover Sheets. The complaint alleges a claim under the Insurance Frauds Prevention Act on behalf of the plaintiff and Sintia Garcia, whose co-parent and son were employed by Bayview Services, Inc. and were killed while traveling to work. The complaint alleges that defendants, employees of Bayview, made false and misleading statements to support the contention that the decedents were not in the course and scope of employment, making Garcia ineligible for worker's compensation death benefits. The Insurance Commissioner and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office have declined to intervene in the matter, which permits the plaintiff to proceed with the action and allow service on the defendants. The court grants the motion with respect to the Confidential Cover Sheets and proof of service filed under seal.
