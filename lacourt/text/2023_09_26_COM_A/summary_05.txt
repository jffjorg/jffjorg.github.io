And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to set aside the default entered against him on April 10, 2023. The defendant claims that the default was entered due to his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and that he did not understand the significance of the complaint or other court documents filed against him in two other counties. The plaintiff argues that the defendant has not shown facts to support the requested relief and that the motion was not made in a reasonable time, causing prejudice to the plaintiff.

The court finds that the defendant's excuse for not appreciating the legal significance of the summons and complaint is valid, and that he did not substantially delay in making the motion. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not shown any prejudice that would result from vacating the entry of default, as the plaintiff's alleged financial hardship is a damage claim that can be tried on the merits.

Accordingly, the court grants the defendant's motion to set aside the default and orders the defendant to file a verified answer in compliance with statute. The court also denies the plaintiff's request to impose a penalty of $1,000 against the defendant under the circumstances.
