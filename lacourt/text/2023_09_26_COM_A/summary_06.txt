And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has taken the demurrer to the complaint off calendar as it has been rendered moot by the filing of the first amended complaint. The anti-SLAPP motion filed by the defendants, Hertz Car Rental and Ally Bank, to strike the first through third causes of action alleged in the complaint is granted. The defendants have made a prima facie showing that the claims arise from their constitutionally protected activity in connection with the underlying dispute and settlement agreement. The plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of proof and the first through third causes of action are stricken. The defendants are entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs as prevailing parties.
