**Case Number:** 21CMCV00138

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Parties:** Joel K. Briley (Plaintiff) v. Rocket Minjizzle (Defendant)

**Background:** Joel K. Briley and Rocket Minjizzle formed a trucking company, Rocket's Resolutions Trucking, LLC, to provide delivery services. The company bought a 2016 Peterbilt tractor truck. Briley alleges that Minjizzle dissolved the company and transferred the truck title to herself without Briley's consent. Briley claims breach of contract, fraud, conversion, claim and delivery, breach of fiduciary duty, accounting, unjust enrichment, and common counts.

**Judge's Tentative Ruling:** The Judge tentatively denies Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleading. All causes of action are adequately supported by the alleged facts.

**Discussion:**

- **First cause of action - Breach of contract:** Briley sets forth the material terms of the agreement to form a partnership, and Defendant breached the contract by dissolving the LLC without notice and taking the truck title.
- **Second cause of action - Fraudulent misrepresentation:** Defendant made a knowingly false representation stating she would honor the parties' agreement. Plaintiff alleges the misrepresentation with specificity.
- **Third cause of action - Conversion:** Plaintiff had a 50% interest in the LLC which owned the truck. Defendant wrongfully changed the truck title without Plaintiff's consent.
- **Fourth cause of action - Breach of fiduciary duty:** Business partners are typically recognized as fiduciary relationships. Plaintiff alleges the parties agreed to form an LLC with equal shares.
- **Sixth cause of action - Accounting:** The right to an accounting can arise from the possession by the defendant of money or property which the defendant is obliged to surrender.
- **Seventh cause of action - Unjust enrichment:** The elements for a claim of unjust enrichment are the receipt of a benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another.
- **Eighth cause of action - Common count (money had and received):** Plaintiff has alleged a claim for accounting, which is asserted whenever the amount due cannot be stated with certainty without an accounting.

**Significant Statements:**

- "For the purposes of this motion, all properly alleged material facts are deemed true."
- "Plaintiff’s request for additional time to file an opposition is denied as moot."
- "All causes of action are adequately supported by the alleged facts."
