## Case Summary: Simplified Labor Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Tricap Int'l, et al. (23CMCV00858)

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Simplified Labor Staffing Solutions, Inc.
* **Defendants:** Tricap International, Caryn Blanc, Allan Parker, and ADP Express, LLC

**Case Background:**

Plaintiff obtained a $1,910,337.59 judgment against Tricap International on May 14, 2021. Plaintiff alleges Tricap has attempted to conceal its assets through various means, including transferring assets to Blanc and Parker, and that ADP is Tricap's alter ego.

**Plaintiff's Claims:** 

Plaintiff alleges claims for:

* Actual and constructive fraudulent conveyance
* Setting aside a void encumbrance or lien
* Alter ego liability
* Civil conspiracy

**Defendant's Arguments:**

Defendants demur to all claims, arguing that:

* Plaintiff fails to state sufficient facts to support each element of the claims.
* The third cause of action is not a cognizable claim.
* The alter ego allegations are insufficient.
* The conspiracy claim is barred by the statute of limitations.

**Court's Ruling:**

The court sustains the demurrer to all causes of action **with 30 days leave to amend**. 

**Reasons for Sustaining Demurrer:**

* **First & Second Causes of Action (Fraudulent Conveyance):** Plaintiff fails to adequately allege "badges of fraud" – specific facts demonstrating an intent to defraud creditors. The allegations are based on information and belief without providing supporting evidence.
* **Third Cause of Action (Void Encumbrance):** The claim is "mislabeled" and lacks clarity regarding the specific legal relief sought.
* **Fourth Cause of Action (Alter Ego):** Plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and do not provide sufficient factual support to establish both unity of interest and ownership and unjust result resulting from treating Tricap as a separate entity.
* **Fifth Cause of Action (Conspiracy):** While the statute of limitations is not clearly applicable to the fraudulent transfer claims, the conspiracy claim is barred because Plaintiff fails to adequately allege a separate tort.

**Next Steps:**

Plaintiff has 30 days to amend the complaint and address the deficiencies identified by the court.


**Significant Statements:**

* "Plaintiff has failed to allege with specificity badges of fraud."
* "Plaintiff’s allegations conclusory allegations are not supported by any facts."
* "A conspiracy 'must be activated by the commission of an actual tort.'"

* Plaintiff's claim for alter ego is insufficient because it does not allege a unity of interest and ownership, and an unjust result if the corporation is treated as the sole actor.
