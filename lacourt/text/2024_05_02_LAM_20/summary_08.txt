And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a subpoena issued by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had issued a subpoena to the Defendant's former counsel, Anahita Kouroshnia, seeking documents and communications related to the requests for admission at issue. The Defendant sought to quash the subpoena, arguing that it seeks information subject to the attorney-client privilege. The Plaintiff argued that the privilege has been impliedly waived because the Defendant's communications with Kouroshnia were placed at issue when the Defendant filed its motion to withdraw its admissions. The Judge ruled that the substance of Kouroshnia's communications have not been placed directly at issue by the withdrawal motion, and therefore, the privilege has not been waived. The Judge granted the Defendant's motion to quash the subpoena and declined to award sanctions.
