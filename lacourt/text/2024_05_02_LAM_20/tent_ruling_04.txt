Defendants Cal Homes Group, Inc., Eddie Salinas, and HVMJ, LLC seek to compel the depositions of Plaintiffs David and Connie Reed.  Alternatively, Defendants seek terminating sanctions because this is the second time that they have sought to compel Plaintiffs’ depositions as Plaintiffs did not comply with the Court’s March 8, 2024, order.  The Court, in the exercise of its discretion, will only compel the depositions of the Plaintiffs.  The depositions are to be completed within 20 days on dates selected by Defendants.  The Court awards reduced monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,000.  If Plaintiffs do not appear, the Court will enter terminating sanctions. Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
