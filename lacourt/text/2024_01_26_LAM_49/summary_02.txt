Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Sofia Moreno v. Thomas James Turner, et al. The case involves a demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint and a motion to strike certain allegations.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer to the Thirteenth Cause of Action, which alleges breach of fiduciary duty by New Era Escrow, Inc. and Terrica Banks. The Judge has also struck the allegations against Defendant Terrica Banks, finding that they are not relevant to the case.

The Judge has ordered the Defendants to file an Answer to the Second Amended Complaint (minus the Thirteenth Cause of Action) within 14 days. The Judge has also ordered the Plaintiff to give notice, unless waived.

The Judge's ruling is based on the pleadings and the law. The Judge has taken judicial notice of certain exhibits and has considered the legal standards and precedents relevant to the case. The Judge has found that the Plaintiff has not alleged facts supporting the existence of a confidential relationship between the parties, and therefore, the alleged breach of fiduciary duty is not a cognizable cause of action.
