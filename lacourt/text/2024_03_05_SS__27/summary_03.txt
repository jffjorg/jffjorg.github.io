And here is the English-text summary:

The Honorable Judge Lee S. Arian has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motions to compel the depositions of plaintiffs Micaela Jaramillo Macias and Amelia Jaramillo. The defendants, Jose Manuel Gudino and Wendy Romero Diaz, had moved to compel the depositions after the plaintiffs failed to appear for a scheduled deposition on February 6, 2024. The judge found that the defendants had not made a sufficient attempt to meet and confer with the plaintiffs before filing the motion, as required by law. The judge therefore denied the defendants' motions to compel depositions, but ordered the parties to meet and confer by March 8, 2024 to select a mutually agreeable date for the plaintiffs' depositions.
