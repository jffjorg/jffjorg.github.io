BACKGROUND¿¿ 
 
On February 24, 2021, Plaintiff Monique Von
Flotow initiated the current lawsuit for general negligence and premises
liability against Defendant THE BAY CLUBS COMPANY, LLC. On July 21, 2023,
Defendant served Plaintiff with its request for the production of documents,
set one, and form interrogatories, set one. (Capabianco Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. A &
B.) The deadline to respond to these discovery requests was August 20, 2023.
From August 2023 to January 2024, Plaintiff's counsel requested numerous
extensions, all granted by Defendant. (Capabianco Decl., ¶ 7-10.) Despite these
extensions, Plaintiff did not provide any discovery responses. As a result, on
January 25, 2024, Defendant filed the current motion to compel and request for
sanctions. (Capabianco Decl., ¶ 11.) While Plaintiff has filed an opposition, it
does not challenge the request to compel; Plaintiff’s counsel requests
additional time to reestablish contact with her client. Defendant opposes this
request for an extension in its reply.
 
ANALYSIS¿¿ 
¿¿ 
1.  Interrogatories and Requests for Production 
 
A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)¿ 
 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)¿ 
 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that
the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of
the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery
process includes failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of
reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit
Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)¿¿¿ 
 
It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not serve
timely initial responses to Defendant's form interrogatories Set One and
Requests for Production Set One. Defendant claims they have lost contact with
their client and requests 60 more days from the court to reestablish contact.
However, Defendant fails to provide legal authority for the court to grant such
an order. Furthermore, Defendant afforded Plaintiff a 5-month extension from
August 2023 to January 2024. Defendant has not demonstrated how granting
another 60 days would enable Plaintiff to reestablish contact, given the 5
months already provided by Defendant. Therefore, the present motions to compel
are GRANTED. 
 
2.  Sanctions¿ 
¿ 
Plaintiff's failure to provide timely
responses necessitated Defendant's filing of the present motions, leading to Defendant
incurring attorney's fees. Defendant has requested $2,310.00 in attorneys' fees.
((Declaration
of Yusof S. Nazari, ¶ 3.) Considering the simplicity of the issues involved, the Court
reduces the sanctions awarded to $1,000. Further, because Plaintiff's counsel
has made diligent, albeit unsuccessful attempts to communicate with Plaintiff
(Adams Decl. ¶ 6-10), the Court will impose sanctions on Plaintiff only. 
Accordingly, the Court orders Plaintiff to pay
sanctions in the amount of $1,000 to Hawkins Parnell & Young, payable
within 30 days of today.
