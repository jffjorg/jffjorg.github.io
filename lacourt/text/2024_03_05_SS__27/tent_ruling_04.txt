BACKGROUND  
 
On March 24,
2022, Plaintiff filed the present slip and fall case. On March 23, 2023,
Defendant City of Los Angeles (City of LA) served its Special Interrogatories
Set One and Request for Production Set One on Plaintiff. (Krueger Decl. ¶ 2.)
The deadline to respond was April 25, 2023; however, no responses were provided
by that date. (Krueger Decl. ¶ 4.) Consequently, on June 27, 2023. Defendant
brought the present motions to compel.  
 
On
February 21, 2024, Plaintiff served discovery responses to Defendant City of
Los Angeles’ Special Interrogatories Set One and Request for Production Set
One. (Reyes Decl. ISO Non-Opposition to City of Los Angeles’ Motions ¶ 3.) Plaintiff does not oppose the present
motions. 
 
ANALYSIS  
  
1.  Interrogatories
and Requests for Production
 
A plaintiff may make a demand for production
of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10
days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom
the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020,
subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production
of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the
formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party may
propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the subject
matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).) 
 
The party whom the request is propounded upon
is required to respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the
parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such
agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).) 
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a
request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request is
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)  
   
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030,
subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a
monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes failing to
respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (d).)   A court has
discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791.)   
  
It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not serve
timely initial responses to Defendant City of LA’s Special Interrogatories Set
One and Requests for Production Set One. However, Plaintiff served verified
responses to the discovery requests at issue on February 21, 2024, before the
hearing date. Consequently, the present motions are now moot and are therefore
DENIED.  
 
2.  Sanctions 
 
Plaintiff's
failure to provide timely responses necessitated Defendant's filing of the present
motions, leading to Defendant incurring attorney's fees. Defendant has
requested $1,793.00 in attorneys' fees for each motion based on two (2) hours
researching, drafting, and preparing the instant motion. Defendant expected to
spend approximately two (2) hours reviewing that opposition and preparing a
Reply Brief. Defendant expected to spend one (1) hour in connection with
attendance at the hearing of the instant motion; however, since this is one of
three (3) motions set for hearing for Defendants, Counsel reduced the hearing
time allocated to this motion to approximately one-third of one hour. The
hourly rate is $400 per hour. In addition, the filing of this motion was
subject to a $60.00 filing fee. (Krueger Decl. ¶ 5.) 
Considering the duplicative nature of
the motion, simplicity of the issues involved, and Plaintiff’s declaration of
non-opposition, the Court hereby reduces the sanctions awarded from what was
requested.  The court finds it reasonable to allocate two hours for the
preparation of each motion, but reduced time for the hearing for each motion to
fifteen minutes (¼ of an hour). Consequently, the court hereby orders Plaintiff
and her counsel, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions in the amount of $1000
to Defendant City of LA, payable within 30 days of today.
