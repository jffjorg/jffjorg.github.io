And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Long Beach has filed a motion to amend its Second Amended Cross-Complaint to add an express contract indemnity cause of action against ASM Global. The City alleges that it inadvertently omitted this cause of action from its original pleading. The Court has reviewed the motion and finds that it is timely and will not prejudice ASM Global's defense. The Court has granted the motion and orders that the proposed amended pleading be filed and served within five court days.
