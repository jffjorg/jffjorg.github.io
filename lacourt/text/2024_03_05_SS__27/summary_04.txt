The City of Los Angeles has also moved for sanctions due to Janeese Johnson's failure to respond.

However, the judge has granted the City of Los Angeles' motion for sanctions and ordered Janeese Johnson and her counsel to pay $1000 to the City of Los Angeles. The judge has also reduced the amount of sanctions awarded from what was requested by the City of Los Angeles.
