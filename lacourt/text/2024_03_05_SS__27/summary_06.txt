And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Honorable Judge Lee S. Arian has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Howard S. Blumenthal. The motion was filed on January 31, 2024, citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which renders it unreasonably difficult for Plaintiff's counsel to continue representing the plaintiffs. The Court finds that this breakdown is proper grounds for withdrawal. The Court also finds that the moving party has filed the required documents and that granting the motion will not prejudice the plaintiff or disrupt the orderly process of justice. The trial date has been continued to June 20, 2024, which should be sufficient time for the plaintiff to retain new counsel.
