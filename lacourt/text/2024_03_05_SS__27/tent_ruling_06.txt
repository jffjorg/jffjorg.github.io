 Case Number:  22STCV20445    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  27 Complaint  Filed:      6/22/2022      Hon. Lee S.  Arian   Department 27   Tentative Ruling    Hearing  Date:           3/5/2024 at 1:30  p.m.    Case  No./Name.:      22STCV20445 CAROL  DANIELS, et al. vs MARIA DULCE PENALOZA Motion:                    MOTION  TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL Moving  Party:           Plaintiff’s  Counsel Howard S. Blumenthal Responding  Party:    Plaintiffs Carol Daniels and Alvin Daniel Notice:                     Sufficient        Ruling:                     MOTION  TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL IS GRANTED.   Background On 6/22/2022, Plaintiffs Carol  Daniels and Alvin Daniel initiated a vehicle accident lawsuit against  Defendants. Plaintiffs are represented by Attorney Howard S. Blumenthal.  Initially, the trial was scheduled for 4/17/2024. Parties stipulated and  continued the trial to 6/20/2024. On 1/31/2024, Plaintiff’s counsel moved to be  relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client  relationship, which rendered it unreasonably difficult, if not impossible, for  Plaintiff's counsel to continue representing Plaintiffs. No opposition has been  filed.   Legal Standard The Court has discretion to allow an  attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there  is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of  justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People  v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)  A motion to be relieved as counsel  must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),  MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the  client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of  Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).)  Analysis and Conclusion Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel for  Plaintiff on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client  relationship. (Sheehan Decl., ¶ 4.) The Court finds this to be proper grounds  for withdrawal. A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for  allowing the attorney to withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188  Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) The Court further finds that the moving party has filed  the required documents to be relieved. The trial date for this action has been continued to  June 20, 2024, which should be sufficient time for Plaintiff to retain new  counsel. Thus, the Court finds that granting the motion will not prejudice  Plaintiff and not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  Plaintiff’s non-opposition supports this  finding.  Thus, the motion to be relieved  as counsel is GRANTED.   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE:¿¿¿    If a party intends to submit on  this tentative ruling, the party must send an email to  the court at sscdept27@lacourt.org with the subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.  The body of the email must include the hearing date and time,  counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.         Unless all parties submit by email to this  tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely or in person  for oral argument.  You should assume that others  may appear at the hearing to argue.  ¿¿¿¿¿  If the parties neither submit  nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the  tentative ruling as the order of the Court.  After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may  prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.
