And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendants MICBRI Properties, LLC and Highpoint Real Estate, Inc. against plaintiffs Nataliia Tsepenyuk, Vadim Tsepenyuk, Nataliia Tsepenyuk as Guardian ad Litem for Svitlana Kolomiichuk, an incapacitated adult, and Nataliia Tsepenyuk as Guardian ad Litem for Avraam Tsepenyuk, a minor.

The judge sustains the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend to the second cause of action for nuisance, the third cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress, and the fourth cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. The judge also grants the motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to support punitive damages. The judge grants the motion to strike the request for attorneys' fees in the first four causes of action, finding that they do not allege a statutory or contractual basis for fees.

The judge denies the motion to strike the request for attorneys' fees in the fifth cause of action, finding that it sufficiently alleges a statutory basis for fees. The judge also grants the defendants' demurrer to the fourth cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, finding that the complaint fails to allege whether the cause of action is based on contract or tort.

The judge orders that the defendants give verbatim notice of this tentative ruling.
