  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to
  special interrogatories
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Angela Zoreh Farsad
Nezhad (a/k/a Angela Farsad)            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Alliance Health Choice, Inc. 
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories 
The court
considered the moving papers and opposing declaration filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Angela Zoreh Farsad Nezhad (a/k/a Angela Farsad)
(“Plaintiff”) filed the pending motion to compel responses to special
interrogatories on February 26, 2024, moving the court for an order (1)
compelling defendant Alliance Health Choice, Inc. (“Defendant”) to serve
responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, and (2) awarding
monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$2,460. 
On
February 28, 2024, the court issued an order (1) granting Plaintiff’s ex parte
application, (2) ordering that the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to compel
Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s special interrogatories was advanced from
November 19, 2024 to May 6, 2024, and (3) ordering Plaintiff to give notice of
its February 28, 2024 order.  (Feb. 28, 2024 Order, pp. 1:25-2:1,
2:10.)  However, Plaintiff did not file a proof of service with the court
establishing that Plaintiff gave Defendant and all other parties who have
appeared in this action notice of the May 6, 2024 hearing date on this
motion.  Moreover, on May 3, 2024, counsel for Defendant filed a
declaration stating that he “missed this motion completely” and did not
discover its existence until that week. 
(Sabzevar Decl., ¶ 5.)  The court
acknowledges that Defendant’s counsel further stated that it was not his
intention to state that Plaintiff’s counsel was attempting to hide this motion.
 (Ibid.)  However, this declaration does not state that
Plaintiff gave Defendant notice of the May 6, 2024 hearing date on this motion.

On
May 6, 2024, the court issued an order (1) noting that Plaintiff did not file a
proof of service of the court’s February 28, 2024 order advancing the hearing
date on the pending motion, and (2) exercising its discretion to continue the
hearing on the motion to June 13, 2024, to ensure that Defendant received
notice of the hearing date on this motion. 
(May 6, 2024 Order, p. 2:2-8.) 
The court further ordered Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling to
Defendant and to all other parties who have appeared in this action, and to
file a proof of service of the notice of ruling with the court no later than
May 13, 2024.  (Id., p. 2:13-17;
May 6, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.) 
Plaintiff
has not filed a notice of ruling and proof of service of the notice of ruling
with the court.  Thus, it appears that
Plaintiff did not give Defendant and all other parties who have appeared in
this action notice of the June 13, 2024 hearing date on this motion as ordered
by the court. 
The court therefore finds that it is appropriate, and exercises its
discretion, to continue the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to special
interrogatories to ensure that Defendant receives notice of the hearing date on
the motion.
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
plaintiff
Angela Zoreh Farsad Nezhad’s motion to compel responses to special
interrogatories is continued to July 22, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.

The
court orders plaintiff Angela Zoreh Farsad Nezhad (1) to give notice of this
ruling to defendant Alliance Health Choice, Inc. and to all other parties who
have appeared in this action, and (2) to file with the court the notice of
ruling and a proof of service of the notice of ruling establishing that
defendant Alliance Health Choice, Inc. and all other parties who have appeared
in this action have been served with the notice of ruling no later than June 20,
2024.  
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  June 13, 2024
