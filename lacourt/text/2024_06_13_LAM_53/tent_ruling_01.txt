  Order RE:
 
defendants’ motion for summary judgment or,
  in the alternative, summary adjudication
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:              Defendants Keiko Hasegawa, as an individual and as personal representative of the Estate of
Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso, and Philip Sentoso, as personal representative of the
Estate of Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso

 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Plaintiff Haryati T.S. Sentoso
Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication
Defendants Keiko Hasegawa, as an individual and as personal
representative of the Estate of Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso, and Philip Sentoso, as
personal representative of the Estate of Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso (“Defendants”)
filed the pending motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary
adjudication against plaintiff Haryati T.S. Sentoso (“Plaintiff”) on June 12,
2023. 
On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to Defendants’ motion,
representing that “this case has been settled” and that the parties would be
“submitting a Stipulated Judgment in this case consistent with the terms of the
Settlement Agreement.”  (Opp., pp. 1:24,
2:1-2.)  Defendants did not (1) file a
reply disputing this representation, or (2) take this motion off calendar as
moot.  Moreover, the parties have not
filed a Stipulated Judgment or Notice of Settlement of Entire Case (Judicial
Council form CM-200) with the court. 
Thus, the court finds that it is appropriate, and exercises its
discretion, to continue the hearing on Defendants’ motion to allow the parties
to file a stipulated judgment or notice of settlement pursuant to the terms of
their settlement agreement. 
            The court orders that the hearing on
defendants Keiko Hasegawa, as an individual and as personal representative of
the Estate of Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso, and Philip Sentoso, as personal
representative of the Estate of Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso’s motion for summary
judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication is continued to July 25,
2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders defendants Keiko
Hasegawa, as an individual and as personal representative of the Estate of
Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso, and Philip Sentoso, as personal representative of the
Estate of Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
