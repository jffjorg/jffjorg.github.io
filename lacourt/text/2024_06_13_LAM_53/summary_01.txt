And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Haryati T.S. Sentoso vs. Keiko Hasegawa, et al. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, which was opposed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff represented that the case has been settled and that the parties will be submitting a stipulated judgment consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. Despite this, the defendants did not file a reply disputing this representation, nor did they take the motion off calendar. The court finds that it is appropriate to continue the hearing to allow the parties to file a stipulated judgment or notice of settlement. The court orders that the hearing will be continued to July 25, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
