And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The defendants, Joseph W. Sherman and Catherine Bampoky, have moved the court to relieve them from admissions made in response to the plaintiff, John Oursland's, requests for admission. The defendants claim that their previous response or lack thereof was due to inadvertence, mistake, or excusable neglect. However, the court finds that the defendants were served with the motion on January 17, 2024, and they later received notice of the court's ruling granting the motion. The court concludes that the defendants simply chose not to respond to the motion. While the defendants claim that this relief will not cause prejudice to the party requesting the admissions, they provide only a conclusory statement to this effect, and it is clear that the plaintiff will suffer prejudice given the imminent trial date and the defendants' failure to timely move for relief. Therefore, the court denies the defendants' motion to relieve them from admissions.
