And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ruling on Mark Canton's motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. The judge granted summary adjudication as to the first cause of action (breach of agreement, Robotech Agreement), the second cause of action (breach of agreement, DI Agreement), and the third cause of action (breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing). The judge denied summary adjudication as to the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action (negligent misrepresentation, fraud, violations of California Corporations Code Sections 25400 and 25401, et seq., and 25504, et seq.).

The judge found that Tianmu failed to show that Canton had a duty to complete the film "Robotech" and that the Robotech Agreement contained express language stating that Cinelou makes no assurances that the film will be produced or completed. The judge also found that Tianmu failed to present evidence to refute Canton's contention that the Robotech Agreement was completely integrated such that any other agreements, understandings, inducements, or conditions are barred under the parol evidence rule.

However, the judge found that there is a triable issue of fact regarding whether Canton misrepresented the likelihood of "Robotech"'s success and whether Tianmu reasonably relied on the alleged misrepresentation. Therefore, the judge denied summary adjudication as to the fourth and fifth causes of action.

Finally, the judge noted that Canton did not make any arguments in his motion or reply regarding the sixth and seventh causes of action, and therefore did not meet his initial burden to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact.
