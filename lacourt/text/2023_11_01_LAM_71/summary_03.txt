And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to grant the unopposed motion of Tucalota Creek Ranch, Alan Needle, and Kay Needle to transfer the venue of the case from Los Angeles County to Riverside County. The judge has also denied the defendants' request for sanctions. The judge's decision is based on the fact that TCR is a California Corporation with its principal place of business in Riverside County, and the contract was entered into and the training and care of the horses occurred at TCR in Riverside County. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's selection of venue in Los Angeles County was made in good faith, but the defendant's motion to transfer venue is granted because it is the proper venue for the case. The plaintiff is ordered to pay the transfer fees.
