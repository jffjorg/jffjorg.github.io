BACKGROUND
            This is a Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act action arising from the Defendant’s alleged failure to repair
Plaintiff’s vehicle in violation of the parties’ warranty agreement and Civil
Code §§ 1790-1795.8. On April 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Complaint
alleging (1) violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(d), (2) violation of Civil Code §§
1793.2(b), (3) violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(a)(3), (4) breach of express warranty
in violation of Civil Code § 1791.2(a) and 1794, and (5) breach of implied
warranty of merchantability in violation of Civil Code §§ 1791.1 and 1794. 
            On December 13, 2023, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to set one of Plaintiff’s
Discovery. No opposition has been filed. 
 
            Initially, the Court notes that motions
to compel discovery responses are required to be filed separately, with a
separate filing fee paid for each discovery request for which further responses
are sought.  While the Court exercises
its discretion in considering this single motion despite this violation of the
rules, the Court orders that Plaintiff pay to the Court the additional filing
fees within twenty days of the date of this order.
 
DISCUSSION
A
party must respond to requests for admissions within 30 days after service of
such requests. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd. (a).)  “If a party to whom requests for admission
are directed fails to serve a timely response…(a) [that party] waives any
objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The
requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.” (Id. at subd. (b).)  A motion dealing with the failure to respond,
rather than with inadequate responses, does not require the requesting party to
meet and confer with the responding party. (Deymer v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home
Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, fn. 4 [disapproved on other grounds
in Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973]). There is no time limit within
which a motion to have matters deemed admitted must be made. (Brigante v.
Huang (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1569, 1585.) 

 
A
party must respond to interrogatories and requests for production of documents
within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or
requests for production of documents are directed does not provide timely
responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling responses to
the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also waives the right to make any objections,
including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no
time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or production of
documents other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before
trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a motion to
compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) 
 
Plaintiff
provides the declaration of her counsel, who states that on or about September
22, 2023, Plaintiff served, by electronic mail, her Form Interrogatories, Set One;
Special Interrogatories, Set One; Requests for Admissions, Set One; and
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (collectively, the “Discovery”)
to the Defendant. (Nadri Bedwan Decl. ¶ 3; Exhibit 1.)  The due date of the Discovery was October 24,
2023. (Id. ¶ 6.) Counsel further states that Plaintiff did provide
Defendant with additional time to respond by November 7, 2023, but still did
not receive a response. (Id. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff emailed Defendant regarding
Defendant’s overdue responses; however, Defendant did not respond to
Plaintiff’s email on November 27, 2023. (Id. ¶ 5-6; Exhibit 2.) As of
filing the motion, Plaintiff has not received any responses from Defendant. (Id.
¶ 7.)
 
Here,
the Court finds that more than 30 days have lapsed since Defendant was served
with the Plaintiff’s Discovery. Plaintiff provided evidence that Defendant has
not submitted any responses within 30 days from its issuance. Furthermore, based
on the parties’ email communications, Plaintiff extended the time Defendant
could respond to November 7. Yet despite being given an extension, Defendant
failed to provide timely responses to Plaintiff’s Discovery. Thus, since
Defendant has not provided verified responses to Plaintiff’s discovery request within
30 days of service, Plaintiff is entitled to pursue the motion. However, regarding
Plaintiff’s RFAs, the Court notes that Plaintiff does not provide authority for
compelling responses to her RFAs. Under Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.280(b), when
a party fails to respond to RFAs, the propounding party must “move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted…” (CCP § 2033.280(b) (emphasis added).) Therefore,
the Court DENIES the motion as it pertains to Plaintiff’s RFAs.

Motion to: Compel Defendant’s Verified Responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories,
Set One; Compel Defendant’s Verified Responses to Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One; Compel Defendant’s Verified Responses to Plaintiff’s

Motion to Compel Defendant’s Responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions,

Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
