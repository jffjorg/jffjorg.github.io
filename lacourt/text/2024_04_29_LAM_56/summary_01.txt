And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules that the defendant, FCA US LLC, failed to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests within the required 30-day period. Despite being given an extension, the defendant still did not respond. The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's responses to the plaintiff's form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. However, the judge denies the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to the request for admissions. The defendant is ordered to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests within 20 days of the date of this order.
