And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the plaintiff's motion to lift the stay on the instant action. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, was employed by the defendants, Second Street Corporation, dba The Huntley Hotel & The Penthouse, et al., as a server from 2016 until her constructive termination in 2022. The plaintiff alleges that she was sexually assaulted by a co-worker, Ryan Jackson, and that the defendants failed to investigate and prevent harassment. The defendants filed a notice of appeal, which automatically stayed the proceedings. The plaintiff has moved to lift the stay, arguing that the delay is prejudicing her and that the stay will prejudice her if not lifted. The court concludes that the stay should be lifted, as the delay is unfair to the plaintiff and may result in evidence being lost or witnesses becoming unavailable. The court also rejects the defendants' arguments that the plaintiff is to blame for the delay and that the court lacks jurisdiction to lift the stay. The court grants the plaintiff's motion to lift the stay and sets a case management conference for April 30, 2024.
