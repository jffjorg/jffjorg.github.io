And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court rules that the plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, is entitled to enforce the settlement agreement between the parties. The settlement agreement was executed on April 6, 2021, and provided for the payment of $28,000 by the defendant, Uriel Julian Barraza. However, the defendant failed to make the payments as agreed upon, and the plaintiff is seeking to enforce the agreement and enter judgment against the defendant.

The court finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated grounds for entering judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, and grants the plaintiff's motion to enforce the agreement. Judgment is entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the amount of $22,774.62, which includes the principal settlement amount, interest, costs, and attorney's fees. The court orders the plaintiff to provide notice of this order.
