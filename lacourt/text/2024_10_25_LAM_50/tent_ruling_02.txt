ORDER RE:
 
MORLEY
  CONSTRUCTION COMPANY’S MOTION TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF JAYESH KUMAR’S PRODUCTION
  OF DOCUMENTS FOR FAILURE TO PRODUCE IN ACTUAL COMPLIANCE WITH RESPONSES AND
  SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTIONS


 



            
Defendant Morley
Construction Company (“Morley”) moves for an order compelling Plaintiff Jayesh
Kumar “to produce the documents in actual compliance with responses and
supplemental responses, without objections, to Defendant’s Request for
Production of Documents, Set One…” 
Morley’s motion will be
continued to a new date as set forth below. NO HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON
OCTOBER 25, 2024.   
Pursuant to the Court’s
power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conform
to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court orders
the parties in this case to participate in a meet and confer with the Court
(“Informal Discovery Conference” or “IDC”). Lead or other designated counsel
for the parties with full authority and any self-represented parties are
ordered to participate in person in an IDC. After consulting with opposing
counsel and any self-represented parties regarding available dates, Morley must
make a prompt reservation for the IDC using the Court’s online reservation
system. Morley must file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC form in the department seven
days prior to the IDC, and the responding parties may file the same form in the
department setting forth a response three days prior to the IDC.¿ ¿¿¿   
Once Morley has
confirmed an IDC date, Morley must use the Court’s online reservation system to
continue the motion to a post-IDC discovery hearing date. The parties are
ordered to have with them whatever materials are needed to make the IDC session
productive and successful. Prior to the IDC date, lead or other designated
counsel for the parties with full authority and any self-represented parties
are to meet and confer, in person or via telephone in
a further attempt to resolve as many of the issues as possible before the IDC.
(See CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).) If the parties resolve their
discovery disputes before the IDC date, Morley is ordered to take both the IDC
and the motion off calendar as soon as possible.¿¿ 
ADDITIONALLY, NO
COURTESY COPIES OF THE MOTION PAPERS WERE DELIVERED TO DEPARTMENT 50. COURTESY
COPIES MUST BE PROVIDED FOR ANY DOCUMENTS OVER 15 PAGES AND ANY DOCUMENTS WITH
A POINTS AND AUTHORITIES. 
Morley is ordered to
provide notice of this Order.¿¿
