The petition was filed by City of Hope and Armen Mardiros, who seek to confirm an arbitration award issued by Dr. Eldora Ellison on May 15, 2023. However, the Court finds that the petitioners failed to provide sufficient information to confirm the arbitration award, specifically failing to provide the substance of or a copy of the agreement to arbitrate. Additionally, it is unclear if the petitioners provided the respondent with notice of the hearing. As a result, the Court denies the petition without prejudice. The petitioners are ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
