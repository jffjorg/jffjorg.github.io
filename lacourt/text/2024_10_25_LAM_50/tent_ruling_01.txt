[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFF
  STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COMPANY’S MOTION TO VACATE THE
  DISMISSAL AND MOTION TO ENFORCE A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND ENTER JUDGMENT



Background 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for Subrogation
Recovery in this action on November 2, 2020 against Defendants Uriel Julian
Barraza and Emilio Barraza.  
Plaintiff indicates that
Uriel Julian Barraza and Plaintiff entered into a Stipulation for Settlement
and Order in this matter. (Mahfouz II Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. A.) On April 6, 2021, a
“Proposed Order Regarding Settlement” was filed in this matter providing, inter
alia, that “[t]his matter is HEREBY DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE in its
entirety. However, the Court shall retain Jurisdiction to enforce the
Stipulation for Settlement pursuant to California Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6…” The Order was signed on April 6, 2021. 
Plaintiff now moves for the
Court “to enforce the Stipulation for Settlement entered into by Plaintiff and
Defendant Uriel Julian Barraza…and enter judgment against [Uriel Julian
Barraza] in the amount of $22,774.62.” The motion is unopposed. 
Discussion 
“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)

“Although a judge hearing
a section 664.6 motion may receive
evidence, determine disputed facts, and enter the terms of a settlement
agreement as a judgment, nothing in section 664.6 authorizes
a judge to create the
material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have previously
agreed upon.” ((Weddington Productions, Inc. v.
Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810
[internal citations omitted, emphasis in original].) 
As set forth above,
Plaintiff indicates that Uriel Julian Barraza and Plaintiff entered into a
Stipulation for Settlement and Order in this matter (herein, the “Stipulation
for Settlement”). (Mahfouz II Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. A.) The Stipulation for
Settlement provides, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“…it is hereby agreed and stipulated that
the above captioned matter is settled in the amount of $18,000.00 as follows: 
 
A) Insurance carrier of Defendant,
Alliance United Insurance Company, shall pay the balance of the policy limit
available to Defendant under the policy of insurance issued by 
Alliance United Insurance Company in the
amount of $10,000.00. 
 
B) The balance of $8,000.00 shall be paid
by Defendant in the following manner: 
 
(1) $100.00 shall be paid
upon the signing of this agreement, and no later than March 1, 2021. 
 
(2) Defendant shall
thereafter make payments of $100.00 with each payment being due, consecutively,
on the first day of each month thereafter until the balance of $8,000.00 is
paid in full. 
 
(3) If all payments are made
as set forth above, then the payments will be interest free.” (Mahfouz II
Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. A, ¶ 4.) 
            The
Stipulation for Settlement further provides that “[s]hould Defendant fail to
make the payment, as agreed, on the first of each month, he will be deemed to
be in default of this agreement…Should Defendant be in default, the attorney
for Plaintiff will provide Defendant with written notice of the default and
Defendant will have 10 days within which to remedy the default. If Defendant
does not remedy, the attorney for Plaintiff may, by ex parte motion, submit an
order to the court for entry of judgment against Defendant without further
notice. Judgment shall be entered in the amount of $28,745.89, plus interest on
that amount, at the legal rate, from March 1, 2021, plus all costs of suit and
reasonable attorney’s fees, as well as any additional costs incurred in the
enforcement of this agreement, less any payments that have been made by
Defendant and Defendant’s insurance carrier to Plaintiff, as of that date.” (Mahfouz
II Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. A, ¶¶ 6-7.) The Stipulation for Settlement also provides
that “[i]f the court dismisses this matter, then the court shall retain
jurisdiction to enforce this stipulation pursuant to California
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.” (Mahfouz II Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. A, ¶
8.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel states
that “[o]n or about 3/01/2021, Defendant’s insurance carrier, Alliance United
Insurance Company, made a payment in the amount of $10,000.00 to Plaintiff.” (Mahfouz
II Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff’s counsel further states that “[t]o date, Plaintiff
has only received $1,200.00 from Defendant. As such, Defendant is deemed to be
in default of the Settlement Agreement. My office provided written notice of
the default to Defendant by sending Past Due Notices on 7/29/2022, and
11/02/2022.” (Mahfouz II Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. B.) Plaintiff’s counsel states, that “[t]o
date, Defendant has failed to remedy the default. There is an outstanding
balance that remains unpaid to Plaintiff by Defendant pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement.” (Mahfouz II Decl., ¶ 10.) 
As discussed, Plaintiff
requests that the Court enforce the Stipulation for Settlement and enter judgment against Uriel Julian
Barraza in the amount of $22,774.62. Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[t]he
requested Judgment of $22,774.62 is comprised of the principal settlement amount of
$28,745.89, plus interest of $3,383.14, which accrued at the legal rate of 7%
per annum since the default date of 6/1/2022, plus costs of $593.22, plus
attorney’s fees of $1,252.37, less payments received by Defendant and
Defendant’s insurance carrier of $11,200.00.” (Mahfouz II Decl., ¶ 12.) Plaintiff also asserts in the motion that
“[t]otal interest owing on the principal balance is $3,383.14 as of 2/05/2024
(date motion prepared). As of that date, interest has accrued in the amount of
$5.51 for 614 days, from the default date of 6/01/2022 to 2/05/2024 the date
this motion was prepared.” (Mot. at p. 5:21-23.)
As discussed, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, “[i]f parties to
pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 664.6, subd. (a).) 
Based on the foregoing, the
Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated grounds for the Court to enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the Stipulation for Settlement entered into
between Plaintiff and Uriel Julian Barraza. 
Uriel Julian Barraza does not
oppose the instant motion, and thus does not provide any evidence that he has
remedied the default. Uriel Julian Barraza does not oppose Plaintiff’s request
to enforce the parties’ Stipulation for Settlement. 
Conclusion 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the Stipulation
for Settlement. Judgment
is entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Uriel Julian Barraza in the total amount
of $22,774.62. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
