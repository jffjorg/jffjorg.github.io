[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Suny Khurana (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment against Defendants
E.A. Guzman Plastering, Inc. and Elias Alejandro Guzman Garcia. Plaintiff seeks
judgment in the total amount of $533,217.34, comprising $485,315.00 in damages,
$45,669.34 in interest, $733.00 in costs, and $1,500.00 in attorney’s fees. 
The
Court notes a number of defects with the submitted default judgment package.
First,
in the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that “Plaintiff has suffered damages in an
amount in excess of $250,000…including estimated costs to now complete and
correct all the work, loss of the benefit of having the items installed to
benefit from them in his home and delay damages estimated.” (Compl., ¶ 19.)
Plaintiff also alleges that he seeks a $500 penalty. (Compl., ¶ 19.) In
addition, Plaintiff alleges that “to the extent any payments were made to EAG
and GUZMAN as an unlicensed and uninsured contractor, all such payments must be
disgorged in an amount believed to be in excess of $200,000.00.” (Compl., ¶
21.) These amounts total $450,500.00. However, in the instant request,
Plaintiff seeks $485,315.00 in damages. The Court notes that “[a]
complaint…shall contain…the following:…(2) A demand for judgment for the relief
to which the pleader claims to be entitled. If the recovery of money or damages
is demanded, the amount demanded shall be stated.¿” (¿Code
Civ. Proc., § 425.10, subd. (a)¿.) ¿Code of Civil Procedure
section 580, subdivision (a)¿ “¿limits a trial court’s jurisdiction to
grant relief on a default judgment to the amount stated in the complaint.¿” (¿Dhawan
v. Biring (2015)
241 Cal.App.4th 963, 968¿.) “[I]n all default judgments the demand sets
a ceiling on recovery.” ((Finney v. Gomez (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 527, 534.)
Plaintiff seeks damages in an amount that exceeds the amount stated in the
Complaint. 
Second,
Plaintiff’s supporting declaration provides, inter alia, that “we are
requesting the court to include in the judgment $10,000 a month for each of 12
months that we were not able to move into our new home because GUZMAN failed to
finish his work timely.” (Khurana Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff does not appear to
specify how he incurred a loss of $10,000.00 a month.  
Third,
it is unclear how Plaintiff arrived at the amount of $45,669.34 in requested
interest. The Court notes that pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(3), a party seeking a default
judgment must file “[i]nterest computations as necessary.”
Fourth,
it does not appear that Plaintiff has sought to dismiss the doe defendants. A
party seeking a default judgment must file “[a] dismissal of all parties
against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment…” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(7).) 
Fifth,
Plaintiff seeks $1,500.00 in attorney’s fees. The Court notes that Plaintiff’s
request for court judgment may include “[a] request for attorney fees if
allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(9). Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges
that Plaintiff is entitled to “attorney fees under California
Civil Code section 7160…” (Compl., ¶ 19.) However, the Court is unable to
locate any Civil Code section 7160. Plaintiff does
not appear to demonstrate that any other statute or agreement of the parties
allows for attorney’s fees here. Further, Plaintiff did not provide any
evidence substantiating the requested $1,500.00 in attorney’s fees. 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. The Court will discuss further proceedings with Plaintiff at
the hearing.
