 Case Number:  24CHCV01830    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  F51  SEPTEMBER 25, 2024    PRELIMINARY  INJUNCTION  Los Angeles Superior Court Case  # 24CHCV01830    Application Filed: 7/10/24   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs Mark Gomez; and Juanita  Gomez (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)  RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants  PHH Mortgage Corporation; and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee  for Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Trust 2006-HE8 Mortgage Pass-Through  Certificates, Series 2006-HE8 (collectively, “Bank Defendants”) NOTICE: OK   RELIEF REQUESTED: A  preliminary injunction restraining the foreclosure sale of the Subject  Property.   TENTATIVE RULING: The request is denied.    BACKGROUND    This is a  wrongful foreclosure action wherein Plaintiffs own and reside at certain real  property located at 27406 Onlee Avenue, Saugus, California (the “Subject  Property”). (FAC ¶ 15.) Bank Defendants are the trustee, loan servicer, and beneficiary  of Plaintiffs’ mortgage loan. (Id. at ¶ 12.) Plaintiffs allege that their  home was at risk of foreclosure, therefore on 4/17/24, they contacted the  individual and LLC defendants (collectively, “LLC Defendants”), who advertised  that their company helps save properties from foreclosure. (Id. at ¶  22.) At the LLC Defendants’ direction, on 4/22/24, Plaintiffs executed a Grant  Deed transferring ownership of the Subject Property to the LLC Defendants, but  the foreclosure proceedings were not remedied or otherwise postponed. (Id. at  ¶¶ 24–35.)    On 5/10/24,  Plaintiffs filed their complaint against the LLC defendants, alleging a sole  cause of action for Fraud. On 7/10/24, Plaintiffs filed their first amended  complaint (“FAC”) against eight named defendants, alleging the following causes  of action: (1) Fraud – Intentional Misrepresentation; (2) Fraud – Concealment;  (3) Quiet Title; (4) Cancellation of Written Instrument; and (5) Injunctive  Relief.   On 7/10/24,  Plaintiffs filed an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order  restricting the Trustee’s Sale of the Subject Property, which the Court granted  on 7/11/24. The Court also issued an Order to Show Cause regarding why a  preliminary injunction should not be issued.   On 9/10/24,  the Bank Defendants filed its opposition to the instant request for preliminary  injunction, and the Bank Defendants’ request for judicial notice. On 9/19/24,  Plaintiffs filed their reply.   ANALYSIS   In determining whether to issue a  preliminary injunction, the Court considers two interrelated factors: (1) the  likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial and (2) the  interim harm the plaintiff will likely suffer if the injunction does not issue  as compared to the harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the injunction  does issue. (White v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 554; Smith v.  Adventist Health System/West (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 729, 749; Brown v.  Pacifica Foundation, Inc. (2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 915, 925; Amgen Inc. v.  Health Care Services (2020) 47 Cal.App.5th 716, 731.)   1.      Balancing  of Equities   In deciding on the issuance of a  preliminary injunction, the Court must balance the equities between the  parties. If denying the requested relief would result in great harm to the  plaintiff, and the defendant would suffer little harm if the relief is granted,  it is an abuse of discretion to deny relief. (Robbins v. Superior Court (1985)  38 Cal.3d 199, 205; Butt v. State of California (1992) 4 Cal.4th 668,  678 (the greater the plaintiff’s showing on one factor, the less that must be  shown on the other to support an injunction).)   Irreparable harm (i.e., inadequate  legal remedy) is one of the traditional considerations for the issuance of a  preliminary injunction. (Code Civ. Proc. § 526, subd. (a)(2).) The threat of  irreparable harm must be imminent and not a mere possibility of harm sometime  in the future. (Korean Philadelphia Presbyterian Church v. California  Presbytery (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1069, 1084.) However, plaintiffs need not  wait until they have suffered actual harm and may seek injunctive relief  against threatened infringement of their rights. (Maria P. v. Riles  (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1281, 1292; Costa Mesa City Employees’ Assn. v. City of  Costa Mesa (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 298, 305-306.)   Where a piece of real property is  under threat of sale under a deed of trust, “such damage may be considered  irreparable for in equity each parcel of real property is considered unique.” (Stockton  v. Newman (1957) 148 Cal.App.2d 558, 564.) Here, Plaintiffs argue that they  “will suffer irreparable harm if the Property is sold in the foreclosure sale.  Mortgage Defendants’ actions in pursuing the trustee sale would tend to render  any judgment against the LLC and related parties ineffectual. Additionally,  should surplus funds be available following the sale, those funds would be  payable to the LLC, which would effectuate an unjust enrichment for the LLC and  reward the fraud conducted by the LLC and its related parties.” (Pls.’ Ex Parte  App. 6:26–7:3.)    The Bank Defendants argue in  opposition that “Plaintiffs have been in default on the loan since July 2019  and have had more than five years to cure the default but failed to do so.  Indeed, Plaintiffs have been reviewed for home retention loss mitigation  options several times but unfortunately do not qualify for any programs. Prior  to this action, Plaintiffs filed multiple bankruptcy petitions to interfere  with the trustee’s sale, and their execution of a grant deed to a third party  does not, and should not, prevent the sale from proceeding.” (Defs.’ Opp. 2:8–13.)  The Bank Defendants further argue that any injunctive relief is futile because  Plaintiffs cannot cure their default under the loan. (Id. at 7:12–15.) “It  is well settled that an injunction should not issue when the party seeking the  injunction will not succeed on the merits, even though its issuance might  prevent irreparable harm, because there is no justification in delaying that  harm where, although irreparable, it is also inevitable.” (14859 Moorpark  Homeowner's Ass'n v. VRT Corp. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396, 1408.)   The Court agrees, and notes that  Plaintiffs do not dispute that the Bank Defendants are entitled to foreclose on  the Subject Property, nor do they otherwise make any showing that they are able  to tender the outstanding amount due under the loan. Based on the foregoing,  the Court finds that in balancing the hardships between the parties, the  potential harm to Plaintiffs does not outweigh the potential harm to the Bank  Defendants should the injunction not be issued.   2.      Likelihood  of Success on the Merits   A trial court may not issue an  injunction, regardless of the amount of interim harm, “unless there is some  possibility” that plaintiff will ultimately prevail on the merits of the claim.  (Jamison v. Department of Transp. (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 356, 362; Association  of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs v. County of Orange (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th  29, 49.)   Here, as the Bank Defendants  observe, “there is no relationship between the injury claimed (i.e. the  foreclosure) and the wrongful conduct asserted in the FAC (the LLC’s recording  of the grant deed).” (Defs.’ Opp. 5:13–15.) “Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive  relief must be tied to an actionable claim against Lender Defendants and it is  not. Instead, Plaintiffs are seeking to enjoin Lender Defendants from  exercising their contractual rights because Plaintiffs executed a grant deed to  a third party.” (Id. at 5:19–21.)   The Court agrees and finds that Plaintiffs  allege no wrongdoing by the Bank Defendants in this action. The crux of  Plaintiffs’ action alleges that the LLC Defendants defrauded Plaintiffs into  transferring title to the Subject Property to the LLC Defendants. Any finding  as to the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims are immaterial to the Bank Defendants’  right to foreclose on the Subject Property, which remains whether or not title  is reverted from the LLC Defendants to Plaintiffs. (FAC ¶ 21; FAC p. 31, ll.  21–22.)   Based on the foregoing, the Court  finds it immaterial to determine Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the  merits of their claims, as there is no relationship between the conduct sought  to be enjoined and any misconduct alleged in the FAC. Accordingly, the request  for a preliminary injunction is denied.   CONCLUSION    Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction is denied.
