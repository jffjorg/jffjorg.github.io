BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs bring this action under the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act (Civil Code § 1790 et seq.) for a vehicle they purchased on or
around 4/6/21, for which Defendant issued the manufacturer’s express warranty.
(Compl. ¶¶ 9, 16.) Plaintiffs allege that “defects and nonconformities to
warranty manifested themselves within the applicable express warranty period,” but
Defendant “was unable to conform the Subject Vehicle to the applicable express
warranty after a reasonable number of repair attempts.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 18, 20.) 
 
On 7/19/23, Plaintiffs filed their complaint, alleging
against the dealership and manufacturer defendants the following causes of
action: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty; (2)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty; (4) Violation of
Song-Beverly Act Section 1973.2; and (6) Negligent Repair (against the
dealership defendant). On 1/19/24, Defendant filed its answer.
 
On 12/21/23, Plaintiffs served their first set of discovery
requests on Defendant. (Decl. of Armando Lopez ¶ 4.) On 1/24/24, Defendant
served its responses thereto, with verifications served on 2/15/24. (Id.
at ¶ 5.)
 
On 4/29/24, Plaintiffs filed the instant motions to compel further
responses to the subject discovery requests. On 9/19/24, Plaintiffs filed a
notice of non-opposition to the instant motions. On 9/19/24, Defendant filed an
untimely opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further responses
to Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories, Set One.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Here, Plaintiffs seek to
compel Defendant’s additional responses the subject discovery requests, arguing
that Defendant’s objections thereto are without merit.
 
A.    Meet and Confer 
 
A motion to compel further
discovery responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration stating “facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2016.040.) 
 
Here, Plaintiffs’
counsel declares that on 3/20/24, he sent Defendant’s counsel a meet-and-confer
letter raising the issues discussed herein. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 6.) Counsel for the parties agreed to deadline
extensions for supplemental responses and any motions to compel, but no
supplemental responses were served. (Id. at ¶¶
7–9.) Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied the meet and
confer requirements under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300 and
2031.310.
 
B.     Special Interrogatory Nos. 29 and 32
 
“The
party to whom interrogatories have been propounded shall respond in writing
under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of the following: (1) An
answer containing the information sought to be discovered; (2) An exercise of
the party’s option to produce writings; or (3) An objection to the particular
interrogatory.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) “Each answer in a
response to interrogatories shall be as complete and straightforward as the
information reasonably available to the responding party permits.” (Code Civ
Proc. § 2030.220.) “If an objection is made to an interrogatory or to a part of
an interrogatory, the specific ground for the objection shall be set forth
clearly in the response.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.240, subd. (b).)
 
A propounding party may move for an order
compelling further responses to interrogatories if any of the following apply:
“(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate; or
(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.300, subd. (a).) Discovery is relevant if it is admissible as
evidence, or “appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) “Discovery may relate to
the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to
the action.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatory No. 29
asks: “Do YOU contend that your response to Plaintiff’s pre-litigation
repurchase request is a defense to liability under the Song-Beverly Act?” (Pls.’
SPROG Sep. Stmt.) In response, Defendant asserted relevance objections. (Ibid.)
Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatory No. 32 asks Defendant to “State the date on
which you contend the SUBJECT VEHICLE first qualified for a vehicle repurchase
under the Song-Beverly Act.” (Ibid.) In response, Defendant answered: “FCA
US offered to repurchase the Subject Vehicle in or about March 2023.”[1] (Ibid.)
 
As to Special Interrogatory No. 29, Plaintiffs
argue that the information sought is relevant because “whether FCA contends
that its prelitigation offer serves as a defense to liability is the exact type
of contention interrogatory that the interrogatories are permitted by the
Discovery Act.” (Id. at 1:22–24, citing Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.010,
subd. (b); Burke v. Superior Court (1969) 71 Cal.2d 276, 281 [“a
defendant in California courts may be required through discovery to disclose
not only the evidentiary facts underlying his affirmative defenses … and
denials … but also whether or not he makes a particular contention, either as
to the facts or as to the possible issues in the case.”].)
 
While Defendant stands by its relevance
objections in its late-filed opposition, it fails to offer any justification or
further explanation as to how the request seeks information not reasonably
calculated to lead to admissible evidence. Accordingly, the Court grants
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Special
Interrogatory No. 29.
 
As to Special Interrogatory No. 32, Plaintiffs
argue that Defendant failed to answer the question as asked, because “FCA is
asked to answer what date it contends the vehicle first qualified for
repurchase and FCA merely answers that FCA offered to repurchase the
vehicle on” 4/4/23. (Pls.’ SPROG Mot. 5:16–18 [emphasis added].) The Court agrees
and finds that while Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ argument is merely an
issue of semantics, the date that the subject vehicle first qualified for
repurchase certainly may differ from the date that Defendant ultimately made
its offer to repurchase. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion to
compel Defendant’s further responses to Special Interrogatory No. 32.
 
C.    RFP Nos. 28, 30–31, and 34–35
 
California law requires a
responding party to respond to each request for production of documents with
either a statement of compliance, a representation that the party lacks the
ability to comply, or an objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.210,
subd. (a).) If the response includes an objection to the demand in part, it
must also include a statement of compliance or noncompliance as set forth
above. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240, subd. (a).) Additionally, the response must
(1) identify the particular document that falls within the category of the
request to which the objection is being made, and (2) expressly set forth the
extent of, and specific ground for, the objection. (Id. at subd. (b).)¿A
propounding party may move for an order compelling further response to a
discovery request if it decides that “an objection in the response is without
merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (a).) The demanding party must take the initiative to obtain a
judicial determination of the validity of any objection by moving to compel a
further response, but the objecting party has the burden of justifying the
objection. (See, e.g., Coy v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220.)
 
Here,
Plaintiffs’ RFP No. 28 seeks Defendant’s policies and procedures “regarding
requiring a consumer in California to sign a release agreement as part of a
pre-litigation repurchase.” (Pls.’ RFP Sep. Stmt.) Defendant served
objection-only responses to RFP No. 28. (Ibid.) Plaintiffs’ RFP Nos.
30–31 seek documents evidencing Defendant’s rationale for its response to
Plaintiffs’ pre-litigation repurchase request, and documents constituting
Defendant’s pre-litigation letter in response to the repurchase request. (Ibid.)
In response, Defendant asserted the same objections and stated that it would
comply in part. (Ibid.) Plaintiffs’ RFP Nos. 34–35 seek Defendant’s
template “goodwill” pre-litigation repurchase letter(s) for vehicles
repurchased in California under the Song-Beverly Act. (Ibid.) Defendant
served objection-only responses thereto. (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiffs seek to compel further
responses to the subject RFPs because “Plaintiff has reason to believe FCA’s
response letter was generated using a template and that templates are used
systematically in generating FCA’s responses to consumers making similar
requests. Plaintiff seeks to determine whether it uses different templates when
it does—and when it does not— believe it must comply with the law and how those
responses differ.” (Pls.’ RFP Mot. 5:19–23.) “To that end, the information
sought by these Requests is relevant to showing whether FCA’s offer (and its
systematic procedures for such offers and transactions) complied with or
violated the Act, and whether FCA behaved as though it did or did not believe
its response was governed by the law.” (Id. at 5:25–28.)
 
The Court agrees and finds that
Plaintiffs have provided sufficient facts to establish the requisite good cause
for production of the subject documents. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd.
(b)(1).) In order to obtain civil penalties under the Song-Beverly Act, a
plaintiff must establish that the defendant’s failure to comply was willful,
which may include a showing that the defendant routinely engaged in a practice
of unreasonably denying pre-litigation repurchase requests without due
deliberation. (Civ. Code § 1794, subd. (c).) Information regarding these
practices is relevant to the subject matter of this action as it could assist
Plaintiffs in proving Defendant’s willful violation of the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
grants Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to RFP Nos. 28,
30–31, and 34–35.

D.    Sanctions
 
“The court shall impose a
monetary sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h).)
 
Here, Plaintiffs request
sanctions in the total amount of $5,400.00 to be imposed on Defendant and its
counsel. This amount encompasses: (1) 5.2 hours of Plaintiffs’ attorney’s time
working on the instant motions; (2) an additional anticipated 2 hours spent
reviewing Defendant’s oppositions and drafting replies; and (3) an anticipated
2 hours preparing for and appearing at the instant hearings, at counsel’s
hourly billing rate of $400.00 per hour. (Lopez Decl. ¶ 10.) Plaintiffs also
seek to recover $60.00 in filing fees per motion. (Id. at ¶ 11.) In
granting the instant motions, the Court finds it reasonable to award Plaintiffs
sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $460.00.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motions are granted. Defendant
to provide further code-compliant responses to Plaintiffs’ Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 29 and 32; and Plaintiffs’ RFPs, Set One, Nos. 28,
30–31, and 34–35 within 30 days. The Court imposes sanctions against Defendant
in the amount of $460.00, payable within 45 days.
