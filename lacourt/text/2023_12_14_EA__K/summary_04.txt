And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering whether the statute of limitations has been tolled in this case, which involves exposure to hazardous material or toxic substances. The plaintiff's claim is based on the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, which tolls the statute of limitations if a defendant's deceptive conduct has caused a claim to grow stale. To rely on this doctrine, the plaintiff must allege the supporting facts, including the date of discovery, the manner of discovery, and the justification for the failure to discover the fraud earlier.

The court is looking at three main issues: (1) whether the statute of limitations has been tolled, (2) whether the plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to support the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, and (3) whether the defendant's deceptive conduct has caused the plaintiff's claim to grow stale.

The court will consider the following laws and cases: Code of Civil Procedure ยง 340.8, Norgart v. Upjohn Co. (1999), Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005), and Fuller v. First Franklin Financial Corp. (2013).

The court's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to support the doctrine of fraudulent concealment and that the statute of limitations has been tolled. However, the court is still considering the defendant's arguments and will make a final decision at a later date.
