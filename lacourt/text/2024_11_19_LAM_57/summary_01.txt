And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has announced a tentative ruling regarding the jury instructions and deposition designations for the upcoming hearing on November 19, 2024. The court will give jury instruction CACI 450A, Good Samaritan -- Nonemergency, and instruction CACI 450C, Negligent Undertaking, overruling the defendant's objections to these instructions. On the other hand, the court will not give instruction CACI 450B, Good Samaritan -- Emergency, and will sustain the plaintiffs' objections to it. The court will also not give instruction CACI 452, Sudden Emergency, as the defendant failed to assert this affirmative defense in its answer.

Regarding deposition designations, the court was unable to address this matter overnight and will aim to resolve it on Tuesday. However, the court will meet with counsel during the day to rule on any objections the defendant may have to the additional designations intended for use in the plaintiffs' opening statement.
