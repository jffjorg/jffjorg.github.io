And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Zurich American Insurance Co. and the motion to strike filed by the same defendant. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the defendant can refile the demurrer with additional arguments or evidence. The motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages in the plaintiff's complaint has been granted with leave to amend. The judge is taking under submission the demurrers filed by the J.S. Held defendants, meaning that the judge will consider the arguments made by the defendants and will issue a final ruling at a later date. The court has overruled the demurrers filed by the J.S. Held defendants to the extent that they were based on the plaintiff's failure to include a certificate of merit in the initial complaint.
