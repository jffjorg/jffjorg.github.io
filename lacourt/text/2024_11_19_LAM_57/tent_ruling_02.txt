 Case Number:  22STCV21789    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  57 The motions of Cross-Defendant Celimar Guerra Da Silva Cohen to quash the service of the summons and Cross-Complaint against her in this action and in the related action that has case number 21STCV38449 are granted.  The motions were timely filed.  The hearing date on the motions is timely given the Court's crowded docket.  The declarations supporting the motions attesting to lack of service are more persuasive than the declarations in opposition to the motions.  The latter were not submitted by registered process servers, and they contradict the proof of service itself.
