And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Michelle C. Kim has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for substitution of Matthew Thompson as the personal representative of the deceased plaintiff Jesse Lauricella. The motion is unopposed, but the court finds that the sole declaration filed by the plaintiff's counsel is insufficient to satisfy the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 377.32. The court therefore orders the motion to be continued to July 9, 2024, to allow the moving party to cure the defect by filing a supplemental declaration. The declaration must be filed and served no later than five calendar days prior to the hearing date.
