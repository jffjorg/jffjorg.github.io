RESPONSES 
RELIEF REQUESTED
“Plaintiff,
Lisa Bayne Saavedra, moves this Court for:
1.
An order compelling Defendant Philipe R. Shupe to Further Respond to Plaintiff’s
Form Interrogatories 15.1, Set One, Set One, as they relate to all of Defendant
Shupe’s Affirmative Defenses without objections, and for:;
2.
An order compelling Defendant Shupe to Further Respond to Plaintiff's Form
Interrogatory 17.1 as it related to Plaintiff Saavedra’s Request for Admissions
#2.
3.
An award of monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,105.00 against Defendant
Shupe and his attorneys of record Adam L. Robinson, LaFollette, Johnson,

Form Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant Shupe but defendant has not
properly responded to Form Interrogatory 15.1 as it relates to all of
Defendant’s Affirmative Defenses and Form Interrogatory 17.1 as they related to
Plaintiff Saavedra’s Request for Admission #2. This Court is empowered to
compel defendant to respond to discovery, and to award sanctions pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure §§128.7, 2023.010, 2023.030, 2030.010, 2030.220, and
2030.300.
This
motion is based on this notice, the accompanying Memorandum of Points and
Authorities, the Declaration of Victoria Le and Thomas Emmitt, the attached

LEGAL
STANDARD - COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES
Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is
itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.”  The
Section specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or
defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,”
and that discovery “may be obtained of the identity and location of persons
having knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence,
description, nature, custody, condition and location of any document,
electronically stored information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”
On receipt of a
response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the
following apply:
(1)   An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete.
(2)   An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate.
(3)   An objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general.
(CCP § 2030.300(a).
If a timely motion to compel has been filed,
the¿burden is on the responding party¿to justify any objection or failure fully
to answer.¿(Coy v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58
Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a motion to compel further responses to
interrogatories]; see also¿Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 22
Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
“While the party propounding interrogatories may have
the burden of filing a motion to compel if it finds the answers it receives
unsatisfactory, the burden of justifying any objection and failure to respond
remains at all times with the party resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541 citing Coy v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
Furthermore, to the extent there is any doubt in
whether these records should be discoverable, California’s liberal approach to
discovery provides that doubt should be resolved in favor of permitting
discovery. (Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Superior Court (1970) 2
Cal.3d 161, 173.)
The party to whom interrogatories have been propounded
shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of
the following:
(1) An answer containing
the information sought to be discovered.
(2) An exercise of
the party’s option to produce writings.
(3) An objection to
the particular interrogatory.
 
(CCP §2030.210(a).)
ANALYSIS
As a
preliminary matter, both moving, opposition, and reply papers are less than
models of clarity. 
The parties often
cite inapposite statutes and case law, and generally fail to provide legal
authority for their arguments. 
For example,
Plaintiff extensively cites to CCP § 128.7, despite CCP §128.7(g) stating, “This
section shall not apply to disclosures and discovery requests, responses,
objections, and motions.”
Further,
although Plaintiff’s notice of motion indicates it is seeking to compel further
responses to FROG, Set On, 15.1 and 17.1, it does not appear as if 17.1 is at
issue before this Court. Plaintiff submitted a document called “Notice of
Striking.” 
It is
unclear what this document seeks to accomplish. The Court is guessing it is an attempt
to say that FROG 17.1 is not before this Court, but Plaintiff can confirm at
the hearing.
Either way,
17.1 would not be before this Court because Plaintiff did not include the
response to 17.1 in the Separate Statement. Plaintiff simply discussed RFA # 2,
and compelling further responses to requests for admission are not before this
Court. Plaintiff mentions that a motion to compel further responses to RFAs is
also set to be heard on 4-5-2024, but this is not the case. Plaintiff did not
file a motion to compel further responses re: RFA.
“A separate
statement is a separate document filed and served with the discovery motion
that provides all the information necessary to understand each discovery
request and all the responses to it that are at issue. The separate statement
must be full and complete so that no person is required to review any other
document in order to determine the full request and the full response. Material
must not be incorporated into the separate statement by reference. The separate
statement must include-for each discovery request (e.g., each interrogatory,
request for admission, deposition question, or inspection demand) to which a
further response, answer, or production is requested-the following:
(1)
 The text of the request, interrogatory, question, or inspection demand;
(2)  The
text of each response, answer, or objection, and any further responses or
answers;
(3)  A
statement of the factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses,
answers, or production as to each matter in dispute;
(4)  If
necessary, the text of all definitions, instructions, and other matters
required to understand each discovery request and the responses to it;
(5)  If
the response to a particular discovery request is dependent on the response
given to another discovery request, or if the reasons a further response to a
particular discovery request is deemed necessary are based on the response to
some other discovery request, the other request and the response to it must be
set forth; and
(6)  If
the pleadings, other documents in the file, or other items of discovery are
relevant to the motion, the party relying on them must summarize each relevant
document.”
(CRC, rule
3.1345(a)(1)-(6).)
Here,
Plaintiff’s Separate Statement does not include the response to RFA 17.1. Instead,
Plaintiff included further responses to RFA #2. The Court cannot evaluate
whether 17.1’s response was proper if Plaintiff does not include how Defendant
responded to 17.1. 
45-Day
Requirement
“Unless notice of this motion is given within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.” (CCP
§2030.300(c).)
Here, the Court will hear argument. Frankly, it is
hard to decipher the parties’ arguments.
Meet and Confer
“A
motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” (CCP § 2030.300(b)(1).)
The Court will hear from counsel. Defendant appears to
be arguing that the meet and confer with respect to the issues in this motion
was not sent until after the filing of this motion.  
As stated in Indio Police Command Unit
Assn. v. City of Indio (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 521, 539:

“[W]hether a party actually engaged in meetings in good faith
is generally a factual question, and the fact-finder's express
or implicit determination will be upheld on appeal if supported by substantial
evidence. [Citations.]” (Santa Clara County Correctional Peace Officers'
Assn. v. County of Santa Clara (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1016, 1027, 169
Cal.Rptr.3d 228.) “ ‘In general, good faith is a subjective
attitude and requires a genuine desire to reach agreement
[citations]. The parties must make a serious attempt to
resolve differences and reach a common ground [citation]. The
effort required is inconsistent with a “predetermined resolve
not to budge from an initial position.” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] However,
adamantly insisting on a position does not necessarily
establish bad faith. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 1044, 169 Cal.Rptr.3d
228.)
(Indio
Police Command Unit Assn. v. City of Indio (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 521, 539.)
FROG 15.1
“Identify each denial of a material allegation and
each special or affirmative defense in your pleadings and for each: 
(a) state all facts upon which you base the denial or
special or affirmative defense; 
(b) state the names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers
of all PERSONS who have knowledge of those facts; 
( c) Identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things
that support your denial or special or affirmative defenses, and state the
name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON who has each DOCUMENT.”
Response FROG 15.1
“Defendant
objects to this interrogatory on the basis that it is burdensome, oppressive
and asks that the defendant provide plaintiffs with all discovery in this case.
Responding party further objects on the grounds that this request is premature,
particularly in light of plaintiffs’ allegations which merely set forth the
elements of a cause of action for negligence, without a single fact to put the
defendant on notice as to what claim is being made against him. Furthermore,
although responding party has served initial discovery to learn the plaintiff’s
contentions, plaintiff has requested, and been granted, multiple extensions for
plaintiff to respond (which has not yet occurred). Further, Section 2
Instructions to the Asking Party (d) of plaintiffs’ Form Interrogatories
specifically provides that the interrogatories in Section 16.0 should not be
used until the defendant has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct an
investigation or discovery of plaintiff’s injuries and damages. Responding
party has initiated investigation and discovery. In addition, this
interrogatory is objected to because it seeks information that is privileged
and protected by the attorney-client privilege, Evidence Code § 1157, and the
attorney-work product doctrine, and violates California Code of Civil Procedure
§§ 2034.210, et seq.
Without waiving these objections, defendant provides
information as it understands the question as follows: With respect to the
denial of material allegations, this responding party denied generally and
specifically all allegations under the provisions of California Code of Civil
Procedure § 431.30, as responding party contends that he, at all times, met the
applicable standard of care. Discovery is continuing. As to the affirmative
defenses, they are separately delineated and further identification is unnecessary.
They were alleged prophylactically and to protect the interests of this
responding party. Discovery is in its infancy and is continuing.”
15.1 Analysis
If
a timely motion to compel has been filed, the¿burden is on the responding
party¿to justify any objection or failure fully to answer.¿(Coy v. Superior
Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories]; see also¿Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
“While the party propounding interrogatories may have
the burden of filing a motion to compel if it finds the answers it receives
unsatisfactory, the burden of justifying any objection and failure to respond
remains at all times with the party resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541 citing Coy v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
Furthermore, to the extent there is any doubt in
whether these records should be discoverable, California’s liberal approach to
discovery provides that doubt should be resolved in favor of permitting
discovery. (Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Superior Court (1970) 2
Cal.3d 161, 173.)
Here, Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to
FROG 15.1 as they relate to Defendant’s affirmative defenses.
As a preliminary matter, Defendant’s responses did not
separately identify each affirmative defense, nor did they identify subparts
(a),(b), and (c) for each affirmative defense.
Further, Defendant did not attempt to justify its
objections with legal authority. Defendant makes no argument why attorney-client
privilege or attorney-work product are appropriate objections.
The response to FROG 15.1 contained a reference to
Section 16.0 and how interrogatories in section 16.0 should not be used until
defendant has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct an investigation or
discovery of plaintiff’s injuries and damages. 
In Reply, Plaintiff points out that this is a FROG for
15.1, which isn’t a part of section 16.0. The Reply’s argument seems availing
that Defendant’s objection based on 16.0 is not on point.
 
TENTATIVE RULING 


Plaintiff’s motion
to compel further responses to FROG 15.1, Set One, is GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiff’s motion
to compel further responses to FROG 17.1, Set One, is DENIED.
 
Sanctions
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2030.300(d).)
 
“The court may
award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion
to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).) 

Plaintiff
requests the Court grant a sanctions request against Defendant and his attorney
of record, jointly and severally, in the amount of $3,105.00 to be paid within
twenty days of entering of the order.
The Le Declaration requests sanctions as follows: I
have spent 5.2 hours researching and drafting this motion and declaration, and compiling
exhibits. I expect to spend another 1.5 hours drafting the reply. I expect to
spend 1.0 hour preparing for the hearing, and attending via telephone, for a
total of 8.7 hours. I bill my time at a rate of $ 350 per hour. Including the
filing fee, the cost to Plaintiff is $3,105. (11.7 hr. x $ 350 = $ 3045 + $60 =
$3,105.) 
Opposition argues that sanctions are not warranted
because Defendant had substantial justification for their objections, and this
is a legitimate discovery dispute which does not warrant sanctions based on
objecting. Defendant argues that the time requested for sanctions is excessive
in light of there being zero unique case law to discuss 2 form interrogatories.
Defendant argues that sanctions should be imposed
against Plaintiff for failing to meet and confer in good faith. Defendant cites
to § 2023.010(i) which states, “Misuses of the discovery process include, but
are not limited to, the following: Failing to confer in person, by telephone,
or by letter with an opposing party or attorney in a reasonable and good faith
attempt to resolve informally any dispute concerning discovery, if the section
governing a particular discovery motion requires the filing of a declaration
stating facts showing that an attempt at informal resolution has been made.” (Ibid.)
Defendant also cites to § 2023.020
which states, “Notwithstanding the outcome of the particular discovery motion,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction ordering that any party or attorney
who fails to confer as required pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”(Ibid.)
Defendant requests
sanctions in the amount of $2,115.50, jointly and severally, against
Plaintiff’s counsel.
The Court will hear from
counsel.
