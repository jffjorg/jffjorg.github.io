Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a tentative ruling on a motion for attorney fees filed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Plaintiff") against Flexvisual, Inc. and Chad R. Williams (the "Defendants"). The Plaintiff seeks an award of attorney fees in the sum of $27,469.11, arguing that it is the prevailing party under CCP §1032(a)(4) and that the Contract and Guaranty contain attorney's fees and costs provisions. The judge is concerned about awarding costs because the notice of motion only requests attorney's fees and does not mention costs, and because the Plaintiff did not file a memorandum of costs with the Court. The judge also notes that the Plaintiff needs to address the service issues of the motion, including the fact that the motion was served at a Nevada address, which does not match the address on file in eCourt. The judge has scheduled a hearing to hear further argument from the Plaintiff and to resolve the issues raised in this tentative ruling.
