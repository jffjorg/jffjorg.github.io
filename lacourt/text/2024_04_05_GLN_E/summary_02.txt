Summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for relief from waiver of objections to discovery served on October 13, 2023. The defendant, James Wu, seeks relief from waiver of objections to the discovery, arguing that his failure to timely respond was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The plaintiff, Eric Chen and Cindy Chou, argue that the defendant's responses were not substantially compliant with the code. The court finds that the defendant did not demonstrate substantial compliance with the code and that the plaintiff's arguments are more properly addressed on a motion to compel further responses. The court denies the motion.
