And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge on a motion for leave to amend the Complaint to include a claim for punitive damages. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Dietrich Wilhelm Georg Lusse, who was injured in a motor vehicle accident caused by Defendant Francisco Javier Marquez. Defendant Marquez testified that his vehicle slid and lost control five times on the night of the accident, and that he knew his brakes were not working properly. Despite this, he chose to continue driving and did not pull over.

The Judge finds that the proposed amendment sufficiently alleges a basis for punitive damages and grants the motion for leave to amend. The Judge also finds that Defendant's argument that the proposed amendment would cause prejudice is unavailing. The Court notes that the merits of whether punitive damages are sufficiently alleged would be more properly addressed in a different type of motion.
