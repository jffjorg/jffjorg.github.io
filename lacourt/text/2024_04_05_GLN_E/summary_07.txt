And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court will hear arguments on the motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered against the defendant. The defendant is seeking relief under Code of Civil Procedure sections 473(b) and 473.5, as well as the court's inherent equitable power.

Under CCP section 473(b), the court finds that the defendant's motion was timely filed and that the defendant has demonstrated sufficient grounds to vacate the default and default judgment. The court notes that the defendant was not informed of the lawsuit against her until late September 2023, and that she had a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense.

Under CCP section 473.5, the court finds that the defendant has made a sufficient showing that she was not informed of the lawsuit against her in time to defend the action and that her lack of notice was not caused by her own neglect.

The court also notes that the defendant has demonstrated diligence in seeking to set aside the default once the default was discovered.

The court will hear from counsel on sanctions under CCP section 473(c).
