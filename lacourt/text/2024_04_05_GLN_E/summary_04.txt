Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel discovery responses and monetary sanctions filed by 1001 Las Lomas, LLC (Defendant) against Jose Blanco and Jacinta Blanco (Plaintiffs). The motion was filed on 11/20/2023, and over 30 days have passed since the discovery requests were served. The Judge notes that the motion appears to be filed by one Defendant, not multiple Defendants, and that the Plaintiffs were previously represented by counsel, but counsel was relieved as of 11/17/2023.

The Judge is concerned about several issues, including the fact that the motion was not filed as two separate motions, one for each Plaintiff, and whether the filing fees were paid correctly. The Judge also questions whether the discovery requests were served correctly and whether the Court can consider the motion at all.

The Judge is considering awarding monetary sanctions against the Plaintiffs in the amount of $615.00, which includes attorney's fees and a filing fee. The Judge will hear argument on the issues raised in the motion and will make a final ruling at the hearing on 4/5/2024.
