Case Summary:
The plaintiff, Lisa Bayne Saavedra, is moving for an order compelling the defendant, Philip R. Shupe, to further respond to two form interrogatories. The plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendant to provide more detailed information about his affirmative defenses and to provide information about the facts and legal bases for those defenses. The plaintiff is also seeking an award of monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,105.00 against the defendant and his attorneys for failing to comply with the discovery requests.

The defendant has objected to the interrogatories on the grounds that they are burdensome, oppressive, and premature, and that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient information to allow the defendant to respond. The defendant has also argued that the interrogatories seek information that is privileged and protected by the attorney-client privilege and the attorney-work product doctrine.

The court has reviewed the parties' arguments and has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory 15.1. The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory 17.1. The court has also awarded the plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,105.00 against the defendant and his attorneys for failing to comply with the discovery requests.

The court's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Rules of Court. The court has considered the parties' arguments and the evidence presented, and has made its decision based on the law and the facts of the case.
