Summary:

The tentative ruling is related to the Pacific Trust, a trust established for the benefit of Caroline Corman, a minor beneficiary. The petition for accounting and instructions to trustee was filed by Friedman, the Guardian Ad Litem for Caroline, due to a monthly shortfall between Elizabeth's income and Caroline's expenses. Crawford, the trustee of Brian's sub-trust, objected to the petition, claiming it is not his obligation as trustee to pay Elizabeth's expenses and that Friedman does not have authority to file the petition. The Court grants the petition for an accounting and sets the balance of the petition for further hearing. The Court also overrules Crawford's objections and requires Crawford to file an accounting and declaration showing how he has exercised his discretion consistent with the terms of the Trust.
