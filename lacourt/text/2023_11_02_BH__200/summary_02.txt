And here is the English summary:

This tentative ruling by the judge addresses a dispute between Elizabeth, who is representing herself, and Brian over control of a trust. The judge notes that Goldman Sachs, the trustee of the Pacific Trust, has responsibility for the sub-trust and that Elizabeth consulted with her father before proceeding with the case. The judge questions the motives behind Brian's concerns about teaching his daughter Caroline the wrong lessons about wealth and tax obligations, suggesting that they may be an excuse to maintain control of the trust.

The judge also addresses Elizabeth's contention that Brian made misrepresentations to induce her to execute a stipulation. The judge concludes that this issue will be decided by the Family Court. Finally, the judge notes that the notice to produce documents and corresponding objection are, to some degree, moot, but that Friedman may still seek the requested documents through discovery.
