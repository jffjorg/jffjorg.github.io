[1] The Court uses the first names of family member
parties for ease of reference and without thereby intending any disrespect. 


[2] No objection was filed by Goldman Sachs, trustee of
the Pacific Trust. As the Court understands it, Goldman has responsibility on
some level as far as what Brian’s sub-trust may receive. 


[3] The Court notes that the stipulation recites that
Elizabeth consulted with her father, an Alabama lawyer, and has elected to
proceed representing herself. 


[4] The Court questions the seemingly disingenuous
concerns stated related to teaching Caroline the wrong lessons in being allowed
to enjoy the privileges coming from her grandparents’ wealth, that she will
have a tax obligation or that Elizabeth will indirectly benefit. These seem all
excuses to assure Brian maintain as much of the Trust as possible. 


[5] Moreover, Elizabeth contends in the declaration
attached to the petition that Brian made various misrepresentations to induce her
to execute this stipulation. This would be an issue for the Family Court to
decide.  


[6] In view of this order, the notice to produce
documents, and corresponding objection, become to some degree moot. Friedman cannot
conduct discovery through a CCP sec. 1987 notice to appear; however, he may seek
the requested documents (not revealed by the accounting) through discovery.
