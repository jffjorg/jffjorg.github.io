PETITIONER’S REQUESTS 
Petitioner asks the Court for expedited approval of the compromises of the claims of
minor Plaintiffs Aimee Martinez and Kimberly Najera. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
A.   Aimee Martinez 
Section 19a(2) of the petition states that Petitioner is
the guardian or conservator of Aimee Martinez’s estate, citing case number 22STCV09474.  Based on this assertion, the petition requests
authority to deposit or invest $4,222.67 of the money or other property to be
paid or delivered under 19a(1) in one or more insured accounts with financial
institutions in this state or with a trust company, subject to withdrawal only
on authorization of the court.  However,
case number 22STCV09474 does not appear to involve a guardianship or
conservatorship of Aimee Martinez’s estate. 
Assuming that Petitioner meant to check the box in
Section 19b(2) of the petition, the Court grants the petition and orders
that
the net proceeds of $4,222.67 are to be deposited in an insured account at Citi
Bank, 1900 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 100, Los Angeles, California, 90067,
(424) 354-3401, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the Court. 
B.   Kimberly Najera 
Section
19a(2) of the petition states that Petitioner is the guardian or conservator of
Kimberly Najera’s estate, citing case number 22STCV09474.  Based on this assertion, the petition
requests authority to deposit or invest $3,783.21 of the money or other
property to be paid or delivered under 19a(1) in one or more insured accounts
with financial institutions in this state or with a trust company, subject to
withdrawal only on authorization of the court. 
However, case number 22STCV09474 does not appear to involve a
guardianship or conservatorship of Kimberly Najera’s estate. 
Assuming
that Petitioner meant to check the box in Section 19b(2) of the petition, the
Court grants the petition and orders that the net proceeds of $3,783.21 are to
be deposited in an insured account at Citi Bank, 1900 Avenue of the Stars,
Suite 100, Los Angeles, California, 90067, (424) 354-3401, subject to
withdrawal only on authorization of the Court.
