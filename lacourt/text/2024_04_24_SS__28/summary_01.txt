Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the parties' motions, opposition, and reply papers. The case revolves around the dispute over the scope of the requested examinations, particularly the neurosurgery and orthopedic evaluations. The Court has determined that the scope of the examinations is too broad and has ordered the parties to file supplemental papers addressing the issues of time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examinations, as well as the diagnostic tests and procedures that the examining doctors will use. The Court has also ordered the parties to provide notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days. The case has been continued to a date to be provided at the April 24, 2024 hearing.
