Hofer presiding. The case was previously complex and had multiple pretrial hearings, leading to the decision to reassign the case. All pending motions and hearings, including trial and status conferences, will be reset, continued, or vacated at the direction of the newly assigned Independent Calendar Court. There will be no hearings or appearances on April 24, 2024. The case will be managed in the Independent Calendar Court, and a trial date will be assigned at a later time."
