 Case Number:  20STCV26659    Hearing Date:   April 24, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court  rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  July 15, 2020, Plaintiff Corentin Villemeur (“Plaintiff”) filed this action  against Defendants Elvis Orlando Guevara and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle  negligence, negligent entrustment of vehicle, and intentional infliction of  emotional distress, hit and run, with punitive damages.  On  April 19, 2021, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against Defendants  Elvis Guevara Vasquez, aka Elvis Orlando Guevara, aka Elvis Orlando Guevara  Vasquez (“Defendant”), and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle negligence, negligent entrustment of vehicle, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, hit  and run, with punitive damages.  On  June 21, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service on  Defendant of the first amended summons, first amended complaint, statement of  damages, and other documents on Defendant on June 9, 2021.  On  December 30, 2021, Plaintiff filed an amended proof of service.  On  January 25, 2022, the clerk entered Defendant’s default.  On  March 29, 2022, Plaintiff filed a statement of damages along with the amended  proof of service showing personal service on Defendant on June 21, 2021.  On  March 1, 2023, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice. On January 24,  2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal.  On  February 2, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at  Plaintiff’s request.  On April 8, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a request for Court  judgment.  PARTY’S REQUEST  Plaintiff  asks the Court to enter a default judgment against and award Plaintiff  $10,541,388.96, consisting of $541,388.96 in special damages and $10,000,000.00  in general damages.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.      Default judgment  “[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party  seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry  of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following  must be included in the documents filed with the clerk:  “(1)  Except in  unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties  and the nature of plaintiff's claim;  “(2)   Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment  requested;  “(3)  Interest  computations as necessary;  “(4)  A  memorandum of costs and disbursements;  “(5)  A  declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is  sought;  “(6)  A proposed  form of judgment;  “(7)  A  dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application  for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure  section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment;  “(8)  Exhibits  as necessary; and  “(9)  A request  for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800(a).)  B.       Damages   On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a  cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce  evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice  Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56, citing Johnson  v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying  preponderance of the evidence standard].)   The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry  of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,  for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the  amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),  585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure  fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27  Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a  default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken  against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is  taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a  right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A  trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the  amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.  494.)  DISCUSSION            The Court understands that Plaintiff has made extensive efforts to obtain the final Medi-Cal lien amount, without success.  Plaintiff is asking the Court to award $541,388.96 as special damages because this is the amount Medi-Cal has paid for Plaintiff's medical expenses.  The Department of Health Care Services, however, has not yet told Plaintiff the amount it will accept to satisfy its lien based on these payments.  The Court cannot assume that the Department of Health Care Services will ask Plaintiff to reimburse it for the full $541,388.96 amount.  In the Court's experience, the Department of Health Care Services typically agrees to accept a reduced amount of the medical expenses to satisfy its lien. The Court invited Plaintiff's counsel to appear on April 24, 2024 and advise the Court whether Plaintiff would agree to waive his special damages if the Court entered judgment in his favor for $1,500,000.00, which the Court has concluded is an appropriate amount of general damages based on Plaintiff's pain, suffering, inconvenience, and emotional distress. Plaintiff's counsel appeared and agreed, after some discussion, to waive Plaintiff's special damages.  Accordingly, the Court awards Plaintiff $1,500,000.00 in general damages.  Plaintiff's counsel is to submit a proposed judgment for the Court's signature.CONCLUSION   The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Corentin Villemeur's application for default judgment against Defendant Elvis Guevara Vasquez, aka Elvis Orlando Guevara, aka Elvis Orlando Guevara Vasquez, and awards Plaintiff $1,500,000.00 in general damages. Plaintiff  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
