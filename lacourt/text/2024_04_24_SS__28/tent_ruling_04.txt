PARTY’S REQUESTS

ask the Court to compel Plaintiff to appear for a physical (orthopedic) examination

LEGAL STANDARD 

Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220 provides: 
“(a) In any
case in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal injuries, any
defendant may demand one physical examination of the plaintiff, if both of the
following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The
examination does not include any diagnostic test or procedure that is painful,
protracted, or intrusive. 
“(2) The
examination is conducted at a location within 75 miles of the residence of the
examinee. 
“(b) A
defendant may make a demand under this article without leave of court after
that defendant has been served or has appeared in the action, whichever occurs
first. 
“(c) A demand
under subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope,
and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if
any, of the physician who will perform the examination. 
“(d) A
physical examination demanded under subdivision (a) shall be scheduled for a
date that is at least 30 days after service of the demand. On motion of the
party demanding the examination, the court may shorten this time. 
“(e) The
defendant shall serve a copy of the demand under subdivision (a) on the
plaintiff and on all other parties who have appeared in the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.220.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.240 provides: 
“(a) If a
plaintiff to whom a demand for a physical examination under this article is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, that plaintiff waives any
objection to the demand. The court, on motion, may relieve that plaintiff from
this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: 
“(1) The
plaintiff has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
with Section 2032.230. 
“(2) The
plaintiff’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The
defendant may move for an order compelling response and compliance with a
demand for a physical examination. 
“(c) The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel response and compliance with a demand for a physical
examination, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. 
“(d) If a
plaintiff then fails to obey the order compelling response and compliance, the
court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.240.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310
provides: 
“(a) If any party desires to obtain discovery by a
physical examination other than that described in Article 2 (commencing with
Section 2032.210) . . . , the party shall obtain leave of court. 
“(b) A motion for an examination under subdivision (a)
shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person
or persons who will perform the examination. The motion shall be accompanied by
a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(c) Notice of the motion shall be served on the
person to be examined and on all parties who have appeared in the action.” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2032.310.) 
          Code of
Civil Procedure section 2032.320 provides in part: 
“(a) The court shall grant a motion for a physical . . .
examination under Section 2032.310 only for good cause shown. 
* * *
  “(d) An order
granting a physical . . . examination shall specify the person or persons who
may perform the examination, as well as the time, place, manner, diagnostic
tests and procedures, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subds. (a), (d).) 

DISCUSSION 
Defendants
ask the Court for leave to conduct Plaintiff’s physical (orthopedic)
examination under Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310, which provides that
“(a) If any party desires to obtain discovery by a physical examination other
than that described in Article 2 (commencing with Section 2032.210) . . . , the
party shall obtain leave of court.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd. (a).)  “The court shall grant a motion for a
physical . . . examination under Section 2032.310 only for good cause shown.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subd. (a).) 
Defendants
contend that they have established good cause for the Court to grant leave to
conduct Plaintiff’s examination because (1) Plaintiff has put his physical
condition at issue and (2) Plaintiff has refused to submit to an orthopedic
examination. 
Defendants
do not explain, however, why they require leave of Court.  Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220,
“[i]In any case in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal injuries,
any defendant may demand one physical examination of the plaintiff,” as long as
“[t]he examination does not include any diagnostic test or procedure that is
painful, protracted, or intrusive” and “[t]he examination is conducted at a
location within 75 miles of the residence of the examinee.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.220, subd. (a).)  If a plaintiff refuses to comply with a
demand for a physical examination under Code of Civil Procedure section
2032.220, the defendant “may move for an
order compelling . . . compliance with [the] demand . . . .”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2032.240, subd. (b).) 
In
the portion of their motion requesting sanctions, Defendants’ assert that
Plaintiff “fail[ed] to appear at previously-noticed IMEs without objection or
notice . . . .”  (Motion p. 6.)  According to Defendants, they initially
noticed Plaintiff’s examination with Dr. Triggs for December 4, 2023, at 9:30
a.m.  (Motion p. 7; see exh. B [Demand
for Independent Medical Examination].) 
Plaintiff did not appear for the examination despite failing to object
to the date or time.  (Motion p. 7.)  Defendants’ motion also refers to an
anticipated examination by “Dr. Samudrala, Defendants’ retained neurosurgeon.”  (Motion p. 6.) 
In a January 15, 2024 email, Plaintiff’s counsel told Defendants’
counsel, “I cannot agree to two physical DME's. And I cannot agree to a second
one until I've seen the first report as I do not want to have duplicative
tests.” 
Defendants
provide no other information about the basis for, or status of, their attempts
to conduct other examinations of Plaintiff. 
Without this information, and without an explanation of why Defendants
seek relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310, subdivision (a),
rather than Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.240, subdivision (b), the Court cannot determine if Defendants have good
cause to conduct Plaintiff’s physical (orthopedic) examination. 
The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court DENIES the motion of Defendants Marco Carreon and Vicky Carreon for leave to conduct
an independent medical examination of Plaintiff Art Payne and for sanctions
filed on March 28, 2024. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
