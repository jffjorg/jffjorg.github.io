And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying California Fair Plan's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which aimed to dismiss Trancas Canyon, LLC's claim for bad faith denial of insurance coverage and the request for punitive damages. The judge finds that the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) are sufficient to state a claim against California Fair Plan, and also sufficient to support an award of punitive damages. The judge's previous statement of decision from the Phase 1 bench trial does not change the outcome, as it does not overcome the sufficiency of the allegations supporting the bad faith claim and the prayer for punitive damages.
