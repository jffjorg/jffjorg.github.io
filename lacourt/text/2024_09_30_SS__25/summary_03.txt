Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings as to SoCal Cars, Inc. and Westlake Services. The plaintiff, Juan Arias Ibarra, had filed a complaint against these defendants, alleging that they violated various consumer protection laws and seeking damages limited to $35,000 and rescission of the contract and restitution of amounts paid, as well as attorney's fees.

The defendants did not oppose the motion, and the court found that a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties. The court granted the motion, ordering that the action be stayed pending completion of arbitration.

The court also denied the plaintiff's request for an order directing the defendants to pay plaintiffs' attorney's fees related to arbitration. The court noted that the arbitration agreement states that each party shall be responsible for its own attorney, expert, and other fees, unless awarded by the arbitrator under applicable law.

The court set a status update conference for June 30, 2025, and ordered counsel to file a joint declaration/report regarding the status of the arbitration proceedings. The non-jury trial scheduled for December 15, 2025, remains on calendar as currently scheduled.
