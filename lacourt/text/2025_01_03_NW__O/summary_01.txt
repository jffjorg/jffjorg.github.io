And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's application for a pre-trial writ of possession to take possession of a 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee (VIN 1C4RJECG9MC597681) from the defendant, Manuel Redondo. The plaintiff, Ally Bank Lease Trust, is the owner and holder of a first priority security interest in the vehicle. The defendant stopped making payments on the lease, and the plaintiff has presented evidence of the lease agreement and the vehicle's value. The judge finds that the plaintiff has established probable validity of its claim to possession of the vehicle and that there is probable cause to believe the vehicle is located at 354 El Conejo Dr, Ojai, CA 93023. The judge also finds that the defendant has no interest in the vehicle because the amount he owes under the lease exceeds the market value of the vehicle. As a result, the court orders the plaintiff to submit a proposed order on judicial council form CD-120 for the court's review and signature before the writ may issue.
