  Case Number:  23TRCV02717    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2024    Dept:  P Petition  to Amend and File a Late Government Claim   Moving  Party: Plaintiff  Aalyna Rouse                        Responding Party: None   RULING   Having  considered the moving papers, the court DENIES the petition to file a late  government claim.BACKGROUND   This  action arises from a series of injuries Plaintiff Aalyna Rouse (“Plaintiff”)  incurred while she was a student at La Tijera Academy of Excellence (“La  Tijera”). (Petition, ¶ 3.) Beginning October 25, 2021 until October 2, 2023,  Plaintiff was bullied and beaten by other students. (Petition, ¶ 9.) However,  the incident which is the subject of this petition occurred on February 15,  2023 (Petition, ¶ 7.) On October 2, 2023, Plaintiff was surrounded and beaten  by bullies, which prompted her mother to pull her out of La Tijera and move her  back to her hometown of San Diego, California. (Petition, ¶ 10.)   On January  25, 2023, Plaintiff’s mother emailed La Tijera’s principal notifying him of an  incident where Plaintiff was injured by a male student. (Petition, ¶ 12.) On  February 28, 2023, Plaintiff retained The Ryan Law Group to represent her  against the Inglewood United School District (“IUSD”). (Petition ¶ 13.)   On April  7, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a preservation of evidence letter to IUSD and  La Tijera. (Petition, ¶ 16.) Five days later, counsel sent a Government Tort  Claim Form to the Board of Education Inglewood School District (the “Board”);  IUSD; the City of Inglewood (the “City”); and La Tijera which discussed a  singular incident of bullying. (Petition, ¶ 17.)   On April  19, 2023, the City of Inglewood sent Plaintiff’s counsel a notice of receipt of  the Government Tort Claim Form. (Petition, ¶ 19.) A week later, the City sent  Plaintiff’s counsel a letter of insufficiency. (Petition, ¶ 20.)   On May 16,  2023, IUSD sent a rejection letter of Plaintiff’s Government Tort Claim Form.  (Petition, ¶ 21.) On June 1, 2023, The Ryan Law Group co-counseled Plaintiff’s  matter to The Vartazarian Law Firm (“VLF”). (Petition, ¶ 22.) On June 6, 2023, Plaintiff’s  counsel drafted and mailed an Amended Government Claim for damages. (Petition,  ¶ 23.)    Plaintiff  argues that she and her counsel operated under the mistaken assumption that IUSD  was a subsidiary of the City, not a separate government entity. (Petition, ¶  24.) Thus, she only served the Amended Form on the City. (Petition, ¶ 29.)  Despite never being served, IUSD filed an answer to Plaintiff’s lawsuit on  October 23, 2023, which indicates that there is some nexus between the two  entities.   On  November 20, 2023, the parties began to conduct discovery. (Petition, ¶ 35.) On  November 30, the parties’ attorneys met and conferred telephonically to discuss  the case. (Petition, ¶ 39.) At no point during this conversation or subsequent  discussion was Plaintiff’s counsel made aware that the Government Forms and  complaint had possible discrepancies. (Petition, ¶¶ 42, 44.) Through February 23,  2024, the parties continued to meet, conduct discovery, and hold case  management conferences. (Petition, ¶¶ 44-63.) On this day, Plaintiff learned  for the first time that IUSD and the City might be separate entities when  defense counsel stated it only received notice of the February 15, 2023  incident and would only compensate Plaintiff for this one incident. (Petition,  ¶¶ 64, 69.) Plaintiff contends that Defendants and defense counsel purposefully  waited 123 days to object to the scope of her claims because it was eight days after  the 1-year limitation for a minor to present a late government claim that must  be granted. (Petition, ¶ 71.)   On March  6, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Application to Present a Late Claim to Defendant  IUSD pursuant to Section 911.4 on the basis of mistake. (Petition, ¶ 73.) The application  was denied on April 17, 2024. (Petition, ¶ 74.)   On October  17, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant petition.   LEGAL STANDARD             Under the Government Claims Act, a plaintiff bringing suit for monetary  damages against a public entity or employees thereof must first present a claim  to the public entity (“government claim”) which must be acted upon or deemed  rejected by the public entity.  (Government Code §§ 945.4, 950.2,  950.6(a).)  Government Code section 911.2(a) states that “a claim relating  to a cause of action for death or for injury to person or to personal property  . . . shall be presented . . . not later than six months after the accrual of  the cause of action.”     If a plaintiff fails to file a government claim within the six-month  period, he or she may apply to the public entity for permission to file a late  claim.  (§ 911.4(a).)  An application for permission to file a late  claim must be presented within a reasonable time, and not later than one year  after the cause of action’s accrual.  (§ 911.4(b).)      If the public entity denies the application for permission to file a late  claim, the plaintiff may file a civil petition for relief from section 945.4’s  requirement of timely claim presentation prior to suit.  (§ 946.6.)   The petition must be filed within six months after the application to the  public entity is denied or deemed to be denied.  (§ 946.6(b).)  The  petition must show: (1) that an application was made to the public entity under  section 911.4 and was denied or deemed denied; (2) the reason for failure to  timely present the claim to the public entity within the time limit specified  in section 911.2; and (3) the information required by section 910.  (§  946.6(b).)    The court shall grant relief only if it finds that (1) the application to  the public entity for leave to file a late claim was made within a reasonable  time not to exceed one year after accrual of the claim as specified in section  911.4(b), (2) the application was denied or deemed denied by the public agency  pursuant to section 911.6,  and (3) one or more of the following is  applicable: (a) the failure to timely present the claim was through mistake,  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, unless the public entity  establishes that it would be prejudiced in the defense of the claim if the  court relieves the petitioner from the requirements of section 945.4; (b) the  person who sustained the alleged injury, damage or loss was a minor during all  of the time specified in section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim; (c)  the person who sustained the alleged injury, damage or loss was physically or  mentally incapacitated during all of the time specified in section 911.2 for  the presentation of the claim and by reason of that disability failed to  present a claim during that time; or (d) the person who sustained the alleged  injury, damage or loss died before the expiration of the time specified in  section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim.  (§ 946.6(c).)    “Government Code section 946.6 is a remedial statute intended to provide  relief from technical rules which otherwise provide a trap for the unwary. The  remedial policy underlying the statute is that wherever possible cases should  be heard on their merits. Thus, a denial of such relief by the trial court is  examined more rigorously than where relief is granted and any doubts which may  exist should be resolved in favor of the application.” (Munoz, supra,  33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1778 (citations omitted).) Because of the remedial  character of the statute, “the modern trend of judicial decisions favors  granting relief unless absolutely forbidden by statute.” (Ibid.)    The excusable neglect standard assumes that there has been some sort of  inattention or carelessness and asks “whether a reasonably prudent person might  have made the same error under the same or similar circumstances.” (Id. at  p. 1783 (citations omitted).) In applying this standard, a court must also  examine whether the party or her counsel were “otherwise diligent in  investigating and pursuing the claim.” (Id. at pp. 1782-1783; see  also Dep't of Water & Power v. Superior Court (2000) 82 Cal. App. 4th  1288, 1293.)    DISCUSSION               Plaintiff’s claim began to accrue on February 15, 2023, the first  incident described in the Government Tort Claim Form.   Government Code section 911.2(a) states that “a claim relating to a cause  of action for death or for injury to person or to personal property . . . shall  be presented . . . not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of  action.”  If a claimant fails to make a claim within six months pursuant  to Gov. Code § 911.2, the claimant may make a written application to the board  of the public entity for permission to present a late claim within a reasonable  time but not to exceed one year from the accrual of the cause of action.   (Gov. Code § 911.4(a)-(b).) Timely compliance with the claims presentation  is a mandatory prerequisite to maintaining a cause of action against a public  entity and failure to file a claim is fatal to the claimant’s cause of  action.  Pacific Telegraph & Telephone Co. v. County of Riverside,  (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 183, 188; San Leandro Police Officers Assoc. v. City  of San Leandro, (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 553.   “Filing a late-claim application within one year after the accrual of a  cause of action is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a claim-relief petition.  When the underlying application to file a late claim is filed more than one  year after the accrual of the cause of action, the court is without  jurisdiction to grant relief under Government Code section 946.6” Munoz v.  State of California (1995) 33 Cal. App. 4th 1767, 1779 (internal citations  omitted).)   Here, Plaintiff presented her claim to the City within six months but did  not present her claim to IUSD. However, IUSD filed an answer after Plaintiff  served the City.   Plaintiff’s Late Claim Application was filed on March 6, 2024, about a  year and twenty-two days after the February 15, 2023 incident.  It was denied on April 17, 2024.    Although the Petition was filed within six months after the Late Claim  Application was denied, and presuming that there was excusable neglect, mistake  or inadvertence on the part of the Petitioner, the court is still without power  to grant this petition.  The conceded  failure to file the petition within one year of the accrual of the cause of  action creates a jurisdictional barrier to this court giving relief.   CONCLUSION   Because  Plaintiff’s Late Claim Application was not timely filed, Plaintiff’s petition  is DENIED.              Defendant to give notice of ruling.
