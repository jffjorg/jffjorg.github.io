And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the petition to file a late government claim. The petition was filed by Aalyna Rouse, who was bullied and beaten by other students at La Tijera Academy of Excellence. Rouse's mother emailed the school's principal about the incident, and Rouse retained a law firm to represent her against the Inglewood United School District (IUSD). The law firm sent a preservation of evidence letter and a government tort claim form to the relevant parties, but the IUSD filed an answer to Rouse's lawsuit without being served with the government tort claim form.

Rouse argues that she and her counsel operated under the mistaken assumption that the IUSD was a subsidiary of the City, not a separate government entity, and therefore only served the amended government claim form on the City. The judge finds that Rouse's failure to file a government tort claim form with the IUSD is not excusable and that the petition is not timely filed, as it was filed more than a year after the incident occurred. The judge concludes that the petition is denied, as the court is without jurisdiction to grant relief due to the jurisdictional barrier created by the untimely filing of the petition.
