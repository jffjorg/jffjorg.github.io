And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Dzmitry Shabliuk vs Guevara Robert. Due to a dispute over the e-filing of a reply brief, the court has ordered both parties to appear at a hearing on November 22, 2024. The judge plans to continue the trial to permit Petitioner to file his reply brief and to afford sufficient time for the court to review the brief. As Petitioner is self-represented, he is not required to e-file and may bring a hard copy of the brief to the hearing. The court's clerk will accept the filing.
