  Case Number:  23STCP04414    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  82 DZMITRY SHABLIUK vs GUEVARA ROBERTPetitioner
Dzmitry Shabliuk (“Petitioner”), a self-represented party, contacted the
court’s clerk to report that he has been attempting to e-file his reply brief,
but it has been rejected on at least two occasions.  The court discloses
this ex parte communication and shall permit Respondent an opportunity to
respond at the hearing tomorrow (Friday, November 22, 2024, at 9:30 a.m.)
 
The
court orders the parties to appear (either remotely or in-person) at the
hearing tomorrow.  Absent good cause, however, the court plans to continue
the trial to permit Petitioner to file his reply brief and to afford sufficient
time for the court to review the reply brief.  Because Petitioner is
self-represented, he is not required to e-file briefs.  Accordingly,
Petitioner may bring a hard copy of the reply brief to the hearing, and the
court’s clerk will accept it for filing.
 
The
court’s clerk shall provide notice via email.
