The judge's tentative ruling denies Petitioner's motion to stay the revocation of its provisional license and sustains Respondents' demurrer without leave to amend. The ruling concludes that Petitioner does not have a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits and that the balance of harms weighs in favor of denying preliminary injunctive relief. The ruling also finds that the Department does not have a ministerial duty to provide a pre-deprivation hearing and right to appeal before revoking a provisional license.
