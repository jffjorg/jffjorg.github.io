And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling overruling the demurrer filed by Respondents Ida F. Cochrane, et al. to the petition for writ of mandate filed by Petitioner Beta Pi Sigma Sorority, Inc. The petition relates to a dispute over who controls the sorority and the accuracy of the Statement of Information on file with the Secretary of State. The Respondents contend that the petition does not state a cause of action for writ of mandate, but the judge finds that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge also finds that the petition sufficiently identifies the parts of the sorority's bylaws and constitution at issue and that the Respondents have not requested judicial notice of these provisions or developed an argument that they do not apply or were not violated by the actions alleged in the petition. The judge concludes that the court cannot determine from the face of the pleadings that Petitioner has failed to exhaust any applicable internal remedies and that the petition sufficiently alleges the standing of Petitioner to challenge the alleged "unauthorized" conduct of the Respondents. The judge orders that the demurrer is overruled and that Respondents must file an answer.
