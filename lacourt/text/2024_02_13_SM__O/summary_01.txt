And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has granted City National Bank's motion to strike the Law Office of Jeremy Tenser Limited's answer to the first amended complaint. The Law Office is a suspended corporation due to outstanding taxes, and therefore lacks capacity to sue or defend itself. The Court has authority to strike a suspended corporation's answer under CCP § 436, and the Law Office's answer is a pleading that is not in conformity with the laws of the state because the Law Office is suspended. The Law Office's arguments that the Court has no authority to strike the answer, that a suspended corporation can cure its suspension, and that City National Bank should be equitably estopped from striking the answer are not persuasive. The Court has denied the Law Office's defenses, including statute of limitations, laches, and estoppel, and has granted City National Bank's motion to strike the answer.
