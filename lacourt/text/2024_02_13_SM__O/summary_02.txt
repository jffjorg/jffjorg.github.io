And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by defendants Douglas Emmett, Inc. and Barrington Pacific, LLC is overruled. The plaintiff, Barrington Plaza Tenant Association, has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for declaratory relief. The court finds that the issue of whether the defendants had a genuine intent to permanently remove Barrington Plaza from the rental market is a factual issue that must be resolved at trial. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claim is ripe for adjudication and will be fully adjudicated at the stipulated consolidated trial scheduled for April 15, 2024. The court further finds that the plaintiff has standing to pursue the claim and that the litigation privilege does not preclude claims for declaratory relief.
