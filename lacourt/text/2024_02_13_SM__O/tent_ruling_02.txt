TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendants
Douglas Emmett, Inc. and Barrington Pacific, LLC’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.  Plaintiff Barrington Plaza Tenant Association (BPTA) has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for declaratory relief.
 
“To
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for declaratory relief, the
plaintiff must allege two essential elements: (1) a proper subject of
declaratory relief, and (2) an actual controversy involving justiciable
questions relating to the rights or obligations of a party….  Childhelp, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles
(2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 224, 235, as modified (May 5, 2023), [internal
citations omitted].)  The Court is not persuaded
that the rights and obligations of the parties can be adjudicated at this stage
of the case based solely on the allegations of the complaint for declaratory
relief. The Court agrees with the Plaintiff that whether Defendants had a genuine
intent to permanently remove Barrington Plaza from the rental market is a factual
issue that must be resolved at trial. 
 
            BPTA's claim is ripe for adjudication and
pursuant to the parties’ stipulation will be fully adjudicated in the
stipulated consolidated trial scheduled for April 15, 2024. (See Farm
Sanctuary, Inc. v. Department of Food & Agriculture (1998) 63
Cal.App.4th 495, 502. [“the question before us is not so abstract or
hypothetical that we should await a better factual scenario.”]
 
            BPTA does
not clearly appear to have a speedy and adequate remedy at law. (See Maguire
v. Hibernia Savings & Loan Soc. (1944) 23 Cal.2d 719, 732  [“[B]efore a court may properly exercise its
discretion to refuse relief on that ground, it must clearly appear that the
asserted alternative remedies are available to the plaintiff and that they are
speedy and adequate or as well suited to the plaintiff's needs as declaratory
relief.”].) The litigation privilege does not preclude claims for declaratory
relief (See Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 479
[“Defendants contend, and the trial court concluded, that the litigation
privilege precludes plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief. That privilege
does not.”].) BPTA has standing to pursue the claim. (See Tenant Assn. of
Park Santa Anita v. Southers (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1293, 1902 [“It is
settled that an unincorporated association can sue in a representative capacity
. . . to bring an action for prospective relief such as an injunction or a declaration
of rights.”].)
