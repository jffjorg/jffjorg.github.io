 Case Number:  BC675696    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Petition of Defendants/Petitioners to Confirm
Arbitration Award as to Respondent Estela Rosas
 
On 1/12/22, the Court
confirmed an arbitration award regarding Plaintiff/Respondent ERIKA VALADEZ.  Plaintiffs filed a an appeal as to the
1/12/22 order. According to Court of Appeal records, in appellate case number
B318125, the appeal was submitted on 12/13/23, with an anticipated due date of
3/1/24 for an opinion.
In the meantime, Defendants filed this petition to
confirm the arbitration award as to Plaintiff/Respondent MARIA ESTELA ROSAS. As
the Court has ruled on 4/10/23, 7/12/23, and 12/12/23, the Court concludes that
the appellate decision in the B318125 case could impact the outcome of
Defendants’ current petition. Therefore, the Court should rule after
considering an anticipated appellate ruling that likely would provide
directions or guidance.
The petition hearing, continued from 12/12/23, is
again continued, this time to 4/12/24 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 55, pending
appeal.
