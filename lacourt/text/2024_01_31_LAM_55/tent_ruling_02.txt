 Case Number:  20STCV45492    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Defendant St. John’s Well Child &Family
Center’s Motion To Continue Trial.
 
The motion is denied.
Background
In this case filed in
2020, Plaintiff HENRY ANYANWU (“Plaintiff”) seeks damages against ST. JOHN’S
WELL CHILD & FAMILY MEDICAL CENTER (“Defendant”) related to an allegedly
botched tooth extraction procedure that Plaintiff received. Following demurrers
to prior complaints, Plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint against
Defendant on 1/27/23. 
Defendant has filed a
motion requesting continuance of the trial set for 2/25/24. Plaintiff opposes
the motion. 
“Continuances are granted
only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring a continuance.”  In re Marriage of Falcone and Fyke (2008)
164 Cal. App. 4th 814, 823.  A trial
court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment motion filed within the time
limits of CCP § 437c. Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior Ct. (1989) 207 Cal.
App. 3d 526, 529. 
Here, Defendant contends
that the last day that a summary judgment motion may be heard based on the
current trial date is February 25, 2024, but the earliest date Defendant could
reserve a motion for summary judgment is April 8, 2024. Implicit in the rule
requiring that trial courts accommodate motions for summary judgment is the
assumption that the moving party acts with the requisite diligence in reserving
and filing a summary judgment motion. Defendant does not explain when it
reserved the April 8, 2024 hearing date. This information is important because
the Court set the current March 25, 2024 trial date in January 2023 and so
Defendant has known about the summary judgment deadline for a year. Defendant does
not explain why it could not have reserved and filed a summary judgment motion earlier
in this case. The pleadings have been set since June 2023. but Defendant has
been litigating the case against Plaintiff since 2020. Defendant therefore has
failed to establish that it has pursued a motion for summary judgment with
diligence. The Court does not find good cause to continue the trial in these
circumstances.
