And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to continue the trial, which is set for February 25, 2024. The defendant, St. John's Well Child & Family Medical Center, claims that it needs more time to prepare for the trial, but the plaintiff, Henry Anyanwu, opposes the motion. The judge finds that the defendant has failed to show good cause for the continuance, as it has known about the summary judgment deadline for a year and has not explained why it could not have reserved and filed a summary judgment motion earlier. Additionally, the defendant did not provide information on when it reserved the April 8, 2024 hearing date, which is important because the court set the current trial date in January 2023. The judge concludes that the defendant has not pursued a motion for summary judgment with diligence and therefore denies the motion to continue the trial.
