And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. The case involves a legal malpractice claim brought by Rolan Feld against David A. Erikson and Erikson Law Group. Feld alleges that Erikson breached his professional duty and fiduciary duties during an arbitration proceeding in which Feld's former attorney, Helen Yu, won an award of over $1 million. The defendants contend that Feld cannot establish causation of damages and that Erikson did not breach his duties. The Court has determined that triable issues of fact exist on the issues of duty and causation, and therefore, the motion is denied.
