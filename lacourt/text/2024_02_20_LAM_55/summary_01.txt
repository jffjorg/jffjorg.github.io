  - "Once the defendant has satisfied that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff ‘to show, by responsive separate statement and admissible evidence, that triable issues of fact exist.’"
  - "Failure to object to requests for judicial notice constitutes a waiver of the objection."
  - "The Court determines that Defendants’ separate statements of undisputed facts, which reference Defendants’ evidence, suffice to establish that one or more elements of each of Plaintiffs’ claims fail as a matter of law."

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court grants the unopposed motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Defendant Thomas Block, and Defendant Sue Emrek joins in the motion. The Court also grants the unopposed requests for judicial notice filed on December 8, 2024, and September 21, 2024. The Plaintiffs, NIKI-ALEXANDER SHETTY and ADINA ZAHARESCU, have failed to file an opposition to the motion, and the Court determines that the Defendants have established that one or more elements of each of the Plaintiffs' claims fail as a matter of law. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have not presented any triable issues of material fact to raise, and therefore, the motion is granted.
