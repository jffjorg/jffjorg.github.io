And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to serve the defendant, VIP Capitals, LLC, via the California Secretary of State. The plaintiff, Anthony Bouyer, had filed a complaint against the defendant for violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act and had made multiple unsuccessful attempts to serve the defendant through its agent, Azar Noroozy. The plaintiff then filed a motion to serve the defendant via the Secretary of State, citing authority regarding the individuals who may be served on behalf of a corporation. However, the judge ruled that the motion did not cite authority for serving the defendant via the Secretary of State if the plaintiff is unable to accomplish service by serving an individual identified in the California Code of Civil Procedure. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff may refile the motion in the future.
