COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES 
(Request for
Production of Documents, Set 1)
 
Motion filed on 3/26/24.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Wendy Hernandez
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Volkswagen Group of America,
Inc.
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
striking Defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.’s objections and
compelling further responses and production of responsive documents to
Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set 1, Nos. 1-31.

 
RULING: The motion is denied.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Wendy Hernandez’s
(Plaintiff) lease of a 2021 Volkswagen Atlas (the Vehicle) on 9/18/21.  Defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.
(Defendant) warranted the Vehicle.  
 
Plaintiff alleges that the Vehicle was delivered to her with
defects and nonconformities to warranty and developed other serious defects and
nonconformities to warranty including, but not limited to, engine, electrical,
emission, structural, and suspension system defects.  Plaintiff contends that she presented the
Vehicle to Defendant’s authorized repair facility(ies) for warranty repairs on
multiple occasions.  Plaintiff claims
that none of the repairs performed by Defendant’s authorized repair facility(ies)
permanently repaired the defects.  
 
Plaintiff contends that the issuance of Technical Service
Bulletins (TSBs) evidences the fact that Defendant had knowledge of the defects
with the Vehicle.  Plaintiff contends
that Defendant has not adequately compensated her for the Vehicle which was
never fully repaired within a reasonable number of attempts.  
 
On 10/24/23, Plaintiff filed this action against
Defendant for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty,
(2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty and (3)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Civil Code 1793.2.  On 11/21/23, Defendant answered the
complaint.  
 
On 12/12/23, Plaintiff served Defendant with Request for
Production of Documents, Set 1, by electronic mail.  (Sogoyan Decl., Ex.3).  The parties then agreed to extend the due
date for discovery responses to 2/5/24. 
(Roberson Decl., Ex.B).  On
2/2/24, Defendant served responses to the document requests by email.  (Sogoyan Decl., Ex.4).  On 2/15/24, Defendant re-served the responses.  (Further Mahnke Decl.
¶¶7-16; Further Roberson Decl. ¶7).  On
3/6/24, Plaintiff’s counsel began meet and confer efforts regarding what
Plaintiff perceived to be deficiencies in the responses.  (See Sogoyan Decl., Ex.5-10).   
 
On 3/26/24, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order striking Defendant’s   objections and compelling further responses
and production of responsive documents to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents, Set 1, Nos. 1-31.  The caption
of the motion indicates that Plaintiff also requests unidentified
“sanctions.”  (See Motion,
p.1:17).  However, the type of sanctions
and against whom they are sought is not set forth in the body of the notice of
motion as required nor is a request for sanctions supported in the memorandum
of points and authorities.  See
CCP 2023.040.  Additionally, Plaintiff
did not efile the separate statement in support of the motion.  However, a courtesy copy of the separate
statement was submitted to the courtroom which was used to review the motion.  Defendant opposed the motion and
Plaintiff  filed a reply to the
opposition.  
 
Due to issues regarding the timeliness of the motion and
whether the service of supplemental responses to the discovery requests mooted
the motion, on 10/7/24, the Court continued the hearing on the motion to
11/8/24.  (See 10/7/24 Minute
Order).  
 
The Court specifically ordered:
 
“If the hearing is continued, the
supplemental papers noted above are due to be filed and served at least 10 court days before the
continued hearing date. Such supplemental briefs are limited to 10 pages
each, excluding declarations and exhibits. Each party may then respond to the
other’s supplemental papers with a 5-page brief which are due to be filed and
served at least 5 court days before the continued hearing date.” (emphasis
added)
 
(10/7/24 Minute Order, pp.5-6)
 
The Court also stated: 

 
“The supplemental briefing noted
above is not intended to take the place of a motion to compel further responses
regarding any supplemental responses served on 9/10/24. As noted above, a new
motion must be filed regarding such responses, if the issues cannot be
informally resolved.”
 
(10/7/24 Minute Order, p.6)
 
The Court further stated: 
 
“Finally, the Court notes that
Plaintiff’s counsel failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to
the declarations filed in support of the motion and reply as required by
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1110(f)(4). Counsel for the parties are
warned that failure to comply with this rule in the future may result in
matters being continued so that papers may be resubmitted in compliance, papers
not being considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.”
 
(10/7/24 Minute Order, p.6)
 
On 11/4/24, Plaintiff filed and served a further
declaration of counsel in support of the motion.  On 11/5/24, Defendant filed a served a
further declaration of counsel in support of the opposition.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Despite the clear order of the Court that the
supplemental papers in support of each party’s position were due “at least 10
court days before the continued hearing date,” Plaintiff did not file and serve
the further declaration in support of the motion until 4 court days before the
continued hearing date.  As a result, Defendant
did not file a serve a further declaration in response thereto until 11/5/24, two
court days after a response was due pursuant to the Court’s 10/7/24 ruling.  (See 10/7/24 Minute Order, pp.5-6).      
 
With regard to the timeliness of the motion, in the
motion, Plaintiff claimed that “[o]n February 2, 2024, Defendant responded
late to Plaintiff’s written discovery requests… .” (italics and bold in
original) (See Motion, p.4:12-13; Sogoyan Decl. ¶16).  In response to the Court’s 10/7/24 ruling
which noted that the evidence established that the parties had agreed to extend
the deadline to serve responses to 2/5/24, making Defendant’s responses early,
Plaintiff now claims that the responses were not actually served until 2/15/24
because one of the three email addresses on which they were served on 2/2/24
apparently contained an error.  (See
Further Mahnke Decl. ¶¶7-16; 10/7/24 Minute Order, p.2).  Defendant contends its counsel never conceded
that the responses were not timely served pursuant to the parties agreed upon
extension and/or that the instant motion was timely filed and served.  (See Further Roberson Decl. ¶¶5-9).
 
Plaintiff provides no authority for the proposition that
the responses were untimely because one of the email addresses where they were
served on Plaintiff’s counsel contained an error while the other two were
correct.  Plaintiff does not claim that
the two attorneys who were served by email with the responses on 2/2/24 did not
receive them.  As such, the Court finds
the responses were timely served on 2/2/24. 
Therefore, the motion which was filed and served on 3/26/24 would be
untimely as noted in the Court’s 10/7/24 ruling.  (See 10/7/24 Minute Order).  However, even if the motion is considered
timely, it fails.  
 
The further declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel shows that
Plaintiff did not begin to attempt to meet and confer with Defendant’s counsel regarding
the issues for which the motion was continued until 10/31/24, 4 court days
after the supplemental papers were due to be filed (10 court days before the
11/8/24 hearing date was 10/25/24).  (See
Further Mahnke Decl. ¶26).  This failure
seems to be a continuation of Plaintiff’s failure to meet and confer in good
faith as noted in the Court’s 10/7/24 Minute Order.  (See 10/7/24 Minute Order, p.4).
 
Additionally, although Plaintiff’s counsel now concedes
that Defendant served supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production on 9/9/24, without providing a copy of such supplemental responses,
Plaintiff contends that Defendant did not supplement its responses to Requests
15-29.  (Further Mahnke Decl. ¶22).  Defendant also did not provide a copy of the
further responses served on 9/9/24 and verified on 9/10/24 with the further
declaration of Defendant’s counsel.  However,
the further declaration of Defendant's counsel indicates that Defendant “stands
by its responses and objections to Plaintiff’s Request for Production Nos.
15-19.”  (See Further Roberson
Decl. ¶11).  As such, it is not clear which
of Defendant’s responses were supplemented in September 2024 and which were
not.  
 
The further declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel go on to address
the purported “deficiencies in Defendant’s responses and supplemental
responses,” despite this Court’s specific order that the supplemental
briefing “is not intended to take the place of a motion to compel further
responses regarding any supplemental responses served on 9/10/24.” (emphasis
added) (Further Mahnke Decl. ¶¶27-30; 10/7/24 Minute Order, p.6).
 
The Court cannot determine from the further declaration of
Plaintiff’s counsel which original responses Plaintiff contends are still at
issue.  Rather than filing a supplemental
brief which concisely sets forth Plaintiff’s arguments and cites supporting
authority and evidence as contemplated by the Court’s 10/7/24 ruling,
Plaintiff’s counsel merely filed a further declaration of counsel which fails
to clearly set forth which of Defendant’s original responses are still at issue
after Defendant’s service of further/supplemental responses on 9/10/24.  It is also not clear whether Plaintiff’s are
now complaining that Defendant’s production does not comply with their
responses.  (See Further Mahnke
Decl. ¶¶28-30; Further Roberson Decl. ¶¶12-13).
 
As noted in the Court’s 10/7/24 ruling, to the extent
Plaintiff is dissatisfied with the further responses served by Defendant on 9/10/24,
Plaintiff was required to file a timely motion to compel further responses
regarding those specific responses.  To
the extent Plaintiff is seeking to compel compliance with Defendant’s original
responses and/or the supplemental responses, Plaintiff must file a motion
pursuant to CCP 2031.320.
 
Finally, in violation of CRC 3.1110(f)(4), Plaintiff’s
counsel has again failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to
the further declaration, despite the warnings provided in the Court’s 10/7/24 ruling.  (See 10/7/24 Minute Order, p.6).  Rather than electronically bookmarking the
exhibits, Plaintiff’s counsel has electronically bookmarked the parts of the
declaration itself.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied.
