And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Cross-Defendants (Pacifica Reliable Funding, LLC, Giora Agam, Nathan Agam, and Agam International, Inc.) to the First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by the Cross-Complainants (IC Funding, Inc., Nadav Ibi, Einat Rozenbaum, and Carmiel Cohen).

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract, finding that the settlement agreement is written and that the Cross-Complainants have sufficiently alleged facts that allow the court and the parties to ascertain that the subject agreement was written.

The judge has also overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action for fraud, finding that the Cross-Complainants have alleged, with sufficient particularity, representations made by the Cross-Defendants and that those representations were made without any intention to perform and with further intention to deny the very existence of those representations.

The court orders the Cross-Defendants to file an answer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint within 10 days of the date of this order and orders the Cross-Complainants to give notice of this ruling.
