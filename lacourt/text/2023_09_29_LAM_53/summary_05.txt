The judge has also overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action for fraud, finding that the Cross-Complainants have alleged, with sufficient particularity, representations made by the Cross-Defendants and that those representations were made without any intention to perform and with further intention to deny the very existence of those representations.

The court orders the Cross-Defendants to file an answer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint within 10 days of the date of this order and orders the Cross-Complainants to give notice of this ruling.
