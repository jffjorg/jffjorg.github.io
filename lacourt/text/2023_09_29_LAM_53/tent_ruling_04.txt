[1] The
court notes that the evidentiary objections to the deposition of Adriane Nolan
are not numbered.  The court has ruled on
the objections in numerical order. 


[2] The
court notes that some unlawful employment practices are actionable as against
labor organizations, employment agencies, person, apprenticeship training
program, or any training program leading to employment.  (Gov. Code, § 12940, subds. (h),
(k).)  However, Plaintiff has alleged
that defendants KFH and TPMG are “covered employer[s] as defined in the FEHA,
at California Government Code § 12926(d).”  (Compl., ¶¶ 3-4 [italics in original].) 


[3] The
court notes that Plaintiff has submitted evidence showing that the successful
applicants for the job postings associated with requisition numbers 845010,
880308, and 995085 were, respectively, 39 years old, 36 years old, and 48 years
old at the time of hire.  (Pl. Ex.
F.)  However, as set forth above,
Plaintiff did not proceed with those applications.  (Def. COE Vol. 1, Ex. 4, Nirona Decl.,
¶¶ 27 [Plaintiff declined requisition number 845010], 21 [Plaintiff did
not submit an application related to requisition number 880308], 24 [Plaintiff
did not submit an application to requisition number 995085].)
