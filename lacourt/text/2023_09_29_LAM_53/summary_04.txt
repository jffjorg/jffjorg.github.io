And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the deposition of Adriane Nolan and the evidentiary objections to it. The court notes that the objections were not numbered, so it has ruled on them in numerical order. The court also notes that the plaintiff has alleged that the defendants, KFH and TPMG, are "covered employers" under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). However, the court has also seen evidence that the successful applicants for certain job postings were older than 40, which raises questions about whether the defendants are indeed covered employers. The court will consider this further at the upcoming hearing.
