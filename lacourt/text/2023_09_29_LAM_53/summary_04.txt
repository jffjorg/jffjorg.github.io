```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the deposition of Adriane Nolan and the evidentiary objections to it. The court notes that the objections were not numbered, so it has ruled on them in numerical order. The court also notes that the plaintiff has alleged that the defendants, KFH and TPMG, are "covered employers" under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). However, the court has also seen evidence that the successful applicants for certain job postings were older than 40, which raises questions about whether the defendants are indeed covered employers. The court will consider this further at the upcoming hearing.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a upcoming court hearing. The court has reviewed the evidentiary objections to the deposition of Adriane Nolan and has ruled on them in numerical order. The judge notes that the plaintiff has alleged that the defendants, KFH and TPMG, are covered employers under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). However, the court also notes that the plaintiff did not proceed with job applications for requisition numbers 845010, 880308, and 995085, despite the successful applicants for those positions being 39, 36, and 48 years old at the time of hire. The court will consider these facts, as well as the laws and statutes relevant to the case, including California Government Code § 12926(d) and § 12940, subds. (h), (k), in making its ruling. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the court is skeptical of the plaintiff's allegations of unlawful employment practices, given the plaintiff's failure to proceed with the job applications in question.
