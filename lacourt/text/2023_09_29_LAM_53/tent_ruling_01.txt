[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to form interrogatory number 15.1
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff Mary Jane Pardo
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Defendants Ladera Lending, LLC, Jason Eugene
Burt, and Coast 2 Coast Lending Group, Inc.
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatory Number 15.1
The court considered the moving and reply papers filed in connection
with this motion.  
The court has disregarded (1) the “Opposition to Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Interrogatory No. 15.1,” filed by defendants Jason Eugene
Burt, Ladera Lending, LLC, and Coast 2 Coast Funding Group, Inc., on September
20, 2023, and (2) the “Supplement to Defendant Ladera Lending LLC; Jason Eugene
Burt; and Coast 2 Coast Lending Group, Inc.’s Opposition to Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Interrogatory No. 15.1,” filed by defendants Jason Eugene
Burt, Ladera Lending, LLC, and Coast 2 Coast Funding Group, Inc., on September
26, 2023, because they were not filed at least nine court days before the
hearing on this motion.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Mary Jane Pardo (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
(1) compelling defendants Jason Eugene Burt and Ladera Lending, LLC (the
“Ladera Defendants”) to provide a further response to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatory number 15.1; (2) compelling defendant Coast 2 Coast Funding
Group, Inc. (“Coast 2 Coast”) to provide a further response to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatory number 15.1; and (3) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and
against Ladera Defendants and Coast 2 Coast (collectively, “Defendants”) in the
amount of $5,175, to be apportioned equally. 
Plaintiff asserts that Defendants’ responses as to the facts upon
which Defendants base their denials or special or affirmative defenses (requested
in subdivision (a) of Form Interrogatory number 15.1) are evasive and
incomplete.  The court disagrees.  The court therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion
to compel Defendants’ further response to Form Interrogatory number 15.1,
because those answers are not evasive or incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(a)(1).) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s request for an award of monetary
sanctions against Defendants.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)  
ORDER
The court denies plaintiff
Mary Jane Pardo’s motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories.
The court orders defendants
Jason Eugene Burt, Ladera Lending, LLC, and Coast 2 Coast Funding Group, Inc. to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
