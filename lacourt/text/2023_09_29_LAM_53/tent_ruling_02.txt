[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s amended motion to compel further
  responses to requests for production of documents
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Jose Hernandez         
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant General Motors, LLC
Amended Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Requests for Production of Documents
The court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in
connection with this motion.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Jose Hernandez (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
compelling defendant General Motors, LLC (“Defendant”) to serve further
responses and produce documents responsive to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production of Documents, numbers 1-3, 9, 13-17, and 34-45.
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to
Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 1-3, 9, 13, 15, and 17, because
the objections to those requests are without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(a)(3).)  
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to
Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 14, 16, and 34-36, because those
requests are overbroad and unduly burdensome. 

The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to
Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 37-45, limited to customer
complaints relating to defects alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint in vehicles
purchased in California for the same year, make, and model of the subject
vehicle. 
ORDER
The court grants in part plaintiff Jose
Hernandez’s amended motion to compel further responses to requests for
production as follows. 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.310, the court orders defendant General Motors, LLC (1)
to serve on plaintiff Jose Hernandez further written responses to (i) Requests
for Production of Documents numbers 1-3, 9, 13, 15, and 17, and (ii) Requests
for Production of Documents numbers 37-45, limited to customer complaints
relating to defects alleged in plaintiff Jose Hernandez’s operative complaint
in vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make, and model of the
subject vehicle, and (2) to produce to plaintiff Jose Hernandez all documents
and things in defendant General Motors, LLC’s possession, custody, or control
which are responsive to those requests (and limited as set forth above), within
20 days of the date of service of this order. 
The court orders plaintiff
Jose Hernandez to give notice of this ruling.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  September 29, 2023
