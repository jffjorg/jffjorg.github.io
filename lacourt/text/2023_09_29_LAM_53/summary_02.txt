And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's amended motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, and has issued a tentative ruling. The plaintiff, Jose Hernandez, is seeking an order compelling the defendant, General Motors, LLC, to provide further responses and produce documents related to requests numbers 1-3, 9, 13-17, and 34-45.

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests numbers 1-3, 9, 13, 15, and 17, as the defendant's objections to those requests are without merit. The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests numbers 14, 16, and 34-36, as those requests are overbroad and unduly burdensome.

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests numbers 37-45, but only to the extent that the requests relate to customer complaints about defects in vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make, and model as the subject vehicle.

The court orders the defendant to provide further written responses and produce documents within 20 days of the date of service of this order. The court also orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
