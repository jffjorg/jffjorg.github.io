The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests numbers 1-3, 9, 13, 15, and 17, as the defendant's objections to those requests are without merit. The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests numbers 14, 16, and 34-36, as those requests are overbroad and unduly burdensome.

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests numbers 37-45, but only to the extent that the requests relate to customer complaints about defects in vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make, and model as the subject vehicle.

The court orders the defendant to provide further written responses and produce documents within 20 days of the date of service of this order. The court also orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.

## English Summary

In this tentative ruling, Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III addresses Plaintiff Jose Hernandez's motion to compel Defendant General Motors, LLC to provide more documents.
