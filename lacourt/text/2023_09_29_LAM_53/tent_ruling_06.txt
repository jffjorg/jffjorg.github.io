MOVING PARTY:                 Applicant Scott C. Ferrier      
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Application of Scott. C. Ferrier to be Admitted Pro Hac Vice
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this application.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Applicant Scott C. Ferrier
requests an order permitting them
to appear as counsel pro hac vice
for plaintiff Forex Express Corp., d/b/a Wirecash in this action. 
The court finds that the
application complies with California Rules of Court, rule 9.40.  However, the court notes that applicant Scott
C. Ferrier has not presented evidence showing that they paid a reasonable fee
not exceeding $50 to the State Bar of California with a copy of this
application and the notice of hearing that was served on the State Bar.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 9.40, subd.
(e).)  The court therefore grants the
application and orders that (1) Scott C. Ferrier is permitted to appear as
counsel pro hac vice for plaintiff Forex Express Corp., d/b/a Wirecash in this
action, and (2) Scott C. Ferrier shall pay to the State Bar of California a
reasonable fee not exceeding $50 within 20 days of the date of this order.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 9.40, subd. (a).) 
The court orders plaintiff
Forex Express Corp., d/b/a Wirecash to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
