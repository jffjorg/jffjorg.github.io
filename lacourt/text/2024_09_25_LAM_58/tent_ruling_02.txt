I.              
STEFFANIE STELNICK’S MOTION 
 
Moving Party’s Position 
            
Defendant Jamisha Duncan’s former
counsel, Steffanie Stelnick (“Stelnick”), moves the Court for an order to release
a portion of the proceeds that were deposited with the Court, arguing the
following. 
 
On October 29, 2022, and April 23,
2023, Stelnick and Defendant entered into Hourly Fee Agreements that allow
Stelnick to attach liens to any recovery that Defendant may obtain whether via
judgment, settlement, or otherwise. On December 8 and 11, 2023, Stelnick was
relieved as counsel for Defendant in Case Numbers 22CMCV00583 and 22STCV33544,
respectively. 
 
On or around January 2, 2024, Stelnick
filed two Notices of Lien: one in 22STCV33544 for $11,063.58 and the second in
22CMCV00583 for $24,263.43, a total of $35,327.01. 
 
Subsequently, Stelnick filed Notices
of Lien against Defendant’s interest in real property. However, because those
liens had to be removed for title to be perfected and the real property sold,
Stelnick signed a Stipulation and Agreement providing that Defendant’s proceeds
from the sale will be deposited with the Clerk of Court and would remain with
the Court until further court order. Stelnick removed her liens on the real
property. 
 
On May 1, 2024, Stelnick received
notice that Defendant’s proceeds of $150,883.82 had been deposited with the
Court. 
 
On June 10, 2024, Stelnick moved for a
distribution of $35,328.01 from those proceeds for her liens. (Her two liens
actually total $35,327.01.) 
 
Opposition 
 
            Keystone
Law Group, P.C. (“Keystone”), Defendant’s former counsel, opposes Stelnick’s
motion. 
 
Kesystone relies on Civil Code section
2897, which states: “Other things being equal, different liens upon the same
property have priority according to the time of their creation, except in cases
of bottomry and respondentia.”
 
            Keystone
asserts a lien of $92,598.98. (It appears, however that based on its invoices,
more than $20,000 of this amount was incurred after it substituted out as
Janisha’s attorneys on August 31, 2022.) Keystone contends that its lien has
priority over Stelnick’s attorney fee liens because Keystone’s lien was created
before Stelnick’s liens, on July 2, 2021, when Defendant and Keystone entered
into Attorney-Client Hourly Fee Agreement. The agreement contained an attorney
lien provision. Stelnick’s liens were created after Keystone’s liens (i.e., October
29, 2022, and April 2, 2023, when Stelnick and Defendant entered into their
Hourly Fee Agreements). In addition, Stelnick had constructive notice of Keystone’s
Notice of Lien, because the notice was filed in the estate proceeding where Keystone
represented Defendant and also served Defendant with the notice. Stelnick was
also made aware that on November 2, 2023, Defendant owed Keystone approximately
$82,000 in fees. 
 
            Keystone
asserts that because its lien takes priority over Stelnick’s liens, the Court
should deny Stelnick’s motion and instead order that $92,598.98 be released to
Keystone to satisfy its attorney lien. 
 
            Keystone
also argues that Stelnick failed to serve Keystone with the motion. 
 
Reply 
 
            In
reply, Stelnick does not address Civil Code section 2897  or dispute Keystone’s argument that Keystone’s
lien has priority over her liens. Instead, she argues (among other things) that
Keystone delayed in filing its motion for distribution and that, contrary to
Keystone’s argument, she provided the firm copies of her instant motion and minute
order. She argues that the Court should disregard Keystone’s allegations and
allow the proceeds to be distributed to her. 
 
Relevant Law
 
“A lien in favor of an attorney upon
the proceeds of a prospective judgment in favor of his client for legal
services rendered has been recognized in numerous cases. Such a lien may be
created either by express contract … [citations], or it may be implied if the
retainer agreement between the lawyer and client indicates that the former is
to look to the judgment for payment of his fee [citations].” (Cetenko v. United
California Bank (1982) 30 Cal.3d 528, 531.)
 
“Civil Code section 2897 provides: ‘Other
things being equal, different liens upon the same property have priority
according to the time of their creation, except in cases of bottomry and respondentia.’”
(Bluxome Street Associates v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 1149, 1158 (Bluxome).)
 
“Under Civil Code section 2897, [the]
analysis of the priority of … [a] lien does not end with the determination that
it was created prior to [other] liens. The language of the statute itself
requires that [the court] also determine whether the equities of the
lienholders are equal. [Citations.] For example, in [one case], the trial court’s
determination that a judgment creditor’s lien had priority over a prior
contractual lien of an attorney for services performed in the action was upheld
on appeal on the ground that the equities favored the judgment lien creditor.
The contract between the plaintiff-debtor and the attorney to grant the
attorney a lien was not made until after the judgment creditor had given notice
that it intended to move the court for a lien under Code of Civil Procedure
section 688.1.” (Bluxome, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at p. 1159
[emphasis added].)
 
Here, (1) Keystone’s lien has priority
over Stelnick’s liens because the former lien was created first and Stelnick
had notice of the Keystone lien; and (2) equities between Keystone and Stelnick
are otherwise equal because they both have attorney liens. 
 
Both parties cite Fletcher v. Davis
(2004) 33 Cal.4th 61 and Carroll v. Interstate Brands Corp. (2002). 99 Cal.App.4th
1168 for general principles of the law regarding attorney liens. “An attorney’s
lien (also known as a ‘charging’ lien) is a lien that secures an attorney’s
compensation against the client's assets.”  Once created, the attorney's lien grants the
attorney a security interest in specific property, and the attorney has the
right to receive payment from such property before payment can be made to the
client. (Fletcher v. Davis (2004) 33 Cal.4th 61, 66-67.) 
 
Stelnick also cites Isrin v.
Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1965), 63 Cal.2d 153 for the
principle that attorneys’ liens are provided for by legislation in limited
instances and may be created by express provision of retainer contract between
attorney and her client.
 
Stelnick cites Code of Civil Procedure
section 873.820, which states that “proceeds of sale for any property sold
shall be applied in the following order: (a) Payment of the expenses of sale.
(b) Payment of the other costs of partition in whole or in part or to secure
any cost of partition later allowed. (c) Payment of any liens on the property
in their order of priority except liens which under the terms of sale are to
remain on the property.” 
. 
Finally, Stelnick cites Code of Civil
Procedure section 708.410, subdivision (c), which states that a judgment
creditor “shall serve on all parties who, prior thereto, have made an
appearance in the action or special proceeding a copy of the notice of lien and
a statement of the date when the notice of lien was filed in the action or
special proceeding.” 
            
II.           
KEYSTONE’S MOTION 
 
Moving Party’s Position 
            
On August 29, 2024, Keystone filed its
own Motion for Order for Distribution of Proceeds Deposited With the Court.
 
Keystone’s motion and its opposition
to Stelnick’s motion are virtually identical.
 
Stelnick’s Opposition 
 
            In her
opposition to Keystone’s motion, Stelnick generally makes the same arguments
that she made in her reply in support of her motion. 
 
            Stelnick
maintains that Keystone has not proved that its requested $92,598.98 is
reasonable. Keystone, she argues, has only provided vague descriptions of the
work it performed. Keystone has not provided the billing rate for the work
performed. 
 
Keystone’s Reply 
 
In reply, Keystone argues that nowhere
in the opposition does Stelnick dispute (or even address) the fact that
Keystone’s lien (as the first-in-time) takes priority over hers. 
 
Second, as to the reasonableness of
Keystone’s fees, Stelnick has cited inapplicable law. Stelnick cites Probate
Code section 1472, which concerns fees for counsel appointed by a court in
guardianships, conservatorships, and other protective proceedings. This statute
is inapplicable, as this is not a protected proceeding, nor did Keystone
represent Defendant in a protected proceeding. Next, Stelnick cites PLCM
Group. Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095, which relates
specifically to entitlement to attorney’s fees to the prevailing party in litigation
pursuant to a contract. This is also inapplicable to Keystone’s lien, as this
matter does not involve a court’s award of attorney’s fees, but rather is a
straightforward right to and lien securing attorney’s fees are inapplicable. Stelnick’s
reliance on cases concerning the amount of attorney’s fees is off the topic. 
 
Finally, Stelnick, as a competing
lienholder, does not have standing to object to the attorney’s fees Jamisha
incurred during her representation by Keystone. The client, Jamisha Duncan, is
the only one with standing to dispute the fees. Stelnick no longer represents Defendant
and cannot speak on her behalf. 
 
Discussion
 
An issue in Keystone’s motion is the
total amount subject to lien. The Court concludes Keystone cannot assert a lien
for any work done when it no longer represented Jamisha Duncan. 
 
Keystone states in its motion: “Per Jamisha’s
express request, Keystone’s provision of legal services concluded on August 31,
2022 when Keystone filed a Substitution of Attorney form signed by both Keystone
and Jamisha. Oberto Decl., ¶ 6, Exhibit 3, Substitution of Attorney form.”
(Motion, p. 3:15-17 [bold emphasis removed].) Keystone also states that on
September 8, 2022, it sent a closing letter to Defendant confirming the
termination of the attorney-client relationship. (Motion, p. 3:18-19.)
 
As of August 31, 2022, the amount
Jamisha owed to Keystone’s lien was $69,370.07. (See Oberto Decl., Exhibit 2 –
copies of the invoices, Invoice # 41605 with “Period End Date: 8/31/2022.”) 
 
            Despite
its own invoices reflecting that Jamisha owed Keystone on August 31, 2022 a
total of $69,370.07, Keystone seeks compensation for work done after that, through
August 2024.  Keystone has offered no
factual or legal justification for why a lien attaches to purported billings
when it no longer represented Jamisha Duncan. 
Moreover, Keystone has provided no unredacted invoices of the services
it provided after August 2022.  The Court
concludes that these post-termination amounts are not subject to any lien
enforceable here.  
 
On the other hand,
Stelnick seeks to challenge Keystone’s fees. She has not cited (and the Court
has not found) any authority permitting her to do so.  Here, the client, Defendant Jamisha Duncan has
not objected to Keystone’s lien. 
 
Stelnick fails to
address the lien priority established by Civil code section 2897.  The Keystone lien takes priority over
Stelnick’s lien.
 
Conclusion
 
            The
Court orders that from the funds deposited in Court for the benefit of Jamisha
Duncan, the amount of $69,370.07 shall be paid to Keystone Law Group P.C. in
full satisfaction of its lien rights.  If
there are funds remaining, they shall be paid to the Law Office of Steffanie
Stelnick up to the sum of $35,327.01.
