And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the second amended complaint in the case Westlake Services, LLC v. Perl. The demurrer was filed by the defendant, Chaim Perl, and argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of contract and common counts. The judge has sustained the demurrer to both causes of action, but has given the plaintiff, Westlake Services, LLC, leave to amend the complaint.

The judge found that the complaint fails to adequately allege a breach of contract, as it does not specify how the defendant's actions arose to a breach of the contract. The judge also found that the complaint fails to adequately state a cause of action for common counts, as it is based on the same facts as the breach of contract claim and seeks the same amount of damages.

The judge has given the plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint and has set a hearing date for September 25, 2024, to consider any amended complaint.
