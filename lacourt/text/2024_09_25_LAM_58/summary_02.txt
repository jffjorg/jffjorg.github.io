English text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses two motions for distribution of proceeds deposited with the court: one filed by Steffanie Stelnick, Jamisha Duncan's former counsel, and another filed by Keystone Law Group, P.C., Jamisha Duncan's former counsel. The court grants Keystone's motion for distribution of $69,370.07, which is the amount Jamisha Duncan owed Keystone as of August 31, 2022. The court also grants Stelnick's motion for distribution of up to $35,327.01, but only after Keystone's lien has been satisfied.

The court concludes that Keystone's lien takes priority over Stelnick's lien based on Civil Code section 2897, which establishes that different liens on the same property have priority according to the time of their creation. The court also finds that Keystone's fees are reasonable and that Stelnick lacks standing to object to Keystone's fees.

The court orders that the funds deposited in court for Jamisha Duncan's benefit be distributed as follows: $69,370.07 shall be paid to Keystone Law Group, P.C. in full satisfaction of its lien rights, and any remaining funds shall be paid to the Law Office of Steffanie Stelnick up to the sum of $35,327.01.
