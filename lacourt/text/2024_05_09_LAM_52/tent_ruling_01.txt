  Case Number:  19STCV15834    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Richard Owens’s Motion for Reconsideration
Plaintiff Richard Owens moves for reconsideration of
the court’s order granting defendant City of Los Angeles’s motion for nonsuit.
The court cannot consider a motion for reconsideration
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. 
“[A] motion for reconsideration may only be considered before final
judgment is entered and while the case is still pending in the trial court.”  (Betz v. Pankow (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th
931, 937.)  The court entered final
judgment in this action on March 27, 2024. 
It is too late for reconsideration. 

Assuming the court had the power to reconsider its
order granting nonsuit, it would not do so. 
A
motion for reconsideration must be “based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law.”  (CCP §
1008(a).)  The moving party “shall state
by affidavit… what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to
be shown.”  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff does not show new or different
facts, circumstances, or law that warrant reconsidering the court’s order
granting nonsuit.
The
motion is denied.
