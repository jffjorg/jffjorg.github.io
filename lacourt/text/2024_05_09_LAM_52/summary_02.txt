And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court's tentative ruling grants plaintiff Peter Alexan Enterprises Inc.'s motions to compel further responses to requests for production and form interrogatories. The court also grants the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against defendant Jara Blash, ordering her to pay $4,560 in sanctions.

The court also rules on the defendant's motions, granting her motion for a protective order to delay her deposition and allowing her to take her deposition remotely. The court also denies the defendant's demurrer to the first amended complaint, rejecting her arguments that she cannot be liable for interference with the plaintiff's business relationships.

The court finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts for causes of action for intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, and that the defendant's conduct, including spreading false statements and refusing to return company files and property, constitutes wrongful conduct.

The court also rules on the defendant's request for a protective order to delay her deposition, granting her motion to require that the deposition be taken at a location within 75 miles of her residence.
