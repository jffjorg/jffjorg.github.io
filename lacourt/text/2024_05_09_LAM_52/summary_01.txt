Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's order granting nonsuit. The court's order granting nonsuit was entered on March 27, 2024, and it is too late to reconsider it. Even if the court had the power to reconsider its order, it would not do so because the plaintiff has not shown new or different facts, circumstances, or law that warrant reconsidering the order. The court can only consider a motion for reconsideration before final judgment is entered and while the case is still pending in the trial court.
