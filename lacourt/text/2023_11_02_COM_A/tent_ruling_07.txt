[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STRIKE PORTION OF PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT
 
       The complaint alleges a claim for
negligence arising from a slip-and-fall incident that allegedly occurred on
Defendant’s premises.
       Defendant moves to strike the claim for
punitive damages as it is not supported by any facts showing malice, fraud, or
oppression. Leave to amend should not be granted. Defendant timely served the
motion on Plaintiff on September 27, 2023. No opposition has been filed. 
       The predicate acts
to support a claim for punitive damages must be intended to cause injury or
must constitute “malicious” or “oppressive” conduct as defined by statute.
“Malice” is defined as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause
injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the
defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others.” (Civ. Code, § 3294 subd. (c)(1).) "Oppression" is defined as “despicable conduct that subjects
a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's
rights.” (Civ. Code,
§ 3294 subd. (a) subd. (c)(2).)  Absent an intent to injure the plaintiff, the
conduct must be “despicable” which is defined as “base, vile, or contemptible.”
(College Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court of Orange County (1994) 8
Cal.4th 704, 725.) 
       Plaintiff filed a Judicial
Council Form complaint which does not allege any facts indicating malice,
fraud, or oppression. The complaint arises from negligence. Conduct
constituting negligence, gross negligence, or recklessness is insufficient to
support a claim for punitive damages. (Dawes v. Superior Court (1980)
111 Cal. App. 3d 82, 87.) 
       Without
an opposition, there is no showing that Plaintiff can amend the complaint to state
a claim for punitive damages, which is Plaintiff’s burden. (Association of Community Organizations for Reform
Now v. Department of Industrial Relations (1995) 41 Cal. App. 4th 298, 302.) Accordingly, the motion to strike paragraph
14(a)(2) of the complaint requesting punitive damages is GRANTED without leave
to amend.
