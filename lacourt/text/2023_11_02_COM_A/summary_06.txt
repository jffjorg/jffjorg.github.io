And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to vacate the court's order of waiver of trial by jury. The Plaintiff, Derrick Coleman, Jr., failed to post jury fees prior to the Case Management Conference as required by statute, resulting in a waiver of jury trial. Despite this, the Judge has discretion to allow a jury trial, and the right to jury trial is fundamental. Since there has been no prejudice to the other party or to the court from an inadvertent waiver, the motion is granted. The Plaintiff has timely served the motion, and no opposition has been filed. The Judge orders that the waiver of jury trial is set aside, and the case will proceed with a jury trial.
