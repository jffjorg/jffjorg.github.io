The judge also rules that the plaintiff cannot amend the complaint to state a claim for punitive damages without showing that the defendant's conduct was intended to cause injury or was malicious or oppressive. The motion to strike paragraph 14(a)(2) of the complaint requesting punitive damages is granted without leave to amend.
