[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
MOTION
 TO VACATE COURT’S ORDER OF WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY
 
       Plaintiff
failed to post jury fees prior to the Case Management Conference as required by
statute, resulting in a waiver of jury trial. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 631; Min. Ord. August 9,
 2023.) Plaintiff seeks relief from the waiver. Plaintiff
timely served Defendants with the motion on September 27, 2023. No opposition
has been filed. 
       A
party waives jury trial by failing to timely pay the jury fee. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 631 (f) (5).) 
The court has discretion to allow a jury
trial although there may have been a waiver. (Code Civ. Proc., § 631 (g).) While Plaintiff seeks relief under Civil
Procedure, section 473(b), relief from waiver may be granted where there has
been no prejudice to the other party or to the court from an inadvertent
waiver. (Code Civ. Proc., § 631 (g); Wharton v.
Superior Court (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 100, 104.) Because the right to jury trial is
fundamental, doubts are resolved in favor of allowing a jury trial. (Tesoro del Valle Master Homeowners
Assn. v. Griffin (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 619, 638.)
       The
Court’s electronic file reflects that Plaintiff posted jury fees on October 4,
2023. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
