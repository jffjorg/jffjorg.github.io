And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has not yet decided on the Receiver's motion to approve the Receiver's Certificate, approve the listing agreement, and authorize the appointment of Receiver's counsel. The Receiver has requested an order to approve a Receiver's Certificate to secure a line of credit for $100,000 to pay for expenses incurred in securing the property and to improve it in preparation for sale. The Receiver has also requested permission to retain Buchalter, a Professional Corporation, as Receiver's counsel for litigation matters. However, the court finds that the motion is premature and orders the Receiver to submit a Rehabilitation Plan and Cost Estimate to be submitted for the court's approval before the motion can be further considered.
