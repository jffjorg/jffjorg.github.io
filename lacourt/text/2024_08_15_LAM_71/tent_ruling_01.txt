 Hearing
  Date:  August 2, 2024



 
Plaintiff Andre Taylor’s unopposed motion to compel Defendant
Barrett Financial Group, LLC to provide further responses to its Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 12 and 13 is granted.  Defendant
is ordered to produce Code-compliant responses without boilerplate objections
within 20 days.
 
          Plaintiff Andre Taylor (“Taylor”) (“Plaintiff”)
moves unopposed to compel further responses to its Special
Interrogatories (Set One) (“SROG”) Nos. 12 and 13 from Defendant Barrett
Financial Group, LLC (“BFG”) (“Defendant”).  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §2030.300.)
 
Meet and Confer
On July 26, 2024, the parties participated in an
Informal Discovery Conference on the instant motion.  After discussion, this Court deemed the
issues unresolved.  (7/26/24 Minute Order
IDC.)
 
Background
          On January
23, 2024, Plaintiff propounded its SROG on Defendant.  (Decl. of Lofton ¶2, Exh. A.)  On February 26, 2024, Defendant served
responses to the SROG.  (Decl. of Lofton
¶2, Exh. A.)
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on April 30, 2024. 
As of the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
          Discussion
A “party may obtain discovery regarding any matter,
not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action . . . if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  (C.C.P. §2017.010.)  “[A] civil litigant’s right to discovery is
broad” and the “statutes governing discovery must be construed liberally in
favor of disclosure.”  (Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541.)  When “a deponent fails to answer any question
. . . specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party
seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer or
production.”  (C.C.P. §2025.480(a).)
“[E]vidence is ‘relevant’ if it might reasonably
assist a party in evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a
settlement.”  (Moore v. Mercer (2016)
4 Cal.App.5th 424, 447).  A party is
entitled to discover “any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action.”  (C.C.P. §2017.010.)  The phrase “subject matter” is broader than
relevancy to the issues (which determines admissibility of evidence at trial).  (Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1392.)  Courts have uniformly held that, for discovery
purposes, information should be regarded as “relevant” to the subject matter if
it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial,
or facilitating settlement.  (Stewart
v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1013.)
SROG Nos. 12 and 13 seek basic information relating
to Plaintiff’s PAGA claims, specifically, the number of pay periods worked by
Defendant’s employees during the PAGA period.  This information is relevant and should not be
onerous for Defendant to provide, considering multiple sections of the Labor
Code require Defendant to record the days and hours worked by non-exempt
employees, and to make those records available to the Labor Commissioner upon
request.  (See Labor Code §§226,
247.5, 1174.)
Defendant’s objection on the basis that producing
the information in SROG Nos. 12 and 13 is unavailing because Defendant has the
burden of establishing the nature of any claimed burden, and it has failed to
do so, either in its responses or in subsequent attempts to meet and confer.  (See Williams v. Superior Court (2017)
3 Cal. 5th 531, 549 [“An ‘objection based upon burden must be sustained by evidence
showing the quantum of work required.’”].)
Further, Plaintiff suggested at least two ways that
Defendant could obtain the requested information with relative ease — namely,
by checking the audit logs for the software used by its employees (Calyx
Point), and/or by checking the email outboxes for mail sent by employees during
the relevant timeframe. Plaintiff was very specific that he was not seeking the
contents of any email messages or Calyx Point activity — merely evidence of the
activity itself as reflected in date and time stamps associated with sent
emails and/or activity in the audit logs. Defendant admitted that it never made
any effort to even look at these sources of information, much less made any
determination as to how difficult it would be to provide the requested data to
Plaintiff.
C.C.P. §2030.220(b) requires that if an
interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it must be answered to the extent
possible.  C.C.P. §2030.220(c) mandates
that a responding party must make "”a reasonable and good faith effort to
obtain the information by inquiry.” 
Here, Defendant has made no effort to answer these
interrogatories to any extent whatsoever, and has made no reasonable or good
faith effort to inquire about the requested information, even after Plaintiff’s
counsel provided specific suggestions as to where relevant information could be
easily obtained.
Accordingly, Defendant is ordered to provide
substantive, responsive answers without boilerplate objections to SROG Nos. 12
and 13 within 20 days.
 
Conclusion
          Plaintiff’s
unopposed motion to compel further answers to SROG Nos. 12 and 13 from
Defendant is granted.  Defendant is ordered
to produce Code-compliant responses without boilerplate objections within 20
days.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
