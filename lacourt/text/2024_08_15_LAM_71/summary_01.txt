And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff Andre Taylor's unopposed motion to compel Defendant Barrett Financial Group, LLC to provide further responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 12 and 13. The defendant is ordered to produce code-compliant responses without boilerplate objections within 20 days.

The judge finds that the information requested in the special interrogatories is relevant to the subject matter of the pending action and is not privileged. The judge also finds that the defendant has failed to make a good faith effort to obtain the requested information, despite suggestions from the plaintiff's counsel.

The judge notes that the defendant's objection to providing the information is unavailing because the defendant has failed to show the quantum of work required to provide the requested information. The judge also finds that the defendant's failure to answer the interrogatories to any extent whatsoever is not justified.

The judge concludes that the defendant must provide substantive, responsive answers without boilerplate objections to the special interrogatories within 20 days.
