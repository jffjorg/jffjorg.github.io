And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to expunge the notice of pendency of action recorded by the plaintiff on January 20, 2011. The plaintiff, Carol Wyatt Berkley, filed a lawsuit against various defendants regarding real property in Pacoima, California, and recorded a notice of pendency of action in the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office. However, the action was dismissed over 10 years ago, and the plaintiff has failed to respond to the defendant's requests to withdraw the notice of pendency of action. The defendant, U.S. Bank Trust National Association, has an interest in the property and has filed a motion to expunge the notice of pendency of action. The judge has granted the motion, citing California Code of Civil Procedure sections 405.30, 405.31, and 405.32, which allow for the expungement of a notice of pendency of action where the action does not present a real property claim or where the recording party cannot establish the probable validity of the real property claim.
