SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 1/13/11, Plaintiff Carol Wyatt Berkley (Plaintiff),
representing herself, filed this action against various defendants regarding real
property commonly known as 12750 Daventry St., Pacoima, California 91331 (the
Property).  On 1/20/11, Plaintiff recorded
a Notice of Pendency of Action in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office as
Instrument Number 20110109235 which gives notice of a suit affecting the
Property.  (Davieau Decl. ¶5, Ex.A).  On 1/31/11, while still representing herself,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint. 
On 2/24/11, Plaintiff substituted in attorney Wilma R. Shanks to
represent her in this action.  On 6/8/11,
attorney Shanks on behalf of Plaintiff filed a Request for Dismissal of the
entire action with prejudice which was entered that day.  (Davieau Decl. ¶6).  
 
On or about 10/17/14, the beneficial interest in the Deed
of Trust encumbering the Property was assigned from JPMorgan Chase Bank,
National Association to NRZ Pass-Through Trust IV, U.S. Bank National
Association as Trustee, and a Corporate Assignment of Deed of Trust was
recorded on 10/17/14 in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office as Instrument
Number 20141097669.  (RJN, Ex.3).  On 2/14/22, the beneficial interest in the
Deed of Trust was assigned to NRZ Pass-Through Trust VIII, which assignment was
recorded on 2/17/22 as Instrument Number 20220196516.  (RJN, Ex.4). 
Thereafter, on 11/9/23, the beneficial interest in the Deed of Trust was
assigned to U.S. Bank Trust National Association, solely as Trustee for RCF 2
Acquisition Trust’s (U.S. Bank), which assignment was recorded on 12/21/23 as Instrument
Number 20230899636.  (RJN, Ex.5).  
 
Plaintiff has failed to respond to U.S. Banks’s requests to
withdraw the Lis Pendens.  (See
Davieau Decl. ¶¶8-10).  Therefore, on
2/5/24, U.S. Bank filed (served on 2/1/24) a motion for an order allowing U.S.
Bank to intervene in this action pursuant to CCP 387 for the sole and limited
purpose of filing a Motion to Expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action recorded
by Plaintiff in connection with this action. 
No opposition or other response to the motion was filed and the motion
was granted on 9/25/24.
 
On 2/5/24, U.S. Bank filed (served on 2/1/24) the instant
motion seeking an order expunging the Notice of Pendency of Action recorded by
Plaintiff on 1/20/11 in the Los Angeles Recorder’s Office as Instrument No.
20110109235 (Lis Pendens).  No opposition
or other response to the motion has been filed. 

 
ANALYSIS
 
U.S. Bank’s Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is
granted.  
 
At any time after notice of pendency of action has been
recorded, any party, or any nonparty with an interest in the real property
affected thereby, may apply to the court in which the action is pending to
expunge the notice.  CCP 405.30.  As evidenced by the granting of U.S. Bank’s
motion to intervene, U.S. Bank has an interest in the Property.  
 
A lis pendens may be expunged where the action does not
present a real property claim or where the recording party cannot establish the
probable validity of the real property claim.  CCP 405.31, 405.32.  This action was dismissed over 10 years ago
as such there is no valid basis for the Lis Pendens which acts as a cloud on
title to the Property.  Amalgamated
Bank (2007) 149 CA4th 1003, 1011.  A
motion to expunge lis pendens may be made in the trial court even after
judgment has been entered.  Peery
(1981) 29 C3d 837, 842.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
