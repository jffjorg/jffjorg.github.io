The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants, Bank of America, N.A. and Carla Jaco, to the second, fourth, and fifth causes of action in the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend as to the second and fourth causes of action, which are based on California Commercial Code 4103 and negligence, respectively. The demurrer is overruled as to the fifth cause of action, which is based on conversion. The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for violation of California Commercial Code 4103 and has failed to establish a duty of care owed by the defendants to the plaintiff. The judge also finds that the negligence claim is barred by the economic loss rule and that the conversion claim can proceed. The answer(s) is(are) due within 30 days.
