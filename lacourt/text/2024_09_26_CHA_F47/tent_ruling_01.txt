SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Edgar Buniatyan’s
(Plaintiff) claim that there were $206,594.89 in unauthorized transactions from
2/7/24 through 3/1/24 debited from Plaintiff’s Bank of America, N.A. (BANA)
checking account.  (FAC ¶11).  On 3/11/24, Plaintiff reported the alleged
unauthorized transactions to Defendant Carla Jaco (Jaco), a banker and employee
of BANA, who allegedly promised that she would close Plaintiff’s checking
account and would process Plaintiff’s claim for investigation.  (FAC ¶13). 
Plaintiff immediately received a temporary credit to his checking
account in the amount of $82,494.81. 
(FAC ¶12).  Because BANA determined
that Plaintiff authorized the remaining charges, the remaining charges were not
credited to Plaintiff’s account.  (FAC
¶¶14, 16).
 
Based on the foregoing, on 5/9/14, Plaintiff filed this
action against BANA and Does 1-50 for: (1) Violation of California Commercial
Code 4401, (2) Violation of California Commercial Code 4103, (3) Breach of
Contract, (4) Negligence and (5) Conversion. 
On 6/7/24, Plaintiff filed the subject First Amended Complaint alleging
the same five causes of action and including Jaco as a defendant in the 4th
cause of action for negligence.  After
meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the issues BANA and Jaco
(collectively, Defendants) had with the First Amended Complaint, on 8/21/24,
Defendants filed and served the instant demurrer to the 2nd, 4th
and 5th causes of action in the First Amended Complaint on the
ground that the claims do not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.  CCP 430.10(e).  Plaintiff has opposed the demurrer and
Defendants have filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
2nd cause of action – Violation of
California Commercial Code 4103
 
California Commercial Code 4103 provides: 
 
“(a) The
effect of the provisions of this division may be varied by agreement, but the parties to the agreement cannot disclaim a bank's responsibility for
its lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care or limit
the measure of damages for the lack
or failure. However, the parties
may determine by
agreement the standards by which the bank's responsibility
is to be measured if those standards
are not manifestly unreasonable.
(b) Federal
Reserve regulations and operating circulars,
clearing house rules, and the like have the effect of
agreements under subdivision (a),
whether or not specifically assented to by all parties interested in items
handled.
(c) Action
or nonaction approved by this division or pursuant to Federal Reserve
regulations or operating circulars is the
exercise of ordinary care and, in the absence of special instructions, action
or nonaction consistent with clearing house rules
and the like or with a general banking usage not disapproved by this
division, is prima
facie the exercise of ordinary care.
(d) The
specification or approval of certain procedures by this division is not disapproval of other
procedures that may be
reasonable under the circumstances.
(e) The
measure of damages for failure to exercise ordinary care in handling an item is
the amount of the item reduced by an amount that could
not have been realized by the exercise of
ordinary care. If there is also bad faith it includes any other
damages the party suffered as
a proximate consequence.”
 
Contrary to Plaintiff’s assertion, California Commercial
Code 4103(e) does not establish that a  
bank, such as BANA, owes a duty of care to its customers or authorize a
cause of action for violation of any duty. 
See Mills (2008) 166 CA4th 871, 888-889.  Commercial Code 4103(e), merely prescribes
the measure of damages for failure to exercise ordinary care.
 
In the opposition, Plaintiff also argues that the
allegations in the First Amended Complaint are sufficient to state a claim for
violation of Commercial Code 3103 and/or 1304. 
However, the 2nd cause of action only references Commercial
Code 4103.  Even if Commercial Code 3103
and/or 1304 were referenced in the 2nd cause of action, the claim
would fail.  Neither Commercial Code 3103
nor 1304 set forth any duty of care. 
Commercial Coe 3103 merely defines “ordinary care” and Commercial Code 1304
provides that where a duty exists, it must be performed in good faith.  No obligation of good faith exists with
regard to Commercial Code 4103 because that statute does not establish that a
bank owes a duty of care to its customers. 
See Mills, supra.
 
4th cause of action – Negligence
 
The elements of a negligence cause of action are: (1) existence
of a legal duty, (2) breach of that duty and (3) breach as the proximate cause
of injury.  See Federico
(1997) 59 CA4th 1207, 1211.
 
The relationship between a bank, such as BANA, and its
customer, such as Plaintiff, is contractual and banks do not have a common law
fiduciary duty to their customers.  Kurtz-Ahlers,
LLC 48 CA5th 952, 956-961; Chazen (1998) 61 CA4th 532, 537.  The facts alleged do not show that BANA or
Jaco owed Plaintiff any duty of care aside from the contractual agreement
between a bank and its customer. 
 
Additionally, the negligence claim is barred by the
economic loss rule which precludes recovery for tort damages if the defendant’s
alleged wrongful conduct results only in economic loss.  See Erlich (1999) 21 C4th 543,
552; Butler-Rupp (2005) 134 CA4th 1220, 1228.  No special relationship exists between
Plaintiff and Defendants which would support the imposition of tort damages in
this case.  See Southern
California Gas Leak Cases  (2019) 7
C5th 391, 400; Kurtz-Ahlers, supra at 956.  Plaintiff’s relationship with Defendants is
purely contractual and Plaintiff seeks to recover economic losses.  (FAC ¶¶58-62, 71, 75).  Plaintiff’s negligence claim depends on the
contractual relationship between the parties; therefore, Plaintiff’s recovery
is covered by and limited to the breach of contract cause of action.  See Robinson Helicopter Company,
Inc. (2004) 34 C4th 979, 991; Sheen 12 C5th 905, 922.
 
5th cause of action – Conversion
 
The elements of a conversion cause of action are: (1) the
plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of the property, (2) the
defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights and
(3) damages.  Lee (2015) 61 C4th
1225, 1240.  
 
Relying on several decades old cases, BANA argues that a
depositor such as Plaintiff cannot have a claim for conversion against it
because once the depositor deposits the money in the bank, the depositor is no
longer the owner or entitled to possession of any specific money.  (See Demurrer, p.6:17-p.7:4).  However, the opposition cites a 2018 case, Fong
(2018) 19 CA5th 224, which states “that there is no special rule preventing a
depositor from pursuing a conversion action against a bank that holds his or
her money.”  Id. at 232.  BANA fails to address Fong in its
reply.  
 
Based on the foregoing, BANA has failed to establish that
Plaintiff cannot pursue a conversion claim against it as a matter of law.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend as to
the 2nd and 4th causes of action.  While Plaintiff requests leave to amend if
the demurrer is sustained, Plaintiff has already had two opportunities to plead
these claims and Plaintiff has failed to indicate how the defects in the causes
of action can be cured by amendment as is his burden.  See Goodman (1976) 18 C3d 335,
349.
The demurrer is overruled as to the 5th cause
of action.
 
Answer(s) is(are) due within 30 days.
