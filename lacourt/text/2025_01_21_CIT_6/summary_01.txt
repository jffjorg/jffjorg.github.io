And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, as well as the parties' respective requests for monetary sanctions. The plaintiff had sought to compel further responses from the defendant, Grays Peak Capital GP LLC, regarding Form Interrogatories numbers 17.1 and 50.2 through 50.6. The defendant had previously provided supplemental responses to these interrogatories, but the plaintiff contended that these responses were incomplete and non-responsive.

The judge found that the defendant's responses were sufficient and that further responses were not warranted or reasonably feasible. The judge noted that the defendant's responses made it clear that it disputes the existence of an agreement between the parties, which is a foundational issue underlying the plaintiff's discovery requests. The judge also found that the plaintiff's motion was brought and opposed with substantial justification, and therefore denied the parties' requests for monetary sanctions.

The judge ordered the defendant to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of the order.
