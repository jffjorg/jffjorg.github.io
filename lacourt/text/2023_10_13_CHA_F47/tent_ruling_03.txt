SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of an alleged breach of a
commercial lease and guaranty of the lease. Plaintiffs Jeffrey Harris and
Austin Harris, Co-Trustees of the Harris Family Trust (Plaintiffs)
are the landlord and Defendant Extensions Plus
(Extensions Plus) is the tenant and Defendant Helene Stahl (Stahl) is the
guarantor (collectively, Defendants). 
Possession of the premises is not at issue as the tenant no longer
occupies the premises.  Plaintiffs
contend that the commercial tenant made unpermitted alterations causing
substantial damages to the property and then abandoned the premises with past
due rent owing to set up their business in a new location.  On 3/30/21, Plaintiffs filed this action for:
(1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing and (3) Common Count.  On
10/22/21, Defendants filed answers to the complaint. 
 
On 8/17/23, Plaintiffs issued a deposition subpoena to Bank
of Hope seeking “All Monthly Bank Statements for the
Months January 2019 through August 2023 for business Extensions Plus, Inc.”  (See Stahl Decl., Ex.A).  

 
On 9/25/23, Defendants filed the instant motion seeking an
order quashing Plaintiffs’ deposition subpoena served on the custodian of
records for Bank of Hope on 8/17/23 for Defendants’ bank records.  Additionally, Defendants seek an order
staying the deposition subpoena pending the resolution of this motion.  Further, Defendants’ request sanctions
against Plaintiffs and/or their counsel in the amount of $2,500.  Plaintiffs have opposed the motion and
Defendants have filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
The motion was not timely filed.  A motion must be filed at least 16 court days
before the hearing date.  CCP
1005(b).  Here, the instant motion was
filed on 9/25/23, only 14 court days before the 10/13/23 hearing date.  Additionally, there is no valid proof of
service for the motion.  The proof of
service attached to the motion indicates that it for “Defendants Helene Stahl
and Extensions Plus’ Response to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production, Set
Three.”  (See Motion, pdf
p.15).  Even if the proof of service was
for the instant motion, electronic service of the motion on 9/21/23 for the
10/13/23 hearing date did not provide the required 16 court days plus two court
days notice required.  CCP 1005(b); CCP
1010.6(a)(3)(B).  Plaintiffs contend that
they did not receive the motion until some unspecified date in October.  (See Opposition, p.4:4-5).  The proof of service also does not show
service of the motion on Bank of Hope. 
Failure to serve the motion on Bank of Hope does not invalidate the
motion; however, it may be raised by the Bank of Hope as an affirmative defense
in any action for liability for improper release of records.  CCP 1985.3(g).  
 
Regardless of the defect in service, Plaintiffs have
opposed the motion on the merits. 
Therefore, the Court will rule on the merits of the motion.
 
CCP 1987.1 provides: 
“(a) If a subpoena requires the
attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored information, or other
things before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of
a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in
subdivision (b), or upon the court's own motion after giving counsel notice and
an opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely,
modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as
the court shall declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court
may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from
unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the right
of privacy of the person.
(b) The following persons may make
a motion pursuant to subdivision (a):
(1) A party.
(2) A witness.
(3) A consumer described in Section
1985.3.
(4) An employee described in Section
1985.6.
(5) A person whose personally
identifying information, as defined in subdivision
(b) of Section 1798.79.8 of the Civil Code, is sought in connection with an
underlying action involving that person's exercise of free speech rights.
(c) Nothing in this section shall
require any person to move to quash, modify, or condition any subpoena duces
tecum of personal records of any consumer served under paragraph
(1) of subdivision (b) of Section 1985.3 or employment records of any
employee served under paragraph
(1) of subdivision (b) of Section 1985.6.”
 
Generally, information is discoverable if it is not
privileged and is relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  CCP 2017.010; Valley Bank of Nevada
(1975) 15 C3d 652, 655-656.    
 
Defendants contend that the bank records sought are
beyond the scope of discovery and are not reasonably calculated to reveal
admissible evidence.  Plaintiffs contend
that the bank records “are highly relevant to Defendant’s defenses raised, most
importantly their defenses raised based on the COVID-19 pandemic.”  (See Opposition, p.1:18-20).  However, neither of the Defendants’ answers make
any reference to COVID-19 as a defense. 
(See Extensions Plus Answer filed 10/22/21; Helene Stahl Answer
filed 10/22/21).  Nor do Plaintiffs’
provide any other evidence that Defendants have raised defenses based on
COVID-19.  (See Opposition,
generally).  
 
As such, Plaintiffs have failed to establish how the financial
records are relevant and/or reasonably likely to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.  
  
The Court notes that Defendants reference the California
Uniform Trade Secrets Act without explaining how it has any relevance to the
records sought.  (See Motion,
p.3:27-p.4:6).  Defendants also argue
that Helene Stahl’s personal bank records are irrelevant and in response
Plaintiffs argue that such records are relevant because she is the guarantor of
the lease.  (See Motion, p.4:7-12;
Opposition, p.2:19-21).  However, the
subject deposition subpoena does not seem to seek Stahl’s personal bank
records.  As noted above, the deposition
subpoena seeks “All Monthly Bank Statements for the Months January 2019 through
August 2023 for business Extensions Plus, Inc.” 
(See Stahl Decl., Ex.A).  
 
The Court further notes that Defendants failed to
electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the motion as required.  See CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Failure to comply with this requirement in
the future may result in papers not being considered, matters being continued
and/or the imposition of sanctions.
 
Although the request to quash the subpoena is granted,
the request for sanctions is denied. 
Defendants have failed to address the request for sanctions in the memorandum
and there is no declaration which supports of the request.  See CCP 1987.2(a); CCP 2023.040.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The request to quash the subpoena is granted.  The request for sanctions is denied.
