Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion to compel production of documents at a deposition. The case involves a dispute between neighbors, Alex Alvarado and Patricia Alvarado (Plaintiffs), and Michael Meadows (Defendant). The Plaintiffs have served multiple deposition notices on the Defendant, but he has failed to timely object to the notices and has failed to produce documents despite multiple requests. The Judge finds that the Defendant's failure to timely object has waived any objections he may have had to the deposition notice, and that he has failed to justify his objections. The Judge orders the Defendant to personally search for documents responsive to the requests and to produce them without objection within 15 days, and grants the Plaintiffs permission to further depose the Defendant for the limited purpose of questioning him regarding the documents. The Judge also imposes sanctions on the Defendant and his counsel in the amount of $3,640, payable within 30 days.
