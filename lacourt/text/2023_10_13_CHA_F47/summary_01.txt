And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Raul Perez vs. Enrique Perez, et al. The issue at hand is whether Attorney Hertz, who represents Enrique and Jonathan Perez, should be disqualified from representing Enrique due to a conflict of interest. The court has reviewed the facts and procedural history of the case and has found that Attorney Hertz has represented both Enrique and Jonathan in this action, which may create a conflict of interest. However, the court has also noted that Attorney Hertz no longer represents Jonathan, and that Jonathan's new counsel has filed joinders in papers filed by Attorney Hertz on behalf of Enrique. The court has ordered Jonathan's new counsel to file a declaration indicating whether he objects or does not object to Attorney Hertz's continued representation of Enrique. The hearing will be continued to allow Jonathan to file this declaration.
