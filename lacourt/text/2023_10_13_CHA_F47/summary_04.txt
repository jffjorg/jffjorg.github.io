And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling to continue the hearing in this case. The petitioners, Angelina Bawaan, David Bawaan, Jr., Isaac Bawaan, and Penelope Bawaan, filed a petition seeking relief from Government Code 945.4, but failed to provide proof of service for the petition. The petitioners also failed to reserve a hearing date initially, prompting the court to set an order to show cause. The petitioners later reserved a new hearing date, but still have not provided proof of service. The judge notes that Government Code 946.6 requires that a copy of the petition and a written notice of the hearing must be served on the respondents before the hearing. Since there is no evidence that the petitioners have served the respondents, the hearing will be continued until the defect in notice is cured.
