And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to quash a deposition subpoena seeking bank records from Bank of Hope. The defendants, Helene Stahl and Extensions Plus, argued that the subpoena was not timely filed and that the bank records were not relevant to the case. The judge agreed with the defendants, finding that the subpoena was filed only 14 days before the hearing date, which was less than the required 16 court days. The judge also found that the defendants had not established how the bank records were relevant to the case.

The judge denied the defendants' request for sanctions, however, as they had not provided sufficient evidence to support their claim. The judge also noted that the defendants had failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to their motion, as required by court rules.

Overall, the judge's ruling has quashed the deposition subpoena and prevented the plaintiffs from obtaining the bank records they sought.
