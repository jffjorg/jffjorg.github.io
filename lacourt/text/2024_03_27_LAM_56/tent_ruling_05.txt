  CASE NO.: 22STCV28980
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION
  FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES
 
8:30 a.m.
March 27, 2024
Dept. 56



 
On October 13, 2023, Plaintiffs Rosa Serna
and Vilma Serna (“Plaintiffs”) accepted a settlement offer made by Defendants, Nissan
North America, Inc. (“NNA”) and Nissan of Duarte (“Nissan of Duarte”)
(collectively “Defendants”), in the amount of $50,294.84. In addition to this
amount, Defendants agreed in the offer that Plaintiffs would surrender the
Subject Vehicle and if Plaintiffs’ counsel and Defendants did not agree on an
attorney’s fees amount, Plaintiffs would still have the right to petition this
Court for an award of the reasonable fees, costs, and expenses reasonably
earned and incurred during this litigation. (Saeedian Decl. ¶¶ 17-18.) Plaintiffs
now move for attorneys’ fees.
 
Defendants have agreed that Plaintiffs are
the prevailing party for purposes of the present fee motion in the terms of the
Settlement Agreement. (Saeedian Decl. ¶¶ 19- 21.) As the prevailing party,
Plaintiffs are entitled to recover its costs (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032), and
under the Song-Beverly Act, the prevailing party is entitled to attorneys’ fees
and costs pursuant to statute. (See, Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) Plaintiffs
request a lodestar fee amount of $31,252.50 for Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees,
costs and expenses as the “prevailing party” in this litigation. This amount
includes approximately 64.5 hours of time, including this fee motion. Michael
Saeedian, Esq. bills at an hourly rate of $695.00 per hour and his
managing  attorney, Christopher Urner
bills at a rate of $525.00 per hour. The firm’s law clerk Jorge Acosta bills at
a rate of $250 per hour.  
 
Plaintiffs also request $1,189.83 in
connection with “filing the complaint, service of process, and electronic
filing of documents and motions. “ (Saeedian Decl. ¶ 20.) Therefore, Plaintiffs
seek a total of $32,442.33. Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that fees are
appropriate and a letter of intent to repurchase does not reduce fees. These
fees also do not depend upon the settlement efforts, but rather fees are
appropriate based on counsel’s efforts.  
 
Defendant argues that all fees accrued in
connection with the Negligent Repair Claim asserted against a different
defendant are not recoverable as to Nissan of North America. “However, “[s]uch
fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation on an issue
common to both causes of action in which fees are proper and those in which
they are not.” (Bell, supra, 82 Cal.App.4th at p. 687.) Moreover,
“[a]pportionment is not required when the claims for relief are so intertwined
that it would be impracticable, if not impossible, to separate the attorney's
time into compensable and noncompensable units.”” (Santana v. FCA US, LLC
(2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 334, 349.)
 
The lodestar method looks at the time
spent on a matter multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. (Serrano, supra
20 Cal.3d at 49). The two-step process begins with the lodestar method, which
is the time spent on the matter multiple by the hourly rate. After the lodestar
method, the second step is determining whether a multiplier should be applied.
The factors that Courts look at to determine if a multiplier is reasonable are:
1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill
displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132). 
 
“In determining hourly rates, the court
must look to the “prevailing market rates in the relevant community.” (Bell
v. Clackamas County¿(9th Cir.2003) 341 F.3d 858, 868.) The rates of
comparable attorneys in the forum district are usually used. (See¿Gates v.
Deukmejian¿(9th Cir.1992) 987 F.2d 1392, 1405.) In making its calculation,
the court should also consider the experience, skill, and reputation of the
attorney requesting fees.” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy¿(2013)
215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009.) Plaintiffs argue the hourly rates are
reasonable. Here, the requested hourly rates are $525 and $695 for the
attorneys on this case and $250 for the certified law clerk. (Dec. Saeedian ¶¶ 3-5,11.)
Plaintiff argues that these rates are reasonable based on the experience of the
attorneys as well as the fact that counsel took the case on a contingency
basis.  
 
Defendant Nissan North America argues in
opposition that the hourly rates are too high because the matter was not a
complex matter, but rather a lemon law case. Further, the majority of the work involved
communicating with Plaintiffs and reviewing the file. Moreover, Defendant argues
that Plaintiffs’ reliance on the “Laffey Matrix,” is misguided. Defendant also
asserts that courts previously held Mr. Saaedian’s rates to be unreasonable and
therefore Defendant seeks to reduce the hourly rate to $350.00. 
 
Nevertheless, the Court finds that these
hourly rates are reasonable for this case based on the hourly rate of similarly
situated attorneys in the Los Angeles area. Based on the Laffey Matrix,
attorneys with similar years of experience as Michael Saeedian have comparable,
if not a higher hourly rate. Specifically, Michael Saeedian has been practicing
law for about fourteen years. Thus, the hourly rates are appropriate.   
 
Here, the Court finds that the hours were
reasonable. A verified fee bill is “prima facie evidence the costs, expenses
and services listed were necessarily incurred, and when they are properly
challenged the burden of proof shifts to the party claiming them as costs.” (Hadley
v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) Plaintiffs have provided a fee
bill. Significantly, Defendant failed to provide any specific billing tasks
which it contends are unneeded, unnecessary, or represent excessive hours or
billing. Instead, Defendant provided generalized comments that there was too
much communication with Plaintiffs.  After reviewing the bill, the Court finds that
these fees were reasonable, as Plaintiffs accepted the 998 offer after
retaining counsel. Thus, the hours billed are reasonable.  
 
In sum, the Court awards $32,442.33  in attorneys’ fees.  The Motion is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiffs
are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
