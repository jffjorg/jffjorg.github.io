And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a discovery motion hearing. The case involves a contract for the sale of real property and four types of discovery motions (requests for production of documents, form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for admissions) filed by the defendants against the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the defendants have moved to compel responses. The court grants the motions and orders the plaintiffs to provide complete, code-compliant, and verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days. The court also deems the requests for admissions admitted and awards the defendants reduced monetary sanctions of $1,680.00.
