RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.

 
BACKGROUND
            On January 10, 2022, Plaintiff Berj
Parseghian (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint for injunctive relief and civil penalties
against Defendant Whole Foods Market (“Defendant”) for violation of Proposition
65, Health & Safety Code section 25249.6. [1]  On January 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion for entry of stipulated consent judgment.
 
DISCUSSION
            Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking
Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, prohibits businesses from knowingly
exposing individuals to any chemical known to cause cancer or reproductive
toxicity without first providing a clear and reasonable warning.  (Health and Safety Code § 25249.6.)  Chemicals requiring such warning, i.e.,
“listed chemicals,” are listed at 27 CCR section 27001 (b).
 
In
addition to government prosecutors, the Act can be enforced by any person in
the public interest.  (§ 25249.7(d).)  To bring such a suit, a person must first give
60-days notice of the alleged violation to the violator, the California
Attorney General, and the district attorney and city attorney in whose
jurisdiction the alleged violation occurred.  (§ 25249.7(d)(1).)  For violations of section 25249.6, the notice
must include a certificate of merit that states that the person executing the
certificate has consulted with an expert regarding the facts concerning the
exposure and that there is a reasonable and meritorious case for the private
action.  (Id.)  If the government prosecutors decline to
commence a suit, the private party may do so.  (§ 25249.7(d)(2).)
 
In
reviewing and approving a settlement of a Proposition 65 action, a court must
ensure that its judgment serves the public interest.  (Consumer
Advocacy Grp., Inc. v. Kintetsu Enters. Of Am. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 46,
62.)  It is required to make findings
that (a) the warning required by the settlement complies with law, (b) the
award of attorney’s fees is reasonable, and (c) the penalty is reasonable.  (§ 25249.7(f)(4).)  The plaintiff carries the burden of producing
evidence to sustain each required finding.  (§ 25249.7(f)(5).) 
 
In
addition to the statutory criteria, the court must also review justiciability
and the adequacy of notice to the Attorney General.  (Consumer
Advocacy Grp., supra, 141
Cal.App.4th at 65.)
 
The
plaintiff must serve the moving papers on the Attorney General at least 4 days
before the motion hearing on settlement approval.  (§ 25249.7(f)95); 11 CCR § 3003.)  The Attorney General may appear and
participate in the settlement-approval proceeding without intervening in the
suit.  (§ 25249.7(f)(5).)  The Attorney General has standing to appeal an
approved Proposition 65 settlement.  (Consumer Def. Grp. V. Rental Hous. Indus.
Members (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1185, 1205.)
 
Notice
Requirements
Here,
Plaintiff’s moving papers were timely filed on January 19, 2024, with a hearing
date set for March 27, 2024.  (POS
attached to Krikorian Decl.)  However,
the proof of service indicates that the papers were only served on Plaintiff’s
counsel, and not on the Office of the Attorney General.  Thus, Plaintiff has not satisfied the notice
requirements. 
 
Compliance of
Warning 
Plaintiff
has submitted a copy of the proposed consent judgment.  Pursuant to the Consent Judgment, after the
Effective Date, which is the date the Consent Judgment is approved and entered
by the Court and written notice of entry of the Consent Judgment is provided, Defendant
shall be permanently enjoined from manufacturing for sale in the State of
California, “Distributing into the State of California,” or directly selling in
the State of California, any Covered Product that exposes a person to a daily
lead exposure level of more than 0.5 micrograms of lead per day, or a level
permissible by Preposition 65 regulation in effect on or after the Effective
Date, unless it meets the warning requirements under Section 3.2.  As used in this Consent Judgment, the term “Distributing
into the State of California” shall mean to directly ship a Covered Product
into California for sale in California or to sell a Covered Product to a
distributor that Defendant knows or has reason to know will sell the Covered
Product in California.  The injunctive
relief in Section 3 does not apply to any Covered Product that has left the
possession, and is no longer under the control of Defendant prior to the
Effective Date and all claims as to such Covered Products are released in thus
Consent Judgment.  (Consent Judgment, ¶
3.1.1.)  The Consent Judgment also states
that if Defendant is required to provide a warning, one of the following
warnings must be utilized: 
Option
1:
WARNING: Consuming
this product can expose you lo chemicals including lead, which is known to the
State of California to cause [cancer and], birth defects or other reproductive
harm. For more information go to www.P65Warnings.ca.gov/food.
Option 2:
WARNING: [Cancer
and] Reproductive Harm - http://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/food.
WFM shall use the
phrase “cancer and” in the Warning has reason to believe that the “Daily Lead
Exposure Leve” is greater than 15 micrograms of lead.
(Consent Judgment
¶ 3.2.) 
 
The
foregoing warning proposed by the settlement is clear and reasonable, and
satisfies the warning requirement under Health and Safety Code, section
25249.6. 
 
 
Reasonableness of
Attorney’s Fees 
The
fees setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar”
method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate, which may then be adjusted based on consideration of
factors specific to the case to fix the fee at the fair market value of the
legal services provided.  (Serrano v.
Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)  After
the court has performed the lodestar calculations, it shall consider whether
the total award so calculated under all of the circumstances of the case is
more than a reasonable amount and, if so, shall reduce the award so that it is
a reasonable figure.  (PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096.) 
 
Plaintiff
seeks to recover $75,000.00 in attorney’s fees and costs; and Defendant has
consented to the amount.  (Consent
Judgment ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff has brought
evidence in support that Plaintiff has actually incurred a lodestar of $75,000.00
in fees and costs. (Krikorian Decl. (Attorney and Staff Billing Rates) ¶ 6,
Exh. D.)  The amount represents 87 hours
($400 hourly rate) by Tro Krikorian, 53 hours ($550 hourly rate) by Vache
Thomassian, and 17 hours ($550 hourly rate) by Caspar Jivalagian.  (Id. ¶¶ 6.)  The hours expended were on the following: (1) Pre-Litigation Research & Development; (2) Background research on the Covered Product; (3) Exchange and Review of
Information; (4) Preparation, Review, and Filing of Complaint; (5) Written Discovery; (6) Depositions and
Motion to Compel; (7) Litigation Strategy, Research of Defenses and internal
review of file; (8) Consent Judgment Terms & Modifications; (9)
Preparation, Review, and Filing of Motion Packet; (9) Communications with Opposing Counsel Throughout; (10) Communications with
Client Throughout; and (11) Communications witl1 Experts Throughout.  (Id.) 
 The Court finds that the amount
of $75,000.00
represents reasonable attorney’s fees
and costs for the work performed.  Accordingly, the
attorney’s fees and costs are approved. 
 
Reasonableness of
Penalty Amount 
Civil
penalties are not to exceed $2,500 per day for each violation.  (Health & Saf. Code § 25249.7(b)(1).)  In assessing the amount of a civil penalty,
the court must consider:  
(A)
The nature and extent of the violation. 
(B)
The number of, and severity of, the violations. 
(C)
The economic effect of the penalty on the violator. 
(D)
Whether the violator took good faith measures to comply with this chapter and
the time these measures were taken. 
(E)
The willfulness of the violator’s misconduct. 
(F)
The deterrent effect that the imposition of the penalty would have on both the
violator and the regulated community as a whole. 
(G)
Any other factor that justice may require. 
(Health & Saf.
Code, § 25249.7(b)(2).) 
 
Under
the Consent Judgment, Defendant has agreed to pay civil penalties of $10,000.00.
(Consent Judgment, ¶ 4.) The amount is to be apportioned: 75% remitted to State
of California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (“OEHHA”) and
the remaining 25% remitted to Plaintiff.  (Id.; Health & Saf. Code
§¿25249.12(c),(d).)  Plaintiff has
offered evidence in support that the amount of civil penalties is reasonable,
based on each of the factors under Health & Safety Code, section
25249.7(b)(2). (Mot. at pp. 7-8; Krikorian Decl. ¶¿13.)  In consideration of that evidence, the Court
finds that the civil penalties of $10,000.00 are reasonable and thus
approved. 
            
            As the warning required by the
settlement complies with the law, the award of attorney’s fees is reasonable,
and the penalty is reasonable, the motion to approve the stipulated judgment is
GRANTED provided Plaintiff submits evidence to the Court prior to or at the
hearing that the moving papers were served on the Office of the Attorney
General on the same date indicated on the original Proof of Service.  If service was not in fact effected on that
date, then the hearing will be continued by two weeks to April 9, 2024 at 8:30
to allow proper service to be effected.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
