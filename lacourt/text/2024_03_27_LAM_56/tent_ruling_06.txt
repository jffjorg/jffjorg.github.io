 Case Number:  22STCV33012    Hearing Date:   March 27, 2024    Dept:  56     SUPERIOR  COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR  THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT                 BO ZHANG,                          Plaintiff,             vs.   DVIR COHEN, et al.,                                                                                                           Defendants.                                               CASE NO.: 22STCV33012   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTIONS TO BE    RELIEVED AS COUNSEL   8:30 a.m. March 27, 2024 Dept. 56                  Susan M. Murphy, Esq., moves to be  relieved as counsel for Cross-Defendants Bo Zhang, Eva Neumann, United Premier  Development LLC (“United”), Yukee Architectural Design Corp (“Yukee”), and  Jianying Wu on the grounds that there has been an irreparable breakdown of the  attorney-client relationship that makes it impossible for counsel to continue  representing the clients. (Murphy Decl. ¶ 2.) The Motions comply with all  requirements of Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.   3There  is no showing that granting the motions to be relieved as counsel (the “Motions”)  would result in prejudice, except for the fact that the trial is currently set  for June 3, 2024 – less than nine weeks after the hearing on this motion -- and  two of the parties subject to these Motions, i.e., United  and Yukee cannot represent themselves, being  an LLC and a corporation, respectively.  The Court on its own motion therefore sets an  Order to Show Cause for April 26, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. for United and Yukee to  show that they are represented by new counsel.   The trial is continued to December 2, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.  The Final Status Conference date is also  vacated and re-set for November 18, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.   Thus,  the Motions are GRANTED.   Susan  M. Murphy is ordered to give notice of this ruling.   Parties  who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at  SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court  website at www.lacourt.org.  If the  department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the  hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.               Dated this 27th day of March 2024                     Hon. Holly J.    Fujie Judge of the    Superior Court
