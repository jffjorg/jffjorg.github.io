Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for entry of stipulated consent judgment in this case. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Berj Parseghian, and seeks to approve a settlement agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, Whole Foods Market California, Inc. et al.

The settlement agreement requires the defendant to provide a clear and reasonable warning to consumers regarding the presence of lead in certain products. The warning must be provided in accordance with Proposition 65, which prohibits businesses from knowingly exposing individuals to chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without providing a clear and reasonable warning.

The court finds that the warning required by the settlement complies with the law. The court also finds that the award of attorney's fees and costs is reasonable, as the plaintiff has incurred actual expenses of $75,000 in fees and costs. The court also finds that the civil penalties of $10,000 are reasonable, as they are based on the nature and extent of the violation, the number and severity of the violations, and the economic effect of the penalty on the violator.

The court grants the motion to approve the stipulated consent judgment, provided that the plaintiff submits evidence to the court prior to or at the hearing that the moving papers were served on the Office of the Attorney General on the same date indicated on the original Proof of Service. If service was not in fact effected on that date, then the hearing will be continued by two weeks to April 9, 2024, to allow proper service to be effected.
