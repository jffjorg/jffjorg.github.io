And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of the defendant, Jamshid Barmaan, on his motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Jalil Rostamzad Mansour, alleged that the defendant wrongfully removed his personal property, including cash and coins, from his apartment. The defendant argued that there were no triable issues of fact and that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims.

The judge found that the defendant had satisfied his prima facie burden and that the plaintiff failed to rebut the showing by failing to provide any admissible evidence to support his claims. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claims were speculative and unsupported by evidence.

The judge granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, ruling that there were no triable issues of fact and that the defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The judge also ordered the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
