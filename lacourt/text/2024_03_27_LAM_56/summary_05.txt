And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

In this ruling, the court addresses the plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees in the amount of $32,442.33. The plaintiffs accepted a settlement offer from the defendants, Nissan North America, Inc. and Nissan of Duarte, for $50,294.84. The settlement agreement also provided that the plaintiffs would surrender the subject vehicle and have the right to petition the court for an award of reasonable fees, costs, and expenses if the parties did not agree on an amount. The court finds that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover their costs and attorneys' fees as the prevailing party under the Song-Beverly Act. The court also finds that the hourly rates requested by the plaintiffs' counsel are reasonable, citing the Laffey Matrix and the experience and skill of the attorneys. The court awards the requested amount of $32,442.33 in attorneys' fees and grants the motion.
