BACKGROUND
This action arises
out of a contract for sale of real property.  The currently operative first amended
complaint (the “FAC”) was filed on July 13, 2022 and alleges specific
performance for the sale of real property. 
On October 10,
2023, Defendants filed a motion to compel (1) the production of documents as to
Plaintiff Joseph Ferencz and Robert Ferencz (the “RFP Motion”); (2) form
interrogatories as to Plaintiff Joseph Ferencz and Robert Ferencz (the “FROG
Motion”); (3) special interrogatories as to Plaintiff Joseph Ferencz and Robert
Ferencz (the “SPROG Motion”); and (4) motion for order deeming matters to be
admitted against Plaintiff Robert Ferencz (the “RFA Motion”).  On October 11, 2023, Defendants filed a motion
for order deeming matters to be admitted against Plaintiff Joseph Ferencz (the “RFA
Motion”).  To date, no oppositions have
been filed.  There are a total of 8
discovery motions set for hearing on March 27, 2024, 4 types of motions for
each of the Plaintiffs (collectively the “Motions”).
 
DISCUSSION
Request for Production of Documents
            Where there has been no timely response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing or sampling, the demanding party may seek an order
compelling a response.  (CCP § 2031.300,
subd. (b).)  Failure to timely respond
waives all objections, including privilege and work product.  (CCP § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
 
Interrogatories
            Under CCP section 2030.290, subdivision (b), when a party
directs interrogatories towards a party and that party fails to serve a timely
response, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories.  (CCP § 2030.290, subd. (b).)  The moving party need only show that the
interrogatories were served on the opposing party, the time has expired to
respond to the interrogatories and no responses have been served in order for
the court to compel the opposing party to respond.  (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 902, 906.) 
            
Requests for Admissions 
Under CCP section 2033.280,
subdivision (a), where requests for admission are propounded on a party and
that party fails to serve a timely response, that party waives any objection to
the requests.  (CCP § 2033.280, subd.
(a).)  The requesting party may move for
an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction.  (CCP § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The court must grant a motion to have
admission requests deemed admitted where responses have not been served prior
to the hearing, or, if such responses were served, they were not in substantial
compliance with CCP section 2033.220.  (CCP § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated the motion.  (Id.)
 
Analysis
Plaintiff
served the discovery requests at issue in the Motions on April 21, 2023.  (See Declaration of Jason J. Sancen (“Sancen
Decl.”) ¶ 2.)  The Court notes that the
Motions contain the same underlying facts. 
As of the filing of the Motions, Plaintiffs have not provided responses.
 (Sancen Decl. ¶ 9.) 
 
As they are
unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motions.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  Plaintiffs are
ordered to submit complete, Code-compliant and verified responses to the
discovery requests discussed in the Motions within 20 days of this order.  The RFAs at issue in the RFA Motion are deemed admitted.  
 
Monetary Sanctions 
CCP § 2023.030(a) says that “[t]he
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.”  A misuse of the
discovery process is failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.  (CCP § 2023.010(d).) 
 
Defendants’ counsel, Jason J. Sancen,
declares that: (1) his regular billing rate is $300.00 per hour; (2) he spent
over 1.5 hours preparing each motion and anticipates spending another 1.5 hours
in reviewing Plaintiffs’ oppositions and preparing a reply; and (3) 1.5 hours
attending the hearing for each motion if each motion is heard on different
dates.  (Sancen Decl. at ¶ 12.)  Thus, counsel requests a total of $5,640.00,
which consists of 4.5 hours by counsel’s hourly rate of $300.00 for each motion
(4) plus the $60.00 filing fee for each motion.  (Id.)  Although counsel claims that there are four
motions in total, the Court notes that there are eight, and Defendants have
paid a total of $480.00 in filing fees. 
 
The Court exercises its discretion and
awards Defendants reduced monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,680.00 which
represents four hours of work on drafting the Motions collectively at an hourly
rate of $300.00 per hour and $480.00 in filing fees, payable to Defendants and
their counsel by Plaintiffs and their counsel within 20 days of the date of the
entry of this order.  (Van Sickle v.
Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) 
 
DEFENDANTS are ordered to give notice
of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
