And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge denies the Plaintiff's (East West Bank) motion for appointment of a receiver and preliminary injunction. The Plaintiff sought to appoint a receiver to operate and collect rents on 17 real properties serving as collateral under deeds of trust. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff is not entitled to appoint a receiver because the properties are located outside of California and the Court does not have jurisdiction over them. Additionally, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not shown that the properties are in danger of being lost or that the appointment of a receiver is necessary.

The Judge also denies the Plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction, finding that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated that it is likely to prevail on the merits and that the balance of harms favors the Defendants. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's interest is already protected by the recording of deeds of trust against the real properties, and that a preliminary injunction would be unduly restrictive of the Defendants' rights to alienation of their land.
