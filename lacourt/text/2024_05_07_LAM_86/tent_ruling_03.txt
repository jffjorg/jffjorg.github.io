Cross-petitioners
American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, District Council
36, et al. (“Coalition”) move for an award of attorney fees and costs in
the amount of $385,235.38, comprised of $378,397.50 for fees and $6,837.88 in costs.  The Motion is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
I.       Background
 
On August 17, 2022, the City of Los Angeles
(“City”) filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate against the Los Angeles City
Employee Relations Board (“ERB”), with the Coalition as real parties in
interest. 
 
On September 22, 2022, the Coalition filed a
Cross-Petition for Writ of Mandate against the City, with International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 18 as the real party in interest. 
 
On
November 27, 2023, the Court denied the City’s petition and granted the
Coalition’s cross-petition. On January 24, 2024, the Court entered judgment in
favor of the Coalition. 
 
II.      Analysis
 
A.          
Entitlement
to Fees under Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5
 
The Coalition seeks an award of attorney fees
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5. “Upon motion, a court may award
attorneys’ fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in
any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right
affecting the public interest….” (CCP § 1021.5.) “[E]ligibility for section
1021.5 attorney fees is established when ‘(1) plaintiffs’ action “has resulted
in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,” (2) “a
significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary has been conferred on
the general public or a large class of persons” and (3) “the necessity and
financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award
appropriate.”’” (Conservatorship of Whitley (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1206,
1214.)
 
1.           
Successful Party
 
A party “may be
considered successful if they succeed on any significant issue in the
litigation that achieves some of the benefit they sought in bringing suit.” (Ebbetts
Pass Forest Watch v. Department of Forestry & Fire Protection (2010)
187 Cal.App.4th 376, 382.) In determining whether the issue upon which a party
prevailed is significant, “the court must critically analyze the surrounding
circumstances of the litigation and pragmatically assess the gains achieved by
the action.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, the Coalition
succeeded in obtaining a writ directing the City to comply with ERB Decision No.
U-228 and the June 27, 2022 order issued in that matter. (1/24/24 Judgment ¶¶
2, 3.) The ERB ordered the City to bargain over the effects of Water and Power
Employees’ Retirement Plan’s (“WPERP”) decision to suspend reciprocity. (AR 4212-13.) The ERB also
ordered the City to “make whole Coalition-represented employees who have
sustained any losses (including a reduced pension or other benefits) due to
unilateral changes implemented on or after January 1, 2014 to the manner in
which WPERP years of service are treated or who sustain any such losses in the
future, with any compensation awarded to be augmented by interest at a rate of
7 percent per year, from the date any impacted employee began to experience
harm ….” (AR 4213.)
 
Although
the Coalition had prevailed on certain issues, the ERB also found that the City
did not violate the City’s Employee Relations Ordinance (“ERO”) by failing to provide
the Coalition with notice and an opportunity to bargain over WPERP’s decision
to suspend reciprocity. (AR 4212.) The ERB also found that the City did not
violate the ERO by failing to provide the Coalition with notice and an
opportunity to bargain over the City’s decision to withdraw its opposition to
WPERP’s suspension of reciprocity. (AR 4212.) 
 
Thus, while the Coalition
did not prevail on all issues, the Coalition did prevail with respect to the
requirement to bargain over the effects of the suspension of reciprocity and
the make-whole remedy starting from January 1, 2014. The crux of the
Coalition’s Unfair Employee Relations Practice (“UERP”) charges against the
City was that the City had unilaterally changed the reciprocity agreement
between Los Angeles City Employees’ Retirement System (“LACERS”) and WPERP without
meeting and conferring beforehand to mitigate the impact of the suspension of
reciprocity, in violation of Employee
Relations Ordinance §§ 4.830(a), 4.857, 4.860(a)(1), and 4.860(a)(3). (AR
1859.) By having its cross-petition for writ of mandate granted, the Coalition
vindicated its right to bargain over changes to terms of employment and
potentially diminish any negative impacts. 
This was a significant issue in the dispute between the Coalition and
the City. 
 
Because the Coalition prevailed on a significant
issue in the litigation, the Court finds that the Coalition qualifies as a
successful party under section 1021.5. 
 
2.           
Enforcement of Important
Right Affecting the Public Interest
 
“In assessing whether an
action has enforced an important right, courts should generally realistically
assess the significance of that right in terms of its relationship to the
achievement of fundamental legislative goals. As to the benefit, it may be
conceptual or doctrinal and need not be actual and concrete; further, the
effectuation of a statutory or constitutional purpose may be sufficient ...
[However,] [t]he benefit must inure primarily to the public. Thus, the statute
directs the judiciary to exercise judgment in attempting to ascertain the
‘strength’ or ‘societal importance’ of the right involved.” (Sandlin v.
McLaughlin (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 805, 829, quoting Choi v. Orange County
Great Park Corp. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 524, 531, internal quotations and
citations omitted.) 
 
The meet and confer obligations under the Meyers-Milias-Brown
Act (“MMBA”), which governs employment relations between the City and its
recognized bargaining units for its employees, are important rights affecting
the public interest. (See Indio Police Command Unit Assn. v. City of Indio
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 521, 542, citing People Ex Rel. Seal Beach Police
Officers Assn. v. City of Seal Beach (1984) 36 Cal.3d 591, 594 and Los
Angeles Police Protective League v. City of Los Angeles (1986) 188
Cal.App.3d 1, 12–13 [finding that trial court did not abuse its discretion in
finding that important right affecting public interest concerning meet and
confer obligations under the MMBA was enforced].) “Attorney fees have
consistently been awarded for the enforcement of well-defined, existing
obligations.” (Riverside Sheriff's Assn. v. County of Riverside (2007)
152 Cal.App.4th 414, 422, internal citations and quotations omitted.) By
obtaining a writ of mandate, the Coalition enforced an important right
affecting the public interest by ensuring that public employees have the
opportunity to bargain over the effects of changes to their terms of
employment. (See Indio Police, 230 Cal.App.4th at 536.) 
 
3.           
Significant Benefit
Conferred on General Public or Large Class of Persons
 
“Whether a successful
party’s lawsuit confers a ‘significant benefit’ on the general public or a
large class of persons is a function of (1) ‘the significance of the benefit,’
and (2) ‘the size of the class receiving [the] benefit.’ [Citation.] In
evaluating these factors, courts are to ‘realistic[ally] assess[ ]’ the
lawsuit’s ‘gains’ ‘in light of all the pertinent circumstances.’ [Citation.]” (La
Mirada Avenue Neighborhood Assn. of Hollywood v. City of Los Angeles (2018)
22 Cal.App.5th 1149, 1158.) “A benefit need not be monetary to be significant.
(§ 1021.5 [defining “a significant benefit” as either “pecuniary or
nonpecuinary”].) Where, as here, the nonpecuniary benefit to the public is the
proper enforcement of the law, the successful party must show that the law
being enforced furthers a significant policy. [Citation.]” (Id. at
1158.) 
 
“[T]he significant
benefit requirement of section 1021.5 requires more than a mere statutory
violation.” (Burgess v. Coronado Unified School District (2020) 59
Cal.App.5th 1, 9.) However, a significant benefit can be found “simply from the
effectuation of a fundamental constitutional or statutory policy” “from a
realistic assessment, in light of all the pertinent circumstances, of the gains
which have resulted in a particular case.” (Woodland Hills Residents Assn.,
Inc. v. City Council (1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 939-40.)
 
For the reasons stated
above with respect to enforcement of an important right, the Coalition demonstrates
that a significant benefit was conferred on the general public. (La Mirada,
22 Cal.App.5th at 1158 [finding when proper enforcement of law is the public
benefit, “the significant benefit and important right requirements of section
1021.5 to some extent dovetail”].) The City contends that the ERB’s decision
only affects the employees who have transferred from WPERP to LACERS. However, “courts
are not required to narrowly construe the significant benefit factor.” (See
Indio Police, 230 Cal.App.4th at 543.) A fee award does not require a great
public benefit. (Ibid., citing Center for Biological Diversity v.
County of San Bernardino (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 866, 894.) By obtaining a
writ of mandate, the Coalition vindicated its right to “full communication
between public employers and their employees” concerning the terms of
employment under the MMBA. (See Gov. Code § 3500(a).) 


 
4.           
Necessity and Financial
Burden of Private Enforcement
 
“[T]he necessity and
financial burden requirement really examines two issues: whether private
enforcement was necessary and whether the financial burden of private
enforcement warrants subsidizing the successful party’s attorneys.” (Whitley,
50 Cal.4th at 1214.) The Court notes the City does not contend in its briefing
that the necessity and financial burden elements of a CCP § 1021.5 award sre
not satisfied.
 
Private enforcement was
necessary in this case because the petitioner brought the action against a
government entity that refused to comply with the ERB’s make-whole remedy. (See
Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc., 23 Cal.3d 917, 941 [“Inasmuch as the
present action proceeded against the only governmental agencies that bear
responsibility for the subdivision approval process, the necessity of private,
as compared to public, enforcement becomes clear”].) 
 
With respect to whether
petitioner’s financial burden in pursuing writ relief warrants a fee award, “[T]he
purpose of section 1021.5 is not to compensate with attorney fees only those
litigants who have altruistic or lofty motives, but rather all litigants and
attorneys who step forward to engage in public interest litigation when there
are insufficient financial incentives to justify the litigation in economic
terms.” (Whitley, 50 Cal.4th at 1211.)
 
Here, the Coalition did
not obtain any financial relief from the judgment, such as increased union dues
or membership. (See id. at 1217 [“As a logical matter, a strong
nonfinancial motivation does not change or alleviate the ‘financial burden’
that a litigant bears”].) The Coalition only obtained a writ directing the City
to comply with the ERB’s decision. Moreover, the writ of mandate affects not
just employees who transferred from WPERP to LACERS, but also all City
employees represented by City unions who now have clarity regarding the City’s
obligations to bargain over effects to changes in terms of employment and the
right to a make-whole remedy for violation of effects bargaining obligations. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the
Court finds that the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement by the
Coalition warrants a fee award under CCP § 1021.5. 
 
B.          
Reasonableness
of Fees and Costs Requested
 
The Coalition moves for $378,397.50
for fees and $6,837.88 in costs. The amount is based on
the lodestar and does not include a multiplier. 
 
1.           
Fees
 
The Coalition seeks $378,397.50 for fees, as
detailed in the following table:
 
 
 



Attorney


Hours


Hourly Rate


Lodestar




Hannah Weinstein


559.3


$575


$321,597.50




Julia Harumi Mass


49.6


$700


34,720.00




Jonah Lalas


36.8


$600


2,080.00




TOTAL


645.7


 


$378,397.50



 
(Weinstein Reply Decl. ¶
5 & Ex. F.) The fee request includes the work from the remedy phase of the
ERB proceeding through the preparation of a reply on the instant fee motion. (Weinstein
Motion Decl. ¶ 7; Weinstein Reply Decl. ¶ 5.) 
 
The asserted hourly rates
are reasonable. The Court is not obligated to compensate the Coalition’s
counsel at the hourly rate of the City’s counsel or reduce the fees because the
City is a public entity. (Lyons v. Chinese Hospital Assn. (2006) 136
Cal.App.4th 1331, 1356 [“a distinction between private and public defendants
would be inconsistent with the purposes underlying section 1021.5”]; Goglin
v. BMW of North America, LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 462, 473-74 [trial court
not obliged to base hourly rate on opposing counsel’s lower hourly rates].) The
City cites Estate of Baum (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 744, 753 for the
proposition that “the total burden on the public entity [may] not exceed a sum
sufficient to reimburse reasonable attorney fees as judged by an objective
standard from the point of view of the public entity.” However, this holding
was based on CCP § 1036, where the Legislature intended to limit fee awards to
amounts reasonably incurred to protect the public. (Estate of Baum, 209
Cal.App.3d at 752-53.) A fee award under CCP § 1021.5 does not share similar
concerns. 
 
With respect to the work
prior to the instant fee motion, having reviewed the billing records filed by
the Coalition (Weinstein Motion Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. B), the Court finds the fee
request to be reasonable. The remedy phase of the ERB proceeding started in
2019. As explained by the Coalition’s counsel and not disputed by the City, “when
Cross-Petitioners began litigating the ERB proceeding below, the caselaw
concerning what remedy should be ordered if the ERB found only an effects
bargaining violation was imprecise, and that uncertainty was not clarified by
PERB until years into the parties litigating the remedy phase.” (Weinstein
Motion Decl. ¶ 6.) Further, the Public Employment Relations Board decision
in SEIU Local 99
v. The Accelerated Schools, PERB
Dec. No. 2855, upon which the Court relied in its ruling on the City and the
Coalition’s respective petitions, was not issued until March 17, 2023—after the
underlying ERB decision and before briefing on the writ petitions. Based on the
uncertainty and complexity concerning the issue of whether the ERB had the
authority to order a make-whole remedy, the time the Coalition’s counsel spent
researching, briefing, and preparing for oral argument in the underlying
proceeding and the instant writ proceeding was reasonable. 
 
With respect to the instant fee motion, the
Coalition seeks the following fees:
 



Attorney


Hours


Hourly Rate


Lodestar




Hannah Weinstein


44.8


$575


$25,760.00




Julia Harumi Mass


1.7


$700


1,190.00




Jonah Lalas


36.8


$600


22,080.00




TOTAL


83.3


 


$49,030.00



 
(Weinstein
Motion Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. B; Weinstein Reply Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. E.) Even if
counsel does not regularly draft CCP § 1021.5 motions (Weinstein Reply Decl. ¶
4), 83.3 hours is objectively excessive. A reduction of 60%, or $29,418,
is warranted. Accordingly, petitioner’s request for fees is GRANTED IN PART in
the amount of $348,979.50 ($378,397.50 fee request - $29,418 fee
motion).
 
2.           
Costs
 
Petitioner seeks $6,837.88 in costs. (Weinstein Motion Decl. ¶ 9
& Ex. E.) However, petitioner did not file a memorandum of costs within 15
days of January 25, 2024—when notice of entry of judgment was served—in violation
of Rule of Court 3.1700(a)(1). In fact, no memorandum of costs has been filed. Accordingly,
the request for costs is DENIED.
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The motion is GRANTED IN PART. Using the appropriate lodestar approach, and
based on the foregoing findings and in view of the totality of the
circumstances, the total and reasonable amount of attorney fees incurred is $348,979.50.
Such fees are awarded to cross-petitioners American Federation of State,
County, and Municipal Employees, District Council 36 et al. and against respondent City of Los Angeles.
