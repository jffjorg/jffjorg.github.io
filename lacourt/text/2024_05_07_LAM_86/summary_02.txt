And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a writ hearing regarding a charter petition rejection by the District. The petitioner argues that the District continues to improperly reject charter petitions despite changes to the Policy. The petitioner relies on a request for material revision submitted by Crete Academy, which the District refused to accept due to missing information. The judge notes that the operative First Amended Petition is a facial challenge to the District's Policy and Staff Guide, and that the question of whether the District properly applied the Policy as amended with respect to any one particular applicant is not at issue. The respondents contend that certain causes of action do not seek relief with respect to the DRL (Data Review Log), but the judge notes that the Staff Guide incorporates the DRL, making a challenge to the DRL included within the petitioner's writ claims concerning the Staff Guide.
