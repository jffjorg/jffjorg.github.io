the Education Code unless otherwise indicated.


[2]           The CPRA statutes were re-numbered
effective January 1, 2023.  


[3]           Petitioner argues that, despite
changes to the Policy, the District continues to improperly reject charter
petitions for reasons other than lack of a certification of completeness.
(Opening Br. at 15:7-15.) In furtherance of this claim, petitioner relies on a
request for material revision submitted by Crete Academy, which the District
refused to accept for processing due to missing information, including revised
budget and cash flow projections. (AR 964.) The operative First Amended Petition,
however, is a facial challenge to the District’s Policy and Staff Guide. (FAP
¶¶ 56, 63 [seeking writ ordering set aside of Policy and Staff Guide].) The
question of whether the District properly applied the Policy as amended with
respect to any one particular applicant is not at issue.
 


[4]           Respondents contend the first, second,
fifth, and sixth causes of action, which are at issue in this writ hearing, do
not seek relief with respect to the DRL. (Opp. at 9, fn. 1.) However, the Staff
Guide states that a charter petition and any supporting documents are expected
to be consistent with the DRL at issue. (AR 322.) Because the Staff Guide
incorporates the DRL, a challenge to the DRL is necessarily included within
petitioner’s writ claims concerning the Staff Guide.
