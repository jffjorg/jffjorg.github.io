And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the petitioners' motion for an order nunc pro tunc, which seeks to have the petition filed on March 15, 2024, is continued to June 6, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. in Department 86 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The motion will be heard at the same date and time as the respondent's motion to quash service of petition, which argues that the petition was never served on the respondent and was therefore not filed timely.
