And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet discloses that approximately 24 years ago, she and her husband purchased a pickup truck that developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer agreed to take the pickup back and refund the purchase price without litigation. Judge Beaudet does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased for or against either party, but if the parties believe otherwise, they may file and serve a verified statement of disqualification by May 15, 2024. The Case Management Conference will be continued to July 8, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement.
