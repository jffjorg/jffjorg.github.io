Code § 2033.280(b) a  party propounding the request for admission may move for an order that the  truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted.  “The court shall make this order [deem  admitted], unless it finds that the party to whom the request for admissions  have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed  response to the request for admission that is in substantial compliance with  section 2033.220.” (Civ. Proc. Code, § 2033.280(c).)     As of the date this motion was  filed, Defendant David had not served timely responses to requests for  admission. (Declaration of Dustin Z. Moaven, ¶¶ 6, 7.) As such, the motion to  deem admitted requests for admission is GRANTED.    Plaintiff’s request for sanctions against  Defendant David is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $850[1].  (Declaration of Dustin Z. Moaven, ¶ 8.) Sanctions are to be paid to Plaintiff’s  counsel within 20 days.
