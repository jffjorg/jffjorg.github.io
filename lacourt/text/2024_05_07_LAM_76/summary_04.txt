And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs' motion for a trial preference pursuant to CCP § 36(b). The motion was filed by Catherine W. Kiguru and others on behalf of minor plaintiffs who are under the age of 14. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the minor plaintiffs suffered any physical injuries that require an earlier trial. The court also noted that the supporting declarations focused on psychological injuries rather than physical injuries. As a result, the court denied the motion for trial preference.
