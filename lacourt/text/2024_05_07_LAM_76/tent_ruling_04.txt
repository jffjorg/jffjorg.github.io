Motion For Trial
Preference
Discussion
            Plaintiffs
move for a trial preference pursuant to Civ. Proc. Code, § 36(b)(minor
plaintiffs).
            Civ. Proc. Code § 36(b) provides:
A civil action
to recover damages for wrongful death or personal injury shall be entitled to
preference upon the motion of any party to the action who is under 14
years of age unless the court finds that the party does not have a substantial
interest in the case as a whole. A civil action subject to subdivision (a)
shall be given preference over a case subject to this subdivision.


(Cal. Civ. Proc., § 36(b)[bold emphasis added].)
 
            When applicable, Civ. Proc. Code §
36(b) is mandatory. (Peters v. Superior Court (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 218, 224.)
            Here, four named Plaintiffs are
minors under the age of 14. (Declaration of Victoria L. Ersoff, ¶ 2.) They
allege in vague, conclusory terms in the Complaint that they have suffered
physical injuries. (Complaint, ¶¶ 21(b), 40, 49, 53.) However, the supporting
declarations do not set forth actual physical injuries to the minors, but
rather psychological injuries (primarily of the adult plaintiffs)—which are
understandable but insufficient to justify a trial preference. (See
Declarations of Alex Omodni Oloo, Maria Navia Quiles.)
Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the minor plaintiffs suffered any
physical injuries which require that trial be held 9 months earlier.           
            The motion for a trial preference is
DENIED.
