And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the defendants' demurrer to the complaint and has overruled it. The defendants, Rochelle Sterling, Donald T. Sterling, and Beverly Hills Properties, LLC, had argued that the complaint was insufficient and that the defendants were mis-joined. The judge disagreed, finding that the complaint was sufficient and that the defendants were properly joined.

The judge also found that the eighth cause of action, alleging financial elder abuse, was sufficient. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants wrongfully withheld wages from her and that she was unable to obtain a remedy because of the defendants' undue influence and fraud. The judge found that the plaintiff had pleaded sufficient elements of fraud and undue influence and that the defendants had wrongfully withheld wages, which qualified as real or personal property.

The judge's ruling is based on the legal principles that a demurrer lies only for defects appearing on the face of the complaint, and that a complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts pleaded. The judge also cited relevant statutes, including Code Civ. Proc., section 379, and Welf. & Inst. Code, section 15610.30.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is that the complaint is sufficient and that the defendants must answer the complaint within 10 days.
