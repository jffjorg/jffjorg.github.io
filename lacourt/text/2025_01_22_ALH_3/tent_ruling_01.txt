I.           
INTRODUCTION
On August 12, 2022, plaintiff Trinidad
Franco Lopez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendant P.R. Pernecky
Management Corp. (“Defendant”) for penalties under the Private Attorney General
Act (“PAGA”). The parties have agreed on the terms of a settlement and now seek
court approval of those terms. Under the proposed settlement, Defendant will
pay a Gross Settlement Amount of $1.15 million. Of that amount, $460,000 will
be paid as attorney fees (40%), $23,786.77 will be paid as costs, up to $13,000
will be paid to a settlement administrator, ILYM Group, Inc. (“ILYM”), and up
to $15,000 will be paid to Plaintiff as a service award. Of the remaining $638,213.23,
$159,553.31 will be paid to the aggrieved employees and $478,659.92 (75%) will
be paid to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”)
pursuant to Labor Code section 2699(i). 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
PAGA is “a procedural statute allowing
an aggrieved employee to recover civil penalties for Labor Code violations that
otherwise would be sought by state labor law enforcement agencies.” (Amalgamated
Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 993,
1003.) The court “shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action
filed pursuant to [PAGA].” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).) However, because PAGA
does not provide the standard or criteria for the review and approval of settlements,
the trial court “should evaluate a PAGA settlement to determine whether it is
fair, reasonable, and adequate in view of PAGA’s purposes to remediate present
labor law violations, deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state
labor laws.” (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 77.)
To determine if a PAGA settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, courts
consider factors “including the strength of the plaintiff’s case, the risk, the
stage of the proceeding, the complexity and likely duration of further litigation,
and the settlement amount. (Id. at p. 75.) 
III.       
DISCUSSION
A.  
Notice
to the LWDA
A proposed PAGA settlement must be
submitted to LWDA at the same time that it is submitted to the court for review
and approval. (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (l)(2).) Plaintiff’s counsel attaches
proof that the settlement was submitted to the LWDA at the same time the motion
was filed. (Adams Decl., Ex. F.) Accordingly, the Court finds that this
requirement is satisfied.
B.  
Aggrieved
Employees
The “Aggrieved Employees” are defined
as “all current and former hourly-paid, non-exempt employees who were employed
by [Defendant] in the State of California at any time during the PAGA Period.”
(Adams Decl., Ex. A, Section I, ¶ 2.) Each Aggrieved Employee’s portion of the
settlement will be calculated by “(a) dividing the amount of the Aggrieved
Employees’ 25% share of PAGA penalties ($159,553.31) by the total number of
PAGA Period Pay Periods worked by all Aggrieved Employees during the PAGA
Period and (b) multiplying the result by each Aggrieved Employee’s PAGA Period
Pay Periods.” (Id., p. 5, Section III, ¶ 3(d)(i).) 
C.  
Fair,
Reasonable, and Adequate
Under Dunk v. Ford Motor Co.
(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794, a presumption of fairness exists where “(1) the
settlement is reached through arm's-length bargaining; (2) investigation and
discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently;
(3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation; and (4) the percentage of
objectors is small.” (Id. at 1802.) 
Here, the settlement agreement seems to
have been reached through arm’s-length bargaining. The parties participated in
a full-day mediation before neutral Chris Barnes on August 8, 2024. (Adams
Decl., ¶ 20.) There also seems to have been sufficient investigation and
discovery. Prior to litigation, the parties exchanged written policies and
practices related to meal periods, rest periods, overtime, wage statements,
payment of final wages, and any other wage-and-hour issues, sample time records
and wage statements, and data demonstrating the total number of aggrieved
employees and total number of pay periods. (Adams Decl., ¶ 18.) Lastly, Plaintiff’s
counsel has extensive experience litigating wage-and-hour class and
representative actions. (Adams Decl., ¶¶ 5-9.) Accordingly, the settlement
agreement is presumptively fair. (Dunk, supra, 48 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1802.) 
D.  Civil Penalties
Plaintiff’s counsel declares that based
on Defendant’s payroll time records and wage statements, there is a PAGA
violation approximately 25% of the pay periods within the PAGA Period (56,416
total) due to the failure to provide meal breaks, resulting in approximately
14,104 pay periods with a PAGA violation. (Adams Decl., ¶¶ 37-41.) Based on a
penalty of $100, Defendant’s exposure was $1,410,400 and the penalties paid
pursuant to the proposed settlement agreement are $638,213.23, resulting in $45.25
per violation. Plaintiff argues the proposed civil penalties are fair and reasonable
given the risks of continued litigation, including a lower potential recovery
at trial and the Court’s discretionary power to reduce any penalties awarded. The
Court agrees with Plaintiff’s characterization, as other courts have imposed
even smaller penalties. (See, e.g., Carrington v. Starbucks
Corp. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 504, 517 [where violations were minimal and
compliance was attempted, court imposed a penalty of $5 per violation].) The
amount allocated to civil penalties is approved. 
E.  
Settlement
Administration and Costs
The parties have agreed to engage ILYM
as the third-party administrator for the settlement funds. ILYM has agreed to
administer the settlement for a capped fee of $13,000. Plaintiff’s counsel
declares that in his experience, $13,000 is a reasonable amount in light of the
number of Aggrieved Employees and pay periods. (Adams Decl., ¶¶ 28-29.)
Accordingly, the administrator costs of $13,000 is approved. 
F.  
Service
Award 
The proposed settlement distributes
$15,000 to Plaintiff as a service award. This is amounts to 0.01% of the gross
settlement amount, compared with 13.9% of the gross settlement amount allocated
to the Aggrieved Employees. Plaintiff declares that they were deposed and
prepared for the deposition for several days. (Lopez Decl., ¶ 9.) Plaintiff
also declares that they prepared for the mediation by reviewing case documents
and made themselves available for further questioning. (Ibid.) 
Plaintiff does not identify the approximate
number of hours spent on preparing for deposition or the mediation. However,
given the age of the case and the overall percentage of the gross settlement
amount, the request for a $15,000 service award is approved. 
G.  Attorneys’ Fees and Costs 
Plaintiff’s counsel requests $460,000
for fees and $23,786.77 in costs to be paid out of the proposed settlement
funds. Awarding a percentage of the total settlement value is a common method
in determining a fee award. Here, Plaintiff’s counsel’s request for 40% of the
recovery amount is reasonable and Plaintiff’s counsel attaches a copy of a
document identifying all the expenses incurred. Accordingly, the request for
fees and costs is approved.  
H.  Released Claims
The term “PAGA Released Claims” means
“any and all claims, rights, demands, liabilities and causes of action for
civil penalties under the PAGA asserted, or that could have been asserted in
the Complaint, including, but not limited to, those under California Labor Code
§§ 1197, 1197.1, 1198, 510, 511, 526(a), 558, 1194, 512(a), 201, 202, 203, 226,
226.7, 2802, 2698, the applicable IWC Wage Order and California Civil Code §
1542 release as to those sections, that arose during the PAGA Period.” (Adams
Decl., Ex. F, Section 1, ¶ 21.) 
The definition of “PAGA Released
Claims” is too broad because it goes beyond PAGA claims to include “any and all
claims . . . under the PAGA asserted, or that could have been asserted in the
Complaint” while identifying statutory provisions not mentioned in the
Complaint. The Complaint’s prayer for release only mentions California Labor
Code §§ 201-203, 226, 226.7, 510, 511, 526(a), 1194, 1198, and 2802, as well as
IWC Wage Order No. 4-2001. (Compl., Prayer for Relief, ¶¶ 2-3.) Therefore, any
other statutory provision appears to exceed the scope of the action. Further,
the term “applicable IWC Wage Order” is not limited to the particular wage
order alleged in the Complaint. The Court additionally notes that a copy of the
letter to the LWDA was not attached to this motion, therefore the Court is
unable to assess whether the many statutory provisions listed in the definition
of “Released Claims” exceed the scope of those that were included in the LWDA
letter. Accordingly, the Court is reluctant to approve the proposed settlement
at this time. 
IV.       
CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, the Court
continues the hearing on this motion to _______ at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of
the Alhambra Courthouse so that the parties may submit to the Court a copy of
the predicate letter to the LWDA, revise the language defining the claims
covered by the proposed settlement agreement, and provide proof that the
revised language was served on the LWDA. A copy of the letter, revised
agreement, and proof of service must be filed no later than 5 court days before
the date of the hearing. 
Moving party to give notice.

this 22nd
day of January 2025
