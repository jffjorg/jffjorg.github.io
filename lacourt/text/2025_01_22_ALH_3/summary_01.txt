And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for approval of a PAGA settlement. The settlement was reached through arm's-length bargaining and provides for a gross settlement amount of $1.15 million. The settlement allocates $460,000 for attorney fees, $23,786.77 for costs, and $13,000 for settlement administration costs. The remaining $638,213.23 will be distributed among the aggrieved employees and the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency.

The judge finds that the settlement agreement is presumptively fair and that the proposed civil penalties are fair and reasonable. However, the judge is reluctant to approve the proposed settlement at this time due to the broad definition of "PAGA Released Claims", which exceeds the scope of the action.

The judge has continued the hearing to January 22, 2025, and has ordered the parties to submit a revised definition of "PAGA Released Claims" and proof of service to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency.
