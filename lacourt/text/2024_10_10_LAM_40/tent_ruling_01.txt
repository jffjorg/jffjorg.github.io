Motion to Compel
  Further Responses to Plaintiff's Request for Production for Documents, Set
  Number One [RES ID #1214]



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff J.P. (Joseph Parker) sues
Defendants Eastern Revenue, Inc. (Eastern Revenue), Emmanuel University, Inc.
(Emmanuel University), Kyle Shanahan (Eastern Revenue’s President), Matt McRee,
Joann S. Harper, and Does 1-30 pursuant to an October 3, 2024, First Amended Complaint
alleging claims sounding in fraud, unfair business practices, breach of
contract, unlawful collection practices, and conversion. As alleged by
Plaintiff, the case arises from a collection agency (Eastern Revenue)
attempting to collect student loan debt from an active-duty soldier, in
violation of the law. 
B. Motion Before the Court
On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff propounded
Request for Production of Documents (RFPs), Set One, on Defendant Eastern
Revenue. (Parker Decl., Ex. A.) 
On July 26, 2024, Eastern Revenue served
its response. (Parker Decl. Ex. B.) 
On September 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel further responses to RFPs, Set One, on Eastern
Revenue, and request for sanctions in the amount of $7,560.00. 
On September 30, 2024, Eastern
Revenue opposed the motion and also requested sanctions in the amount of $2,437.50.

On September 30, 2024, Parker
replied. 
 
II. Motion
A. Evidentiary Objections
Plaintiff’s Objections to the
Declaration of Marcus Dong are OVERRULED. 
B. Legal Standard
A motion to compel a further
response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable
objections to interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admission.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390,
403.) 
To request further production, a
movant must establish: (1) good cause for the production (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra, at p. 403); and (2) that
a further response is needed because (a) the responding party’s statement of
compliance with the demand to produce is incomplete Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding party’s representation that it is unable
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s objection in the response is without
merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina
Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or
(d) if the responding party objected to the production of ESI on the ground
that it is not reasonably accessible the movant can show that the (i) ESI is
reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good cause for production of the ESI
regardless of its accessibility (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)). 
The Court retains jurisdiction to
rule on the merits of discovery motions even after requested discovery was
provided after the motion was filed. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 409.)
C. Analysis
Plaintiff asserts that the Eastern
Revenue’s responses are deficient because they were not timely, the responses do
not include the language required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.210, the
objections are general and without merit, and Eastern Revenue did not include a
privilege log. (Mot. pp. 4-5.) 
In opposition, Eastern Revenue
argues that Plaintiff filed this motion prematurely without first giving
Eastern Revenue the opportunity to meet and confer. Eastern Revenue contends
that it “did not state it was unwilling to meet and confer, state it was
refusing to provide further responses or produce additional documents, or state
it was unequivocally standing on its objections.” (Opp. p. 4.) 
 On August 26, 2024, Plaintiff sent a letter detailing
deficiencies with Eastern Revenue’s responses to RFP Nos. 1-2, 7-8, 10-11, and
13. (Opp. p. 3; Parker Decl., Ex. E.) Eastern Revenue states that it received
the letter on September 3, 2024. (Dong. Decl ¶ 10.) On September 5, 2024,
Eastern Revenue responded that they were in receipt of the letter and that they
“are reviewing and will be responding or providing further responses. In the
meantime, we are agreeable to extending Plaintiff’s time to file any motion to
compel further responses with respect to Eastern Revenue’s Responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One until Friday,
November 1, 2024.” (Parker Decl., Ex F.) Plaintiff’s counsel responded that his
“office has previously made multiple request to you to meet/confer regarding
your deficient responses. But you intentionally delayed responding to our
request, causing undue delay to my client. Therefore, I am unable to agree to
your proposed extension.” (Dong. Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. H) The next day, September 6,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed this motion to compel. 
Further, Eastern Revenue observes
that Plaintiff’s August 26 meet and confer letter does not address RFPs Nos.
3-6, or 9, although the instant motion seeks to compel further responses to
those items as well. 
In reply, Plaintiff’s counsel
argues that counsel has made good faith efforts to meet and confer through calls
to Eastern Revenue’s counsel in attempts to meet and confer between July 26 and
September 2 (the precise dates are not specified), and that counsel did not
believe that granting the extension would be fruitful because Eastern Revenue
had refused to meet and confer on prior discovery motions. (Reply pp. 2.)
Here, Plaintiff has not met the
meet and confer requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 310.310 subd. (b)(2). (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2031.310, subd. (b)(2), § 2016.040.) As Plaintiff points out, a reasonable and good
faith attempt at informal resolution “requires that counsel attempt to talk the
matter over, compare their views, consult, and deliberate.” (Clement v.
Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294.) In response to Plaintiff’s meet
and confer letter, Eastern Revenue stated that it would respond and provide further
responses. Eastern Revenue offered to extend Plaintiff’s deadline to file a
motion to compel, indicating that it was going to provide additional responses
as requested without precluding Plaintiff from filing a motion to compel
further if the amended responses were still insufficient. Plaintiff indicates
that these terms were unacceptable to him, however rather than talk the matter
over with or meet with Eastern Revenue’s counsel, Plaintiff’s counsel
immediately filed the instant motion. The parties were not at an impasse –
Plaintiff noted deficiencies in Eastern Revenue’s responses, Eastern Revenue
agreed to amend the responses accordingly. It is not clear why a motion to
compel further responses is necessary where Eastern Revenue has already agreed to
provide them. 
Thus, the motion to compel further
responses is DENIED. 
 
III. Request for Sanctions
Except in certain circumstances
involving electronic stored information, the court must impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(h).) 
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd.
(a).) 
Even after a party provides
discovery responses, a party can keep its motion on calendar and the court has
authority to grant sanctions, even if it denies the motion to compel responses
“as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko, supra, at
p. 409.)
Eastern Revenue requests sanctions
against Plaintiff and his attorney of record, jointly and severally, in the
total amount of $2,437.50 based upon counsel’s rate of $375/hour for: (1) 1.0
hour to analyze the moving papers and discovery history, (2) 3.5 hours to
prepare the opposition, (3) 1.0 hour to review the reply papers and prepare for
the hearing, and (4) 1.0 hour to appear at the hearing. The Court finds the
time requested mostly reasonable, but deducts one hour from the preparation of
the opposition, for a total of $2,062.50.
While Plaintiff contends that
sanctions against him are not permitted here because Eastern Revenue did not file
a noticed motion of sanctions as required by Rule of
Court 2.30 subd. (b), sanctions here are imposed pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure, section 2031.310, subdivision (h), not Rule of Court 2.30. 
Thus, sanctions are GRANTED against
Plaintiff and his counsel of record in the total amount of $2,062.50.
IV. Conclusion
Plaintiff J.P.’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Plaintiff's Request for Production for Documents, Set Number One is DENIED. 
Sanctions are GRANTED against Plaintiff and his counsel of record
in the total amount of $2,062.50.
