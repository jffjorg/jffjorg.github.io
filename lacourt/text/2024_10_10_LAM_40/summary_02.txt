And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Los Angeles Unified School District's (LAUSD) demurrer to the complaint filed by John HH Doe, a minor with autism. The complaint alleges that LAUSD failed to properly supervise its students or take reasonable steps to protect Doe from bullying and physical/verbal abuse by a fellow student at John Burroughs Middle School.

The judge has ruled that LAUSD's demurrer is OVERRULED, meaning that the complaint is allowed to proceed to the next stage of the litigation. The judge found that Doe's claims fall under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1, which provides a special statute of limitations for childhood sexual assault cases, and are exempt from the Government Claims Act filing requirements.

The judge also found that LAUSD is not immune from liability based on Government Code section 815, which provides immunity from common law claims for public entities. The judge granted Doe's request for judicial notice of the existence of certain documents and denied LAUSD's request for a special demurrer for uncertainty.

The judge's ruling allows Doe's lawsuit to proceed, and LAUSD may need to respond to the complaint and defend itself against Doe's allegations.
