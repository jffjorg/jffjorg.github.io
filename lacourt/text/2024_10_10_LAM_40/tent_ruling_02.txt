Los Angeles
  Unified School District’s Demurrer to Complaint for Damages



 
     
I.         
Background
A.   
Pleadings
Plaintiff John HH Doe, by and
through his guardian ad litem, Francisca Guzman, sues Defendant Los Angeles
Unified School District (LAUSD) and Does 1 through 50, pursuant to a April 9,
2024, Complaint alleging causes of action for: (1) Negligence, (2) Negligent
Supervision, (3) Negligent Failure to Warn, Train or Educate, and (4)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. 
Doe is a child with autism and a
student at John Burroughs Middle School, an LAUSD school. The claims arise from
allegations that Doe was bullied, physically and verbally abused as well as
sexually harassed, assaulted, battered, abused, and molested by a fellow
student at John Burroughs Middle School. The Complaint alleges that the abuses
occurred while Does was under the supervision of LAUSD and that LAUSD generally
failed to properly supervise its students or take reasonable steps to protect
Doe from the alleged abuses.  
B.   
Motion Before the Court
On June 11, 2024, LAUSD demurred to
all four causes of action in the Complaint on the grounds of sufficiency and uncertainty.

On September 26, 2024, Doe opposed
the motion.
On October 3, 2024, LAUSD replied. 
 
    II.         
Motion
A.   
Requests for Judicial Notice
Pursuant to Evidence Code section 452, subdivisions (a) and
(c), the Court may take judicial notice of “(a) …the resolutions and private
acts of the Congress of the United States…”, (c) [o]fficial acts of the
legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the United States and of
any state of the United States.” 
The court however may not take
judicial notice of the truth of the contents of the documents. (Herrera v.
Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.)
Documents are only judicially noticeable to show their existence and what
orders were made such that the truth of the facts and findings within the
documents are not judicially noticeable. (Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell,
Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 885.)  
            Doe
requests that the Court take judicial notice of the following: 
(1)  
Assembly Floor Analysis, Analysis of Assembly Bill No.
218 (2019-2020 Regular Session) as amended August 30, 2019; 
(2)  
Senate Rules Committee, Analysis of Assembly Bill No.
218 (2019-2020 Regular Session) as amended August 30, 2019; 
(3)  
Senate Judiciary Committee, Analysis of Assembly Bill
No. 218 (2019- 2020 Regular Session) as amended March 25, 2019; 
(4)  
Assembly Floor Analysis Third Reading, Analysis of
Assembly Bill No. 218 (2019-2020 Regular Session) as amended March 25, 2019;
and
(5)  
Exhibit 5: Assembly Committee on Judiciary, Analysis of
Assembly Bill No. 218 (2019-2020 Regular Session) as introduced January 16,
2019.
The requests for judicial notice are
GRANTED to the extent of the existence of the documents. 
B.   
Meet and Confer
LAUSD has satisfied the meet and
confer requirement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a)(3)(A). (Nelson Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.) 
C.   
Legal Standard
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) This
device can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a
[general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
In testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally
and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v.
Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) The face
of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.)
A demurrer for uncertainty tests
whether the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 430.10, subd. (f).) 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is
strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain,
because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury
v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616, disapproved
on other grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co. (1998) 19
Cal.4th 26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business practices need not be pled
specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].) As a result, a special
demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach failure to incorporate
sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at uncertainty existing
in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro (1957) 149
Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v. J.E.
French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations
question].) 
D.   
Analysis
LAUSD demurs to the entire
Complaint on the grounds that Doe has not satisfied the requirements of the
Government Claims Act and that LAUSD is immune from direct liability for all
causes of action not supported by statutory authority. 
1.    
Government Claims Act
First, LAUSD argues that pursuant
to Government Code sections 910-913.2, Doe was required to file a government
tort claim “not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action”
before Doe could file suit against LAUSD. (Demurrer, p. 10; Gov. Code § 911.2.)
LAUSD further argues that while Doe brings this cause of action under Code of
Civil Procedure section 340.1, that section does not cover sexual assault
committed by a minor on another minor. (Demurrer, p. 11.) LAUSD argues that
because “childhood sexual assault” is defined in section 340.1 through
reference to various Penal Code sections and because individuals under the age
of 14 cannot be held guilty for crimes under the Penal Code, section 340.1 does
not apply to Doe’s causes of action. (Demurrer, pp. 11-12.)  
In opposition, Doe argues that claims
brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 are exempt from the
government tort claim filing requirement. (Opp. pp 8-10; Gov. Code § 905 subd.
(m).) Doe also argues that Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 does apply to
claims of childhood sexual assault perpetrated by minors. (Opp. pp. 10-13.) 

Here, Doe’s causes of action fall
under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1. In A.M. v. Ventura Unified
School District (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1252, the Court of Appeal decided a
case analogous to this one. There, the Court of Appeal stated that, “We
recognize that the primary purpose of section 340.1 is to extend the statute of
limitations for adults who discover they had been abused as children, but
respondents cite no persuasive authority suggesting that section 340.1,
subdivision (a)(2) does not apply to situations in which the abuse is
discovered while the plaintiff is still a minor.” (A.M. v. Ventura Unified
School District, supra at 1262.) Similarly, LAUSD does not provide any
persuasive authority that suggests section 340.1 applies only to adult
plaintiffs. 
LAUSD asserts that section 340.1
does not apply to the instant action because acts committed by minors do not
fall within the definition of childhood sexual assault in section 340.1,
subdivision (c). That subdivision states: “‘Childhood sexual assault’ as used
in this section includes any act committed against the plaintiff that occurred
when the plaintiff was under the age of 18 years and that would have been
proscribed by Section 266j of the Penal Code; Section 285 of the Penal Code;
paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (b), or of subdivision (c), of Section 286
of the Penal Code; subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 288 of the Penal Code;
paragraph (1) or (2) of subdivision (b), or of subdivision (c), of Section 287
or of former Section 288a of the Penal Code; subdivision (h), (i), or (j) of
Section 289 of the Penal Code; any sexual conduct as defined in paragraph (1)
of subdivision (d) of Section 311.4 of the Penal Code; Section 647.6 of the
Penal Code; or any prior laws of this state of similar effect at the time the
act was committed. This subdivision does not limit the availability of causes
of action permitted under subdivision (a), including causes of action against
persons or entities other than the alleged perpetrator of the abuse.” 
LAUSD argues that under Penal Code
section 26 children under the age of 14 are only capable of committing a crime if
there is “clear proof that at the time of committing the act charged against
them, they knew its wrongfulness.” (Penal Code § 26.) Similarly, LAUSD asserts
that Penal Code section 288 “only applies where the harm was conducted with
sexual intent.” LAUSD argues that the Complaint lacks facts that allege that
the minors in question were aware of the wrongfulness of their conduct or that demonstrate
that the act was done with sexual intent. (Reply pp. 4-5.) 
At the demurrer stage, a plaintiff
need only set forth the essential facts of their case. Doe alleges that another
student “touched [Doe] over his pants in [Doe]’s groin area” (Complaint, ¶ 20.)  Prior to conducting discovery, Doe may not
have access to information pertaining to the other student’s state of mind or
intent. Thus, he has alleged facts sufficient to show an act of childhood
sexual assault. 
Accordingly, Doe’s claim falls
under the purview of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1, and he is exempted
from the filing requirements of the Government Claims Act. 
2.    
Government Code Section 815 Immunity
Second, LAUSD argues that under
Government Code section 815, public entities cannot be liable for common law
theories of general negligence and that liability against the school district
must be authorized by statute. (Demurrer, pp. 12-13; Gov. Code, § 815, subd.
(a).) LAUSD argues that it is thus immune from Doe’s claims of negligence,
negligent supervision, negligent failure to warn, train or educate, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Demurrer, pp. 12-13.) 
In opposition, Doe asserts that his
claims are not barred by Government Code section 815 because LAUSD is liable
for torts committed by its employees pursuant to Government Code section 815.2
subd. (a). (Opp. p. 13; Gov. Code, § 815.2 subd. (a).)
Here, LAUSD’s argument is
unavailing. Government Code section 815.2 subdivision (a) provides that public
entities are “liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an
employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or
omission would, apart from this section, have given rise to a cause of action
against that employee or his personal representative.” (Gov. Code, § 815.2
subd. (a).) The Complaint alleges that LAUSD staff breached their duties to Doe
in the course and scope of their employment and that the various breaches of
duty gave rise to the facts underlying Doe’s various causes of action.
(Complaint ¶¶ 89, 108, 117, 130.) 
Thus, Doe’s claims are supported by
statutory liability and LAUSD is not immune based on Government Code section
815. 
Accordingly, based on the above, LAUSD’s
demurrer is OVERRULED. 
III. Conclusion
Los Angeles Unified School District’s Demurrer to Complaint for Damages
is OVERRULED.
