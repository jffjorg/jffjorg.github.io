Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents. The plaintiff, Joseph Parker, alleges that the defendant, Eastern Revenue, Inc., failed to provide sufficient responses to the request. The Judge finds that the plaintiff has not met the requirements for a motion to compel further responses, as the parties have made good faith efforts to meet and confer and Eastern Revenue has agreed to provide further responses. The Judge denies the motion to compel further responses.

The Judge also grants sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel in the amount of $2,062.50, as the plaintiff's counsel failed to make a reasonable and good faith attempt at informal resolution of the dispute. The Judge finds that the time spent by Eastern Revenue's counsel on the opposition and preparation for the hearing was mostly reasonable, but deducts one hour from the preparation of the opposition.

The Judge notes that the parties were not at an impasse, as Eastern Revenue agreed to provide further responses and the plaintiff's counsel did not believe that granting an extension would be fruitful. The Judge finds that the motion to compel further responses is essentially unnecessary and grants sanctions in favor of Eastern Revenue.
