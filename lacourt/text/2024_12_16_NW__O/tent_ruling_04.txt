[2] In Rodriguez, the plaintiff
asserted PAGA and non-PAGA claims; the non-PAGA claims were arbitrated. (Rodriguez,
106 Cal.App.5th 645.) The Court of Appeal found “Rodriguez’s PAGA standing as
an aggrieved employee was predicated on the Labor Code violations he failed to
prove in arbitration. The trial court thus properly found that the arbitration
award and resulting judgment preclude Rodriguez from relitigating the Labor Code
violations to prove standing to maintain the PAGA cause of action.” (Id.)
