And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration in a PAGA action brought by Plaintiff Sergio Gandarilla against Harbor Freight Tools USA, Inc. The Court holds that the PAGA action is not subject to arbitration because Plaintiff asserts his action in his representative capacity only, and that he must be an "aggrieved employee" to bring a PAGA action. The Court also finds that the arbitration agreement does not cover the PAGA action as it only covers individual claims and not representative claims. The Court concludes that Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration is denied.
