     CASE NO.: 22VECV00601
 
ORDER
  DENYING KINGSTON PROPERTIES LLC’S MOTION TO COMPEL THE PLAINTIFF, FRANK
  DANDRIDGE, TO APPEAR AND TESTIFY AT DEPOSITION





 
I.              
BACKGROUND 
This case
arises of habitability issues Plaintiff Frank Dandridge (“Plaintiff”) allegedly
experienced while leasing an apartment located at 5401 Sepulveda Blvd #14,
Sherman Oaks, CA 91411. In connection with those issues, Plaintiff filed a
Complaint against Defendants W-R-T Development Co. (“W-R-T”), Frank Warren, as
Trustee of the Frank Warren and Joanne Warren Revocable Trust, Joanne Warren,
as Trustee of the Frank Warren and Joanne Warren Revocable Trust (“Joanne”),
Warren Properties, Inc. (“Warren”), Kingston Properties LLC (“Kingston”), and
Hollywood Don LP (“Hollywood”). 
Kingston now
seeks to compel Plaintiff’s deposition.  
II.

Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; (3) Breach of Warranty of Habitability; (4)

On July 22,
2022, Hollywood filed its Answer to the Complaint. 
On April 10,
2023, Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging (1) Breach of
Contract/Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment/Warranty of Habitability; (2) Negligence; (3)
Nuisance; (4) Violation of California Civil Code Section 1942.4; (5) Violation of
Unfair Business Practices; (6) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress;
and (7) Trespass to Chattel. 
On July 25,
2023, Plaintiff dismissed his seventh cause of action in his FAC. 
On November
9, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to his FAC, changing “W-R-T DEVELOPMENT
CO., a California limited partnership” to “W-R-T DEVELOPMENT CO., a California
general partnership.”
On November
14, 2023, the Court granted in part W-R-T, Warren, Kingston, and Hollywood’s

On December

On October 7,
2024, the Court denied Kingston’s Motions to Compel the Responses of Plaintiff
to its Special Interrogatories and its Requests for Production. (“Motion”). 
On November
20, 2024, Kingston filed the instant Motion to Compel the Plaintiff, Frank
Dandridge, to Appear and Testify at Deposition (the “Motion”) and Declaration
of David Larsen in Support of the Motion dated November 20, 2024 (“Larsen Decl.”).
On December
3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Partial Opposition” to the Motion. 
On December
4, 2024, Kingston filed its Reply.
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450(a)[1]
provides that, “[i]f, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action… without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it…, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”  
Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.410(a),
provides that, “[a]ny party served with a deposition notice that does not
comply with [the notice requirements in Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2025.210
through 2025.290] waives any error or irregularity unless that party promptly
serves a written objection specifying that error or irregularity at least three
calendar days prior to the date for which the deposition is scheduled, on the
party seeking to take the deposition and any other attorney or party on whom
the deposition notice was served.”
Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450(b)(2)
requires the motion to compel deposition be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition, by a
declaration stating the moving party has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.
Finally, Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.290,
which provides for a limit of seven hours of total testimony of a witness, does
not apply to the deposition of a person designated as the person most qualified
to be deposed. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.290(b)(5).)
IV.         
MEET AND CONFER
A motion set forth under Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450 must be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration or, when the deponent does not attend the
deposition, a “declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the
deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450(b)(2).)

Kingston’s counsel warned Plaintiff’s counsel he intended to file
a Motion to Compel after receiving the objection to Kingston’s First Amended Notice
of Deposition. (See Larsen Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. G.) However, Kingston’s counsel
did not communicate with Plaintiff’s counsel at all after taking Plaintiff’s Non-Appearance
at the previously noticed September 25, 2024, deposition. (See generally Larsen
Decl. and Plaintiff’s Opposition, 3:25-26.) The Court notes that it denied
Kingston’s last pair of discovery motions for failing to meet and confer. Kingston’s
counsel has once again failed to properly meet and confer after Plaintiff’s
non-appearance and before Kingston filed the Motion as required by section
2025.450(b)(2). Kingston’s counsel’s approach does not demonstrate a reasonable
and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the issues presented in the
Motion. As such, Kingston’s Motion is DENIED. 
In addition, since Plaintiff’s counsel has not requested sanctions
or provided any evidentiary support on which the Court might rely to sanction
Defendants’ counsel for failing to meet and confer, the Court will not sanction
Defendants’ counsel for violating section 2025.450(b)(2). However, the Court
reminds counsel for both parties that failing to meet and confer prior to
filing a discovery motion when a particular discovery motion so requires them,
they could be subject to sanctions for misuse of the discovery process. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010.)
Based on its review of the sequence of events leading up to this Motion,
the Court is particularly concerned that counsel for both sides have
failed to take the Court’s admonitions at the hearing on Kingston’s prior
motions to compel and in its subsequent order to heart. Specifically, in its Order
dated October 7, 2024, a full 44 days prior to Kingston’s filing of this
motion, the Court stated it “takes seriously their obligations to work
collaboratively and cooperatively for the sake of their clients, not to mention
judicial efficiency.” Simply put, this is the last time the Court will warn
counsel about their lack of civility. 

V.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES Kingston’s
Motion to Compel the Plaintiff, Frank Dandridge, to Appear and Testify at Deposition.
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      December 16, 2024



Hon. Michael R. Amerian
Judge,
  Superior Court
