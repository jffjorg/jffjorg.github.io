And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production, Set 1, filed by Kei-Ai against Jim Rey. The motion was filed due to Jim Rey's failure to properly respond to the requests, which included failing to identify documents produced and providing incomplete or evasive responses. The judge ordered Jim Rey to provide further, verified responses to Requests for Production, Set 1, numbers 1-17 and 20-103, and to produce responsive documents within 30 days. Additionally, the judge imposed sanctions on Jim Rey in the amount of $1,000.00, payable within 30 days, for his failure to comply with his discovery obligations.
