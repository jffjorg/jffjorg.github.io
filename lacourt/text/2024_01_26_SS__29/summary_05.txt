Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Infinity Insurance Company's motion to reduce the amount of the appeal bond. The motion was filed on December 20, 2023, and Infinity argued that the amount of the bond, which is currently $4,065,127.11, is excessive given the issuance of the remittitur in the first appeal and the satisfaction of that judgment. The judge found that Infinity's argument lacks case authority and that Infinity did not obtain a clear benefit in choosing to post a bond in the amount of 150 percent of the full amount of the judgment against the estate. The judge also rejected Infinity's argument that it was misled by its counsel, FWHB, and that the bond is unnecessary. The hearing on the motion is continued to January 26, 2024.
