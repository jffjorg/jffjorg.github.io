 Case Number:  19STCV35153    Hearing Date:   January 26, 2024    Dept:  29  
Tentative
The motions are DENIED without prejudice.
Background
On October 2, 2019, Plaintiff Karina Mena (“Plaintiff”) filed
the Complaint in this action against Defendants Michael Obeng, M.D. (“Obeng”), Miko
Plastic Surgery (“Miko”), Beverly Hills Wellness Surgical Institute, Lotus
Surgery Center, Inc., and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for medical
negligence and negligent hiring and retention.
On July 6, 2020, the Court entered the default of Obeng
and Miko.
On February 16, 2021, the Court, at the request of
Plaintiff, dismissed all claims against Beverly Hills Wellness Surgical
Institute, Lotus Surgery Center, Inc., and Does 1 through 50, without
prejudice.
Despite the entry of default, Obeng and Miko filed their
Answer to the Complaint on November 3, 2021. 
On that same day, Obeng and Miko also filed a Cross-Complaint against
Kaiser Permanente Medical Group, Kaiser Permanente a Corporation, and Does 1
through 15, for (1) Indemnification, (2) Apportionment of Fault, and (3)
Declaratory Relief.
Obeng and Miko filed a motion to set aside the
default.  On July 22, 2022, the Court
granted Obeng’s motion to set aside the default and denied Miko’s.
On September 9, 2022, Obeng filed a First Amended Answer.
On November 17, 2022, Obeng amended the Cross-Complaint
to name Southern California Permanente Medical Group (“SCPMG”) as Doe 1.  SCPMG filed an Answer to the Cross-Complaint
on August 29, 2023.
Two days
later, on August 31, 2023, SCPMG served Obeng with Form Interrogatories (Set
One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One).  (Brown Decls., ¶¶ 4-5 & Exhs. A-B.)  As of the filing of this motion, Obeng had
not responded to the discovery.
On
October 6, 2023, Obeng filed a substitution of attorney.  Obeng is now representing himself.
On December
28, 2023, SCPMG filed the two motions that are before the Court and set for
hearing on January 26: a motion to compel initial responses to interrogatories
and a motion to compel initial responses to requests for production.  SCPMG seeks monetary sanctions in each
motion.
Obeng
has not filed an opposition to either motion.
Legal Standard
A party
must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party
must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision
(d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to
respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding
untimely responses does not divest the trial court of its authority [to hear a motion
to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even if the untimely response “does not
contain objections [and] substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion
to compel responses … the trial court retains the authority to hear the
motion.”  (Id. at pp. 408-409.)  This rule gives “an important
incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”  (Id.
at p. 408.)  If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,” the trial court may
“deny the motion to compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in
part, and just impose sanctions.”  (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may
award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion
to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).)  
Discussion
SCPMG
served Obeng with Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set
One), and Requests for Production (Set One) on August 31, 2023.  (Brown Decls., ¶¶ 4-5 & Exhs. A-B.)  Obeng had not responded.
There is
an issue, however, with service.  
Initially,
based on the information in the record, the discovery requests themselves were
duly and properly served on Obeng through his then-counsel.  
On
October 6, 2023, Obeng filed a substitution of counsel indicating that he is
now representing himself; the substitution form includes a mailing address for
Obeng but no email address.
Obeng is not a represented party and so is not subject to
any mandatory provision for accepting electronic service that applies to
represented parties.  (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 1010.6; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.251.)  Nor is there any evidence in the record that Obeng
agreed to or consented to electronic service of court documents in this matter.  Accordingly, SCPMG (and all parties) are
required to serve Obeng by mail (or by some other authorized means other than electronic
service).
Here, however, according to the proofs of service, Obeng
was served with these two motions electronic service only.  That is not valid service for these motions.
Accordingly, the Court DENIES these two motions for lack
of proper service.  The denial is without
prejudice.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES without prejudice the motions of
Cross-Defendant Southern California Permanente Medical Group to compel
Obeng to respond to interrogatories and requests for production. 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
