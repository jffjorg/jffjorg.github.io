The judge's tentative ruling continues the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to discovery requests for approximately 90 days, pending completion of an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). The judge denies the defendant's motions to compel initial responses to discovery requests due to the defendant's failure to properly serve the discovery requests. The judge also notes that the defendant did not provide an electronic service address for service and did not confirm the appropriate electronic service address for the counsel being served.
