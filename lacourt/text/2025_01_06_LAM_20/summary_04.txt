And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge on a demurrer filed by Allstate Insurance Company against the Third Amended Complaint (TAC) filed by Plaintiff Tigran Galstyan. The Plaintiff alleges that his real property was destroyed by a fire originating from Defendant Lai's property and that Allstate lied about not pursuing a subrogation claim. The judge has ruled that the fifth through eighth causes of action, which allege fraud, concealment, and negligent misrepresentation by Allstate, are deficient because they fail to specifically plead facts indicating fraudulent intent. Additionally, the judge has ruled that the sixth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation is defective because it is not an actionable form of deceit. The judge has also ruled that the UCL claim is merely derivative of the other unsuccessful claims and that the "tort of another" claim is not a "cause of action", but rather a theory to support a request for attorneys' fees. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend, and Allstate's Motion to Strike is denied as moot.
