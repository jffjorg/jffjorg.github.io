And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most knowledgeable. The plaintiff sought to compel the deposition after the defendant failed to provide deposition dates, but the judge found that the motion is defective due to a lack of meet-and-confer efforts. The defendant had offered to provide deposition dates and scope of examination, but the plaintiff did not address these objections or proposed scope of examination in their correspondence. As a result, the judge denied the motion.
