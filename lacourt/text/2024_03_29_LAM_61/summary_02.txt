And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Arizona Tile, LLC, has moved to strike certain language from the First Amended Complaint (FAC) of the plaintiffs, Demetrio Luna-Reyes and Guillemina Valdez. The defendant argues that the language, which alleges that the plaintiffs were injured by "other stone products to be identified during the course of discovery," is improper because it fails to identify specific products, as required by the California Supreme Court in Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co. The judge agrees with the defendant and grants the motion to strike, finding that the language in the FAC is insufficient and allows the plaintiffs to avoid identifying the specific products at issue.
