MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Duncan
J. McCreary, Reeder McCreary, LLP
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On April 9,
2024, Duncan J. McCreary, counsel for Defendant, Centinela Car Wash Properties,
LLC, filed this Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel.
 
            The Motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and
without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship
why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration
in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052));
(3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other
parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving
counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).  
The court
has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿
            
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Duncan J. McCreary seeks to be
relieved as counsel of record for Defendant for the following reasons: “A conversation
occurred late in the evening of March 5, 2024 between Hooman Michael Nissani
and myself which resulted in a serious conflict of interest between Mr. Nissani
and myself, and Reeder McCreary, LLP. The conflict is so serious that no
additional work can ethically be performed by either myself and/or Reeder
McCreary, LLP for Hooman Michael Nissani and any of his related entities.  Duncan McCreary and Reeder McCreary, LLP must
ethically cease all representation of Hooman Michael Nissani and any of his related
entities immediately due to the serious nature of the conflict.”  (McCreary Decl., Form
MC-052.)    
 
            Christopher S. Reeder, managing
partner of Reeder McCreary, LLP also adds the following:  “Late in the evening on March 5, 2024, I
became aware that a conversation occurred on March 5, 2024 between Hooman
Michael Nissani and Duncan J. McCreary of Reeder McCreary, LLP which resulted
in a serious conflict of interest between Mr. Nissani and Mr. McCreary. On
March 6, 2024, after consulting with our outside ethics counsel, I concluded
that the conflict is so serious that no additional legal services can ethically
be performed by either Mr. McCreary or Reeder McCreary, LLP for Hooman Michael
Nissani and any of his related entities.” 
(Reeder Decl., Form MC-052.)
 
Absent a showing
of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398,
406.)¿¿ 
 
Upon review, the
court finds that the Motion does not comply with California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362.  The proof of service shows that Plaintiff was not served
with notice of this Motion. 
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
Accordingly, the Motion is CONTINUED to June 25, 2024 to
allow Counsel for Defendant to serve Plaintiff with notice of this Motion.  The court notes Plaintiff is
self-represented.  Counsel for Defendant
is directed to serve Plaintiff pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule
2.251(c)(3)(B).
