Here is a summary of the tentative ruling:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 21STCV24940
* Hearing Date: May 23, 2024
* Trial Date: June 24, 2024
* Parties: Gus Murra, Jacob Palacios, Victor Brown, Jerry D. Fritz, Louie Gener, and the City of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), and Los Angeles Police Revolver and Athletic Club (LAPRAAC)

**Summary of the Case**

The case involves allegations of negligence and negligent supervision, hiring, or retention by the City of Los Angeles, the LAPD, and LAPRAAC. The Plaintiffs, including Murra, Palacios, Brown, Fritz, and Gener, were sworn officers of the LAPD who purchased firearms from LAPRAAC. The Plaintiffs allege that LAPRAAC was the ostensible agent of the City or LAPD for the sale of firearms, leading to their harm.

**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has considered the motions for summary judgment filed by the City and has denied the motions. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have not presented sufficient evidence to establish an ostensible agency relationship between the City or LAPD and LAPRAAC for the sale of firearms.

**Reasoning**

The Court concludes that the Plaintiffs' evidence, while showing a strong association between LAPRAAC and the LAPD, fails to demonstrate any representation from the City or LAPD that LAPRAAC was their agent for the sale of firearms. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs' belief that LAPRAAC was the City's or LAPD's ostensible agent for the sale of firearms was not reasonable.

The Court cites several cases, including Magallanes v. Doctors Medical Center of Modesto and Pereda v. Atos Jiu Jitsu LLC, to support its conclusion. The Court also distinguishes the case from Ermoian v. Desert Hospital, where the clinic provided medical services that were held out as being part of the hospital.
