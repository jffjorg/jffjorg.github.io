MOTION
TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
LA Dorm, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Julian
Stuart
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On December 9, 2021, Plaintiff, Julian Stuart, filed a Complaint
against Defendant, LA Dorm, LLC, arising from Plaintiff’s tenancy at a property
owned and operated by Defendant. Plaintiff alleges breaches of the warranty of
habitability, among other claims.  Defendant
answered the complaint on December 30, 2021. 

 
            On August
28, 2023, Defense Counsel substituted out of the case.  Defendant did not retain counsel.
 
            On
September 5, 2023, Plaintiff announced ready for trial.  Defendant requested additional time to
acquire legal representation.  The court
continued the Final Status Conference to November 3, 2023.
 
            On November
3, 2023, Defendant did not appear. Accordingly, the court ordered Defendant’s
answer stricken and its default entered.
 
 On February 14, 2024,
Defendant filed this
motion to set aside the default under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b), and concurrently filed a substitution of attorney.  
 
On May 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.  Defendant did not reply.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b) provides that a court may “relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.”  In addition, a court
must vacate a default or dismissal when a motion for relief under Section 473,
subdivision (b) is filed timely and accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect “unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact
caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)   
 
The party or the legal
representative must seek such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980 [“because more than six months had elapsed from the
entry of default, and hence relief under section 473 was unavailable”]; People
v. The North River Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 712, 721 [motion for
relief under section 473 must be brought “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months”].)   
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Defendant seeks discretionary relief to vacate the default
on the following grounds: (1) a timely response to the complaint was not filed
because previous counsel substituted out of the case without advising Defendant
and was unprepared to retain new counsel. 
(See Declaration of Vladislav Shuliko.) 
Further, this motion was timely filed within six months of the entry of
default.  For these reasons, Defendant argues
his failure to timely answer the Complaint was the result of his mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 

 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues the motion should be denied
because Defendant has not offered any competent evidence to justify 473
relief.  “The party seeking relief,
however, bears the burden of proof in establishing a right to relief.”  (Hopkins & Carley v. Gens (2011)
200 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1410.)  As Plaintiff
correctly points out, entry of default against Defendant was not based on a
failure to timely respond to the Complaint. 
Defendant filed an answer.  (See
Answer, 12/30/21.)  Rather, Defendant’s
default was entered because it failed to appear for the Final Status Conference
after the court continued the same for two months to allow retention of new
counsel.  (See Minute Order, 11/3/23.) 
            Nonetheless, the court grants relief because Defendant
states he was not able to retain new counsel and the reasonable inference
therefrom is that Defendant did not appear at the November 3, 2023, hearing
because Defendant was without counsel.  Defendant
is now represented.  Given that (1)
Defendant has retained counsel, (2) this motion was filed within six months of
the entry of default, (3) there is no showing of prejudice to Plaintiff if
default is set aside, (4) the policy that cases be resolved on their merits,
and (5) Defendant’s failure to appear was due to excusable neglect, the court
grants discretionary relief pursuant to CCP § 473, subd. (b).
 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The motion to set aside default is GRANTED.  
 
Defendant shall file its answer within 30 days.  A case management conference is scheduled for
August 6, 2024, at 9am.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
