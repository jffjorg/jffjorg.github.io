The court grants Defendant LA Dorm, LLC's motion to set aside the default entered against it. The default was entered because the Defendant failed to appear at the Final Status Conference. The court finds that the Defendant's failure to appear was due to excusable neglect, as it was without counsel at the time. The court also finds that the Defendant has now retained new counsel and that the motion was filed within the six-month time limit. The court grants discretionary relief pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 473, subdivision (b). The Defendant is granted 30 days to file its answer, and a case management conference is scheduled for August 6, 2024.
