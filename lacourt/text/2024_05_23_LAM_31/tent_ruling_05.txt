[1] Defendant City of Los Angeles
filed separate motions for summary judgment against each Plaintiff.  As such, each Plaintiff filed separate
oppositions. 


[2] 
At various times, the court refers to Defendants City and LAPD collectively
as the City or Defendants. The parties generally refer to the two Defendants
interchangeably.   


[3]  The
court will address in a separate order the City’s motion for summary
adjudication of Palacious’s retaliation claim.  


[4] Unless otherwise noted, all
references to the City’s undisputed material facts are taken from the City’s
separate statement in support of their motion for summary judgment against
Plaintiff Murra’s claims.
 


[5] Plaintiffs’ evidence is taken from
Murra’s separate statement.  The facts in
Murra’s separate statement appear in the separate statements filed by each
Plaintiff.  


[6] Having so concluded, the court
does not address the City’s governmental immunities argument.
