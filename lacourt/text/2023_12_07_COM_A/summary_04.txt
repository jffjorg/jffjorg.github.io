And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the matter of Johqa Langley, a minor, seeking to change her name to Johqa Maliqe Webb. The Petitioner has only obtained consent from one parent, and is required to disclose the name and address of the other parent and serve them with the Order to Show Cause at least 30 days before the continued hearing date. However, the Court's file does not reflect that the Petitioner has complied with these requirements, including filing proof of service and publishing the Order to Show Cause. The Judge has continued the hearing to February 9, 2024, and ordered the Petitioner to comply with the requirements for proof of service and publication.
