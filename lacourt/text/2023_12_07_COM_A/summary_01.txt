And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling continues the hearing on the petition for approval of a compromise of a claim for a person with a disability. The plaintiff, Apolonio Garcia, was injured in an accident involving a truck driven by Antonio Uribe Caracheo on December 14, 2018. As a result of the incident, Garcia suffered a severe traumatic brain injury and multiple facial fractures, rendering him 100 percent disabled.

Garcia seeks approval of the settlement, which includes a payment of $9,825,000 from Lincoln Transportation Services, Inc. and $25,000 from West Coast Management. The plaintiff's counsel requests attorney's fees totaling $3,930,000, which the court finds reasonable under the circumstances.

The court also reviews the billing records of counsel, which total $204,088.30. After deducting attorney's fees and costs, the net settlement to Garcia is $5,690,911.70. Garcia proposes to use $4,000,000 to fund a single-premium deferred annuity, and the balance will be transferred to an existing trust for his benefit.

Because the settlement involves a transfer to a trust, the Probate Division must review the trust terms. The plaintiff must lodge with the filing window of the Probate Division at least 30 days before the hearing a physical copy of the face page of the petition to approve the compromise and attach a copy of the proposed trust instrument and the proposed order approving the compromise and trust.

The court continues the hearing to February 9, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
