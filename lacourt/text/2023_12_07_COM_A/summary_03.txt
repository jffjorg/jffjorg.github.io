The Court orders the petitioner to serve the other parent with notice of the hearing and to make diligent efforts to locate the other parent. If the other parent cannot be located, the petitioner must file a supplemental declaration stating what attempts were made to locate the other parent and why service cannot be reasonably accomplished.
