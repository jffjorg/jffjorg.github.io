ORDER CONTINUING
 THE HEARING ON PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
      Petitioner, Valeria Citlalli Leyva, a minor, by and through her
 mother, Gabriela C. Huitzil, filed this Petition for an Order for
Change of Name to Valeria Citlalli Barrera.  
      The Court continued this hearing from October 24, 2023, since
only one parent consented to the name change and Petitioner was ordered to
serve the other parent with the Order to Show Cause at least 30 days before the
continued hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1277(a)(4).) The Court’s file does
not reflect that Petitioner filed a proof of service showing that the other
parent was given notice of the hearing.

at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton
Courthouse. The petitioner “shall cause, not less than 30 days before
the hearing,” personally serve the other parent with notice of the time and
place of the hearing or a copy of the order to show cause” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1277; Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) If the other parent lives outside the state,  the parent may be served by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, and requiring a return receipt. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.40.)
      Petitioner is required to make diligent efforts to locate the
other parent. If the other parent cannot be located, Petitioner shall file a
supplemental declaration stating what attempts were made to locate the other
parent and why service cannot be reasonably accomplished. The supplemental declaration
shall be filed no less than 10 court days before the continued hearing date. Additionally,
the Court’s file does not reflect that Petitioner has complied with the
requirements for publication of the Order to Show Cause. Code Civ. Proc., §
1277. 
            Accordingly,
the Court continues the hearing to February 9, 2024,  at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton
Courthouse. Petitioner is ordered to comply with the foregoing requirements.
