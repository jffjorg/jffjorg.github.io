And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiffs' motion to add claims under the Fair Housing Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, and California Disabled Persons Act to their original complaint. The motion was filed on August 14, 2024, and the plaintiffs sought to add these claims based on "newly discovered facts" that supported these claims. However, the court found that the motion was conclusory and failed to specify what new facts emerged that necessitated the amendment. Additionally, the court was not convinced that the plaintiffs could not have discovered these facts earlier, as they had occupied the premises. The court also found that the proposed amendments failed to comply with the California Rules of Court, as they did not state the underlying facts supporting the new claims and their inability to discover them earlier.
