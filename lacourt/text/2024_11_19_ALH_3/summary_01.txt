And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., has failed to maintain a qualified third-party dispute resolution process, as required by the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (SBA) and the Tanner Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). The defendant's Seventh and Eighth Affirmative Defenses, which alleged that the plaintiffs received timely notice of the availability of a third-party dispute resolution process and that the defendant possesses a qualified third-party dispute resolution process, are therefore dismissed.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the defendant has not obtained certification from the California Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) for its dispute resolution process, as required by the SBA and TCPA. The judge also found that the defendant's dispute resolution process has not been reviewed by the DCA, and that the defendant's attempts to argue that its process is in "substantial compliance" with the SBA and TCPA without certification are insufficient.

The judge's ruling grants the plaintiffs' motion for summary adjudication of the defendant's Seventh and Eighth Affirmative Defenses, and finds that the defendant did not maintain a qualified third-party dispute resolution process and that its affirmative defenses fail as a matter of law.
