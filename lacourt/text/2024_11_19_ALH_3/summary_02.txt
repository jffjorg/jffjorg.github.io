Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining defendants' demurrer without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Marti Mackey, filed a lawsuit against the City of Pasadena and Jim Wong, alleging elder abuse and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff claims that she was wrongfully evicted from her property after the City accepted $150,000 from a junior lienholder to reconvey its first lien deed of trust.

The defendants filed a demurrer, arguing that the plaintiff fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The plaintiff filed an opposition brief and exhibits in support, while the defendants filed a reply brief.

The Court found that the plaintiff's first claim was properly rejected by the City on May 4, 2023, and that the plaintiff's subsequent re-submitted claim did not constitute a new claim. The Court also found that the City's notice of rejection was properly served, despite some discrepancies in the dates on the proof of service and the postage meter stamp on the envelope.

As a result, the Court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the plaintiff's lawsuit. The plaintiff has been given notice of the ruling and may choose to appeal.
