  Case Number:  21VECV01239    Hearing Date:   December 11, 2024    Dept:  T JP MORGAN V BEN-SHAUL 21VECV01239
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Plaintiff JP Morgan Chase Bank’s Motion to Enforce Settlement and Enter
Judgment is GRANTED.
Introduction 
Plaintiff JP Morgan Chase Bank (Plaintiff) moved to enforce
the settlement and enter judgment against Defendant Barak Ben Shaul
(Defendant).  
Defendant’s opposition was due November 26, 2024 and none
was filed.
Discussion 
It is undisputed that the parties entered into a settlement
agreement (Agreement) and a stipulation for the Court to retain jurisdiction
pursuant Code of Civil Procedure, section 664.6 (Stipulation).  The Stipulation is signed by the Defendant
and Plaintiff’s Counsel and expressly provides that the Court retains
jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  (Drew Callahan’s Decl., Exh. 1.)    Plaintiff presented evidence that Defendant
breached the payment obligations under the settlement agreement and despite
notice of the default failed to cure. 
(Drew Callahan’s Decl., par. 10, Exh. 2.)  Plaintiff is entitled to judgment of
$71,733.55, which includes the principal less payments; late fees and costs;
attorneys’ fees per the Agreement and Stipulation; and costs.  Because Plaintiff has shown Defendant’s
breach and failure to cure and the Court’s retention of jurisdiction, the motion
is persuasive.
The motion to enforce and enter judgment is GRANTED.  Judgment to be submitted by moving party.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
