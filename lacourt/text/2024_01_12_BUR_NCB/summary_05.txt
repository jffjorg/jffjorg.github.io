And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a demurrer to the complaint filed by the defendant, Justin Adam Scarbrough, arguing that the two-year statute of limitations has expired. The plaintiff, Illya Kode, alleges that the defendant was negligent in a motor vehicle accident on October 22, 2020, in Studio City. The plaintiff filed the complaint on November 18, 2022, but the defendant argues that the original filing date on October 19, 2022, should be considered, as the complaint was rejected by the clerk of the court due to being filed in the wrong court district. The judge is granting the demurrer and continuing the hearing to March 8, 2024, while directing the plaintiff to re-serve the opposition papers and to file an appropriate motion seeking a nunc pro tunc order regarding the filing date of the complaint.
