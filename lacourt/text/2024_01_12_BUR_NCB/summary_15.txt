And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for trial preference due to his age (83 years old) and health conditions. The plaintiff was injured in a fall at a Walgreens store and has several medical conditions, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and osteopenia. He has recently been diagnosed with invasive squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, and his health is declining, including memory loss, depression, and physical pain.

The defendants argued that trial preference is not automatic based solely on age and that the plaintiff's motion papers fail to show that his health is such that he would be prejudiced if trial were not scheduled within 6 months. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has made a sufficient showing of his advanced age and numerous health issues, and that he has recently been suffering memory loss, which may be important for future depositions and testifying at trial.

The trial is set for May 13, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. The plaintiff shall provide notice of this order.
