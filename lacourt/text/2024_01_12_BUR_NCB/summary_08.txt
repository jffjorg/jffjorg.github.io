And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling discusses the case between UAC and NTS regarding strict products liability. NTS argues that it need not be the ultimate consumer or purchaser of the MAFFS part, and that sale of the product is not necessary for imposing products liability. The judge finds merit in these arguments, citing cases such as Elmore v. American Motors Corp. and Stein v. Southern Cal. Edison Co. However, the judge also notes that there are still other issues with the strict products liability cause of action, and therefore, the cause of action is not adequately pled.
