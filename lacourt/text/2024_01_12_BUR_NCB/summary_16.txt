And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike the allegations for punitive damages from the complaint. The defendant, Sevan Safyani, moved to strike these allegations, arguing that the complaint lacks specific facts supporting a claim for punitive damages and that the allegations are conclusory. The plaintiff, Sergio Corona, opposes the motion, alleging that the defendant's conduct was reckless and dangerous and that he was aware of the probable consequences of his actions.

The judge finds that the allegations in the complaint regarding the defendant's intoxication are insufficient to support the imposition of punitive damages. The judge also finds that the allegations regarding malice, oppression, despicable conduct, and/or conscious disregard are conclusory as currently alleged in the complaint. The judge grants the motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint with leave to amend.

The judge notes that specific factual circumstances must be alleged which show that the risk of injury was probable, such as weaving through lanes of traffic, a previous conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol, or driving while simultaneously drinking alcohol. The fact that an accident occurred and the defendant was found to be intoxicated, without more, does not show aggravating circumstances warranting punitive damages.

The judge orders that the defendant shall provide notice of this order and grants the defendant 20 days leave to amend the complaint.
