  Hearing Date:  January 12, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to be relieved as counsel
 



 
Defense counsel, Steven N. Richman, Esq.
(“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Marilyn Karmazyn
and Blazin’ Burgers (“Defendants”).  
Counsel filed this instant motion to be
relieved as counsel on December 15, 2023.  Counsel has filed an MC-052 form pursuant to
CRC Rule 3.1362, but has not filed an MC-052 declaration form and an MC-053
proposed order form.  
According to the MC-051 form, Counsel
seeks to be relieved as counsel because during the course of the litigation,
certain irreconcilable differences arose between Defendants and Counsel, which
prevented effective representation by Counsel’s firm, Defendants were informed
of the inability of Counsel to effectively represent them, and the office has
made all necessary efforts to resolve the differences and avoid the motion but
such efforts have been unsuccessful.  (MC-051,
§3.)  For these reasons, Counsel seeks to
withdraw from representing Defendants in this action.  
Counsel served Defendants with the motion,
as well as counsel for the other parties in this action on December 18,
2023.  However, as the MC-052 form is not
provided with the moving papers, the Court cannot ascertain whether Counsel
confirmed Defendants’ address within the past 30 days of filing the motion. 
As for future hearing dates, a motion to
compel discovery/deposition is set for January 19, 2024, a Mandatory Settlement
Conference is set for August 30, 2024, the Final Status Conference is set for January
16, 2025, and the Trial is set for January 27, 2025.  Thus, there is sufficient time for Defendants
to obtain substitute counsel. 
As the MC-052 and MC-053 forms were not
provided with the MC-051 motion papers, the Court will continue the hearing on
the motion to January 19, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.., to be heard concurrently with the
motion to compel discovery/deposition.  By
the end of the business day on January 16, 2024, Counsel is ordered to file the
MC-052 and MC-053 forms to accompany the motion papers.  
Notice to be provided by Counsel.
