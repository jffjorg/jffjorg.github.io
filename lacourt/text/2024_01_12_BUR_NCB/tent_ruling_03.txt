[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to compel compliance on failure
  to produce documents    



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
            Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment
Bureau, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) alleges that it was assigned the debt of $313,014.75
for Policy No. 9254579-19 and the debt of $7,812.38 for Policy No. 9254579-20 from
its assignor, State Compensation Insurance Fund.  Plaintiff alleges that the due date for the
first policy was January 11, 2021 and the due date for the second policy was
July 6, 2021.  Plaintiff alleges that its
assignor and Defendants CNA Partners, Inc. aka CNA Partners Inc dba Property
Damages Specialists (“CNA Partners”), PDS Construction Inc aka Property Damage
Specialists aka Property Damages Specialist (“PDS”), and GLA Puroclean, Inc.
dba Puroclean dba Puroclean of North Hollywood (“Puroclean”) entered into a
written agreement wherein Plaintiff’s assignor agreed to provide policies of
workers compensation insurance to Defendants in the aforementioned two
policies.  Plaintiff alleges Defendants
breached the policies by failing to make the required payment of premiums
assessed after audit by Plaintiff’s assignor.   
            The first amended complaint (“FAC”),
filed May 15, 2023, alleges causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2)
open book account; (3) account stated; and (4) reasonable value. 
            On September 6, 2023, the default of
CNA Partners, Inc. aka CNA Partners Inc dba Property Damages Specialists was
entered.  
B.    
Motion on Calendar  
On November 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
motion to compel GLA Puroclean, Inc.’s compliance on failure to produce
documents in accordance with responses to Plaintiff’s first demand for
identification, production, inspection, and copying of documents and other
things (“DPD”).  Plaintiff also requests
sanctions in the amount of $2,072.27.  
On January 3, 2024, Puroclean filed an
untimely “Limited Non-Opposition” brief. 
On January 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
reply brief. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
CCP § 2031.320(a) states: “If a party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and
2031.280 thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling in accordance with that party's statement of compliance, the
demanding party
may move for an order compelling compliance.”  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff moves to compel
Puroclean’s compliance with Plaintiff’s DPD, set one.  Plaintiff states that it served the DPD on
Puroclean on August 28, 2023 and it received Puroclean’s written responses on September
28, 2023.  Plaintiff states, however,
that Puroclean failed to produce documentation in response to DPD Nos. 1-3,
5-9, 11-14, 16-18, 20-27, and 31 even though Puroclean responded that it would
produce documents.  (Mot., Ex. 2.)   Plaintiff
states that it gave Puroclean nearly a month to send the documents, it
attempted to meet and confer with defense counsel, and provided an
extension.  However, as of the date of
the filing of the motion, Puroclean has not provided responsive documents.  
            In its limited non-opposition brief,
Puroclean states that responsive documents have been produced and requests that
sanctions to Plaintiff be limited to 2 hours spent to prepare a 5-page
motion.  
            Based on
Puroclean’s responses to the DPD, it appears that Puroclean intended to provide
responsive documents but has failed to do so. 
As such, the motion to compel compliance is granted. 
            Plaintiff seeks $2,072.27 in
sanctions against Puroclean and its counsel of record.  The Court grants the request for sanctions in
the reasonable sum of $1,000 in attorney’s fees and $72.27 in filing fees for
this motion.  If there are further
discovery disputes between the parties, the Court may be inclined to consider
increased sanctions amounts.  
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
Plaintiff
Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc.’s motion to compel Defendant GLA Puroclean,
Inc. dba Puroclean dba Puroclean of North Hollywood’s compliance on failure to
produce documents in accordance with responses to Plaintiff’s first demand for
identification, production, inspection, and copying of documents and other
things is granted.  Defendant is ordered
to produce documents in response to Plaintiff’s DPD requests
within
20 days of notice of this order.  
Puroclean and its counsel of record, jointly and severally, are ordered to
pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,072.27 to Plaintiff, by and through
counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order. 
Plaintiff shall
provide notice of this order.
