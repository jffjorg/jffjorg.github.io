 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to compel discovery responses; requests for sanctions
 



 
On November 22,
2023, Plaintiffs Stephanie Herrera and Alejandro Herrera (“Plaintiffs”) filed a
single motion to compel initial responses from Defendant Carolyn Katz (“Defendant”)
for: (1) Special Interrogatories (“SROG”); and (2) Request for Production of
Documents (“RPD”).  
On August 18,
2023, Plaintiffs served on Defendant the discovery requests.  Plaintiffs state that their counsel made
several attempts to contact defense counsel for the responses.  As of the filing of the motion, Plaintiffs state
that they have not received responses from Defendant.  
Plaintiffs’ unopposed motions
to compel responses to the SROG and RPD are granted pursuant to CCP §§ 2030.290
and 2031.300.  Defendant is ordered to
provide verified responses to Plaintiffs’ discovery requests, without
objections, within 20 days of notice of this order.  
Plaintiffs request
sanctions against Defendant and her attorney in the amount of $2,936.50.  The request is granted in the reasonable sum
of $1,000 in attorney’s fees and $61.50 in filing fees.  Defendant and her counsel
of record, jointly and severally, are ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the
amount of $1,061.50 to Plaintiffs, by
and through counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order. 
Plaintiffs shall provide
notice of this order.
 
Warning regarding
electronic appearances:  All software for remote or electronic
appearances is subject to malfunction based on system weakness and human error,
which can originate from any of the multiple parties participating each
morning. The seamless operation of the Court’s electronic appearance software
is dependent on numerous inconstant and fluctuating factors that may impact
whether you, or other counsel or the Court itself can be heard in a particular
case. Not all these factors are within the control of the courtroom staff. For
example, at times, the system traps participants in electronic purgatories
where they cannot be heard and where the courtroom staff is not aware of their
presence. If you call the courtroom, please be respectful of the fact that a
court hearing is going on, and that the courtroom staff is doing their best to
use an imperfect system. If it is truly important to you to be heard, please
show up to the courtroom in the normal way. Parking is free or reasonable
in Burbank.
