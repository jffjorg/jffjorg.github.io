And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel initial responses from Defendant Carolyn Katz to Plaintiffs Stephanie Herrera and Alejandro Herrera's discovery requests. The Plaintiffs had served the requests on August 18, 2023, and had made several attempts to contact defense counsel for responses, but had not received any. The Court granted the motion, ordering Defendant to provide verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of notice. The Plaintiffs also requested sanctions against Defendant and her attorney in the amount of $2,936.50, which was reduced to $1,061.50. The Court granted the request for sanctions in the reasonable sum of $1,000 in attorney's fees and $61.50 in filing fees. The order also warns counsel about the potential for technical issues with electronic appearances.
