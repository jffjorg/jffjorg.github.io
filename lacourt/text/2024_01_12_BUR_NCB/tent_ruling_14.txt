[1] Plaintiff also
argues that the surveillance material are not privileged communications.
However, Defendant did not object based on the attorney-client privilege or
based on “privileged communications.”  
 


[2] In the Ward case, the U.S. District Court of
the E.D. of North Carolina stated: 
In the absence of any
ruling by the Fourth Circuit, and considering the split of other authority on
the subject, the undersigned again concludes that allowing discovery of
surveillance materials after the deposition of the plaintiff, but before trial,
best meets the ends of justice and the spirit of the discovery rules to avoid
surprise at trial. Defendant may insure the impeachment value of the
surveillance by taking a video deposition prior to disclosure of the
surveillance materials. In that deposition, defendant may carefully examine
plaintiff about his injuries and disabilities and even require him to
demonstrate alleged limitations of motions on videotape. Inconsistencies
between that deposition and the surveillance materials can be used to impeach the
plaintiff at trial.
(Ward, supra, 161 F.R.D. at
41.)
