The judge has denied Woeber's motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiffs, citing that efforts to comply with the discovery order were made and responses were eventually provided. However, the judge has granted Woeber's motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,060, which accounts for 10 hours of time to prepare the motion at $200/hour, plus $60 in filing fees. The judge has also denied Woeber's request for evidence sanctions against Plaintiffs.
