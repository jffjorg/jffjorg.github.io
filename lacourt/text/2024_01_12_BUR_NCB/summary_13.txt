Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Steven Alfaro's motion to compel Defendant Eric Peter Goldman to produce surveillance footage taken by Badcat Investigations. The footage was taken on June 13, 2022 and October 6, 2022, and Defendant objected to producing it based on qualified work product doctrine. Plaintiff argues that the footage is discoverable and relevant to the case, while Defendant argues that it should be protected until after Plaintiff's deposition. The Court finds that delaying disclosure of the footage until after deposition is prudent and balances the protection of work product with the production of relevant evidence prior to trial. The motion is denied without prejudice, subject to the completion of the deposition.
