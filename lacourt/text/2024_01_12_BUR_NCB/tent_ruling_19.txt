Handy
informs the Court that the Pote Action was filed first and then 3 other
overlapping PAGA-only actions against Handy were filed in Lagos v. Handy
Technologies (July 6, 2023, LASC Case No. 23STCV15644), Cali v. Handy
Technologies, Inc. (February 10, 2023, U.S. Dist. Court, Central District,
Case No. 8:23-cv-00755-CJC-KES), and the McKenzie Action (June 3,
2020).  (Nelson Decl., ¶10.)  Counsel Michael W. Nelson states that the
pending settlement in the Pote Action would release all PAGA claims
based on Plaintiff’s theory of alleged independent contractor misclassification
asserted in the Pote, Lagos, and Cali Actions, as well as
the McKenzie Action.   (Id.)
