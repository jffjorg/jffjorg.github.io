And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.'s motion to seal Exhibit J of the complaint, which contains proprietary trade secrets related to its relationship with its licensee. The court finds that there is an overriding interest to protect Warner Bros.' intellectual property and business relationships, and that the document should be sealed to prevent public disclosure. The court notes that there is no dispute at this point and that the sealing of the document is narrowly tailored to achieve the overriding interest. The judge orders the plaintiff to refile the initial complaint with the redacted Exhibit J, which will be deemed the operative complaint.
