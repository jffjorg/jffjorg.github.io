[1] The Court notes that NTS
argues that it need not be a “consumer” as strict products liability may extend
beyond immediate purchasers to reasonably foreseeable persons who were injured
by the defect.  (See Elmore v.
American Motors Corp. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 578, 586 [stating that strict
products liability not only extends to the consumer or user, but also to
reasonably foreseeable persons such as bystanders who may be injured by the
defect].) NTS also argues that sale of the product is not necessary for
imposing products liability; rather, as stated in Stein v. Southern Cal. Edison
Co. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 565, 571, the object must be placed on the market, knowing that it
is to be used without inspection for defects. 
The Court finds merit to these arguments that NTS need not be the
ultimate consumer or purchaser of the MAFFS part or that the MAFFS had to be
sold in order for UAC to be subject to strict products liability.  Nevertheless, there are still other issues
with the strict products liability cause of action as discussed in this order,
such that this cause of action is not adequately pled.
