And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of the disputed claim of minor LA, age 6. The court finds the settlement reasonable, but several deficiencies prevent the granting of the petition at this time. The deficiencies include the lack of an attorney declaration to support the fee request, the absence of medical records, and the lack of a reduction agreement for medical expenses from Beverly Hills Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery Institute. Additionally, there is no order to deposit the funds into a blocked account. As a result, the petition is continued. Counsel is ordered to file a declaration addressing the deficiencies and provide notice to the moving party. The next hearing will be scheduled for a later date.
