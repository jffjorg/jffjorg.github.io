And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to discovery requests, including special interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and form interrogatories. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, which waived any objections he may have had. The court also imposes $700.00 in monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and/or his counsel for the defendant's attorney's time spent preparing the motion and for travel to and attendance at the hearing. The court notes that the plaintiff failed to oppose the motion, and the defendant's request for $4,700.00 in monetary sanctions was not opposed.
