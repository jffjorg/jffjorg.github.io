Plaintiff  is ordered to provide verified, objection-free responses to the subject  discovery requests within 30 days. The Court imposes $700.00 in monetary  sanctions against Plaintiff and/or his counsel.   BACKGROUND   This is an employment action  brought by Plaintiff, who alleges that he was employed by Defendant “from April  18, 2002, until he was wrongfully denied a reasonable accommodation for his  disability when he was released from medical treatment by Dr. Frederic Nicola  with permanent restrictions limiting BEJAR from lifting over 30 pounds and no  repetitive use of the right upper extremity over shoulder greater than 30  pounds and not allowed to return to work on June 2, 2021.” (Compl. ¶ 3.)   On 3/11/24, Plaintiff filed his  complaint, alleging against Defendant the following causes of action: (1) Disability  Discrimination; (2) Failure to Prevent Discrimination; (3) Failure to Provide  Reasonable Accommodation; and (4) Failure to Engage in Interactive Process. On 4/11/24,  Defendant filed its answer.   On 4/15/24, Defendant served the  subject initial discovery requests on Plaintiff. (Decl. of Erin Cazares M.  Sanzo ¶ 2.) On 8/14/24, Defendant filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiff’s  responses thereto. No opposition has been filed to date. On 11/25/24, Defendant  filed a notice of Plaintiff’s non-opposition.   ANALYSIS   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to interrogatories if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd.  (b); 2030.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings  under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to a request for production of documents if the  responding party fails to serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ.  Proc. §§ 2031.300, subd. (b); 2031.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding  party who fails to serve a timely response “waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd.  (a).)   Here, as Defendant served the  subject discovery requests by mail and electronic service on Plaintiff on 4/15/24,  the last day for Plaintiff to respond was 5/20/24. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1013, subd. (a).) To  date, Plaintiff has not provided responses to the subject discovery requests. (Sanzo  Decl. ¶ 7.) As such, Plaintiff has waived any objections thereto.    The Court notes that Plaintiff has  failed to oppose the instant motion. Accordingly, the Court grants the instant  unopposed motion to compel Plaintiff’s verified, objection-free responses to  the subject discovery requests.    “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a [discovery] response … unless it finds that the  one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd. (c);  2031.300, subd. (c).)   Here, Defendant seeks to impose  $4,700.00 in monetary sanction against Plaintiff and/or his counsel,  encompassing: (1) 15 hours of Defendant’s attorney’s time spent preparing the  instant motion; (2) an anticipated 3 hours reviewing Plaintiff’s opposition and  preparing for the instant hearing; and (3) an anticipated 2 hours traveling to  and attending the instant hearing, at counsel’s hourly billing rate of $235.00.  (Sanzo Decl. ¶ 8.)   In granting the instant unopposed  motion, the Court finds it reasonable to impose $700.00 in monetary sanctions  against Plaintiff and/or is counsel.   CONCLUSION   The unopposed motion is granted. Plaintiff is ordered to  provide verified, objection-free responses to the subject discovery requests  within 30 days. The Court imposes $700.00 in monetary sanctions against  Plaintiff and/or his counsel.
