And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the defendant did not owe a duty to equip the trailer with a side underride guard at the time of manufacturing. The court found that side underride guards were not commercially available until 2017, and therefore it would have been impossible for the defendant to equip the trailer with such a guard in 2011. The court also found that the Rowland factors do not support the imposition of a duty on the defendant.
