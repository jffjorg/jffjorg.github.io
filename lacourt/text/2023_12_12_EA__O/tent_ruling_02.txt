[1] The first nine pages
of Plaintiff’s opposition were dedicated to causation and citation to various
evidence and case law when Defendant’s motion merely dedicated its final
paragraph to the issue of causation. Thus, as the Rowland factors was
clearly set forth as the second major argument in opposition (See Table of
Contents, Section E), Plaintiff had ample pages to address the legal argument. 
 


[2] Due to the numerous
filings in this case, the procedural history has been shortened.  
                        


[3] Utility is a
manufacturing company that makes made-to-order and semi-custom semi-trailer dry
van, flatbed, and refrigerated van trailers. On April 8, 2011, C.R. England
custom ordered from Utility the subject trailer known as a “reefer.” Utility
designed and manufactured the trailer based on C.R. England’s made-to-order
specifications. The subject vehicle at issue is a truck-trailer (Utility’s
trailer was attached to a 2011 Freightliner tractor, TAC ¶89:12-14.) 
 


[4] Plaintiff also
states in opposition that Defendant does not address “alternative theories of
liability” such as alter ego. For the sake of brevity, the court refers the
parties’ the court’s final ruling on the Access Defendants’ MSJ for the court’s
take on that argument, which, in short, is unavailing for purposes of denying
the motion. 
 


[5] The California Supreme Court in Barker
v. Lull Engineering (1978) 20 Cal.3d 413 laid out two alternatives but not
mutually exclusive tests to establish a design defect: (1) the “ordinary
consumer expectations test” and (2) the “risk benefit” test. The consumer
expectations test is reserved for cases in which expert testimony is not
necessary because the everyday experience of the product’s users permits a
conclusion that the product’s design violated minimum safety assumptions. (See
e.g., Campbell v. General Motors Corp. (1982) 32 Cal.3d 112 [jury could
employ its own sense of whether a bus’s lack of adequate number of grab bars
for persons to hold onto was defective]; see also Demara v. The Raymond
Corp. (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 545.soule) On the other hand, the “risk
benefit” test is appropriately invoked in cases involving automobiles because
an ordinary consumer does have an idea of how the vehicle should perform in all
foreseeable situations. (Soule, infra.) The
tests requires evaluation of the following factors: (1) the product's design by
considering the gravity of the danger posed by the design, (2) the likelihood
such danger would occur, (3) the feasibility of a safer alternative design, (4)
the financial cost of an improved design, and (5) the adverse consequences to
the consumer resulting from an alternative design. (Opp. p. 11, quoting Saller
v. Crown Cork & Seal Co., Inc. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1220, 1233.)
“[W]hatever the cause of an accident, a vehicle's producer is liable for
specific collision injuries that would not have occurred but for a
manufacturing or design defect in the vehicle.” (Soule v. General
Motors Corp. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 548, 560.) Here, the TAC’s 4th COA
for Products Liability/Strict Liability relies upon both the consumer
expectation test (TAC ¶169) and the risk benefit test instead (¶170), but
Plaintiffs’ opposition only focuses on the risk benefit test. 
 


[6] Plus, both parties’
citations largely do not address the risk-benefit test. 
 


[7] The failure to
discuss the risk-benefit test in its motion is not fatal as where liability
depends on the proof of design defect, no practical difference exists between
negligence and strict liability; the claims merge. (Lambert v. General
Motors (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1185; see also Opp. p. 12, citing Jimenez
v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1971) 4 Cal.3d 379, 387 [Theory of strict
liability in tort and negligence “parallel and supplement each other.”].) Thus,
addressing duty (i.e., as to negligence) tacitly addresses the strict products
liability COA. 


[8] In
reply, Defendant appears to argue that “[f]or all practical purposes, the
trailer in the present case was a stationary object, given that it was barely
moving.” (Reply p. 6, emphasis added.) Barely moving is still moving. 
 


[9] (See e.g., Opp. p.
4:23-24 [“Ponder notes that the side underride hazard has been part of the
patent and government literature since at least 1910.”], underline
original); see also Opp. p. 5:25-26 [“Paul Lewis is a biomechanical engineer
who has investigated over 4,900 cases and testified in at least 1200 times in
depositions and hundreds of time at trial in almost every state….”]); see also
Bloch Decl., p. 5, ¶11[Bloch explaining that he has testified as an expert in
truck underride cases in “various court trials across the U.S.”].) 


[10] Plaintiff in
opposition contends that reliance on Rivers is inappropriate because the
case involved Alabama law where contributory negligence is an absolute defense.
But Rivers applied Florida law in discussing strict liability and
Florida, like California, is a contributory negligent state. (Id. at p.
1530.)
 


[11] In Reply, Defendant cites to Rennert v. Great Dane
Ltd. P’ship, 543 F.3d 914, 918 (7th Cir. 2008) (citing 61 Fed. Reg. 2004,
2004 (1996) for its proposition that installing side underride guards is not
the equivalent of installing rear side underride guards because of the
potential additional safety problems with the former.  (Reply pp. 8-9.) But that case moreso dealt
with telescoping side guard, which doesn’t seem
to have been available even as of 2018. 
 


[12] EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTION: Plaintiff’s objections to these portions of the declarations
(objections No. 6 and 11) are OVERRULED as Plaintiff has not explained why both
need to have been involved with the development of the underride guards
to make their claims. 
 


[13] As with the Access
Defendants’ MSJ, Plaintiff’s opposition maintains a position that is not
supported by the evidence. (E.g., Access Defendants’ MSJ Plaintiff averred the
defendants knew of prior accidents whereas a review of the depositions showed
otherwise.) 
 


[14] Though there are
triable issues of material fact as to causation.
