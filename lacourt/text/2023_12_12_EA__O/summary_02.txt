And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment (MSJ) filed by the defendant, which argues that the trailer was not defective and that the accident was caused by other factors. The plaintiff's opposition to the MSJ argues that the trailer was designed with a defect and that the accident was caused by that defect.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's opposition focuses on the risk-benefit test, but fails to discuss the consumer expectation test. The judge also notes that the parties' citations do not address the risk-benefit test.

The judge finds that there are triable issues of material fact as to causation, and therefore denies the defendant's MSJ. The judge also overrules the plaintiff's objections to certain declarations and finds that the plaintiff's opposition maintains a position that is not supported by the evidence.
