On November 9, 2023, the following minute order was entered:
The Court reviews the written Stipulation Of The Parties To Take Mandatory
Settlement Conference Off Calendar signed by Plaintiff's Counsel on 11/07/2023
and by Defendants' Counsels on 11/08/20213 and filed 11/08/2023. The Court
approves the Stipulation.
 
 
Discussion
 
As to each Defendant, Defense Counsel Kevin T. Kay seeks to
be relieved as counsel because the clients have breached the terms of the
attorney-fee agreement by failing to honor the payment obligation under the fee
agreement. Counsel has made repeated requests that the client honor the terms
of the fee agreement, but the client has failed to comply. 
 
Here, the failure to make payments as required by a retainer
agreement is proper grounds to allow an attorney to withdraw as counsel in the
matter. Smith v. Superior Court (1968) 68 Cal.2d 547, 558. As for any
prejudice, the matter has settled, indicating little if any prejudice by
granting the motions.  Furthermore,
Defense Counsel has complied with all California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362
(filed MC-051, 052, and 053 forms) and has appropriately served Plaintiff and
Defendants. 
 
Therefore, absent defects, the court grants the motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Defense Counsel’s Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED, effective upon serving this court’s order relieving Counsel sent to
Plaintiff, Defendant, and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
