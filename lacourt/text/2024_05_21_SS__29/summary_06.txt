Here is the English text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Defendants. The Judge sustains the demurrer to the Eighth Cause of Action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that the conduct alleged by the Plaintiff is not outrageous enough to give rise to a cause of action. The Judge also sustains the demurrer to the Ninth Cause of Action for negligent infliction of emotional distress, finding that it is duplicative of the negligence cause of action. The Judge overrules the demurrer to the Eleventh Cause of Action for tort of another, finding that the attorney's fees incurred in defending against lawsuits caused by the Defendants' tortious conduct are compensable damages. The Judge grants Plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint within 14 days of notice.
