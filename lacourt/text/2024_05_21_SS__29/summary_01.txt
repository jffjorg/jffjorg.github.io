Here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to enforce the settlement agreement as moot, as the settlement agreement has been signed and payments have been made. The request for sanctions is also denied, as it appears that the delays were not the result of bad faith or improper conduct. The court notes that the request for sanctions was brought improperly with the motion to enforce settlement.
