And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge granted Liberty Mutual Insurance Company's motion for leave to intervene in the lawsuit brought by Jose Munoz against Pasy Wang, Rolan Hernandez, and others. The motion was granted because the insurance company has a valid basis to intervene to assert claims for subrogation as to the workers' compensation benefits paid to Munoz. The judge found that the insurance company's interest in the matter is direct and proper to be determined in the action.
