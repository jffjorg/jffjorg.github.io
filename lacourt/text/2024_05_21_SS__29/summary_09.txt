The tentative ruling by the judge grants the motion to set aside the dismissal of the case filed by Plaintiff Isabel Gonzalez. The judge finds that the dismissal occurred due to counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, as the counsel filed a request for dismissal for the wrong client due to multiple clients with similar names. The judge grants the motion and sets a hearing for the case to be re-entered or for a trial setting conference in approximately 30-45 days.
