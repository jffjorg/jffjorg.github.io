 Case Number:  22STCV01966    Hearing Date:   May 21, 2024    Dept:  29 Demurrer filed
by Defendants Wing Lai and Chi Man Wong.
 Tentative
The demurrer is sustained in part and
overruled in part.
Background
These two consolidated cases arise out of a fire that
occurred on October 28, 2020, on Pasadena Avenue in Los Angeles.
In the lead case, Case No. 22STCV01966, Plaintiff Tigran
Galstyan (“Galstyan”) filed a complaint on January 18, 2022, against Defendant Wing
Lai (“Lai”), and Does 1 through 25, alleging nine causes of action for: (1) Negligence,
(2) Trespass, (3) Private Nuisance, (4) Violation of Health and Safety Code
section 13007, (5) Negligent Misrepresentation, (6) Intentional
Misrepresentation, (7) Concealment, (8) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress, and (9) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress. According to the
complaint, a large fire originated on Lai’s property and spread to Galstyan’s
causing extensive damage, and then Lai made misrepresentations about the cause
and origin of the fire, causing Galstyan to suffer further damages and emotion
distress.
Lai filed her answer to the complaint on March 16, 2022.
In a separate case, Case No. 22STCV14996, Plaintiff
Allstate Insurance Company (“Allstate”) filed its complaint against Galstyan
and Does 1 through 20 on May 5, 2022, asserting three causes of action in
subrogation for: (1) Premises Liability, (2) General Negligence, and (3)
Trespass. In its complaint, Allstate alleges that it
insured Lai’s property; that Galstyan’s actions or inactions caused the fire
and resulting damage to Lai’s property; and that as a result Allstate suffered
a loss. Galstyan filed his answer on July 5, 2022.
The two cases were related on August 5, 2022, and
consolidated for all purposes on May 19, 2023.
On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to
name Chi Man Wong (“Wong”) as Doe 1.
On March 11, 2024, the Court granted in part, and denied
in part, Defendant Lai’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.  The Court granted Plaintiff leave to amend.
On March 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”).  In the FAC, Plaintiff
names as defendants Lai, Wong, Allstate, and Does 2 through 25,  Plaintiff alleges eleven causes of action:
(1) Negligence, (2) Trespass, (3) Private Nuisance, (4) Violation of Health and
Safety Code section 13007, (5) Promissory Estoppel/Fraud, (6) Negligent
Misrepresentation, (7) Concealment, (8) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress, (9) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, (10) Violation of
California Business and Professions Code section 17200, and (11) Tort of
Another.
On April 24, 2024, Defendants Lai and Wong (collectively,
“Defendants”) filed a demurrer. Plaintiff filed an opposition on May 8, along
with objections to some of Defendants’ evidence.  On May 14, Defendants filed a reply and a
response to the objections.
Legal
Standard
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the
function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and
for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are
assumed to be true. (Id.)  
A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116
Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co.
(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].)  
A demurrer can be utilized where the
“face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that
would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001)
94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of the complaint” includes
material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into
the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v.
Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and
accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the
pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]).  
A demurrer can be sustained only when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) 
"Before filing a demurrer
pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person
or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41(a).)
Evidentiary
Objections
Plaintiff
objects to paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Declaration of Defendants’ counsel Daniel
J. Sullivan and Exhibits B and C to his declaration.
The objections
are SUSTAINED.  In ruling on a demurrer,
the Court is limited to a review of the challenged pleading and judicially
noticeable matters.  The statements in
the declaration, and the attached exhibits, are not part of the FAC, and
Defendants do not contend that the statements or exhibits are a proper subject
of judicial notice.
Discussion
The meet and confer requirement of Code of
Civil Procedure section 430.41 is satisfied. (Sullivan Decl., ¶ 2.) 
Defendant Wong demurs to the entirety of the
FAC (as against him) based on the statute of limitations.
In addition, Defendants Lai and Wong together
demur to the sixth, eighth, ninth, and eleventh causes of action in the FAC. 
Wong’s Demurrer to Entire FAC –
Statute of Limitations
The fire underlying this litigation occurred on October
28, 2020.  (FAC, ¶ 1.)  The initial complaint was filed in January
2022 (less than two years later) against Lai and Does 1 through 25. 
On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff named Wong as Doe 1.  Wong claims that this was after the statute
of limitations on the claims against him (which are, he says, either two or
three years) had run.  (Demurrer, at pp.
10-11.)
As a general matter, however, for statute of limitations
purposes, the naming of a Doe defendant relates back to the filing of the
initial complaint.  Wong claims that the
relation back rule applies only when Plaintiff was genuinely ignorant of the
identity of the Doe defendant at the time the complaint is filed – and here,
Wong argues, Plaintiff knew of his identity years ago.  When Plaintiff learned the identity of Wong,
however, is a question of fact that cannot be resolved based on the four
corners of the pleading and judicially noticeable matters.  Wong may have a valid statute of limitations
defense, or he may not, but on this record the Court cannot adjudicate the
defense at the pleading stage.
Accordingly, Wong’s demurrer to the entire FAC on statute
of limitations grounds is overruled.
Sixth Cause of Action – Negligent Misrepresentation
The elements of negligent misrepresentation are: “(1) the
misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact, (2) without reasonable
ground for believing it to be true, (3) with intent to induce another's
reliance on the fact misrepresented, (4) justifiable reliance on the
misrepresentation, and (5) resulting damage.” 
(Apollo
Capital Fund LLC v. Roth Capital Partners, LLC (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 226, 243;
see also CACI No. 1903.)
Plaintiff alleges each of these elements in the FAC as against Lai with
sufficient particularity.  (FAC, ¶¶ 20-22,
26, 89, 95-102.)  Accordingly, Lai’s
demurrer to the Sixth Cause of Action is overruled.
Eighth Cause of
Action – Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
The elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”)
are: “(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of
causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional
distress; (2) the plaintiff suffered severe or extreme emotional distress; and
(3) the plaintiff's injuries were actually and proximately caused by the
defendant's outrageous conduct.” (Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050; see also, e.g., Cochran v. Cochran (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 488, 494;
CACI No. 1600.)  Conduct is “outrageous”
when it is “so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized
community.”  (Hughes, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 1051.)
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants made false statements to Plaintiff,
to Natalie Lee (one of their tenants), and Allstate about the cause and origin
of the fire.  (FAC, ¶¶ 111-116.)  These misrepresentations, Plaintiff alleges, caused
stress to him, and caused Ms. Lee and Allstate to sue him, causing further
distress.  (Id., ¶¶ 119-126.)  The distress associated with being lied to
about the cause of an accident, and the distress associated with defending
lawsuits (even when they are without merit), however, cannot be
recovered through a cause of action for IIED. 
Making a false statement about the cause of a fire to shift blame away
from oneself is morally blameworthy, but it is not so extreme or outrageous as
to give rise to an IIED claim. 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the Eighth Cause of Action is sustained
with leave to amend.
Ninth
Cause of Action – Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress
“The negligent causing of emotional distress is not an independent tort.
but the tort of negligence.”  (Burgess v. Super. Ct. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064, 1072;
see also, e.g., Levy v. Only Cremations for Pets, Inc. (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th 203, 218;
CACI No. 1620.)  As Plaintiff has
asserted a negligence cause of action in the FAC against Defendants (the First
Cause of Action), this purportedly separate cause of action for negligent
infliction of emotional distress is duplicative.
Accordingly, the demurrer to the Ninth Cause of Action is sustained without
leave to amend.
Eleventh
Cause of Action – Tort of Another
“A
person who through the tort of another has been required to act in the
protection of his interests by bringing or defending an action against a third
person is entitled to recover compensation for the reasonably necessary loss of
time, attorney's fees, and other expenditures thereby suffered or incurred.” (Prentice
v. North Am. Title Guaranty Corp., Alameda Division (1963) 59 Cal.2d 618,
620.) “In the usual case, the attorney's fees will have been incurred in
connection with a prior action; but there is no reason why recovery of such
fees should be denied simply because the two causes (the one against the third
person and the one against the party whose breach of duty made it necessary for
the plaintiff to sue the third person) are tried in the same court at the same
time.” (Id. at p. 621.)  The attorney’s fees incurred in
defending (for example) the suit that was brought by a third party as a result
of defendant’s tortious conduct are compensable damages under this theory of
recovery.  (E.g., Mai v. HKT Cal, Inc.
(2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 504, 512.) 
 
In
the FAC, Plaintiff alleges the elements of a cause of action to recover attorney’s
fees under the tort of another doctrine. 
Plaintiff alleges that the torts of Defendants caused others – Allstate and
Ms. Lee – to bring litigation against him. 
(FAC, ¶¶ 150, 152-156.)
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer to the Eleventh Cause of Action is overruled.
