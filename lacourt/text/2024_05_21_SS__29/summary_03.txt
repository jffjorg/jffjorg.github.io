And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge grants Defendant Michael Close, D.C.'s motion to compel Plaintiff Scott McKee's response to Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One). The judge orders Plaintiff to respond to these discovery requests within 21 days of notice. The judge denies Defendant's request for sanctions because Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion to compel.
