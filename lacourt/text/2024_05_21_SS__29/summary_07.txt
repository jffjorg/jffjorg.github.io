And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to continue the trial. The defendants, Emmanuel Dossetti and Kristin Dossetti, had argued that the trial should be continued due to unresolved discovery issues, including their need to schedule and obtain an expert's report. However, the court found that the defendants did not provide sufficient grounds for the continuance and that the motion to compel the physical examination of the plaintiff was denied on May 13. The court notes that the defendants did not provide another reason for the continuance in their motion.
