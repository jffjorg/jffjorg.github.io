  Case Number:  20VECV01343    Hearing Date:   June 28, 2024    Dept:  T JOHNSON V
FACECAKE 20VECV01343
Tentative
ruling: Motion to advance hearing on motion for terminating sanctions-DENIED.
Discovery
motions must be heard no later than 2 weeks before the trial date. The trial is
set July 23, 2024. Two weeks before trial is July 9, 2024.
Therefore, the motion should have been filed and electronically served no
later than June 11, 2024 for a hearing no later than July 9, 2024 (16 court
days plus 2 additional days for electronic service.)  Even if the court were to special set the
motion, the motion is untimely. 
Accordingly, the ex parte application is denied.
