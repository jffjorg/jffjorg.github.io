And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the complaint filed by Jane Doe K.G. and Jane Doe K.N. against John Roe N.L. The complaint alleged negligence, sexual assault/battery, sexual harassment, gender violence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge ruled that the claims are time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations and that the revival provision under Section 340.16(e) does not apply to Defendant NL because he is not an entity. The judge also noted that the revival provision is inapplicable to Defendant NL because he is not an entity and that the claims against him as an individual are not revived under Section 340.16(e). The judge granted Defendant NL's request for judicial notice and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
