  Case Number:  20STCV49246    Hearing Date:   September 13, 2024    Dept:  53 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – Central District Department  53         seran ng, d.m.d., inc.      ;         Plaintiff,     vs.     yang lu      , et al.;         Defendants.   Case    No.:   20STCV49246               Hearing    Date:   September     13, 2024               Time:          10:00 a.m.                 [tentative]    Order RE:   plaintiff’s motion to compel further    responses to special interrogatories, set 11, and request for monetary    sanctions        MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D.,  Inc.            RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Yang Lu Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set 11,  and Request for Monetary Sanctions The court  considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with  this motion.  EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS The court overrules plaintiff  Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s evidentiary objection, filed on September 6, 2024, to  the declaration of Susanna Chenette. DISCUSSION Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an  order (1) compelling defendant Yang Lu (“Defendant”) to serve further responses  to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set 11, numbers 138-142, and (2)  awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the  amount of $6,196.65. As a threshold matter, the court notes that Defendant has challenged  the meet and confer process in her opposition papers.  (Opp., pp. 1:2-3, 6:22-8:1.)  The court has reviewed the meet and confer  letter dated December 1, 2023, and finds that it shows “a reasonable and good  faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by [this]  motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040,  2030.300, subd. (b)(1); Chan Decl., Ex. C.)  The court therefore rules on the merits of  Plaintiff’s motion.             The court grants Plaintiff’s motion  to compel Defendant’s further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set 11, numbers  138-142 because Defendant’s objections to those interrogatories are without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3).)  The court notes that Defendant has objected to  these interrogatories on the ground that Plaintiff exceeded the limit of 35  interrogatories.  But (1) Plaintiff served  on Defendant a declaration that is in substantial compliance with section  2030.050, and (2) the court denied Defendant’s motion for a protective order on  June 28, 2024.  (Chan Decl., Ex. A, p. 5;  June 28, 2024 Order, p. 5:2.)  The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against  Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,  subd. (d).)  The court finds that $1,549.15  ((3.5 hours x $425 hourly rate) + $61.65 filing fee) is a reasonable amount of  sanctions to impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Chan Decl., ¶¶ 23-25.) The court denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.  (d).)   ORDER             The court grants plaintiff Seran Ng,  D.M.D., Inc.’s motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories,  set 11, and request for monetary sanctions as follows. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, the court orders  defendant Yang Lu to serve further, full and complete answers to plaintiff Seran  Ng, D.M.D., Inc.’s Special Interrogatories, Set 11, numbers 138-142, which  comply with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210-2030.250, within 20 days  of the date of this order.   The court orders defendant Yang Lu to pay monetary sanctions to  plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. in the amount of $1,549.15 within 30 days of  the date of this order.  The court orders plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. to give notice of  this ruling. IT IS SO ORDERED.   DATED:  September 13, 2024   _____________________________ Robert  B.
