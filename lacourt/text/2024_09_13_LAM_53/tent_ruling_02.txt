DISCUSSION
Brian Brumfield (“Defendant’s Counsel”) moves to be relieved as
counsel for defendant Ye a/k/a Kanye West (“Defendant”) in this action. 
“The question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to
withdraw as counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within
the sound discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal
might work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure
section 284, subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires
(1) a notice of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a
consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration,
and proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order
Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form
(MC-053)).¿¿¿ 
            The court finds that Defendant’s
Counsel has served (1) Defendant with the moving papers filed in connection
with this motion by mail at Defendant’s last known address, which Defendant’s
Counsel has confirmed within the past 30 days is current, (2) counsel for plaintiffs
Cecila Hailey, Chekarey Byers, and Timanii Meeks with the moving papers filed
in connection with this motion by mail, and (3) counsel for defendant Donda
Academy, Incorporated with the moving papers filed in connection with this
motion by mail.  (MC-052, ¶ 3, subds. (a)(2),
(b)(1)(b); Aug. 13, 2024 Proof of Service.) 
The court also finds that Defendant’s Counsel has shown sufficient
reasons why the motion should be granted, and why counsel has brought the
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2) instead of
filing a consent under section 284, subdivision (1).¿ (MC-052, ¶¿2.)¿¿
            The court therefore grants
Defendant’s Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant. 
            Brian Brumfield will be relieved as counsel
of record for defendant Ye a/k/a Kanye West effective upon the filing of the proof of
service of the signed “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel – Civil” on the client.¿¿
            The court orders Brian Brumfield to
give notice of this ruling and the
signed “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” to
defendant Ye a/k/a Kanye West and to all other parties who have appeared in
this action.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
