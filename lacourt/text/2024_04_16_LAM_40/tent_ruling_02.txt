Court
Order
 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Marcus Webster sues Defendants
the Regents of the University of California (the Regents)—as owner, operator,
and/or entity controlling medical clinics and hospitals that are part of the
UCLA health system, including the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center (UCLA
Reagan)—and Does 1 through 50 pursuant to a June 22, 2023 Second Amended
Complaint alleging claims of (1) Discrimination in Violation of the FEHA [Fair
Employment and Housing Act], (2) Retaliation in Violation of the FEHA, (3)
Harassment in Violation of the FEHA, (4) Failure to Take Steps to Prevent
Discrimination, and Harassment in Violation of FEHA, (5) Retaliation Under Cal.
Health & Safety Code § 1278.5, (6) Declaratory Relief, and (7) Retaliation
under Labor Code § 1102.5.
While the caption of the SAC names
a number of individuals as Defendants in this action—including Jasmine
Briones—the claims alleged in the SAC are only directed at the Regents and Does
1 through 50.
On July 21, 2023, the Regents filed
an Answer to the SAC.
B. Relevant
Procedural History
On June 20, 2023,
Plaintiff Webster’s counsel served the Regents with Requests for Production of
Documents (RPDs), Set Three, Nos. 40-57.
On August 11, 2023, the Regents
served responses to RPDs, Set Three, responding with objections alone to RPDs,
Set Three, Nos. 40-46 and 48-50. 
On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel served a meet and confer letter on the Regents’ counsel regarding the
deficiency of the Regents’ responses to RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 40-46 and 48-50.
On August 25, 2023, counsel for the
parties conferred by phone regarding the allegedly deficient responses,
subsequently continuing the meet and confer process via email. Plaintiff’s
counsel offered concessions relating to RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 40-46 and 48-50,
but the Regents stood by their objections. The parties nevertheless agreed to
an informal discovery conference (IDC) for October 20, 2023, and to a
continuance of the motion to compel further deadline to October 23, 2023, with
later agreements extending the motion to compel deadline to February 2, 2024.
On October 11, 2023, Plaintiff
Webster deposed Defendant Scott Karas.
On October 20, 2023, the Court held
the IDC between the parties, the result of which was a partial resolution on
motion to compel issues.
Between late-October and December
2023, counsel for the parties continued to meet and confer regarding RPDs, Set
Three, Nos. 40-46 and 48-50.
On December 6, 2023, the Regents
served supplemental responses to RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 40-46 (no responsive
documents exist or have ever existed) but failed to supplemental its responses
to RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 48-50.
Counsel for the parties
subsequently met and conferred regarding the Regents’ failure to supplement
responses to Request Nos. 48-50 and the sufficiency of the responses in
relation to Request Nos. 40-46.
On January 26, 2024, the Regents’
counsel informed Plaintiffs’ counsel that the Regents would not be
supplementing their responses or producing documents in relation to RPDs, Set
Three, Nos. 48-50 and that the supplemental responses to RPDs, Set Three, Nos.
40-46 were Code-compliant.
C. Motion Before the
Court
On February 2, 2024,
Plaintiff Webster filed a motion to compel further production from the Regents
in relation to RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 40-46 and 48-50.
On April 3, 2024, the
Regents filed an opposition to Plaintiff’s motion.
On April 5, 2024, the
Regents filed a supplemental declaration from counsel.
On April 9, 2024,
Plaintiff Webster filed a reply to the Regents’ opposition.
Plaintiff Webster’s
motion is now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Compel Further
Production and Request for Sanctions
A.
Request for Judicial Notice: GRANTED.
Per
Plaintiff Webster’s request, the Court takes judicial notice of the Complaint
and proof of service for the Complaint in this action. (Mot., RJN, p. 2, Ex. A;
Evid. Code, §§ 452, subd. (d), 453, subds. (a)-(b).)
B.
Further Production: DENIED.
1. Legal Standard
A
motion to compel a further response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory
answers or makes untenable objections to interrogatories, demands to produce,
or requests for admission. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)
To
request further production, a movant must establish: (1) good cause for the
production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra,
at p. 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a) the
responding party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is
incomplete Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding
party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate, complete, or
evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s
objection in the response is without merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to
the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the
movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good
cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)).
2. Analysis
a. RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 40-46
i. Plaintiff’s
Requests
RPDs, Set Three, No. 40: “All
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO the incident described in paragraph 6 of the declaration
Bates No. WEBSTER000126-WEBSTER000131 [a declaration by Siobhan Johnson
produced by Plaintiff to the Regents relating a complaint in an anonymous note to
Siobhan Johnson asking why Johnson was hiring so many Black individuals],
including Exhibit 1 referenced in that paragraph.”
RPDs, Set Three, No. 41: “All
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO any investigation by YOU into the incident described in
paragraph 6 of the declaration Bates No. WEBSTER000126-WEBSTER000131, including
Exhibit 1 referenced in that paragraph.”
RPDs, Set Three, No. 42: “All
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO any formal or informal complaints or reports to YOU by
Siobhan Johnson.”
RPDs, Set Three, No. 43: “All
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO YOUR RESPONSE or investigation to any formal or informal
complaints or reports to YOU by Siobhan Johnson.”
RPDs, Set Three, No. 44: “All
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO any formal or informal complaints or reports involving
Siobhan Johnson.”
RPDs, Set Three, No. 45: “All
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO YOUR RESPONSE or investigation to any formal or informal
complaints or reports involving Siobhan Johnson.”
RPDs, Set Three, No. 46: “All
COMMUNICATIONS between Siobhan Johnson and Scott Karas.”
(Mot., Kalinowski Decl., Ex. 1, pp. 3-4.)
ii. The
Regents’ Objections
The Regents state 13 general objections:
(1) Attorney-client and word product privileges; (2) undue burden in
expenditure of time and money to answer the request or locate responsive
documents or things; (3) overbreadth in time and scope; (4) vague, ambiguous,
uncertain, argumentative, unintelligible, and/or indefinite; (5) calls for
legal conclusion; (6) cumulative discovery; (7) not relevant or reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence; (8) lack of
foundation; (9) compound requests; (10) trade secret privilege; (11)
confidential and proprietary information; (12) request not reasonably
particularized in conformity with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.030,
subdivision (c)(1); and (13) right to privacy. (Mot., Kalinowski Decl., Ex. 2,
pp. 1-2.)
These objections are then raised in
the objection-only responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 40-46. (Mot., Kalinowski
Decl., Ex. 2, pp. 3-6.)
iii. Regents’
Supplemental Responses
The Regents supplemented these
objection-only responses on December 6, 2023, to add:
“Subject to the foregoing [initial]
objections, and limiting the request to” (1) “incidents involving a complaint
of discrimination, retaliation or harassment against African American or black
employees” (RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 40-41), (2) “complaints involving a complaint
of discrimination, retaliation or harassment against African American or black
employees” “by” or “involving” “Siobhan Johnson made to Employee Relations, the
Whistleblower Hotline, and the Staff Diversity & EEO Compliance Office from
January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2022” (RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 42-45), or (3) “communications
between Siobhan Johnson and Scott Karas involving a complaint of
discrimination, retaliation or harassment against African American or black
employees from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2022” (RPDs, Set Three, No.
46), “the University responds as follows: Upon conducting a diligent search and
reasonable inquiry, no responsive documents exist or have ever existed.” (Mot.,
Kalinowski Decl., Ex. 8, pp. 3-9.)
iv. Parties’
Arguments
In his moving papers, Plaintiff
Webster argues that RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 40-46 involve relevant discovery and
that the Regents’ initial objections to RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 40-46 are not
meritorious. Plaintiff Webster also argues that the Regents’ December 6, 2023,
representation that no documents could be located in response to these RPDs is
facially contradicted by testimony from University of California employees
describing responsive communications and documents by or involving Siobhan
Johnson. “Specifically,” argues Plaintiff, University of California (UC)
employee “testified that there are internal UC communications regarding Siobhan
Johnson related to escalating an anonymous note she received at work from an
employee that [Johnson] was hiring too many Black people at UC[,] which was
escalated to UC’s Staff Diversity & Compliance office ….” (Mot., pp. 7-9,
citing Mot., Kalinowski Decl., ¶¶ 10-11, Exs. 8, 12-13 [re: Dec. 6, 2023,
supplemental responses].)
In opposition as to the December 6,
2023, supplemental responses, the Regents argue that neither Jasmine Briones
nor Scott Karas identified communications that exist between Siobhan Johnson
and Mr. Karas regarding the anonymous note, and that the Regents provide
Code-compliant responses relating to the non-availability of responsive
documents. (Opp’n, pp. 7-8.)
In reply, Plaintiff Webster argues
that the Regents are withholding documents responsive to RPDs, Set One, Nos.
40-46. (Reply, pp. 3-6.)
v. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of the
Regents as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 40-46.
Plaintiff Webster requested
documents responsive to six specific subject matters within the context of a FEHA
race discrimination, retaliation, and harassment action. The Regents have
indicated the responsive documents cannot be located or have never existed. The
Regents’ discovery obligations are thus complete, and Plaintiff’s contention as
discussed in the Reply that the Regents are in fact lying—essentially
committing perjury—in providing verified supplemental responses attesting to a
lack of responsive documents appears based, for example, on deposition
testimony that says the incident (which Regents does not define as a Complaint)
was reported to various persons – but does not say whether in writing or orally.
Generally, when a party states they have produced all responsive documents in
their possession, custody or control, the requesting party is limited to a remedy
of exclusion – not a court order telling the responding party to produce a
document they contend they do not have.
Moreover, the Court determines that
the Regents reasonably qualified their December 6, 2023, supplemental responses
to the subject matter of each request: (1) “incidents involving a complaint of
discrimination, retaliation or harassment against African American or black
employees” (RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 40-41), (2) “complaints involving a complaint
of discrimination, retaliation or harassment against African American or black
employees” “by” or “involving” “Siobhan Johnson made to Employee Relations, the
Whistleblower Hotline, and the Staff Diversity & EEO Compliance Office from
January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2022” (RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 42-45), or (3)
“communications between Siobhan Johnson and Scott Karas involving a complaint
of discrimination, retaliation or harassment against African American or black
employees from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2022” (RPDs, Set Three, No.
46). (Mot., Kalinowski Decl.,
Ex. 8, pp. 3-9; cf. Mot., Kalinowski Decl., Ex. 1, pp. 3-4.)
If the Regents later seek to
introduce or otherwise rely on new evidence responsive RPDs, Set One, Nos.
40-46, in a motion, at trial, or in some other fashion, Plaintiff Webster may
raise a judicial estoppel, impeachment, or a similar argument or objection at
that time. For discovery purposes, however, the Regents’ obligations relating
to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 40-46 appear complete.
Plaintiff’s motion is thus DENIED
as to compelling further responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 40-46.
b. RPDs,
Set Three, Nos. 48-50
i. Plaintiff’s
Requests
RPDs, Set Three, No. 48: “The call
out records for YOUR employees who were managed by WEBSTER from 2020 to present.”
RPDs, Set Three, No. 49: “The
attendance records for YOUR employees who were managed by WEBSTER during the
time that WEBSTER was employed by YOU.”
RPDs, Set Three, No. 50: “Any and
all disciplinary records and associated documents for YOUR employees who were
managed by WEBSTER from 2020 to present including but not limited to the
following documents: coaching sessions, memorandums to employees, write-ups,
notices to dismiss, and termination.”
(Mot., Kalinowski Decl., Ex. 1, p. 4.)
ii. The
Regents’ Objections
The Regents state 13 general objections:
(1) Attorney-client and word product privileges; (2) undue burden in
expenditure of time and money to answer the request or locate responsive
documents or things; (3) overbreadth in time and scope; (4) vague, ambiguous,
uncertain, argumentative, unintelligible, and/or indefinite; (5) calls for
legal conclusion; (6) cumulative discovery; (7) not relevant or reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence; (8) lack of
foundation; (9) compound requests; (10) trade secret privilege; (11)
confidential and proprietary information; (12) request not reasonably
particularized in conformity with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.030,
subdivision (c)(1); and (13) right to privacy. (Mot., Kalinowski Decl., Ex. 2,
pp. 1-2.)
These objections are then raised in
the objection-only responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 48-50. (Mot., Kalinowski
Decl., Ex. 2, pp. 6-7.)
Unlike with RPDs, Set Three, Nos.
40-46, the Regents have refused to supplement their initial, objection-only
responses to RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 48-50.
iii. Parties’
Arguments
In his motion, Plaintiff Webster
argues that discovery relating to RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 48-50 is relevant to
proving up Plaintiff Webster’s Health and Safety Code and Labor Code
retaliation claims by showing that Plaintiff Webster made protected complaints
regarding employees calling out sick without sufficient notice, which affected
patient safety. (Mot., pp. 6-7.)
In opposition, the Regents raise
the privacy rights of nearly 90 employees and unnamed patients whose rights may
be implicated by Plaintiff Webster’s production requests, as well as the
overbreadth and the resulting burden of those requests. The Regents add that
the requested information is not relevant to whether Plaintiff made reports of
conduct endangering patient safety in good faith. The Regents last argue that
the sought-after discovery can be obtained through less intrusive means, such
as to propound interrogatories as to the employees that Plaintiff Webster
reported for excessive absences, only three of which are identified in the
pleadings at paragraphs 18 to 26. (Opp’n, pp. 11-14.)
In reply, Plaintiff Webster argues
that “[i]nformation responsive to these RFPs may lead to admissible evidence
that UC had an ongoing problem with employees calling out of work, which
Webster reported during his employment to his supervisor and, moreover, that it
was affecting patient safety.” This, in turn, could “validate one of Webster’s
reports of patient safety made during his employment in support of his Health
and Safety Code §§ 1278.6 and Labor Code § 1102.5 causes of action.” (Reply, p.
6.)
iv. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of the
Regents as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 48-50.
Plaintiffs’ requests are overbroad.
As phrased, RPDs, Set Three, Nos. 48-49 conceivably relate to all individuals
supervised by Plaintiff Webster, not just employees with prolonged periods of
absence that support the retaliation claims in the SAC. Request No. 50 requests
all disciplinary documents relating to Plaintiff Webster’s former supervisees,
failing to limit itself to disciplinary documents for supervisees disciplined
based on excessive absences. The requests are also burdensome as many of the
documents are in paper copies only.
And while the meet and confer
evidence attached to the moving papers shows that Plaintiff offered to modify
Requests 48-50 by limiting their scope to 2022, with production to be made
under a protective order or subject to redactions that protect third-party
information (Mot., Kalinowski Decl., Ex. 4, pp. 15-16), those modifications do
not save the overbreadth in scope of the requests.
Moreover, the Court determines that
the sought-after information can be secured through less obtrusive means, such
as limiting the production requests to specific employees explicitly identified
by the discovery request, or through interrogatories establishing whether, on
or at a reasonable time after Plaintiff’s termination, the University of
California received complaints regarding, disciplined, or terminated any
employees previously under the supervision of Plaintiff Webster based on
excessive absences, or other targeted interrogatories such as the number of absences
each day in a given timeframe, as a few examples.
Plaintiff’s motion is thus DENIED
as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 48-50.
C. Request for Sanctions: DENIED.
1. Legal
Standard
Except in certain circumstances
involving electronic stored information, the court must impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(h).)
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
2. Analysis
Having denied Plaintiff’s motion,
the Court also DENIES Plaintiff’s sanctions request.
The Court also DENIES the sanctions
requested by the Regents in their opposition because Plaintiff had valid
concerns relating to evidence in bringing this motion, i.e., concerns as to
whether the Regents have been forthcoming as to evidence relating to RPDs, Set
Three, Nos. 40-46, and concerns as to finding evidence supporting Plaintiff’s
retaliation claims. 
III. Conclusion
A. Plaintiff Marcus Webster
Plaintiff Marcus Webster’s Motion
to Compel Further Responses and Document Production to Requests for Production
of Documents and Request for Sanctions is DENIED.
B. Defendant The Regents of the
University of California
Defendant The Regents of the
University of California’s Opposition Request for Sanctions is DENIED.
