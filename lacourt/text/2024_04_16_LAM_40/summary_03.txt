And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike punitive damages allegations and prayers from the complaint. The defendants, St. Mark's Fifth Street Partners and SRHT Property Management Company, had filed the motion, and the plaintiffs had filed an opposition. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleges the knowing and willful failure to correct defective conditions on the premises. The judge has also noted that the complaint's allegations of the defendants' failure to remedy untenantable conditions after notice from tenants and county housing authorities imply the approval or ratification of the wrongful conduct by a decisionmaker at the defendants.
