And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and document production to Requests for Production of Documents and request for sanctions against the Regents. The Plaintiff, Marcus Webster, alleges that the Regents have failed to provide responsive documents and has brought a motion to compel further production and request sanctions.

The Court has denied the Plaintiff's motion as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 40-46, finding that the Regents have indicated that no responsive documents exist or have ever existed. The Court has also denied the Plaintiff's motion as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 48-50, finding that the requests are overbroad and burdensome.

The Court has denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Regents, finding that the Plaintiff had valid concerns relating to evidence in bringing the motion. The Court has also denied the Regents' request for sanctions against the Plaintiff, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations of retaliation and harassment have not been proven.

The Court has scheduled a hearing to consider the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and document production to Requests for Production of Documents and request for sanctions against the Regents.
