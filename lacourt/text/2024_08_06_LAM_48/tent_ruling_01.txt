  CASE NO.: 21STCV47587
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
August 6, 2024



 
Rachel
P. Howard, counsel of record for Defendant Tom Harrison, seeks to be relieved as
counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that
Defendant has not performed an obligation contained in the relevant engagement
agreement with counsel.  No party opposed
the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
substantially complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  This action is stayed pending arbitration, and
there is no prejudice to Defendant.
The
proposed order does not include Defendant’s current or last known address and
telephone number.  Without this
information, the Court will deny the motion. 
If counsel files an amended and complete proposed order before the
hearing, the Court will grant the motion, effective upon filing a proof of service
showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Tom Harrison and
all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
