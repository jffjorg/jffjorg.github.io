And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to deny the motion filed by counsel Rachel P. Howard to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Tom Harrison. The motion was unopposed, and the judge noted that counsel's declaration stated that Defendant has not performed an obligation contained in the engagement agreement. The judge cited People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406, which states that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. However, the judge denied the motion because the proposed order did not include Defendant's current or last known address and telephone number. The judge ordered that if counsel files an amended and complete proposed order before the hearing, the motion will be granted, effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the signed order on all parties.
