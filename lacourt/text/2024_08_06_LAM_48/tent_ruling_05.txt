[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR ORDER
  APPROVING SETTLEMENT AND DETERMINATION OF GOOD FAITH
 
Dept. 48

August 6, 2024



 
In
2014, Ad Leverage provided marketing and advertising services for the Sage Receivership
Entities.  (See Moldo Decl. ¶¶ 3, 7, fn. 1.)  On September 28, 2017, Ad Leverage filed a complaint
against the Receivership Entities (Case No. BC677615).  (Moldo Decl. ¶ 4.)
On
January 22, 2018, Ad Leverage filed a claim in the Receivership Estate for $4,187.008.66,
and on May 29, 2018, Ad Leverage amended the claim to increase the amount to $4,319,266.55.  (Moldo Decl. ¶ 5.)
On
October 6, 2021, Ad Leverage amended its complaint in Case No. BC677615 and reduced
its alleged damages against the Receivership Estate to $2,704.980.60.
A
settlement was eventually reached between Ad Leverage and Sage Receivership Entities.  On July 8, 2024, the Receiver filed a motion for
an order approving the settlement and for a determination of a good faith settlement.  No oppositions were filed.
A.        The Court Approves the Settlement. 
The
settlement is intended to resolve all matters between the parties that arise out
of or are in any way connected with the action. 
(See Moldo Decl., Ex. B [“Settlement Agreement”] at pp. 4-5, ¶ 3.)  The settlement includes a waiver of claims under
Civil Code section 1542.  (Settlement Agreement
at p. 5, ¶ 4.)  The Court will retain jurisdiction
under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. 
(Settlement Agreement at p. 9, ¶ 21.)
The
sum of $1,547,253.10 is “intended to equal the amounts billed by Ad Leverage that
were not billed to the Receivership Entities by any other company, whether directly
or as a third-party collector.”  (Moldo Decl.
¶ 18(d).)  Ad Leverage will also obtain a
waiver/release of claim submitted on behalf of KRRL-KYSR (approximately $848,500.00)
on the official Receivership Waiver of Claim form.  (Moldo Decl. ¶ 8(e).)  The settlement sum is significantly less than
Ad Leverage’s claim against the Receivership Estate.  (Moldo Decl. ¶ 9(b).)  The Receiver believes that the settlement’s “benefits
outweigh the risks of proceeding with the Ad Leverage Litigation, that the Settlement
is fair and reasonable, [and] is in the best interests of the Receivership Estate.”  (Moldo Decl. ¶ 9.)  The Court agrees.
The
Court finds that the settlement is reasonable for the Receivership Estate.  Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
B.        The Settlement Was Made in Good Faith.
Any
party to an action with two or more joint tortfeasors may petition the court for
a determination of the issue of the good faith of a settlement.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(1).)  The court’s approval of the settlement furthers
two sometimes-competing policies: (1) the equitable sharing of costs among the parties
at fault, and (2) the encouragement of settlements.  (Erreca’s v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th
1475, 1487.)  To demonstrate a lack of good
faith, a non-settling party must show that the settlement is so far “out of the
ballpark” as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives of Section 877.6.  (Nutrition Now, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 209, 213.)  The Court
will typically consider: (1) the plaintiff’s (roughly) approximated total recovery;
(2) the settlor’s share of liability; (3) the size of the settlement at issue; (4)
the distribution of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs; (5) the usual discount
value when plaintiffs settle before trial; the settlor’s financial condition and
insurance policy limits; and (6) whether there is evidence of “collusion, fraud,
or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants.”  (Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates
(1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499.)  These factors
will be evaluated accordingly to what information is available at the time of settlement.  (Ibid.)  “When no one objects, the barebones motion which
sets forth the ground for good faith, accompanied by a declaration which sets forth
a brief background of the case is sufficient” for the Court to grant a motion for
determination of good faith settlement.  (City
of Grand Terrace, supra, 192 Cal.App.3d at p. 1261.)
The
motion and Receiver’s declaration set out the background of this case and the terms
of the settlement.  The Sage Receivership
Defendants shall pay Ad Leverage $1,547,253.10. 
(Moldo Decl. ¶ 8.)  This amount is
significantly
less than Ad Leverage’s alleged claim against the Receivership Estate, which totals,
at minimum, $2,704.980.60 plus at least $1,834,000.00 in prejudgment interest.  (Moldo Decl. ¶ 9.)  This settlement was reached through counsel’s
continued negotiations after an unsuccessful mediation on April 14, 2024.  (Moldo Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.)  There is no evidence of collusion or fraud in
the settlement.
Based
on the record presented and the lack of any objection, the Court GRANTS the motion
and finds this settlement was made in good faith.
Receiver
to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
