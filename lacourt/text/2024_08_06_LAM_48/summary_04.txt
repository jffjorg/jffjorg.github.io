And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling denying the application of Constantine Z. Pamphilis to be admitted pro hac vice to represent Petitioner Joseph Gatt in this action. The application was incomplete, as it did not include the applicant's residence address, and the applicant has appeared pro hac vice in six other California actions within the past two years. The Court cannot find that counsel is not regularly engaged in substantial business, professional, or other activities in California, and therefore denied the application without prejudice.
