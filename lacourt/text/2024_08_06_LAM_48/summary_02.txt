Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for summary adjudication on the grounds that there are triable issues of fact regarding who the parties are to each of the agreements and what agreements were reached. The defendants argue that they are not parties to the Collaboration Agreement, but the agreement does not explicitly define the parties and the signature block lists the defendants' names under "Family Living Avenue 53 LLC" and other individuals under "COHAUS LLC". The court finds that the defendants have not met their initial burden of showing that they owe no obligations to the plaintiff and that there are triable issues of fact regarding the parties' understanding and state of mind.
