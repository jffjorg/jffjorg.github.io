Norfleet
Transportation, et al. v. Trident Industry Inc., 23STCV20972

Tentative decision on application
for right to attach order: mostly granted




 



 
Plaintiff Norfleet Transportation and Logistics LLC (“Norfleet”)
applies for right to attach order against Defendant Trident Industry Inc. (“Trident”).

The court has read and considered the moving papers and opposition
(no reply was filed), and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Complaint
Plaintiff Norfleet filed the Complaint against Defendant
Trident on August 30, 2023, alleging causes of action for: (1) goods and
services sold and delivered; (2) account stated; (3) open book account; (4)
breach of contract – Uniform Commercial Code. 
The Complaint alleges in pertinent part as follows.
Defendant Trident became indebted to Plaintiff Norfleet in
the sum of $300,999.31 within the last four years for goods and services
rendered.  Compl., ¶8.  Defendant Trident agreed to pay the sum of
$300,999.31 and, although Norfleet has demanded payment, Trident has not paid these
monies.  Compl., ¶¶ 8-9.  
The terms which governed the sale of these goods and
services by Norfleet are indicated on each invoice submitted to Trident.  Compl., ¶18, Ex. 1.  The last page of the invoices specifies the
additional terms of purchase which formed the basis for the terms of sale
pursuant to the Commercial Code.  Compl.,
¶18.  
Norfleet has performed all the conditions, promises, and
covenants on its part to be performed in accordance with the terms of the
parties Agreement or has been excused from full performance by the acts of
Trident.  Compl., ¶19.  On or about June 30, 2022, Defendant
defaulted in their payments under the agreement.  Compl., ¶20. 
The agreement provides that Trident will pay all costs and
disbursements including reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by Norfleet.  Compl., ¶21. 
Plaintiff Norfleet seeks (1) the sum of $300,999.31 plus
interest at the maximum rate from June 30, 2022, (2) all costs and reasonable
attorney’s fees, and (3) other and further relief as the court deems just and
proper. 
 
2.  Course of
Proceedings 
On November 16, 2023, Defendant Trident filed its Answer. 
Plaintiff Norfleet initially applied for a right to attach
order for a hearing on July 23, 2024.  Although
the court’s tentative ruling was to grant, it had not seen the timely filed
opposition.  Plaintiff Norfleet failed to
appear at the hearing and the application was taken off calendar.
On August 1, 2024, Plaintiff Norfleet again filed its
application for a right to attach order with a hearing on the instant date.  Trident has opposed but no reply has been
filed.
 
B. Applicable Law
Attachment is a
prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the defendant’s
assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the outcome of the
trial of the action.  See Whitehouse
v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et seq.)
that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v. Appellate
Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536.  See
Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1108,
1115.  As the attachment statutes are
purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner, (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 879, 882.
A writ of attachment
may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which
is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the
claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred
dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the
amount due may be clearly ascertained from the contract and calculated by
evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v.
Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41
(attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for lease of
commercial equipment).
All property within
California of a corporation, association, or partnership is subject to attachment
if there is a method of levy for the property. 
CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a
trustee is a natural person, a trust is not. 
Therefore, a trust’s property is subject to attachment on the same basis
as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison,
Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197
Cal.App.3d at 4.
The plaintiff may
apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the order and
serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the application,
and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
The notice of the
application and the application may be made on Judicial Council forms (Optional
Forms AT-105, 115).  The application must
be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented
would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.  CCP §484.030.  
Where the defendant
is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  Where the defendant is a
partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to “all property
of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to
attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010”
is sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  A specific description of property is not
required for corporations and partnerships as they generally have no exempt
property.  Bank of America v. Salinas
Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
A defendant who
opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of opposition and
supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not later than five
court days prior to the date set for hearing. 
CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of
opposition may be made on a Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155).  
The plaintiff may
file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for the
hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
At the hearing, the
court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right to attach order
and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is exempt from
attachment.  The defendant may appear the
hearing.  CCP §484.050(h).  The court generally will evaluate the
attachment application based solely on the pleadings and supporting affidavits
without taking additional evidence.  Bank
of America, supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at 273.  A verified complaint may be used in lieu of
or in addition to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts.  CCP §482.040. 
The plaintiff has the burden of proof, and the court is not required to
accept as true any affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See Bank of America, supra, at
271, 273.
The court may issue
a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff shows all of
the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is one on which
an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the plaintiff has established
the probable validity of the claim (CCP §484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is
sought for no purpose other than the recovery on the subject claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater
than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
A claim has
“probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will
recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan
Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does not determine whether the
claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not
affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
Except in unlawful
detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the sum of (1)
the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff, and (2)
any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and any allowable
attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110. 
CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak Construction, (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must
be reduced by the sum of (1) the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has
in a money judgment against plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a
cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown would be subject to attachment
against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any security interest held by the
plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together with the amount by which the
acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the security interest) have
decreased that security interest’s value. 
CCP §483.015(b); see also CCP §483.010(b) (“an attachment may not be
issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property arising
from agreement, statute, or other rule of law…However, an attachment may be
issued where the claim was originally so secured but, without any act of the
plaintiff or the person to whom the security was given, the security has become
valueless or has decreased in value to less than the amount then owing on the
claim).  A defendant claiming that the
amount to be secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative
defense must make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an
attachment against the plaintiff.
Before the issuance
of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an undertaking to
pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful
attachment by the plaintiff in the action. 
CCP §489.210.  The undertaking
ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If
the defendant objects, the court may increase the amount of undertaking to the
amount determined as the probable recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP §489.220. 
The court also has inherent authority to increase the amount of the
undertaking sua sponte.  North
Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
C. Statement of Facts
Plaintiff Norfleet
is in the business of providing freight forwarding services to its customers.  Jackson Decl., ¶5.  When a customer needs to move product from
one location to another location, it will contact Norfleet by phone or email,
or both, to request a quote for hiring a freight transportation company to
transport its product.  Jackson Decl.,
¶5.  Once an inquiry is made, the
customer will send Norfleet the necessary information for Norfleet to
communicate and retain an available transportation provider in a position to
meet the requirements requested by the customer.  Jackson Decl., ¶6. 
The transportation
provider then picks up the product and delivers it to the location as
directed.  Jackson Decl., ¶7.  Typically, these are called “loads.”  Jackson Decl., ¶7.  The transportation company sends invoices to
Norfleet for the services rendered, and Norfleet sends its own invoices to the
customer for payment.  Jackson Decl.,
¶7.  The charges for the cost of
transportation are based upon the wait-time that drivers have to spend to pick up
and offload the loads as required by the customer.  Jackson Decl., ¶7.  The customer is aware of the various charges
associated with the process and agrees to pay the charges Norfleet incurs in
providing the services requested.  Jackson
Decl., ¶7.
The invoices sent to
the customers of Norfleet require timely payment for the services rendered, and
among other things, indicate the consequences that will arise from non-payment,
including attorney fees should legal assistance be required in effectuating
payment.  Jackson Decl., ¶8. 
Defendant Trident
was a customer of Norfleet, requested the services described above, and
followed the procedure for Norfleet to arrange the pickup and delivery of
loads.  Jackson Decl., ¶9.  Most of the loads to be picked up were
arriving from overseas with delivery to the Long Beach Harbor.  Jackson Decl., ¶9.  Trident paid in accordance with the invoices provided
for the initial services by Norfleet. 
Jackson Decl., ¶10.
On or about June 5,
2022, Defendant Trident requested various loads to be picked up primarily from
Long Beach Harbor and delivered to various locations.  Jackson Decl., ¶11.  Quotes were sent as to what the associated
cost would be for the services requested. 
Jackson Decl., ¶11.   Samples of quotes
made to Trident for requested services are attached as Exhibit 1.  Jackson Decl., ¶11.  After approval of the cost of services was received,
Norfleet made arrangements with the available carriers to pick up the requested
loads and deliver them as requested. 
Jackson Decl., ¶11.  Once Norfleet
received notice and billings from the carriers used to transport Trident’s
loads, it submitted invoices to Trident for the services provided.  Jackson Decl., ¶12,  Attached as Exhibit 2 are copies of the
invoices submitted to Trident for payment. 
Jackson Decl., ¶12.  Attached as
Exhibit 3 are aging statements reflecting a summary of all invoices submitted
to Trident for services rendered.  
Jackson Decl., ¶12.
Between June 1, 2022
and March 2, 2023, Norfleet provided services to Trident and submitted invoices
totaling in excess of the sum of $300,99.31. 
Jackson Decl., ¶13.  The terms and
conditions were, in part, described on each of the invoices and the backup
which was provided to Trident after the services were provided.  Jackson Decl., ¶13.  Each of the invoices included additional
terms of purchase, which formed the basis for providing the services as set
forth in the Commercial Code.  Jackson
Decl., ¶13.  Trident agreed to pay for
the services provided by Norfleet.  Jackson
Decl., ¶13.  The Agreement provides for
reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in this action.  Jackson Decl., ¶14.
On June 30, 2022,
Trident defaulted under the terms of the Agreement.  Jackson Decl., ¶14.  Trident claims that there are reasons why it
has not paid for the services provided but has failed to provide any evidence
to support this claim.  Jackson Decl.,
¶15.  
Despite demand,
Trident has refused to pay the sums due, and the principal sum of $300,999.31
plus interest, fees, and costs is now due and owing.  Jackson Decl., ¶16.  The transaction described herein are
commercial in nature and do not involve any consumer issues.  Jackson Decl., ¶17.  Norfleet requests a right to attach order for
the principal sum of $300,999.31 at an interest rate of 18% per annum for
$101,531.60, fees in the sum of $17,500.00, and costs in the sum of $1,000.00
for a total amount of $421,031.91. 
Jackson Decl., ¶18, Ex. 4. 
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff Norfleet applies
for a right to attach order against Defendant Trident in the amount of $421,031.91.

 
1. A Claim Based
on a Contract and Which Attachment May Be Based 
A writ of attachment
may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which
is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the
claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five
hundred dollars ($500).  CCP
§483.010(a).  A claim is “readily
ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained by reference to the
contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be reasonable and
definite.¿ CIT, supra, 115 Cal.App.4th at 540-41.  The fact that the damages are unliquidated is
not determinative.¿ Id.¿ But the contract must furnish a standard by
which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.¿ Id. (citations omitted).¿ 
Norfleet’s claim is
based on a partly oral, partly written agreement involving quotations and
invoices.  This is a contract claim on
which attachment may be based.
 
2. An Amount Due
That is Fixed and Readily Ascertainable 
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained
by reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT, supra,
115 Cal.App.4th at 540-41.  The fact
that the damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  Id. 
But the contract must furnish a standard by which the amount may be
ascertained and there must be a basis by which the damages ca be determined by
proof.  Id. (citations omitted).
Norfleet presents evidence that between June 1, 2022 and March 2, 2023, Norfleet provided services to
Trident and submitted invoices totaling in excess of the sum of
$300,99.31.  Jackson Decl., ¶13.  The terms and conditions were, in part,
described on each of the invoices and the backup which was provided to Trident
after the services were provided. 
Jackson Decl., ¶13.  Each of the
invoices included additional terms of purchase, which formed the basis for
providing the services as set forth in the Commercial Code.  Jackson Decl., ¶13.  Trident agreed to pay for the services
provided by Norfleet.  Jackson Decl.,
¶13.  
Trident’s opposition
argues that Norfleet’s claim is not readily ascertainable because Norfleet has
not submitted a spreadsheet summarizing the invoices and even admits that the
invoices provided are “samples”.  There
is no showing that Trident agreed to them or reflect Trident’s offset for
damages from Norfleet’s withholding of Trident’s property.  Opp. at 3.
Trident is incorrect
that the invoices in Exhibit 2 are samples. 
Rather, they are all the invoices submitted by Norfleet to Trident.  Jackson Decl., ¶12.   It is the quotations to Trident for
requested services in Exhibit 1 that are samples.  Jackson Decl., ¶11.  Norfleet is not required to attach each
quotation for each invoice in order to show the amount that is readily
ascertainable.  The submission of
invoices to Trident as part of the parties’ course of dealing, and to which
Trident did not object, is a sufficient basis to show their agreement and also
is circumstantial evidence that the requested services were performed.  
Of course, some of
the invoices were paid.  Exhibit 3 lists
the outstanding amount owed, apparently organized by delivery location of the
loads.  While this exhibit could have
been better organized or explained, it is a sufficient basis for the amount
readily ascertainable from the parties’ agreement.  The invoices and Exhibit 3 furnish a
standard by which the amount owed may be ascertained.  CIT, supra, 115 Cal.App.4th at
540-41.  
Finally, a defendant may raise a claim of offset for any
indebtedness of the plaintiff to the defendant raised in a cross-complaint or
affirmative defense in an answer.  CCP
§483.015(b)(2), (3).  The defendant’s
offset claim under CCP section 483.015(b)(2) or (3) must be supported by
sufficient evidence to prove a prima facie case of attachment in its own
right. Lydig Construction, Inc. v. Martinez Steel, (2015) 234
Cal.App.4th 937; Pos-A-Traction, Inc. v. Kelly Springfield, (C.D. Cal.
1999) 112 F.Supp.2d 1178, 1183.  Trident
has failed to provide any evidence supporting its claim that it sustained
damage from Norfleet withholding its property.
Norfleet seeks interest
at 18%, attorney fees, and costs, contending that Trident owes $101,531.60 in
interest, $17,500 in estimated fees, and $1000 in costs.   The Agreement provides for reasonable
attorney fees to the prevailing party in this action.  Jackson Decl., ¶14.  The attorney fees and costs are not supported
by an attorney declaration.  The
requested interest is not supported by any document or calculation from the
date each of the invoices became overdue. 
As such, they are disallowed.
The amount owed of
$300,999.31 is readily ascertainable from the contract.  
 
3. Probable
Validity of Breach of Contract Claim 
A claim has
“probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will
recover on that claim.  CCP
§481.190.  In determining this issue, the
court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective
parties.  Kemp, supra, 146
Cal.App.4th at 1484.  The court does not
determine whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made
at trial and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b). 
The facts above show
a reasonable probability of success.
 
3. Attachment
Sought for a Proper Purpose  
Attachment must not
be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which
attachment is based.¿ CCP §484.090(a)(3). 

 
E. Conclusion
Plaintiff Norfleet’s
application for a right to attach order against Defendant Trident is granted in
the amount of $300,999.31.
