And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to stay the proceedings pending the resolution of the appeal in the underlying action will be continued until August 23, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. The judge agrees with the defendants that the demurrer to the complaint should be resolved before the motion to stay, as it may resolve the need for a stay. The judge notes that the demurrer argues that the plaintiffs' claims are time-barred under California Code of Civil Procedure section 340.6, and that the outcome of the appeal has no bearing on this issue. The judge concludes that resolving the statute of limitations issue at the outset is important for promoting stability and security in human affairs, and that it would be impractical and inefficient to defer a determination on this issue to a later proceeding.
