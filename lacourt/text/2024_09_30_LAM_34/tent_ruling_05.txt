ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof,
but this time limitation shall not apply to motions specified in subdivision
(e).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1).)
 
“The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper: 
 
“(a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper
matter inserted in any pleading. 
 
“(b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court.”
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 436.)
 
“The grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on the face
of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to
take judicial notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437, subd. (a).)
 
“A notice of motion to strike a
portion of a pleading must quote in full the portions sought to be stricken
except where the motion is to strike an entire paragraph, cause of action,
count, or defense. Specifications in a notice must be numbered consecutively.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322(a).)
 
II.       Discussion
 
Defendants Aaron Merriman and LMDG move the
Court to strike from the Complaint Plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages and
all references to the same. (Motion to Strike, p. 8:15–16.) Defendants argue:
(1) that Plaintiffs have not pleaded malice, oppression, or fraud in the
relevant causes of action; and (2) and that good cause therefore exists to strike
the request for punitive damages. (Id. at pp. 2:7–9, 4:1–4, 5:11–13,
6:11–12, 7:1–3, 7:16–18.)
 
The Court disagrees with this argument. 
 
Plaintiffs repeatedly include descriptive and
explicit allegations of malice, oppression, and fraud in their pleading.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 44–48, 64, 71, 84, 91, 101, 115, 148, 152.) It is not
irrelevant, false, or improper to make such allegations in a pleading. It will
ultimately be Plaintiffs’ burden to prove that they are entitled to the relief
that they seek. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion to Strike is
DENIED.
