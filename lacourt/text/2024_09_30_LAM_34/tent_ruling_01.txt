Choice v. Kamerron Easton, et al. (21STCV27900) 
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Kameron Easton’s Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories Set No. 1 from
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant, Family Choice Private Duty Agency, Inc. and
Cross-Defendant Shellydale Princess Gray is TAKEN OFF CALENDAR. 
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Family Choice Private Duty Agency, Inc.
(“FCPDA”) alleges as follows:
On October 15, 2019,
Marilyn Ashby (“Decedent”) entered into an agreement with FCPDA where FCPDA
would provide in-home care services to Decedent who had been diagnosed with
terminal cancer.  
FCPDA provided its
services from October 2019 through Decedent’s death on February 14, 2020. At
the time of Decedent’s death, there was an outstanding balance for FCPDA’s
services of $84,348.00. 
On March 16, 2020, FCPDA entered
into an agreement with Decedent’s older brother, James P. Ashby (“Ashby”), to
provide him transportation and grocery services. Ashby has not paid and refuses
to pay for any of FCPDA’s services which total $38,516.01. FCPDA contends that
Ashby believed that Decedent and/or her estate would cover his outstanding invoices.

On June 2, 2020, Kamerron
Easton (“Easton”) filed a petition for administration of Decedent’s estate.
FCPDA filed its creditor’s claim in Decedent’s estate on July 1, 2020. Easton
was appointed personal representative of Decedent’s estate on April 16, 2021. 
On June 7, 2021, Easton
served a rejection of FCPDA’s creditor’s claim since Easton claims that there
is not enough funds to pay for the claim. 
On July 28, 2021, FCPDA filed its Complaint
against Easton and Ashby on causes of action for: 
1.    
      Breach
of Contract;
2.    
      Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing; 
3.    
      Common
Count for Goods and Services; and 
4.    
      Common
Count for Open Book Account. 
On October 15, 2021, Easton, who is an attorney
litigating in propria persona, filed his Cross-Complaint against FCPDA
and Shellydale Princess Gray (“Gray”).
On October 22, 2021, Easton filed his Answer to
the Complaint.
On February 8, 2022, the Court sustained in part
FCPDA and Gray’s Demurrer to the Cross-Complaint. Specifically, the Court
sustained the Demurrer to the first and sixth causes of action in the
Cross-Complaint, for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing and
intentional infliction of emotional distress, respectively.
On March 10, 2022, FCPDA and Gray filed their
Answer to the Cross-Complaint.
On May 6, 2022, FCPDA and Gray filed their Amended
Answer to the Cross-Complaint.
On October 7, 2022, Ashby filed his Answer to the
Complaint.
On January 2, 2024, by request of FCPDA, the
Clerk’s Office dismissed with prejudice Ashby from the Complaint.
On August 26, 2024, Easton filed this Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set No.1 from FCPDA and
Gray. On September 16, 2024, counsel for FCPDA and Grey filed his declaration
in response to all pending discovery and motions to compel. Additionally, FCPDA
and Grey filed verified reposes to form and special interrogatories and request
for production of documents. 
As of September 23, 2024, no additional documents
pertaining to this Motion have been received.
LEGAL
STANDARD
On receipt of a response to form interrogatories,
special interrogatories, and/or demand requests, the propounding and/or
demanding party “may move for an order compelling further response” if: (1) the
response is evasive or incomplete; (2) the representation of inability to
comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) the objection is without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a), 2031.310, subd.
(a).)
The moving party must demonstrate a “reasonable
and good faith attempt” at an informal resolution of each issue presented.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2033.290, subd. (b)(1).) “In lieu of a separate
statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the
moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each
response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b)(2).)
Notice of the motion must be provided “within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or any specific later date to which the requesting party and the
responding party have agreed in writing . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(c).) The responding party has the burden of
justifying the objections to the requests. (Coy v. Superior Court (1962) 58
Cal.2d 210, 220-221.)
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . .
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd.
(d).)
DISCUSSION
 
The Court
has not received any additional documents in opposition of Easton’s Motion as
of September 23, 2024. Any motions to compel further responses require
additional meet and confer between the parties before a hearing on the motion. As
such, Easton’s Motion will be taken off calendar and parties will receive
further instructions at the scheduled hearing for this Motion on Monday
September 30, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. in Department 34 (Stanley Mosk Courthouse). 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Kameron Easton’s Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories Set No. 1 from
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant, Family Choice Private Duty Agency, Inc. and
Cross-Defendant Shellydale Princess Gray is TAKEN OFF CALENDAR.
