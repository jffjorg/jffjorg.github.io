And here is the summary in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling is that the Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiffs' Complaint is DENIED. The Motion was filed by Defendant Aaron Merriman and LMDG Real Estate Value Fund II Holdings, LLC, seeking to strike Plaintiffs' request for punitive damages and all references to the same. The Court disagrees with the argument that Plaintiffs have not pleaded malice, oppression, or fraud in the relevant causes of action, and that good cause exists to strike the request for punitive damages. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have repeatedly included descriptive and explicit allegations of malice, oppression, and fraud in their pleading, and that it is not irrelevant, false, or improper to make such allegations. Ultimately, it will be Plaintiffs' burden to prove that they are entitled to the relief that they seek.
