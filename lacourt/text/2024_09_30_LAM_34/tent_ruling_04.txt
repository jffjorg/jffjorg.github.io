Brown v. Does 1-20 (24STCV05561) 
 
Plaintiff Jeffrey Brown’s Motion for Limited-Expedited
Discovery is GRANTED. Plaintiff may serve or conduct discovery against
Charter Communications to obtain necessary information, but only to the extent
necessary to identify and locate Doe Defendants.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Jeffrey
Brown (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows: 
 
On March 10, 2021, Plaintiff’s LastPass account associated with
jeffdbrown@hotmail.com experienced unauthorized access and password changes. As
a result, Plaintiff was concern over the security of his personal information. 
 
On December 1, 2023, additional unauthorized activities were uncovered on
Plaintiff’s ADT alarm system account which involves the security of two
properties. On January 2024, Plaintiff discovered a data breach associated with
Plaintiff’s email account wendy@wendybrown.net.
 
Plaintiff also investigated financial irregularities linked to
Plaintiff’s USAA accounts which included fraudulent charges and unauthorized transactions
between February 1, 2023 and March 30, 2023. Additionally, on May 22, 2021,
there was an unauthorized hotel charge on Plaintiff’s USAA account. 
 
Moreover, there has been indications of data breaches on Plaintiff’s
iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud accounts which leads Plaintiff to believe that
his email account under mynameiswendygbrown@icloud.com has also been
compromised. 
 
Plaintiff has reported and obtained photo evidence of drone surveillance
over his residence. 
 
Plaintiff requires the need for further investigation of third-party
service providers to identify and locate Defendants Does 1-20 (“Doe Defendants”).

 
On August 20, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel issued a deposition subpoena for
production of business records to Charter Communications to obtain information
that would help identify Doe Defendants. 
 
On August 26, 2024, Charter Communications submitted its response and
requested a court order. As a result, Plaintiff filed this Motion, and requests
leave to engage in limited-expedited discovery. 
 
On March 6, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a complaint asserting the following causes of action against Doe
Defendants:
 
1.           Fraud;
2.           Invasion of Privacy;
3.           Conversion; 
4.           Unauthorized Access to Computers in
Violation of California Penal Code § 502; and 
5.           Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. 
 
No Doe amendments
have been filed and no Doe Defendants have appeared yet.
 
On August 29, 2024,
Plaintiff filed this Motion for Limited-Expedited Discovery. As of September
20, 2024, no opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Discovery against non-parties is
generally governed by Code of Civil Procedure sections 2020.010 et seq. 
“[D]iscovery may be obtained from a nonparty only through a ‘deposition
subpoena.’” (Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader¿(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 123,
127.)¿“The Civil Discovery Act . . . authorizes a nonparty’s ‘oral deposition,’
‘written deposition,’ and ‘deposition for [the] production of business
records.’ (Ibid.)¿¿  
 
There is a general discovery provisions
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.210, which apply to all discovery by
deposition, including business records subpoenas to nonparties.  (Cal.
Shellfish v. United Shellfish Co.¿(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 16, 25 [“We
conclude that the deposition hold in section 2025, subdivision (b)(2) does
apply to a deposition subpoena seeking business records”]; see also O'Grady
v. Superior Court (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1423, 1454 [“Not having yet named
any defendant, and a fortiori having served none, Apple needed leave of court
before it could propound discovery from petitioners or anyone else”].) 
 
A plaintiff generally may serve
deposition notices without leave of court 20 days after the “service of the
summons on, or appearance by, any defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.210,
subd. (b).)¿ However, a plaintiff may serve a deposition notice
before the expiration of the 20-day hold set forth in subdivision (b) of
section 2025.210 of the Code of Civil Procedure upon a showing of good cause. (Ibid.)
“[G]ood cause which must be shown should be such that will satisfy an impartial
tribunal that the request may be granted without abuse of the inherent rights
of the adversary.” (Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Ct. In & For Merced
Cnty. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 388, superseded by statute on other grounds in Coito
v. Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th 480.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
The Court
finds Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for obtaining leave to serve
discovery on Charter Communications. Plaintiff has outlined how he has been
injured by Doe Defendants. (Compl., ¶¶ 9-23.) Additionally, Plaintiff has
carried out investigation that make it clear that Plaintiff needs information
to identify and locate the Doe Defendants in this action and that Charter
Communications has at least some of that information. (Motion, 4:7-14, 7:12-19,
Exh. A.)
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion, but only to the extent
necessary for Plaintiff to identify and locate Doe Defendants. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Jeffrey Brown’s Motion for Limited-Expedited
Discovery is GRANTED. Plaintiff may serve or conduct discovery against Charter
Communications to obtain necessary information, but only to the extent
necessary to identify and locate Doe Defendants.
