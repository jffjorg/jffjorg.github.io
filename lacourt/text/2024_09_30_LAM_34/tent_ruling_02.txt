Plaintiff Fernando Carmona’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees is GRANTED in part. Fees and costs are AWARDED in favor of Plaintiff and
against Defendants, jointly and severally, in the total amount of $67,461.92.
This amount is comprised of $60,500.00 in attorney’s fees and $6,961.92 in
costs and expenses.
 
Background
On June 1, 2022, Plaintiff Fernando Carmona (“Plaintiff”)
filed his Complaint against Defendants FCA US, LLC and Arm and J Corporation on
causes of action arising from Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“Defendants”).
On May 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed: (1) Notice of
Acceptance of Defendant FCA US LLC’s (“FCA”) Amended Offer to Compromise (“998
Offer”); and (2) Judicial Council Form CM-200, Notice of Settlement of Entire
Case.
On September 14, 2023, the court entered the
Parties’ Stipulation and Order Requesting the Court Retain Jurisdiction
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 644.6.
On September 15, 2023, the court dismissed with
prejudice the Complaint. By this time, no motion for attorney’s fees had been
heard, despite prior orders of the Court requiring that such a motion be heard
by the time of dismissal.
On November 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion for
Relief Pursuant to CCP Section 473(b) which was denied by the court on December
11, 2023. 
On July 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed his Motion for
Attorney’s Fees. On July 24, 2024, FCA filed their opposition to Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees. On July 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed his reply to FCA’s
opposition.
Legal Standard
“Except as otherwise expressly provided by
statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs
in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).)
Attorneys’ fees are allowed as costs when
authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10)(B).)
Pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act, a prevailing buyer “shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of
the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,
including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the
court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the
commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).) They have
“the burden of showing that the fees incurred were reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount.” (Robertson v.
Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785,
817.) In granting their motion, “[a] trial court may not rubber stamp a request
for attorney fees, but must determine the number of hours reasonably expended.”
(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 38, quoting Donahue
v. Donahue (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259, 271.) “If the time expended or the
monetary charge being made for the time expended are not reasonable under all
the circumstances, then the court must take this into account and award
attorney fees in a lesser amount.” (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America
(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)
Evidentiary Objections
 
Plaintiff’s evidentiary objection is SUSTAINED.
 
Discussion
 
1.              
The Parties’ Arguments 
 
Plaintiff
moves the court to award him $98,078.92, which is comprised of $72,630.00 in
attorney’s fees actually incurred lodestar attorney time billed, $6,961.92 in
advanced incurred out of pockets costs and expenses associated with litigation,
$14,526.00 in a lodestar multiplier of 0.2 to be added to the lodestar as a
“multiplier”, and $3,961.00 in an allowance of an additional six hours total
associated with this Motion through hearing. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, ii:5-19.)
 
Plaintiff
argues that FCA’s 998 Offer stipulates that Defendants jointly and severally
will pay the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees
based on actual time expended pursuant to Civil Code section 1794(d). (Motion
for Attorney’s Fees, 2:20-24.) Plaintiff further argues that the fees and costs
requested by his Motion were reasonably incurred as they are (1) not excessive
or unreasonable considering the case history, and (2) were necessary considering
Defendants’ delays and refusal to honor their obligations. (Id., 3:19-22.)
 
 
In
opposition, FCA concedes that Plaintiff is entitled to his legal fees, but
argues that, by statute, only reasonably incurred attorneys’ fees are
recoverable in an action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Act. (Opp., 2:9-24.)
FCA argues that Plaintiff’s counsel improperly or excessively billed and used
highly inflated hourly rates which support significant reductions to Plaintiff’s
request. (Ibid.)      
 
In reply, Plaintiff
reiterates his arguments that Plaintiff’s counsel’s time incurred was reasonable
and necessary, argues that the hourly rates are reasonable, and that the
lodestar is deserving of a multiplier. (Rep., 2:13-15, 3:7-8, 3:20.)
Additionally, Plaintiff argues that FCA fails to rebut Plaintiff’s argument by
showing the contrary. (Ibid.) 
 
2.              
Authority for Fees & Prevailing Party
 
a.              
Legal Standard 
 
Civil Code section 1794(d) provides that a buyer who
prevails in an action under that section, “shall be allowed by the court to
recover as a part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs
and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended,
determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in
connection with the commencement and the prosecution of such action.”
 
b.              
Discussion 
 
On September 15, 2023, the Court dismissed with prejudice Plaintiff’s
Complaint pursuant to the FCA’s 998 Offer. (Minute Order dated September 15,
2023.) 
 
Plaintiff is the prevailing party and is entitled to
attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to the 998 Offer. (Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, i:22-27.) Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to
recover his attorney’s fees and costs.
 
3.              
Method of Calculation for Fees 
 
Plaintiff
argues that the lodestar adjustment method should be used to calculate
attorney’s fees. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, 13:10-12.)
 
FCA does not dispute this or propose a different method. 
 
The court uses the lodestar adjustment method to calculate
fees. 
 
4.              
Reasonableness of the Fees Claimed
 
a.              
Reasonableness of the Hourly Rates
 
                                                      
i.                   
Legal Standard 
 
“The courts
repeatedly have stated that the trial court is in the best position to value
the services rendered by the attorneys in his or her courtroom, and this
includes the determination of the hourly rate that will be used in the lodestar
calculus. In making its calculation, the court may rely on its own knowledge
and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and
reputation of the attorney requesting fees, the difficulty or complexity of the
litigation to which that skill was applied, and affidavits from other attorneys
regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate determinations in other
cases.” (569 East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.
(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437, citations omitted.)

Discussion 
 
Counsel for Plaintiff
claim the following hourly rates: (1) $500.00 per hour for Counsel Adam Zolonz
until 2022 and $600.00 per hour thereafter; (2) $450.00 per hour for Counsel
Stephen Parnell until 2022 and $550 per hour thereafter; (3) $450.00 per hour for
Counsel Lisa Ziperman; (4) $150.00 per hour for staff
time and Paralegal Sherri Rangel until 2023 and $200.00 for Paralegal Sherri
Rangel thereafter; (5) $550.00 per hour for Counsel Nicholas Bravo in 2020 and
2021; $600.00 for 2022; $625 for 2023, and $650.00 per hour for 2024. (Decl.
Zolonz, ¶¶ 9-14, Decl. Bravo, ¶ 3.)
 
In
opposition, FCA argues that the Court should adopt the analysis in Arias v.
Ford Motor Co., No. (2020) WL 1940843 where the court used the 2018 Real
Rate Report: The Industry’s Leading Analysis of Law Firm Rates, Trends, and
Practices (“Real Rate Report”) to determine the proper rate to be used in
calculation of attorney fees. (Opp., 4:13-17.) FCA argues that using the 2021
Real Rate Report, partner rates should be capped at $443.00 per hour and
associate rates at $308.00 per hour. (Id., 4:18-24.)  As such, Counsel Adam Zolonz would be
entitled to $9,391.60 for 21.2 hours and Counsel Stephen Parnell would be
entitled to $31,169.60 for 101.2 hours. (Ibid.) FCA argues that $150.00
per hour is the more reasonable rate by the California court for paralegal
services which would amount to $4,620.00 for Paralegal Sherri Rangel’s 30.80
hours of services. (Ibid.) FCA argues that the Law Offices of Adam
Zolonz, APC would be entitled to a total of $45,181.20 (Id., 4:25-27.)  FCA also argues that Counsel Nicholas Bravo’s
rate should be reduced to $443.00 per hour for a total of $2,658.00 for six
undisputed hours billed in connection with this Motion. (Id.,
5:1-4.)  
 
In reply,
Plaintiff argues that FCA’s deduction of Plaintiff’s counsels’ hourly rate is
unfounded since FCA does not criticizes counsels’ experience. (Rep., 3:9-19.)
Plaintiff also argues that FCA’s use of the 2021 Real Rate Report is inadmissible
and arbitrarily imposes rates. (Ibid.) Plaintiff argues that other
courts have deemed Plaintiff’s counsels’ rates reasonable, including this same
Court. (Ibid.)
 
After considering the
information provided, the court finds that the appropriate hourly rate for (1)
Counsel Adam Zolonz is $550/hr, (2) Counsel Stephen Parnell is $450/hr, and (3)
Counsel Nicholas Bravo is $550/hr. The court has no information concerning
Counsel Lisa Ziperman other than an hourly rate. Furthermore, the court finds that attorney’s fees should not
be awarded for services provided by Paralegal Sherri Rangel. (Roe v. Halbig
(2018) 29 Cal.App.th 286, 312.) 
 
b.              
Reasonableness of the Number of Hours
 
                                                      
i.                   
Legal Standard 
 
“Under the
lodestar adjustment methodology, the trial court must initially determine the
actual time expended and then ascertain whether under all the circumstances¿of
the case the amount of actual time expended and the monetary charge being made
for the time expended are reasonable. Factors to be considered include, but are
not limited to, the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the attorney
skill exhibited and the results achieved. The prevailing party and fee
applicant bears the burden of showing that the fees incurred were reasonably
necessary to¿the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount. It
follows that if the prevailing party fails to meet this burden, and the court
finds the time expended or amount charged is not reasonable under the
circumstances, then the court must take this into account and award attorney
fees in a lesser amount.” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am., LLC (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 240, 247 [cleaned up].) 
 
                                               
ii.     Discussion

 
Counsel for
Plaintiff claim that the following hours were incurred: (1) 21.20 total hours
for Counsel Adam Zolonz; (2) 101.20 total hours for Counsel Stephen Parnell;
(3) 6 total hours for Counsel Nicholas Bravo. (Decl. Zolonz, ¶ 49 and Exh. B,
p. 34; Decl. Bravo, ¶ 32.)
 
In
opposition, FCA argues that the number of hours spent are unreasonable due to excessive
billing and ambiguous description of activities billed. (Opp., 5:18-21.) In his
opposition, FCA highlights multiple entries found in exhibit B[1]
of Plaintiff’s Motion arguing that they should be reduced by at least 35% meaning
a reduction of 20.16 hours of work billed by Plaintiff’s counsel. (Id.,
5:21-28, 6:1-28, 7:1-11.)  
 
In reply, Plaintiff
argues that the number of hours incurred were reasonable as the billing records
of Plaintiff’s counsel showcase the involving and disputed nature of the
litigation. (Rep., 2:16-19.) Additionally, Plaintiff argues that the billing
statements provided are not required in order to make a request for attorney’s
fees and when provided they should be given credence absent any clear
indication that the records are erroneous which FCA failed to show in their
opposition. (Rep., 2:19-28.)  
 
In this
case, the declarations and billing records provided by Plaintiff’s counsel are
sufficient to meet the burden of proving the reasonableness of the claimed fees
in terms of amounts and tasks. To satisfy this burden, evidence and
descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling
the court to evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys
spent on specific claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended. (Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
 
The court
finds Plaintiff’s fee recovery is based on 128.40 hours. The fees incurred are
reasonable, as captured in the billing records submitted to this Court. (Decl.
Zolonz, ¶ 49 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing records reflect the
actual time and descriptions of services performed in connection with
litigating this case. Although the submission of such detailed time records is
not necessary under California law, if submitted, such records “are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 396.)
 
FCA’s
objections to Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing entries are not sufficient to meet
their burden to challenge Plaintiff’s fee request. Most of the objections are
mere references to the billing entries without an explanation of what is being
actually disputed by FCA. Others only state that the billing is excessive but
give no authority to support that argument. Additionally, FCA does not
challenge the number of hours billed and anticipated to be billed in connection
with the Motion by Counsel Nicholas Bravo. (Opp., 5:1-4.)  
 
Accordingly,
the court grants Plaintiff’s requested attorneys’ fees in the reduced amount of
$60,500.00 for 128.40 hours billed, and $1,350.00 [3 hours at $450/hr] in an
allowance of an additional three hours total associated with this Motion
through hearing. A total of $61,850.00. 
 
c.              
Reasonableness of Multiplier 
 
                                                      
i.                   
Legal Standard 
 
Relevant factors to determine whether an enhancement is
appropriate include (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved,
(2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature
of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)
 
The contingent risks, preclusion of other work, skill, and
difficulty counsel assert are absorbed by counsel’s hourly rates. (Robertson
v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785,
822.)
 
                                                    
ii.                   
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff
argues that Plaintiff’s counsel took this case on a contingency basis, advanced
all costs and expenses on behalf of Plaintiff, and assumed the full risk of
loss of the expenses paid. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, 10:10-12.) As such,
Plaintiff argues that attorneys who take matters on a contingency basis must
receive a higher compensation that those who do not due to the risk involved. (Id.,
10:16-23.) Plaintiff argues that his request for an additional 0.2 lodestar
multiplier (total of 1.2X multiplier) is warranted due to the length of the
case, the result obtained, and to deter a seller or manufacturer from refusing
to provide consumers who are entitled a refund or replacement in hopes that
they will not persist a claim. (Id., 17:1-9, 18:1-4.)
 
In
opposition, FCA argues that this multiplier adjustment is unwarranted since
this case did not present any complex or novel issues and Plaintiff’s counsel knew
the procedural and substantive standard involved from experience. (Opp., 7:13-16.)
FCA argues that the contingency risks assumed by Plaintiff’s counsel are
already perfectly balanced by their hourly rate. (Id., 7:23-28.)
 
The court
denies Plaintiff’s request for a 0.2 lodestar multiplier. Given the routine
work done in this case and the results obtained in this lemon law area, a
multiplier is not appropriate. Any contingency risk factor is already accounted
for in the hourly rates, which the Court has found to be reasonable. 
 
5.              
Reasonableness of the Costs Claimed 
 
Plaintiff
lists $6,961.92 in costs and expenses as seen evidenced in exhibit B of their
Motion. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Exh. B, pp. 32-34.) 
 
FCA does not
seem to dispute these costs and expenses in their opposition. 
 
The court notes that as a prevailing party,
Plaintiff can obtain costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032,
subdivision (b).
 
Accordingly,
the Court finds that all of these costs
are reasonable and allowable under at least one of the cost statutes. The Court
will award all $6,961.92 in
these costs and expenses.  
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in part. Fees and costs are AWARDED in favor of Plaintiff
and against Defendants, jointly and severally, in the reduced amount of $68,811.92.
This amount is comprised of $61,850.00 in attorney’s fees and $6,961.92 in
costs and expenses.
