And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Jeffrey Brown's Motion for Limited-Expedited Discovery, allowing him to serve or conduct discovery on Charter Communications to obtain necessary information to identify and locate the Doe Defendants. The judge found that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause to obtain leave to serve discovery on Charter Communications, as he has outlined how he has been injured by the Doe Defendants and has carried out an investigation that makes it clear that Charter Communications has at least some of the information needed to identify and locate the Doe Defendants. The judge's ruling is limited to the extent necessary to identify and locate the Doe Defendants, and does not permit Plaintiff to conduct discovery beyond that scope.
