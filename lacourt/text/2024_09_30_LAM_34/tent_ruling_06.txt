Defendant Sgt. Dawanna
Gilbert’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is SUSTAINED. The Court will
inquire at the hearing whether leave to amend should be granted.  
 
BACKGROUND
 
On
May 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint for injuries he sustained from a motor
vehicle collision that occurred on October 16, 2016. Plaintiff asserts the
following causes of action against Defendants Dawanna Gilbert, Armando Federico
Reyes, Daniel Barrios, Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, City Logistics &
Transport, and Does 1-25 (“Defendants”) [1]: 
 
1.                 Professional
Negligence; 
2.                 Negligence;

3.                 Personal
Injury;[2]
4.                 Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress; and 
5.                 Declaratory
Pre-Judgement. 
 
On
August 30, 2024, Defendant Stg. Dawanna Gilbert (“Gilbert”) filed this Demurrer
to Plaintiff’s Complaint. As of September 23, 2024, Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition to Gilbert’s Demurrer which was due on September 17, 2024. As such,
Gilbert has not filed a reply. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“The party
against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object, by
demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the pleading on any one or
more of” various grounds listed in statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10.)
 
When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The
only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)
 
Where a
demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC
(2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable
possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation
Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245). 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Gilbert
demurs, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e), to
all causes of action in Plaintiff’s Complaint, on the basis that they each fail
to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Gilbert also demurs,
per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (f), to Plaintiff’s
Complaint on the basis that it is uncertain. 
 
Gilbert also
argues that (1) Plaintiff’s Complaint is barred by the relevant statute of
limitations; (2) Plaintiff’s causes of action against Gilbert are barred by the
immunity for failure to prosecute or enforce the law; (3) Plaintiff’s first
four causes of action are barred by the statutory basis rule; (4) Plaintiff
does not allege compliance with the claims presentation requirements of the
Government Claims Act; (5) the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction; and (6)
Plaintiff’s Complaint is barred by issue preclusion and claim preclusion. 
 
Meet and
Confer 
 
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed
the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether
an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in
the demurrer. (C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.) A declaration must be filed
with a demurrer regarding the results of the meet and confer process. (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).)
 
Gilbert’s
counsel declares that on August 8, 2024, she sent correspondence to Plaintiff
requesting to meet and confer but was unable to meet with Plaintiff since Plaintiff
is currently in prison. (Dem., 7:13-18; Brenner Decl., ¶ 4-6.) 
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
Gilbert’s
Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) is granted. “A court
may properly take judicial notice of its own records. (Evid. Code, § 452,
subd. (e).)” (Garcia v. Sterling (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 17, 21.)
 
However, the
Court does not grant judicial notice of factual findings in the above
documents. Factual findings in prior judicial orders, opinions, or decisions
are not a proper subject of judicial notice. (Kilroy v. State of Calif.
(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 140, 148.) But the finding itself may be a proper
subject of judicial notice if it has a res judicata or collateral estoppel
effect in a subsequent action. (Ibid.)
 
Thus, the
Court grants judicial notice of factual findings if they have a res judicata
effect or collateral estoppel effect in this action.
 
First
Cause of Action (Professional Negligence)
 
 “The elements of a cause of action for professional
negligence are (1) the existence of the duty of the professional to use
such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of the profession commonly
possess and exercise; (2) breach of that duty; (3) a causal connection between
the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage
resulting from the professional negligence.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51
Cal.4th 811, 821.) 
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint makes one
mention of Gilbert stating that she is an individual residing in the County of
Los Angeles. (Cmplt., ¶ 1.) However, Plaintiff includes Gilbert in its
allegations claiming that “Defendants negligently failed to take
steps to make sure that the collision report [10/16/2016] contained the correct
traffic violation and supporting facts, in failing to do so, has caused
irrepariable [sic] damage to his rights preserved by the Victim Bill Of Rights
provided under the states 'constitution".” (Cmplt. ¶ 12.) 
 
Gilbert
argues that Plaintiff’s allegations admit that it was California Highway Patrol
(“CHP”) which wrote the traffic collision report disputed by Plaintiff, not the
Los Angeles County Sherriff’s Department (“LASD”) who employs Gilbert. (Dem., 13:13-16.)
Thus, Gilbert argues that Plaintiff fails to allege a connection between
Gilbert and CHP. (Ibid.) Additionally, Gilbert argues that Plaintiff
failed to make allegations that Gilbert owed any professional duty to Plaintiff
which is essential for a professional negligence cause of action. (Id., 13:21-28.)

 
Plaintiff
fails to allege sufficient facts to assert a professional negligence cause of
action. Plaintiff’s Complaint does not show that Gilbert was involved in the
drafting of the collision report in any professional capacity to create a duty.
As such, Plaintiff did not address Gilbert’s specific conduct or professional
capacity to allege sufficient facts to assert that a duty exists for a professional
negligence cause of action.
 
The Demurrer is SUSTAINED.
 
Second
Cause of Action (Negligence) 
 
In order to
state a claim for negligence, Plaintiff must allege the elements of (1) “the
existence of a legal duty of care,” (2) “breach of that duty,” and (3)
“proximate cause resulting in an injury.” (McIntyre v. Colonies-Pacific, LLC
(2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 664, 671.) 
 
Plaintiff makes general allegations
as to all Defendants for negligence. (Cmplt., ¶¶ 14-20.) Specifically,
Plaintiff alleges that there was a dangerous condition and that the automobile
involved in the collision was driven negligently. (Ibid.) 
 
Gilbert argues that since there are
no allegations stablishing that Gilbert drove the vehicle involved, Plaintiff
did not establish the existence of a duty of care which is essential to a claim
of negligence. (Dem., 14:9-15.) 
 
The Court agrees with Gilbert’s
argument. Plaintiff does not allege sufficient facts to assert that Gilbert owed
a duty to Plaintiff in regard to the driving of the vehicle involved or the
collision itself. Plaintiff’s allegations are too general to create any
imposition of a duty on Gilbert. 
 
The Demurrer is SUSTAINED.
 
Third
Cause of Action (Personal Injury)
 
Plaintiff
does not identify a third cause of action but makes general allegations
regarding injuries sustained from the vehicle collision involved. (Cmplt., ¶¶
25-29.) 
 
Gilbert
argues that Plaintiff’s Complaint fails to state a third cause of action.
(Dem., 14:16-18.) 
As such, the
Court finds that Plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to assert a third
cause of action. 
 
The Demurrer is SUSTAINED.
 
Fourth
Cause of Action (Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress)
 
“The law of negligent infliction of
emotional distress in California is typically analyzed by reference to two theories
of recovery: the ‘bystander’ theory and the ‘direct victim’ theory. The
negligent causing of emotional distress is not an independent tort, but the
tort of negligence. The traditional elements of duty, breach of duty,
causation, and damages apply. Whether a defendant owes a duty of care is a
question of law.” (Spates v. Dameron Hosp. Ass’n (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th
208, 213, ellipses, quotation marks, brackets, and paragraph breaks omitted.) 
 
Plaintiff makes general allegations
that Defendants owed Plaintiff a duty of care and breached this duty. (Cmplt.,
¶¶ 30-31.) 
 
Gilbert argues
that Plaintiff made no additional allegations to support an emotional distress
claim or to support that Gilbert owed a duty to Plaintiff. (Dem., 14:19-26.) 
 
The Court
finds that Plaintiff’s allegations are insufficient to impose any duty of care
on Gilbert or to allege that Gilbert breached any duty which is essential to a
negligent infliction of emotional distress cause of action.  
 
The Demurrer is SUSTAINED.
 
Fifth
Cause of Action (Declaratory
Pre-Judgement)
 
“To
qualify for declaratory relief, a party would have to
demonstrate its action presented two essential elements: (1) a proper subject
of declaratory relief, and (2) an actual controversy
involving justiciable questions relating to the party’s rights or obligations.”
(Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909,
quotation marks and brackets omitted.) 
 
A
cause of action for declaratory relief should not be used as a second
cause of action for the determination of identical issues raised in another
cause of action. (General of America Insurance Co. v. Lilly (1968) 258
Cal.App.2d 465, 470.) “The availability of another form of relief that is
adequate will usually justify refusal to grant declaratory relief” (California Insurance
Guarantee Association v. Superior Court (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1617, 1624),
and a duplicative cause of action is subject to demurrer (Palm Springs
Villas II Homeowners Association, Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268,
290). Further, “there is no basis for declaratory relief where only past wrongs are
involved.” (Osseous Technologies of America, Inc. v. DiscoveryOrtho Partners
LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 357, 366, quotation marks omitted.) 
 
Plaintiff
seeks declaratory relief requesting that the Court finds that Gilbert and LASD breached
a fiduciary obligation by failing to hold Defendant Armando Reyes (“Reyes”)
criminally liable for reckless driving after being found responsible for causing
the collision involved in this action. (Cmplt., ¶ 36.) Plaintiff also alleges
that Gilbert and LASD’s failure to prosecute Reyes obstructed the
administration of justice. (Id., ¶ 37.) 
 
Gilbert
argues that Plaintiff has not alleged a legal theory for declaratory relief to
support his claims. (Dem., 15:1-3.) Additionally, Gilbert argues that the Court
lacks jurisdiction to direct any prosecution which is the sole responsibility of
the public prosecutor. (Id., 15:8-19.) 
 
The
Court agrees with Gilbert in that declaratory relief is inappropriate in
Plaintiff’s case. Since there are other available methods of relief for
Plaintiff’s injuries, Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts
to assert that a cause of action for declaratory relief exists. 
 
The Demurrer is SUSTAINED.
 
Uncertain 
 
Gilbert demurs to Plaintiff’s
Complaint arguing that it is uncertain since Plaintiff fails to label which
allegations pertain to each defendant. Gilbert also argues that the uncertainty
of Plaintiff’s Complaint does not show a connection between Gilbert and
Plaintiff’s causes of action. 
 
The Court agrees that Plaintiff’s
Complaint is uncertain as Gilbert contends.  
The Demurrer is SUSTAINED.
 
Statute of Limitations 
“A statute of limitations defense may be asserted
by a general demurrer.” (SLPR, L.L.C. v. San Diego Unified Port District
(2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 284, 316.) As grounds for demurrer, expiration of a
limitations period is a subspecies of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (e), failure to state a cause of action. (Cavey v. Tulla
(2021) 69 Cal.App.5th 310, 326.)
However, “ ‘ “[a] demurrer on the ground of the
bar of the statute of limitations will not lie where an action may be, but is
not necessarily barred.” It must appear affirmatively that, upon the face of
the complaint, the right of action is necessarily barred.’” (Leasequip, Inc.
v. Dapeer (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 394, 400.) In order for a court to sustain
a demurrer based on a statute of limitations defense, “ ‘the complaint [must
allege] every fact which the defendant would be required to prove if he were to
plead the bar of the applicable statute of limitation as an affirmative
defense. [Citation.]’ ” (Ibid., citing Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell,
Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 881.)
Gilbert argues that Plaintiff’s action is
time-barred since Plaintiff’s alleged injuries occurred on October 16, 2016 and
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on May 3, 2023 which is more than two years past
the date of the vehicle collision. (Dem., 10:10-15.) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 335.1 states: “Within
two years: An action for assault, battery, or injury to, or for the death of,
an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another.” The statute of
limitation can be tolled while a party is in custody, for up to two years. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 352.1.) 
 
Gilbert argues that even though Plaintiff went
to state prison on November 21, 2019, the statute of limitations was not tolled
since the two year limitations period had expired prior to 2019. (Dem., 10:16-21.)
 
 
Additionally, Gilbert argues that Plaintiff’s
allegations against Gilbert is that she failed to prosecute Reyes for reckless
driving is also time-barred by California Penal Code section 802, subdivision
(a). (Dem., 10:21-28.) Section 802, subdivision (a) states “...prosecution for an
offense not punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison...shall be
commenced within one year after commission of the offense.” Thus, Plaintiff’s action
should have been filed by October 16, 2019. As such, Plaintiff’s Complaint
filed on May 3, 2023 is untimely. (Dem., 11:1-4.) 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s Complaint is
time-barred because Plaintiff filed his Complaint more than two years after the
day of the vehicle collision. 
 
The Demurrer is SUSTAINED.
 
Immunity for Failure to Prosecute or Enforce
the Law 
 
Gilbert argues that Plaintiff cannot sue LASD
or Gilbert for failing to prosecute Reyes and Defendant Daniel Barrios
(“Barrios”) for the vehicle collision involved in this case according to
Government Code section 818.2. (Dem., 11:7-16.)  Gilbert cites section 818.2 stating that “ ‘[a]
public entity is not liable for an injury caused …by failing to enforce any
law.’ Similarly, Government Code section 845 provides: ‘Neither a public entity
nor a public employee is liable for failure to establish a police department or
otherwise to provide police protection service or, if police protection service
is provided, for failure to provide sufficient police protection service.’ (Summerfield
v. City of Inglewood (2023) 96 Cal.App.5th 983, 998.)” (Ibid.)
 
The Court finds that Gilbert, as a public
employee, is not liable for LASD’s alleged failure to prosecute Reyes and
Barrios. As such, Plaintiff’s suit is baseless. 
 
The Demurrer is SUSTAINED.
 
Statutory Basis Rule 
 
Gilbert also argues that Plaintiff’s first
four causes of action are barred by the statutory basis rule. (Dem., 11:19-26.)
 
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s allegations
against Gilbert do not have a sufficient statutory basis. 
 
The Demurrer is SUSTAINED.
 
Government Claims Act 
 
Gilbert argues that Government Code section
945.4 requires a written claim to a public entity before a suit may be brought
against them. (Dem., 12:13-28.) Gilbert cites Rubenstein v. Doe (2017) 3
Cal.5th 903, 906 holding that “[c]omplaints that do not allege facts
demonstrating either that a claim was timely presented or that compliance with
the claims statute is excused are subject to a general demurrer for not stating
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Ibid.) Thus, since
Plaintiff did not make any allegations that he presented the claim or that he
was excused from doing, Plaintiff’s first four causes of action should be
subject to demur. (Id., 13:2-3.)
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff did not comply
with Government Code section 945.4. 
 
The Demurrer is SUSTAINED.
 
Subject Matter Jurisdiction 
 
Based on the ruling on the Demurrer, the
court declines to rule on this issue. 
 
Issue Preclusion and Claim Preclusion 
 
Based on the ruling on the Demurrer, the
court declines to rule on this issue.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Sgt. Dawanna
Gilbert’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s
Complaint is SUSTAINED. The Court will inquire at the hearing
whether leave to amend should be granted.
