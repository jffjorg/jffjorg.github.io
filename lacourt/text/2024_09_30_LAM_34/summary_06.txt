And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant, Sgt. Dawanna Gilbert, and sustained her demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The complaint alleges that Gilbert and other defendants were negligent in allowing a vehicle collision to occur, and seeks damages for the plaintiff's injuries. The judge found that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against Gilbert, and that the statute of limitations and immunity for failure to prosecute or enforce the law bar the plaintiff's claims. The judge will inquire at the hearing whether leave to amend should be granted.
