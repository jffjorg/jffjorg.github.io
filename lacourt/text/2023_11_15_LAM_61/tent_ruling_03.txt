Defendant to give notice.
 
I.                  
MOTION TO
COMPEL
“Any
party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other party to
the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of
specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law to
fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy
between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.) If a party fails to serve a timely response to requests for
admissions, “[t]he requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness
of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be
deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280 subd. (b).)
A
party who fails to timely respond to requests for admission waives all
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
Defendant
Silvia Romo (Defendant) served requests for admissions upon Plaintiffs
Valentina Gonzalez and Ricardo Ruiz Gonzalez (Plaintiffs) on July 25, 2023.
(Heim Decl. ¶ 2. ) Responses were due within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.250.) But as to September 7, 2023, no responses have been served. (Heim
Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiffs have filed no opposition to the motions. 
The
motions to deem admitted are GRANTED.
II.   
SANCTIONS
Sanctions
are also mandatory against a party whose failure to serve responses to requests
for admission makes the motion necessary. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd.
(c).) Moreover, a court “may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was
provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (CRC Rule 3.1348,
subd. (a).) 
Defendant
seeks $1,010.00 in sanctions for the motion brought against Valentina Gonzalez,
and $297.50 in sanctions for the motion against Ricardo Ruiz Gonzalez,
representing respectively two hours of attorney work at $475 per hour, and one-half
hour drafting the second motion at the same rate, plus two $60 filing fees.
(Heim Decl. ¶¶ 4–6.) 
Sanctions
are awarded against Plaintiffs in the amount of $1,427.
