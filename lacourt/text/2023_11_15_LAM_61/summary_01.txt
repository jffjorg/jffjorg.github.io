And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns the demurrer to the Cross-Complaint filed by the defendants, Skyhigh Valencia, LLC, Robert Rafia, Mahmoud Malakafzali, and Ron Tucker, and the motion for leave to file a second amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Old Road Realty, LLC.

The Court sustains the demurrer to the Cross-Complaint without leave to amend, finding that the claims rest upon allegations that the entity with which the defendants contracted did not exist or was suspended, which is defective as a matter of law. The Court also finds that the Cross-Complaint lacks factual allegations and that the defendants' arguments are unpersuasive.

The Court grants the motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, finding that the new claim for reformation of contract does not arise from a different set of facts than those alleged in the pleadings and that the claim is timely.
