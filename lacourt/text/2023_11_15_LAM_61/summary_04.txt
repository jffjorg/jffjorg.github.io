Here is the English summary:

In this tentative ruling, Judge grants Defendant Helio Marquez's motion to vacate default judgment and quash service of summons. The Judge finds that service of summons was not properly made and that the defendant lacked notice of the litigation until September 2023. The Judge also grants the motions of OakTree Law and Debra A. Tocalino to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs Juan Ramon Castro and Tomasa D. Portilo, citing the plaintiffs' failure to respond to their counsel's communications. The Judge notes that the defendant has presented evidence that he lacked notice of the litigation and that the substitute service alleged against him was not made upon his "dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address."
