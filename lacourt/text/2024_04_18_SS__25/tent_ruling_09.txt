BACKGROUND
 
            On December
05, 2023, Plaintiff Truist Bank (“Plaintiff”) filed two causes of action
against Defendant Silva Abramyan (“Defendant”) for 1) breach of contract, and
2) quantum meruit/unjust enrichment.
 
            On January
25, 2024, Plaintiff moved for default to be entered against Defendant, and the
Clerk entered default the same day. 
 
            On February
07, 2024, the Court entered default judgment against the Defendant in the amount
of $26,021.54. 
 
            On February

Clerical Errors in Clerk’s Default Judgment Entered on February 07, 2024.

Plainitff prays for the Court to issue a nunc pro tunc
order that corrects the clerical errors in the Clerks’ Default Judgement
entered on February 7, 2024, and grants Plaintiff with the full measure
of relief to which it is entitled in the Judgment on the grounds that the Judgment amount is inaccurate as
a result of an inaccurate pre-judgment interest figure that conflicts with the
averments in the Complaint.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard 
Code of Civil
Procedure § 473(d) provides that, “the court may, upon motion of the injured
party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders
as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed.”  A court
has the inherent power to correct clerical errors in its records so as to make
these records reflect the true facts.  (In re Candelario (1970)
3¿Cal.¿3d¿702, 705.)  “The test which distinguishes clerical error from
possible judicial error is simply whether the challenged portion of the
judgment was entered inadvertently (which is clerical error) versus advertently
(which might be judicial error, but is not clerical error).  Unless the
challenged portion of the judgment was entered inadvertently, it cannot be changed
post judgment under the guise of correction of clerical error.”  Tokio
Marine & Fire Ins. Corp. v. Western Pacific Roofing Corp. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 110, 117 (internal citation omitted).  “An amendment that substantially modifies
the original judgment or materially alters the rights of the parties, may not
be made by the court under its authority to correct clerical error, therefore,
unless the record clearly demonstrates that the error was not the result of the
exercise of judicial discretion.”  (In re Candelario, 3 Cal. 3d.
at¿705.) 
 
II.        Discussion
Plaintiff
moves for a nunc pro tunc order to correct the clerical errors which understate
the pre-judgment interest due and owed to the Plaintiff as of date of entry of
Judgment. (Mot. p. 2.) Plaintiff argues that per the averments in the
Complaint, the pre-judgment interest component of the Judgment should be
$7,931.68, and not $3,782.03 as specified in the Judgment, bringing the judgment
amount to $30,171.19 instead of the $26,021.54 entered by the Clerk. (Id.)
Plaintiff provides the Court with the Declaration of its counsel who states
that she, 
 
filed a proposed form of Clerk’s
Judgment by Default for entry by the Clerk which mistakenly included the wrong
figures for pre-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees. While the Clerk
corrected the error in the attorneys’ fee figure, the Clerk did not correct the
error in the pre-judgment interest figure so that it would conform to the
averments in the Complaint. As a result, the pre-judgment interest figure in
the Judgment is understated and consequently so is the amount of the Judgment.
 
(Collen M. Auer
Decl. ¶ 3.) Per the Complaint, there was $2,328.26 in prejudgment interest due
and owing by Defendant through May 5, 2021, with prejudgment interest
continuing to accrue at the Contract rate of 9.95%, or $5.57 per day from May
06, 2021, until the date of Judgement on February 07, 2024. (Id. ¶ 4.) Meaning
that the prejudgment interest due and owing by the Defendant was $7,931,68
instead of the $3,782.03 specified in the Judgment. (Id.)
 
The Court finds
the evidence sufficient to show that the interest amount of $3,782.03
specified in the February 07, 2024, Judgment was a clerical error. Noting both
the Complaint and Plaintiff’s declaration, prejudgment interest accrued at the
Contract rate of 9.95%, or $5.57 per day from May 06, 2021, until the date of
Judgment. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court amends the Judgment to reflect the correct prejudgment interest
amount of $7,931,68, bringing the total Judgment amount to $30,171.19.
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiff’s Motion for Nunc
Pro Tunc Order to Correct Clerical Errors in Clerk’s Default Judgment Entered
on February 07, 2024, is GRANTED. 
 
The prejudgment
interest amount shall be amended to reflect the correct amount of $7,931,68,
bringing the total Judgment amount to $30,171.19.
 
Counsel
for Plaintiff is ordered to electronically submit a proposed form of amended
