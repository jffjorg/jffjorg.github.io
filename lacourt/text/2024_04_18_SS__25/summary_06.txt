And here is a brief English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the accessibility of the website and the plaintiff's intent to patronize the defendant's restaurant. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant's website was inaccessible to her due to her blindness and inability to access the menu information. The defendant argues that the plaintiff lacks standing because she did not provide evidence of a bona fide intent to patronize the restaurant. The court finds that the evidence presented by both parties raises triable issues of material fact regarding the plaintiff's intent to patronize and the defendant's intent to provide equal access.
