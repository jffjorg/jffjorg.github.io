Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply in a case involving allegations of molestation of four minor children by EDUARDO PENA, a former employee of a childcare facility. The Defendant Department of Social Services has filed a demurrer to the Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint, arguing that the complaint fails to state a cause of action and is barred by immunities provided under California law.

The Court has ruled that the demurrer is sustained in its entirety, and the Plaintiffs are given 20 days leave to amend their complaint. The Court has also held that the Licensing Immunity in GOV § 818.4 applies to the case, as the Department of Social Services is alleged to have licensed the childcare facility where the alleged molestation occurred.

The Court has also held that the Plaintiffs' claims are not sufficient to state a cause of action, as they fail to establish a special relationship between the Department of Social Services and the Plaintiffs, and fail to point to a statute that imposes direct liability on the Department.
