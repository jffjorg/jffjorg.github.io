And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion filed by attorneys for the plaintiffs to allow Eric D. Pearson to appear as counsel pro hac vice. The motion was filed on behalf of Patrick Haynes and others who filed a complaint against General Motors LLC and others, alleging that the defendants failed to disclose and adequately repair defective car batteries in their Chevrolet Bolt vehicles, leading to fires.

The judge found that the plaintiffs' attorneys have met the requirements for admission pro hac vice, including being admitted to practice in good standing before at least one U.S. court, being associated with a member of the California bar, and paying the required State Bar fee.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Rules of Court, rule 9.40, which sets out the requirements for admission pro hac vice. The judge reviewed the moving papers and found that the plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that Eric D. Pearson meets the requirements.

The judge granted the motion and ordered the moving party to give notice.
