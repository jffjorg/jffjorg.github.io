And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case PURAB VISWANATH, et al. vs KENNETH SCHNEL. The court has excused the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, and counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call at the upcoming hearing on February 29, 2024. The court has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of the disputed claim of a minor, Maddox Mann, age 9, and finds the settlement to be reasonable. However, the court identifies two issues that prevent the granting of the petition at this time: the inconsistency in the medical expense lien amount and the need for a revised fee request. The court orders counsel to file a new petition and proposed order correcting these deficiencies, and grants a 25% fee of the gross settlement. The petition is continued, and moving party is ordered to give notice.
