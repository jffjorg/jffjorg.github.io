 Case Number:  20STCV40739    Hearing Date:   February 29, 2024    Dept:  30 RODOLFO ZARATE BLANCO vs KIRSTIE LEE WALKER, et al.TENTATIVEPlaintiff’s motion to compel the deposition of Defendant is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to appear for deposition within 20 days of this order.  Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.Legal StandardAny party may obtain discovery … by taking the oral deposition of any person, including any party to the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)Where a party objects to the deposition, the proper remedy is an objection under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410. If such an objection is made within three calendar days before the deposition date, the objecting party must make personal service of that objection. (Code Civ. Proc. 2025.410, subd. (b).)CCP section¿2025.450(a) provides:¿“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . . , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document . . . described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(a).)CCP section¿2025.450(b) provides:¿“A motion under subdivision (a)… shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”¿ (Id., § 2025.450(b).)DiscussionPlaintiff served a notice of taking Defendant’s deposition two times, once for April 25, 2023 and another for June 8, 2023. (Feldman Decl., Exhs. A, C.) Defendant objected to the April 25, 2023 deposition based on being unilaterally set, but did not object to the deposition set for June 8, 2023. (Id., Exhs. B, D.) On June 6, 2023, Defendant suddenly announced Attorney Shikai had been hospitalized and the deposition needed to be moved but failed to provide any information. On June 12, 2023, Defendant suddenly objected to Defendant testifying about the facts of liability due to Defendant intending to stipulate to liability. The parties attempted to meet and confer, but could not resolve the issue due to each party attempting to impose certain conditions on the deposition.Since the filing of the motion, Plaintiff noticed two more deposition notices. Defendant objected to those notices due to being unilaterally set. Defendant offered four alternative dates for Defendant Walker’s deposition (October 30, November 3, 7, or 8). Plaintiff refused.Defendant argues she sent a valid objection to the last deposition notice. Defendant argues there is no basis to compel Defendant’s deposition because Plaintiff’s counsel failed to take a deposition date offered by Defendant’s counsel. Defendant also states that they are willing to produce Defendant for deposition on a mutually agreeable date regardless of whether the Court grants this motion or not.The Court finds that Plaintiff has properly served notices of taking Defendant’s deposition, and Defendant failed to properly object to the June 8, 2023 notice of deposition, and failed to appear. Further, the objection based on the deposition being unilaterally set is not valid in light of Plaintiff’s multiple efforts in seeking Defendant’s deposition. In addition, Defendants are willing to produce Defendant for deposition. Thus, the motion to compel Defendant to appear for deposition is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to appear for deposition within 20 days of this order.SanctionsPlaintiff’s request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is also denied, as "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)ConclusionBased on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel the deposition of Defendant is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to appear for deposition within 20 days of this order.Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.
