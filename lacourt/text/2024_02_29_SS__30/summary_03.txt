The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant. The defendant has failed to properly object to the deposition notices and has failed to appear for deposition. The judge finds that the plaintiff has properly served notices of taking the defendant's deposition and that the defendant's objections are not valid. The judge orders the defendant to appear for deposition within 20 days. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
