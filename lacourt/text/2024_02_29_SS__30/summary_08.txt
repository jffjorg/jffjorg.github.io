Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike the complaint's allegations seeking punitive damages. The defendant's motion is based on the argument that the pleaded facts do not support the imposition of punitive damages. The judge finds that the allegations of negligence and reckless conduct by the defendant are insufficient to support the imposition of punitive damages. The judge notes that the pleaded facts do not show that the risk of injury was probable, as required by California law. The judge also finds that the allegations do not meet the statutory requirement of "despicable" conduct. As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion to strike and denies leave to amend the complaint.
