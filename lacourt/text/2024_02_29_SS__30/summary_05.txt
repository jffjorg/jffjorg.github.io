And here is the English summary:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of disputed claims of a minor (Maddox Mann, age 9) and finds the settlement reasonable. However, the petition is continued due to two issues: the fee request has not been fully considered, and not all medical expenses are listed on the proposed order. The court orders counsel to file a new proposed order correcting the defects and gives notice to the moving party.
