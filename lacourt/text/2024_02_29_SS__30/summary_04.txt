And here is the English-text summary:

The court's tentative ruling is that the petition to approve the compromise of a disputed claim of a minor will be continued due to several defects. The court finds that the settlement is reasonable, but the following issues need to be addressed: the medical records have not been filed, the costs are not listed correctly, the medical expenses are not listed correctly, and the defendant has not been served. The court orders the claimant's counsel to file a new petition correcting these defects, serve the defendant, and file proof of service.
