And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted plaintiff Carolina Davila's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, ordering defendant Top Ride Auto Group, Inc. to provide verified responses without objections within 20 days. The judge also denied plaintiff's request for sanctions. The judge found that since plaintiff properly served a request for responses and defendant failed to serve responses, plaintiff is entitled to a court order directing defendant to provide the requested responses. The judge noted that plaintiff has only filed one motion and paid one filing fee, so the court only addressed one request to compel discovery. The judge denied the request for sanctions because the motion was not unsuccessfully opposed.
