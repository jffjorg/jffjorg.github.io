 Case Number:  24STCV21517    Hearing Date:   January 7, 2025    Dept:  78 DEPT:   78 OSC DATE:  01/07/2025 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  24STCV21517 HELEN MADENJIAN, et al. vs CALIFORNIA TRANSPORT REFRIGERATION, INC. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  (1) California Transport Refrigeration, Inc. and (2) Craig Burton TENTATIVE RULING:   DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  Plaintiffs Helen Madenjian and Cindy Madenjian as Co-Trustees of the Madenjian Family Trust, Marlene Sevacherian as Trustee of the Sevacherian Family Trust, and Ara Sevacherian (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed this breach of contract action against defendants California Transport Refrigeration, Inc. (“CTRI”), Craig Burton (“Burton”), and Does 1 to 10 alleging defendants failed to pay rental expenses pursuant to the terms of a written lease agreement. (Compl. Ex. A.) The Complaint alleges that on September 12, 2015, Plaintiffs’ predecessor-in-interest Greenwood Industrial LLC (“Greenwood”) and defendant CTRI entered into a written agreement for the rental of real property. Defendant Burton personally guaranteed CTRI’s obligations under the lease agreement. (Compl. Ex. B.) The Complaint sets forth two causes of action for breach of contract and breach of commercial guaranty, and seeks damages in the amount of $248,968.85, interest, and attorney’s fees.  All unnamed Doe defendants were dismissed on December 5, 2024. Plaintiffs seek $302,847.15 against CTRI and Burton (collectively “Defendants”), comprised of (1) $248,965.85 in principal damages, (2) $49,793.30 in interest, (3) $575.00 in costs, and (4) $3,500 in attorney fees.  Plaintiffs’ agent, Gary J. Herman, Jr. (“Herman”), declares Plaintiffs’ predecessor-in-interest Greenwood entered into a Standard Industrial/Commercial Single-Tenant Lease Gross (“the Lease”) with CTRI on August 28, 2014, by which CTRI leased 1125 S. Greenwood Montebello, California 90640 (“the Premises”) for a term of five years and sixteen days. (Herman Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.) CTRI’s obligations under the lease were guaranteed by Burton. (Ibid.) The Lease was subsequently amended on two occasions, with the final amendment extending the Lease term through and including October 31 2024. (Ibid.) The initial monthly base rent due under the Lease was $7,250.00, and that monthly base rent for the final year of the lease totaled $9,302.00. (Herman Decl. ¶ 4.) CTRI was evicted from the Premises and possession restored on April 18, 2023 – the Premises was re-leased effective September 1, 2023. (Herman Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.)  The request for default judgment filed on November 27, 2024 is denied without prejudice for the following reasons:  First, Herman has not established the requisite foundation for his testimony. Herman only declares that he is an “authorized agent” of Plaintiffs. There are no facts to support his personal knowledge of the matter, nor for Herman to be able to authenticate the documents attached to his declaration.  Second, assuming the above defect is cured, the Court is unclear as to how Plaintiffs calculated the back rent of $248,968.85 because no calculation or chart of the months (from start date to end date) and monetary amount owed per month was provided. The complaint and declaration provide that Defendants breached the lease by failing to pay starting November 1, 2022, that CTRI was evicted and the Premises restored to Plaintiffs on April 18, 2023, and that the natural expiration of the lease was October 31, 2024. The declaration further provides that the initial monthly base rent under the Lease was $7,250.00, and the monthly rent “for the final year” totaled $9,302.00. The Court is uncertain what is meant by “the final year” in which rent increased to $9,302.00 – Plaintiffs must clarify this ambiguity.  To the extent that the back rent represents the amount Defendants failed to pay while still in possession of the Premises and an aggregation of anticipated rent from the date of eviction/restoration of the Premises on April 18, 2023 to the date of the application, Plaintiffs have not stated how much of the damages were mitigated through Plaintiffs having successfully re-leased the Premises on September 1, 2023. (See CCP § 1951.2.) No information was provided on how much rent Plaintiffs collected by re-leasing the Premises, and it is uncertain whether Plaintiffs factored mitigation in the amount sought against Defendants. A default is not intended to act as a windfall for Plaintiffs to collect an excess in damages above and beyond the amount necessary to compensate Plaintiffs for the detriment proximately caused by defaulting defendants’ failure to perform on their obligations under the lease. A defendant’s default is not “an unalloyed gift: an opportunity to obtain a big judgment with no significant effort.” (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 271.) “Instead, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove up his damages, with actual evidence.” (Id. at 272.) Aside from lacking foundation, Herman’s declaration fails to demonstrate that the amount sought was properly calculated.  Within 62 days, which is no later than March 10, 2025, Plaintiffs are to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is continued to April 4, 2025.
