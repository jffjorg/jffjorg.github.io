And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively denied the request for default judgment against California Transport Refrigeration, Inc. and Craig Burton. The Judge's reasons for denial include:

1. The agent, Gary J. Herman, Jr., has not established a sufficient foundation for his testimony.
2. The Court is unclear about how the Plaintiffs calculated the back rent of $248,968.85, as no calculation or chart was provided.
3. The Court is uncertain what is meant by "the final year" of the lease, in which the monthly rent increased to $9,302.00.
4. The Plaintiffs have not stated how much of the damages were mitigated through the successful re-lease of the Premises on September 1, 2023.
5. The Judge notes that a default judgment is not intended to act as a windfall for the Plaintiffs, and that they must prove up their damages with actual evidence.

The Plaintiffs are ordered to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects within 62 days, no later than March 10, 2025. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is continued to April 4, 2025.
