And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the supplemental briefs filed by both parties and has issued a tentative ruling. The court finds that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to this employment contract for creative work. The court also finds that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applies, citing California and New York law. The court will not consider new evidence submitted by the Defendants in their reply brief, as this would be unfair to the opposing party. The court will also not address the Defendants' new fact-based argument raised for the first time in their supplemental brief. The court will continue to consider the parties' arguments in determining the appropriate course of action.
