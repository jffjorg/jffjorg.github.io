And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal and enforce the settlement. The case involves an unlawful detainer action between the plaintiff, MIRIAMS WELL, LLC, and the defendants, DYLAN OMID KESHMIR, and MEGAN PATER. The parties signed a stipulation and judgment that provided for a judgment of $42,600 if the defendants defaulted on payments. The defendants failed to make timely payments and also failed to make ongoing rent payments, including the additional $200 per month required in the stipulation. The court concludes that the plaintiff is entitled to enforce the settlement based on the facts presented.
