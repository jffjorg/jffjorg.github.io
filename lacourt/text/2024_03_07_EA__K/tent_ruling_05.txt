 Case Number:  BC649025    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  K Third Party Axos Bank’s Motion to Set Aside and Vacate
August 3, 2023 Orders as Void is DENIED.
Background   
Case No. BC649025
Plaintiffs Elizabeth Taylor (“Taylor”) and Chasity Jones (“Jones”) (together,
“Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:
Defendant Alkiviades David (“David”) was, at
all relevant times, the President, CEO and managing agent of Defendants Hologram
USA, Inc. (“Hologram”), Hologram USA Entertainment, Inc. (“Hologram
Entertainment”), FilmOn Media Holdings, Inc. (“FilmOn”), FilmOn.TV, Inc.
(“FilmOn TV”), FilmOn.TV Networks, Inc. (“FilmOn Networks”), Alki David
Productions, Inc. (“Alki David Productions”) and Anakando Media Group USA
(“Anakando”). In January 2015, Plaintiffs were hired by Defendants as account
executives on the company’s sales team. Throughout the duration of their
employment, Plaintiffs worked in a hostile, misogynistic workplace rife with
sexual innuendo and degrading behavior to women. David also sexually harassed,
assaulted and imprisoned Taylor and sexually harassed and assaulted Jones. In
May 2015, Defendants directed Taylor to falsify health insurance paperwork to
indicate a later hire date. On June 1, 2015, Taylor was terminated, which was
the same day she complained about sexual harassment and insurance fraud. In
October 2015, Defendants ordered Jones to sign a declaration against Taylor. On
November 15, 2016, Jones was terminated in retaliation for rebuffing David’s
sexual assault.
On February 2, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a complaint, asserting causes of
action against David, Hologram, Hologram Entertainment, FilmOn, FilmOn TV,
FilmOn Networks, Alki David Productions, Anakando (together, “Defendants”) and

On January 30, 2018, Plaintiffs filed two “Amendment[s] to Complaint,”

the court declared a mistrial as to all of Taylor’s claims, with judgment to be
entered on the FACC as follows: David to take nothing by virtue of the
cross-complaint.

David Productions, Anakando and FilmOn TV.
On August 26, 2020, the court sustained FilmOn’s, FilmOn Network’s, Alki
David Production’s and Anakando’s demurrer to Taylor’s Supplemental Complaint
for Damages without leave to amend; on September 24, 2020, an “Order of
Dismissal” was entered as to same.
On March 18, 2022, remittitur was filed, affirming the court’s September
26, 2019 amended judgment as to Jones.
On November 9, 2022, the court granted Jones’ Motion to Amend Judgment to
Add Harmonia Malibu, LLC (“HML”), as a Judgment Debtor. On December 5, 2022, HML
filed a “Notice of Appeal.”

Legal Standard
“It is the settled law of California that a judgment or order
which is void on its face, because its infirmity is determinable from an
inspection of the judgment roll or the record, may be set aside on motion at
any time after its entry by the court which rendered the judgment or made the
order.” (Andrisani v. Saugus Colony Limited (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th
517, 523 [quotations and citation omitted].) A void order may be set aside at
any time. (Id.)
Discussion
Third-Party Axos Bank (“Axos”) moves the court to set aside
the court’s August 3, 2023 order on the basis that it is legally void.
Axos first claims that the court’s August 3, 2023 order must
be set aside because it was not provided notice of the ex parte application or
the hearing on the application. “[I]n an adversary proceeding where an order may affect the
rights of an adverse party, notice must be given to protect the adverse party's
right to be heard on the issue as a matter of due process of law.” (St. Paul
Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 82, 85 [quotations
and citation omitted].)
Jones, in turn[1],
argues that there was no requirement to notify Axos of her application because
Axos is not a party in the instant action (See Cal. Rules Ct. rules 1.6(15)[2]
and 3.1203, subd. (a)[3])
and because Judge Colin Leis in case styled Khan v. Hologram USA,
Inc., et al., Case No. BC654017 (“Khan Court”) had already
ordered Axos to turn over pledged cash assets by that time. (Motion, 6:21-23.)
Jones further argues that any error with respect to notice was harmless because
the court’s August 3, 2023 order in the instant action does not cut off Axos’s
rights and “contemplate[s] further action from the Court to determine the
priority of lien interests.” (Opp., 15:7-8).
The court agrees that Jones was not required to provide
notice to Axos of her ex parte application in the instant action because
it had already been determined by the Khan Court that the monies in Axos
Account No. 712943 belonged to David and that Axos was to turn over same to
Khan and held in escrow; as Jones states, “[t]he question of who has the right
to these funds is between Khan and Jones.” (Opp., 6:20-21; see also, Stevens
Decl., ¶ 11, Exh. 8, 1:10-11, ¶ 2.) Further, the court’s August 3, 2023 order
provides, in relevant part, that “[b]oth Creditor and Khan claim an interest in
funds in AXOS Account No. 712943” and that “[t]he statutory scheme following a levy is an adequate method to determine the
priority interests in the funds AXOS Account No. 712943.” (Berger Decl., ¶ 15,
Exh. 6.) Axos has the opportunity to claim exemptions as provided by the
Enforcement of Judgments Law. (See Imperial Bank v. Pim Electric, Inc.
(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 540).
Axos next claims that the court’s August 3, 2023 order
must be set aside because it “contradict[s], nullif[ies], and circumvent[s]” the
Khan Court’s July 20, 2023 and August 1, 2023 orders.[4]
“For one superior court judge, no matter how well intended,
even if correct as a matter of law, to nullify a duly made, erroneous ruling of
another superior court judge places the second judge in the role of a one-judge
appellate court. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County, though comprised of
a number of judges, is a single court and one member of that court cannot sit
in review on the actions of another member of that same court.” (In re
Alberto (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 421, 427-428). “[T]he rule against one trial
judge overruling another reflects an understood notion of ‘comity’ among
jurists on the trial court, which ‘imposes limitations on one judge's authority
when another judge has already acted.’” (Paul Blanco’s Good Car Company Auto
Group v. Superior Court of Alameda County (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 86, 100
[citation omitted].)
Even if the court were to consider the content of the Khan
Court’s July 20, 2023 and August 1, 2023 in ruling on the instant motion, it is
evident that the court’s August 3, 2023 order in no way acted “in review on the
actions” of the Khan Court. The Khan Court’s July 20, 2023 minute
order (Stevens Decl., ¶ 10, Exh. 7) merely indicates that a “Motion for a
Turnover Order Against Third-Party Examinee Axos Bank” was granted on that
date. The Khan Court’s August 1, 2023 order reads, in salient part, that
“Judgment Debtor Alkiviades (‘Alki’) David (‘Mr. David’) is the owner of the
property held in Axos Bank Accounts 712950 and 712943” and that “[a]n order is
issued for the assets in Axos Bank Account 712943 and, to the extent any assets
remain, in Axos Bank Account 712950, to be turned over forthwith to Ms. Khan in
partial satisfaction of her judgment against Mr. David, which are to be held in
escrow.” (Id., ¶ 11, Exh. 8)
The court’s August 3, 2023 order in the instant action acknowledges
that both Jones and Khan have judgments against David, that on July 20, 2023
the Khan Court found that the funds in AXOS Account No. 712943 belonged
to David and should be turned over to Khan, that both Jones and Khan claimed an
interest in AXOS Account No. 712943 and that “[t]he statutory scheme following
a levy is an adequate method to determine the priority interests in the funds
AXOS Account No. 712943.” (Berger Decl., ¶ 15, Exh. 6). The reporter’s
transcript of the July 20, 2023 proceedings before the Khan Court
reflect that Jones was refused standing at that time. (Stevens Decl., ¶ 9, Exh.
6, 2:12-3:26). Neither the Khan’s Court’s July 20, 2023 and August 1, 2023 orders nor the court’s August 3, 2023 order herein make
any determination regarding Jones’s and/or Khan’s priority interest in the
funds.
The motion is denied.
