And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion filed by Axos against Jones. The judge rejects Axos' contention that the motion is a thinly disguised motion for reconsideration. The judge also finds that Axos has failed to attach relevant orders issued by the Khan Court to its moving papers, despite the orders being currently on appeal. As a result, the judge denies Axos' argument that the court's order of August 3, 2023 contradicts, nullifies, and circumvents the July 20, 2023 and August 1, 2023 orders. The judge is unclear about how Axos purports to make this argument without attaching the relevant orders and providing specific reference to them. The judge is awaiting further information from the parties before making a final ruling.
