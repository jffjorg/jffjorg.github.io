[1]              As an aside, the court rejects
Jones’s contention that the instant motion is a thinly disguised motion for
reconsideration. Again, “a court may set aside a void order at any time.” (Andrisani,
supra, 8 Cal.App.4th at 523). Further, the instant motion is not “based upon
new or different facts, circumstances, or law,” as required by Codde of Civil
Procedure § 1008.


[2]              California Rules of Court rule
3.1203 defines a party as “a person appearing in an action. Parties include both
self-represented persons and persons represented by an attorney of record. ‘Party,’
‘plaintiff,’ ‘People of the State of California,’ ‘applicant,’ ‘petitioner,’ ‘defendant,’
‘respondent,’ ‘other parent,’ or any other designation of a party includes the
party's attorney of record.”


[3]              California Rules of Court rule
3.1203, subdivision (a) states that “[a] party seeking an ex parte order must
notify all parties no later than 10:00 a.m. the court day before the ex parte
appearance, absent a showing of exceptional circumstances that justify a
shorter time for notice.” 


[4]              Axos, however, has failed to attach
the July 20, 2023 and August 1, 2023 orders (both of which are currently on
appeal) issued by the Khan Court to its moving papers, nor has it
requested judicial notice of same. It is unclear to the court how Axos purports
to contend that the court’s August 3, 2023 order “contradict[s],
nullif[ies, and circumvent[s]” July 20, 2023 and August 1, 2023 orders rendered
by the Khan Court without attaching the July 20, 2023 and August 1, 2023
orders and providing specific reference to same. Axos’ argument, then, is denied on
this basis alone.
