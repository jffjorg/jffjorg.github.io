[1]           The
motion was filed (and electronically served) on March 27, 2023 and originally
set for hearing on October 11, 2023. Again, on April 26, 2023, the above cases
were transferred from Department 27 of
the Personal Injury Court to Department L (and subsequently to the instant
department). On June 6, 2023, moving defendants filed (and electronically
served) a “Notice of Continuance of Defendants’ Motion to Consolidate,”
advising therein that the October 11, 2023 hearing date had been continued to
November 15, 2023. On August 2, 2023, the above cases were reassigned,
effective August 14, 2023, to Judge Gridiron Winston in Department 6, West
Covina Courthouse.
 
On October 4,
2023, moving defendants filed (and electronically served) an “Amended Notice of
Defendants’ Motion to Consolidate,” advising therein that the November 15, 2023
hearing on the instant motion would now take place in Department 6 in West
Covina. On November 2, 2023, a “Notice of Case Reassignment and Order for
Plaintiff to Give Notice (Dates Remain)” was filed, wherein C. Milliner was
instructed to give notice that the instant case had been reassigned to
Department K and that all matters on calendar would remain set on the dates
previously noticed but now in Department K. There is no indication on ecourt (i.e.,
as of March 5, 2024) that C. Milliner ever provided notice as instructed. Further, moving defendants’
counsel, Lisa Louise Renaud (“Renaud”), was listed on the proof of service
accompanying the November 2, 2023 notice; however, it does not appear that
Renaud gave notice to the parties of the change in location on the instant
motion.
 
The court’s November
15, 2023 minute order states, in relevant part, that “Court and Counsel confer
regarding the Stipulation to Consolidate the above named cases, indicating the
Court will not sign a Stipulation until all outstanding defendants in all cases
are served or dismissed. Counsel indicate all parties have been served in this
case.” On that date, the hearing on the motion was continued to March 7, 2024
and notice was waived. The minute order, however, reflects appearances only by
“Sutton Adam Shapiro Appearing via LA
CourtConnect,” “Julie Romersa, appearing for Bob's Towing and Recovery Service
via LA CourtConnect,” “Stephen Charles Pasarow Appearing by Katherine L.
Curtis, via LA CourtConnect” and “Robert Reisinger Appearing by Glenn Goldby,
via LA CourtConnect.” It is unclear whether certain counsel (including Donald
Dunham, Esq., Elia Castranova, Rickey Ivie, San Nordean, John Flock, Kenechi
Agu , James Wang, Patrick McCarthy, Janet Cervantes and Dimitri N. Chtyrev [all
identified in the notice of motion] failed to appear due to the notice
deficiency noted above. 
 
As an aside, on November 14, 2023, a
“Stipulation Re Consolidation of Actions; [Proposed] Order” was filed in Case
No. 22STCV02707; however, it does not appear that attorney Janet Cervantes
(identified in the notice of motion as counsel for Bandar Khaled Al Badawi and
Omaymah El Kurdi in Case No. 22STCV15084) was included on same.
