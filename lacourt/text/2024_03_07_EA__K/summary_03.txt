And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motion to consolidate was filed on March 27, 2023, and the hearing date has been changed multiple times due to various continuances. The case was reassigned from Department 27 to Department L and then to Department 6, and a notice of case reassignment and order for the plaintiff to give notice was filed. However, it appears that the notice was not provided to all parties, and certain counsel failed to appear at the hearing. The court will not sign a stipulation to consolidate the cases until all outstanding defendants are served or dismissed. The hearing is continued to March 7, 2024, and notice is waived.
