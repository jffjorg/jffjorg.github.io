  - "For one superior court judge, no matter how well intended, even if correct as a matter of law, to nullify a duly made, erroneous ruling of another superior court judge places the second judge in the role of a one-judge appellate court."
  - "The rule against one trial judge overruling another reflects an understood notion of 'comity' among jurists on the trial court, which 'imposes limitations on one judge's authority when another judge has already acted.'"
```

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Axos Bank's motion to set aside the August 3, 2023 order. The order was made void because it was not provided notice of the ex parte application or the hearing on the application. The Judge found that Axos Bank was not a party in the instant action and that the Khan Court had already ordered Axos Bank to turn over pledged cash assets. The Judge also found that the court's August 3, 2023 order did not contradict the Khan Court's orders. The motion is denied.
