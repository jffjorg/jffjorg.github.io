And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to conduct a neuro-ophthalmology examination of the Plaintiff, Alma Nieva-Perez, by Dr. Alfredo A. Sadun, M.D., Ph.D. The Plaintiff claims visual impairment problems, including blurry vision and light sensitivity, which are ongoing. The Defendants, Ehud Levy, 1621 Westerly Terrace, LLC, and Alexander Henry Levin, seek the examination to investigate the causes of the Plaintiff's injuries. The Court finds good cause to allow the examination, as the Plaintiff does not dispute the vision issues and the examination will not be painful or intrusive. The examination will be limited to whatever condition is "in controversy" in the action.
