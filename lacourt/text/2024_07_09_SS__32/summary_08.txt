Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Cross-Complainant Burrell Builders, Inc.'s motion for leave to file a first amended cross-complaint. The motion seeks to add causes of action for breach of contract and express indemnity to the cross-complaint. The court finds that the motion should be granted due to the liberal policy in favor of amendments and the lack of opposition. The court notes that the procedural requirements have not been fully met, but it is willing to overlook this due to the lack of opposition. The court orders Burrell Builders, Inc. to file and serve its first amended cross-complaint within 10 days and to provide notice of the court's order.
