This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for Defendant Mickey Vasquez's cell phone records. The defendants, Mickey Vasquez, Red Bull North America, Inc., and Red Bull Distribution Company, Inc., seek to compel T-Mobile USA, Inc. to produce the records. The plaintiff, Elia Rosa Mercado Leiva, has filed a notice of non-opposition. The court finds that the defendants have not shown that T-Mobile objected to the subpoena or failed to comply, and therefore conditionally denies the motion, subject to the defendants providing updated information at the hearing. The court also notes that counsel's failure to meet and confer further provides no information regarding T-Mobile's position on the motion.
