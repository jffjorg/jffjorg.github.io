Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint to appoint Alex Omar Quevedo Herrera as successor-in-interest for Alex Quevedo Jr., who passed away unrelated to the injuries in the case. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to provide required declarations and that there is no evidence that Maria B. Munoz De Cote Delgado, the decedent's mother, has agreed to the appointment. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure sections 576, 473, 377.30-377.33 and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324 in making its decision.
