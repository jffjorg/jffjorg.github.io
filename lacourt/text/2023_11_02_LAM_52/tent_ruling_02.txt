 Case Number:  22STCV27367    Hearing Date:   November 2, 2023    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default Judgment
Plaintiff Jose A. Zaldana requests court judgment by default
against defendants Compton Car Wash, Inc. and Abrahim Aminpour.
Amount of
Damages 
Plaintiff requests default judgment greater than the amount
demanded in his operative first amended complaint.  “A default judgment greater than the amount
specifically demanded in the complaint is void as beyond the court’s
jurisdiction.”  (Airs Aromatics, LLC
v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 1013, 1018.)  
The body of plaintiff’s first amended complaint alleges
numerous specific items of damages.  (See
Hearn v. Howard (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1209
[“Because the body of the complaint alleged the specific amount of damages
being sought, plaintiffs were not required to reiterate that sum”].)  It alleges the following damages: $43,391.25
unpaid overtime (FAC, ¶ 13); $27,980 unpaid minimum wages (¶ 18); $27,980
liquidated damages (ibid.); $11,525 for meal periods (¶ 23); $11,525 for
rest period (¶ 28), $4,000 for failure to provide accurate wage statements (¶
32), and $3,510 for waiting time penalties (¶ 37).  Those amounts total $129,911.25.  Plaintiff’s request for default judgment,
however, states the “Demand of complaint” is $141,826.  Based on the operative complaint, plaintiff
cannot recover more than $129,911.25 in damages (not including interests,
costs, and attorney fees).  
Amount of
Attorney Fees
            Plaintiff requests $11,250 in
attorney fees based on a lodestar of $7,500 (10 hours at $450 hourly plus 10
hours at $300 hourly) and a 1.5 multiplier. 
(Medina Decl., ¶¶ 4-8.)  Local
Rule 3.214 provides a schedule for reasonable attorney fees on
default judgments but permits “a fee greater than listed … because of
extraordinary services” accompanied by an itemized bill.  (3.214(d).) 
Applying the fee schedule under Local Rule 3.214(a) would limit
plaintiff’s attorney fees to $3,335.48.  That
would result in paying plaintiff’s counsel $166.77 per hour.  That amount is not reasonable.  Labor Code section 1194(a) provides, “[A]ny
employee receiving less than the legal minimum wage or the legal overtime
compensation applicable to the employee is entitled to recover in a civil
action … reasonable attorney’s fees, and costs of suit.”  Awarding plaintiff’s counsel only $166.77
hourly would undermine the Legislature’s intent to encourage attorneys to
represent employees and recover a reasonable fee.  (See Blackwell v. Foley (N.D. Cal.
2010) 724 F.Supp.2d 1068, 1077.)  The
court therefore exercises its discretion to award plaintiff’s counsel their
lodestar of $7,500 in attorney fees.
Defendants Does 1-100
Plaintiff has not requested dismissal of defendants Does 1-100.  A request for default judgment must include
“[a] dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an
application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil
Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a)(7).)  Plaintiff does not seek
default judgment against the Doe defendants. 
The court hereby dismisses defendants Does 1-100.
Disposition
            The court reduces the damages awarded
from $141,826 to $129,911.25 and reduces the attorney fee recovery from $11,250
to $7,500.  Plaintiff thus is entitled to
recover a total of $153,221.18 by default judgment.  Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is granted
in part.  The court will modify and
sign the proposed judgment on form JUD-100.
