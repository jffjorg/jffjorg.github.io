And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants plaintiff Blade Thomas's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories in part, ordering defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to provide further verified responses to form interrogatory No. 12.6 and special interrogatory No. 17.1(c) regarding requests for admission Nos. 8 and 10. The judge also grants plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatory No. 29 and requests for production No. 33, subject to a protective order to limit disclosure of documents and information about defendant's employees. The judge denies plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions against defendant.
