And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the request for default judgment filed by Jose A. Zaldana against Compton Car Wash, Inc. and Abrahim Aminpour. The plaintiff is seeking a default judgment for damages totaling $141,826, which is greater than the amount demanded in his operative first amended complaint. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to recover a total of $129,911.25 in damages, based on the allegations in the first amended complaint.

The plaintiff is also seeking attorney fees of $11,250, which is based on a lodestar of $7,500 and a 1.5 multiplier. The court finds that the fee schedule under Local Rule 3.214(a) would limit the plaintiff's attorney fees to $3,335.48, which is not reasonable. The court exercises its discretion to award the plaintiff's counsel their lodestar of $7,500 in attorney fees.

The court also dismisses defendants Does 1-100, as the plaintiff has not requested dismissal of these defendants.

In summary, the court grants the plaintiff's request for default judgment in part, reducing the damages awarded from $141,826 to $129,911.25 and reducing the attorney fee recovery from $11,250 to $7,500. The plaintiff is entitled to recover a total of $153,221.18 by default judgment.
