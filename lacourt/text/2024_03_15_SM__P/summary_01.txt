And here is the English-text summary:

Tentative Ruling: The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for pretrial financial discovery, citing the need to protect the defendants' financial privacy. The court finds that the plaintiff has not established a substantial probability of prevailing on claims entitling her to punitive damages. While the plaintiff presents evidence of an alleged assault by defendant Weiss, the court concludes that the evidence does not rise to the level of establishing a substantial probability of prevailing on the claims. The court will consider an order that defendants prepare appropriate financial disclosure information prior to trial, so that it can be readily and immediately produced to the plaintiff, should the matter proceed to a punitive damages phase.
