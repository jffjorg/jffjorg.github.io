RULING
Plaintiff Herrick Productions, LLC Motion to Strike
Supplemental Expert Witness Designation is DENIED in part and GRANTED in part. Defendant
properly submitted a supplemental expert witness list pursuant to CCP §
2034.280.  Supplemental expert
designations for Dertouzos, Bragoff, and Wolpert are sufficiently distinctive
from Stanley and Ackerman’s designated testimony, and thus the supplemental
expert witnesses are admissible. Supplemental expert designations for Londre
are sufficiently distinctive other than (1) the speculative nature of
television business and (2) the financial performance of The Toy Box which
overlap with Stanley and Kinnrich respectively. Thus, Londre is prohibited from
opining on these two areas as per CCP 2034.280.
