##  English Summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion filed by Plaintiff Herrick Productions, LLC to strike supplemental expert witness designations made by Defendant Mattel, Inc.  The Judge has reviewed the arguments and evidence presented and determined that some of the supplemental expert witnesses are admissible under California Code of Civil Procedure § 2034.280.  This section governs the submission of supplemental expert witness lists. 

The Judge found that experts Dertouzos, Bragoff, and Wolpert provide sufficiently distinct testimony from previously designated experts Stanley and Ackerman and are therefore admissible. However, the Judge determined that expert Londre's testimony overlaps too much with previously designated experts Stanley and Kinnrich, specifically regarding the speculative nature of the television business and the financial performance of "The Toy Box." As a result, Londre is prohibited from offering opinions on those two topics.
