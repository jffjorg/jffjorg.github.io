## Tentative Ruling Summary: Marina Pacific Hotels & Suites, LLC v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company

**Case Number:** 20SMCV00952
**Plaintiff:** Marina Pacific Hotel & Suites, LLC
**Defendant:** Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Subject:** Motion to Tax Costs

**Ruling:**  The court grants the Plaintiff's motion to tax costs in part and denies it in part.

**Key Points:**

* **Disputes:** The main dispute revolves around the recoverability of various costs incurred by the Defendant, including deposition fees, court reporter transcripts, and printing/copying costs.
* **Legal Argument:** The Plaintiff argues that certain costs are not recoverable under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 1033.5, which governs the award of costs. The Defendant counters that the costs are allowable under the statute or the court's discretion.
* **Court's Decision:**
    * **Item No. 1 (Filing and Motion Fees):** Denied. The court found that the Defendant sufficiently justified the fees.
    * **Item No. 4 (Deposition Costs):** Granted in part. The Defendant conceded to reducing the deposition fees due to a lack of court order for some depositions.
    * **Item No. 9 (Court-Ordered Transcripts):** Granted. The court found that the Defendant did not adequately demonstrate a court order for these transcripts.
    * **Item No. 12 (Models, Enlargements, Photocopies):** Denied. The court found that the costs were reasonably necessary for litigation and allowed under CCP § 1033.5(c)(4).
    * **Item No. 16 (Other):** Granted in part. The Defendant amended the cost for trial equipment rental, and the court found the amended amount reasonable.

**Significant Statements:**

* "[T]he right to costs is governed strictly by statute [citation] a court has no discretion to award costs not statutorily authorized."
*  "[W]e find no indication that the Legislature intended to circumscribe the trial court’s discretionary authority under section 1033.5(c)(4) to award costs incurred in preparing demonstratives and photocopies of trial exhibits, even though they were not ultimately used at trial, when such materials are reasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation and reasonable in amount.”

## Case Summary: Marina Pacific Hotels v. Fireman's Fund Insurance

**Case Number:** 20SMCV00952
**Plaintiff:** Marina Pacific Hotels & Suites, LLC
**Defendant:** Fireman's Fund Insurance Company
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

**Summary:**

The Judge has granted in part and denied in part Plaintiff's motion to tax costs. 

The judge denied Plaintiff's request to reduce the following costs:

* **Item No. 1:** Filing and Motion Fees ($3,371.15) -  Plaintiff failed to prove that the fees were not recoverable.
* **Item No. 12:** Models, Enlargements, and Photocopies of Exhibits ($186,455.88) -  The Court found that these costs were reasonably necessary for litigation even if not all exhibits were used.

The judge granted Plaintiff's request to reduce the following costs:

* **Item No. 4:** Deposition Costs ($17,387.83) - Defendant conceded to reducing the fees for expert depositions that were not court-ordered.
* **Item No. 9:** Court-Ordered Transcripts ($47,983.53) - Plaintiff argued these transcripts were not court-ordered, and the Judge agreed.
* **Item No. 16:** Other Costs ($6,896.79) - Defendant agreed to reduce this amount to $2,517.01 for equipment used during the trial. 

**Key Legal Points:**

* CCP § 1033.5 governs recoverable costs in California civil cases.
* The party seeking to tax costs bears the burden of proving that the costs are not recoverable.
* Courts have discretion to award costs not specifically listed in CCP § 1033.5 if they are reasonably necessary to litigation.

**Case Progress:**

This is a tentative ruling. The final ruling will be issued at the hearing on September 26, 2023.

**Tentative Ruling**

**Case Number:** 20SMCV00952
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Case Name:** Marina Pacific Hotels & Suites, LLC v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company

**Plaintiff:** Marina Pacific Hotels & Suites, LLC
**Defendant:** Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company

**Tentative Ruling:** Plaintiff's Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

**Summary:**

The Court has reviewed the parties' submissions and has made a tentative ruling on Plaintiff's Motion to Tax Costs. The Court has granted the motion for deposition costs, court-ordered transcripts, and amended the amount for "other" costs. The motion was denied for filing and motion fees, court-ordered transcripts, and models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Filing and Motion Fees:** The Court denied the request to tax the filing and motion fees, as Plaintiff failed to identify the individual challenged costs leading to the claimed amount.
2. **Deposition Costs:** The Court granted the motion to tax deposition costs, reducing the amount to $55,843.28, as the deposition fees were not ordered by the court.
3. **Court-Ordered Transcripts:** The Court granted the motion to tax court-ordered transcripts, reducing the amount to $47,983.53, as the transcripts were not ordered by the court.
4. **Models, Enlargements, and Photocopies of Exhibits:** The Court denied the request to tax these costs, as the materials were reasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation and were not excessive.
5. **Other Costs:** The Court granted the motion to tax these costs, reducing the amount to $2,517.01, as the costs for trial equipment rental were reasonably necessary to conduct the litigation.

**Next Steps:**

The parties may file written objections to this tentative ruling by September 26, 2023. The Court will consider any objections and make a final ruling on the motion.

**Significant Statements:**

* "In ruling upon a motion to tax costs, the trial court's first determination is whether the statute expressly allows the particular item and whether it appears proper on its face." (Rozanova v. Uribe (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 392, 459.)
* "Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion." (Id.)
* "The burden is on the party moving to strike or tax costs to establish that each disputed item is not recoverable." (Bach v. County of Butte (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308.)
