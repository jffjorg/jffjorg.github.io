REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT AGAINST
DEFENDANTS (filed 10/11/2024) 
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Plaintiffs’ request for
entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On January
12, 2024, Plaintiffs Northland Thea LLC; Northland Thea Portfolio LLC;
Northland Thea Portfolio II LLC; Northland Thea Portfolio III LLC; and
Northland Thea Portfolio IV LLC filed the instant action against Defendants Darrell
Weaver and Shaun Williams.
 
The Complaint
alleges a cause of action for Breach of Lease. 
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. Plaintiffs own an apartment complex located at
1000 W. 8th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90017. Defendants
entered into a 12-month lease for Unit 3302. Plaintiffs allege that after
entering the Lease, Defendants stopped paying rent, but continued to occupy the
Premises. On or about July 26, 2023, after Defendants did not pay rent or quit
within the three day notice period, Plaintiffs brought an unlawful detainer
action against Defendants seeking, inter alia, forfeiture of the Lease,
possession of the Premises, and past-due rent due from April 2023, onward (the
“Unlawful Detainer Action”). In the
Unlawful Detainer Action, the parties agreed to and entered an Unlawful
Detainer Stipulated Judgment for possession of the Premises only (the
“Stipulated Judgment”), wherein Defendants agreed that, inter alia, (i) the
Lease was forfeited and (ii) Defendants were to return the Premises to
Plaintiffs. The
Stipulated Judgment expressly provided that the parties did not waive their
right to seek to recover money damages later. Defendants are liable for the full amount of Plaintiffs’ damages
accrued through September 15, 2023, including at least $134,000.00 in past-due
rent
 
On October 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant request
for entry of default judgment against Defendants.
 
II.DISCUSSION
 
A.     
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking
judgment on the default by the Court must file a Request for Court Judgment,
and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible
evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as
necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of
judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought;
(7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an
application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.

JC Form CIV-100 must be used to request court
judgment. Here, Plaintiffs have not submitted JC Form CIV-100 in support of their
request. Plaintiffs submitted a declaration by
Plaintiffs’ attorney and a proposed judgment. However, since Plaintiffs have
not submitted JC Form CIV-100, Plaintiffs have not complied with all the
requirements for default judgment.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiffs’ request for
entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
