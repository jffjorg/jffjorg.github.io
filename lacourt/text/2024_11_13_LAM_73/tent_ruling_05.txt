MOTION FOR ORDER COMPELLING PLAINTIFF TO
RETURN MISAPPROPRIATED FUNDS (filed 10/21/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff
to Return Misappropriate Funds is DENIED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 23, 2024, Plaintiffs Lingli Li (“Li”) and Atelier
LLC filed this action against Defendant Wangyuxin Dong (“Dong”). 
 
Plaintiffs allege the following causes of action:
1.     
Breach of Fiduciary Duties
2.     
Breach of Contract 
3.     
Conversion
4.     
Unjust Enrichment
 
The Complaint alleges the following. On or around January 11,
2022, Li and Dong formed Atelier LLC, a jewelry company. (Complaint, ¶ 1.) Li
and Dong each owned 50% of the business and profits were split between the
member. (Ibid.) The parties entered into an Operating Agreement.
(Complaint, ¶ 2.) Li alleges that starting in January 2024, Dong began to try
to take over the LLC as the sole owner. (Complaint, ¶ 16.) On or about, July 13, 2024, Dong
knowingly and intentionally took, without permission, property owned by the LLC
such as furniture and inventory for her own personal and commercial gain. (Complaint, ¶ 57.) On or about July 13, 2024, Dong held
herself out to the public and existing clients as the sole business owner of
the LLC. (Complaint, ¶ 20.) On or about July 15,
2024, Dong changed the email and Instagram account
passwords of the LLC so that Li was unable to access the accounts and run the
business. (Complaint, ¶ 23.) On or about July 29, 2024, Dong without
permission from or notice to Ms. Li, as required under the Agreement,
disconnected the water and power bill (LADWP) from the LLC’s leased studio and
changed the address of the LLC-owned account to her own personal address. (Complaint, ¶ 24.)
 
On October 9, 2024, Defendant Dong filed a Cross-Complaint
against Cross-Defendant Li. The Cross-Complaint alleges the following causes of
action:
1.     
Breach of Contract 
2.     
Breach of Fiduciary Duty
3.     
Defamation
4.     
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
5.     
Misappropriation of LLC Funds and Unjust Enrichment
6.     
Perjury and Fabrication of Evidence
 
On October 21, 2024, Defendant Dong filed a Motion for Order
Compelling Plaintiff to Return Misappropriated Funds, arguing:
·       This motion is made under sections 430.10 and 128.7 of the
Code of Civil Procedure on the grounds that the Plaintiff's actions of
transferring LLC funds to her personal account without the Defendant’s consent,
and subsequently closing the business bank account without Defendant’s consent,
constitute a breach of fiduciary duty conversion, and misappropriation of
funds.
·       Furthermore, the unauthorized transfer of funds and closure of the
business bank account are inconsistent with statutory obligations and may
constitute criminal behavior under California Penal Code §§ 484 and 503. 
·       The cause of action for the Plaintiff’s claims is not supported under
these grounds, and therefore, Defendant seeks an order compelling the Plaintiff
to return the wrongfully transferred amount of $6,870 to the Business account
or $3,435 to Defendant's personal account, representing the Defendant's
rightful 50% share of the LLC.
 
No opposition or reply was filed.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      No Proof of
Service
 
As an initial
matter, the Court notes that the Motion does not include a proof of service
demonstrating the Motion was properly served on Plaintiffs. Failure to give
notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory requirements but of
due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156
Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) Therefore, the Motion cannot be granted if Defendant failed
to properly serve Plaintiffs with the Motion. 
 
B.      Procedural
Deficiencies
 
Next, the
Court notes there are multiple procedural deficiencies with Defendant’s Motion.
First, it is unclear on what grounds Defendant is bringing the instant Motion. Defendant
states that she is bringing this Motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 128.7 and 430.10.
 
CCP section
128.7 provides a 21-day safe harbor provision whereby the offending party can
avoid sanctions by withdrawing the improper pleading. (See Galleria Plus,
Inc. v. Hanmi Bank (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 535, 538.)
CCP section 128.7(b) provides that
by signing and filing a pleading, an attorney “is certifying that to the best
of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry
reasonable under the circumstances, all of the following conditions are met:
(1) [i]t is not being presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to
harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of
litigation[;] (2) [t]he claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein
are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,
modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law[;]
(3) [t]he allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support
or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after
a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery[;] (4) [t]he
denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if
specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or
belief.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7(b).) CCP section 128.7 authorizes the court
to impose appropriate sanctions upon attorneys or parties that have violated
subsection (b). (Id., § 128.7(c).) 
 
CCP 430.10
provides that the party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been
filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the
pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause
of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the legal
capacity to sue.
(c) There is another action pending between the same parties
on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,
“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context—any
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The
only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p.
747.) 
 
In Defendant’s Motion, she requests that the
Court issue an order compelling Plaintiff to return misappropriated funds,
specifically “$6,870 to the LLC or $3,435 to Defendant, representing
Defendant's rightful share of the misappropriated funds, and pay the balance of
$301.51 owed to State Farm Insurance.” (Motion, p. 2.) 
 
The Court does not find that either Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 or 430.10 supports
Defendant’s request. Further, if Defendant is bringing her Motion as a demurrer
pursuant to CCP 430.10, Defendant does not address Plaintiff’s allegations or establish
how Plaintiff’s causes of action are unsupported. Defendant also failed to file
a meet and confer declaration with her Motion. Although Defendant is an in
propria persona party, she is treated like any other party and thus must adhere
to the rules of procedure. (See, e.g., Nwosu v. Uba (2004) 122
Cal.App.4th 1229, 1246-47.) 
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s Motion for
Order Compelling Plaintiff to Return Misappropriate Funds is DENIED.
 
III. DISPOSITION
 

Defendant’s Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff to Return
Misappropriate Funds is DENIED.
