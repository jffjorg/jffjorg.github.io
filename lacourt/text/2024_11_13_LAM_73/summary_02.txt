Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC's motion to compel arbitration, finding that Plaintiff's claims are arbitrable and that Defendant has standing to enforce the arbitration provision as a named third-party beneficiary. The court concludes that the arbitration provision in the lease agreement is valid and enforceable, and that Defendant has met its initial burden to show that an agreement to arbitrate exists and that Plaintiff's claims fall within the scope of the agreement. The court also finds that Defendant is an intended third-party beneficiary to the lease agreement, and therefore can compel Plaintiff's claims to arbitration. The action is stayed pending the completion of arbitration.
