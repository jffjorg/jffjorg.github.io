And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for an order compelling the plaintiff to return misappropriated funds. The defendant, Wangyuxin Dong, claims that the plaintiff, Lingli Li, and Atelier LLC, have misappropriated funds and is seeking an order to compel the plaintiff to return $6,870 to the LLC or $3,435 to the defendant, representing the defendant's rightful share of the misappropriated funds. The judge found that the defendant failed to properly serve the motion on the plaintiffs and that the motion contains procedural deficiencies. Specifically, the judge noted that the defendant failed to file a proof of service, failed to address the plaintiff's allegations, and failed to file a meet and confer declaration with the motion. As a result, the judge denied the motion.
