And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the petition to change the name has been granted. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the name meets these requirements, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not legible or correctly spelled, the petitioner must attend the hearing to provide a corrected proposed decree. A signed copy of the decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
