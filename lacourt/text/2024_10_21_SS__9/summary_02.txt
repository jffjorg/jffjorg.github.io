And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the petition filed by the Petitioner on the grounds that no proof of publication has been filed and that the Petitioner failed to provide sufficient identification tied to a fingerprint on file, necessary for the Court to run a criminal history assessment. The Court has already continued the hearing once to allow the Petitioner additional time to file the required documents, but the Petitioner has failed to do so. As a result, the petition is dismissed without prejudice, and the Petitioner is given the opportunity to file a new petition and provide the necessary documentation.
