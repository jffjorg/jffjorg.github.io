 Case Number:  24STCP01714    Hearing Date:   October 21, 2024    Dept:  9 The petition is denied on the ground
that no proof of publication has been filed. 
The Court has already continued the hearing once to allow Petitioner
additional time to file proof of publication, but Petitioner has nonetheless
failed to file proof of publication.  The
petition is dismissed without prejudice. 
Petitioner may file a new petition and file proof of publication.  
 
The petition is denied on the
additional ground that Petitioner has failed to provide any form of
identification tied to a fingerprint on file, which is necessary for the Court
to run a criminal history assessment.  On
July 29, 2024, the Court continued the instant hearing for Petitioner to enable
Petitioner to pursue one of various options to provide sufficient information
for the Court to run a criminal history assessment.  However, Petitioner failed to do so.  Accordingly, the petition is also denied and
dismissed without prejudice on this additional ground.  
 
Court Clerk to give notice.
