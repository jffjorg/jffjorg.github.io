Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has temporarily delayed the hearing for the petition for name change until January 13, 2025, at 9:30 am. The petitioner must provide proof of publication of the petition at least one week before the new hearing date. If this is not done, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice.

Additionally, the judge has ordered the petitioner to clear two outstanding bench warrants before the court will rule on the petition. The petitioner must file written proof that the warrants have been fully addressed and resolved at least two weeks before the new hearing date. If this is not done, the hearing will be taken off the calendar without prejudice, but the petition may be re-added to the calendar once the warrants have been cleared. The court clerk will run a new criminal history assessment before the new hearing date to verify that the warrants have been cleared.
