This Tentative Ruling sustains the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's Ninth Cause of Action for aiding and abetting. The Court concludes that the County, as a public entity, is immune from aiding and abetting. The plaintiff's claim for aiding and abetting is based on the statutory claims, but the Court finds that there is no authority recognizing liability against the government for aiding and abetting. The Court also notes that the plaintiff has failed to provide any authority supporting liability against the government for aiding and abetting. Therefore, the Court sustains the demurrer and orders the defendant to give notice.
