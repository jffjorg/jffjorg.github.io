And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving medical negligence. The plaintiff, Saghar Yadegar, filed a lawsuit against several defendants, including Cedars-Sinai Health System, alleging medical negligence. The case has undergone several developments, including the dismissal of two defendants and the filing of a notice of settlement. Cedars-Sinai has now filed a motion to file two documents under seal, claiming that they contain confidential information that should not be publicly disclosed. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the overriding interest in keeping the information confidential outweighs the right of public access. The judge has ordered the two documents, including the court's minute order and the plaintiff's notice of ruling, to be sealed.
