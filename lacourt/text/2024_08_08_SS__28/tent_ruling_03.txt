 Case Number:  21STCV47154    Hearing Date:   August 8, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  December 28, 2021, Plaintiff Saghar Yadegar, by and through her guardian ad  litem Samira Yadegar (“Plaintiff”), filed this action against Defendants Nestor  R. Gonzalez, M.D. (“Gonzalez”), Zachary Barnard, M.D. (“Barnard”), Cedars-Sinai  Health System (“Cedars-Sinai”), and Does 1-50 for medical negligence.  On  May 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint.  On  June 20, 2022, Gonzalez and Cedars-Sinai filed an answer.  On  June 21, 2022, the Court dismissed Barnard with prejudice at Plaintiff’s  request.  On  December 28, 2023, the Court dismissed Gonzalez with prejudice at Plaintiff’s  request.  On  August 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement.  On  June 10, 2024, the Court granted Petitioner Samira Yadegar’s Revised Petition  for Approval of Compromise of Claim filed on January 19, 2024, as supplemented.  On  June 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of ruling.  On  June 18, 2024, the Court signed the Revised Order Approving Compromise of Claim  or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with a  Disability.  On  June 7, 2024, Cedars-Sinai filed a motion to file documents under seal.  The motion was set for hearing on August 8,  2024.  No party has filed an opposition. PARTY’S REQUEST  Cedars-Sinai  asks the Court to file the June 10, 2024 minute order and June 14, 2024 notice of ruling under seal.  LEGAL STANDARD  Under  California Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d), “[t]he court may order that a record  be filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes  the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding interest supports  sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding  interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed  sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve  the overriding interest.” DISCUSSION  Cedars-Sinai  asks the Court for an order to file under seal (1) the Court’s June 10, 2024 minute  order granting Plaintiff’s Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise or Compromise  of Pending Action of a Person with a Disability and (2) Plaintiff’s June 14,  2024 notice of ruling.  Cedars-Sinai  argues that the documents contain non-public, sensitive, and confidential  information related to Plaintiff, Cedars-Sinai, and third parties.  As part of their settlement agreement, the parties  intended this information to be confidential.   (Hall Dec. ¶ 3.)  Cedars-Sinai believes  that disclosure of the confidential information in the documents would result  in a substantial risk of serious injury to the parties and to third parties.  Based  on the facts stated in Cedars-Sinai’s motion, the Court finds that (1) There  exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the documents; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the documents; (3) A  substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced  if the documents are not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and  (5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.  The Court therefore grants the motion and  orders the two documents sealed.  CONCLUSION  The  Court GRANTS Defendant Cedars-Sinai Health System’s motion to file documents under seal.  The Court seals (1) the Court’s June 10, 2024  minute order granting Plaintiff Saghar Yadegar’s Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise or  Compromise of Pending Action of a Person with a Disability and (2) Plaintiff Saghar Yadegar’s  June 14, 2024 notice of ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. Moving party is ordered to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
