  Case Number:  21STCV26619    Hearing Date:   August 8, 2024    Dept:  28 Having considered the moving papers, the Court rules  as follows.  BACKGROUND  On July 20,  2021, Plaintiff Alton Dunn (“Plaintiff”) filed this personal injury action against  Defendants Oscar Calderon, Charter Communications LLC,  and Does 1-50 for negligence.  On October 7,  2021, the Court found that this case (21STCV26619) and case number 21STCV13383  are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).  Case number 21STCV13383 became the lead case.  The cases were assigned to Department 28 of  the Spring Street Courthouse for all purposes.  On January  18, 2023, Defendants Calderon and Charter Communications, Inc. (“Defendants”)  filed an answer.  On March 11,  2024, the Court denied Defendants’ motion to consolidate this case (21STCV26619)  and case number 21STCV13383.  The Court  acknowledged that the cases “were deemed related on October 7, 2021, and were  both assigned to Department 28.”   However, on October 12, 2021, case number 21STCV13383 was transferred to  Department 30 in an inventory transfer.   Because the cases were no longer in the same department, Local Rule  3.3(g)(1) prevented consolidation.  Effective May  13, 2024, case number 21STCV13383 was transferred to Department T at the  Alhambra courthouse.  On July 11,  2024, Defendants filed a “Motion to Transfer Venue.”  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.  Trial is set  for September 6, 2024.  PARTIES’ REQUEST  Defendants ask  the Court to transfer the case to Department T of the Alhambra Courthouse.  LEGAL STANDARD            Local  Rule 2.3(b)(2) provides that “[p]roceedings concerning transfer of a Personal  Injury Action shall be determined in the Central District or in the North  District in one of the departments designated to hear those matters (‘Personal  Injury Court’).”  DISCUSSION  Defendants ask the Court to transfer this case (21STCV26619)  to Department T at the Alhambra courthouse, where related case 21STCV13383 is  now pending.   The related cases  apparently became separated in an inventory transfer that overlooked the  October 7, 2021 order relating them.    This case  continues to be related to case number 21STCV13383,  which was designated the lead case.  The  Court therefore finds that it is appropriate to transfer this case to  Department T of the Alhambra Courthouse, where case number 21STCV13383 is  pending.  The Court grants the motion.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS the motion to transfer this case (case number 21STCV26619) to  Department T of the Alhambra Courthouse filed by Defendants Oscar Calderon and Charter Communications LLC.  The Court  transfers the case.  The Court vacates all future dates in case number  21STCV26619.  By request of Department T, an OSC re Why the Cases  Should Not Be Consolidated is set for September 4, 2024 at 8:30 in Department  T.  Moving parties are ordered to give notice of this  ruling.  Moving parties are ordered to file the proof of  service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
