Jenkins (“Jenkins”) and Does 1-50 for general  negligence and premises liability.  On  March 29, 2022, Jenkins filed an answer and a cross-complaint against  Cross-Defendants Norma Burks (“Burks”) and Roes 1-25 for declaratory relief,  implied indemnity and equitable apportionment.  On  December 22, 2022, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendant  Emotional Health Association (“EHA”) as Doe 1. (EHA later clarified that its  correct name was Emotional Health Association Corporation dba Share!)  On  June 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint.  On  July 12, 2023, Jenkins filed an answer.  On  September 7, 2023, the Court sustained EHA’s demurrer with leave to amend.  On  October 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint against Jenkins,  EHA, and Does 1-50 for general negligence and premises liability.  On  November 6, 2023, Jenkins filed an answer.  On  December 12, 2023, the Court sustained EHA’s demurrer to the second amended  complaint with leave to amend.  On  January 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a third amended complaint against Jenkins,  EHA, and Does 1-50 for general negligence and premises liability.  On  January 10, 2024, Jenkins filed an answer.  On  January 18, 2024, EHA filed an answer and a cross-complaint against  Cross-Defendant Norma Burkes (“Burkes”) and Moes 1-25 for indemnification,  apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief.  On  May 14, 2024, the Court granted Jenkins’s motion for summary judgment.  On June 7, 2024, the Court entered judgment  for Jenkins.  B.   These motions  On  May 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel EHA’s further responses to  request for production of documents, set one.   The motion was set for hearing on July 5, 2024. On June 21, 2024, EHA  filed an opposition.  On  June 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel EHA’s further responses to  Plaintiff’s first set of interrogatories.   The motion was set for hearing on July 3, 2024.  On June 20, 2024, EHA filed an opposition.  The  Court continued the hearings to August 8, 2024.  PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS  A.      Informal Discovery Conference  The  Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts  Effective October 10, 2022 (Filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub  Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery  until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion  to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and  complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses  to Discovery.”  The  parties participated in IDCs on April 5, 2024, May 15, 2024, and June 27, 2024.  B.       Timeliness of motions  A  notice of motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of  the service of the verified responses, or any supplemental verified responses,  or on or before any later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c) [demand for inspection]; Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.300, subd. (c) [interrogatories].)   Failure to file a motion by this deadline constitutes a waiver of any  right to compel further responses.  EHA  does not dispute the timeliness of Plaintiff’s motions.  C.   Meet and confer  A  motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or interrogatories  must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil  Procedure section 2016.040.  (See Code  Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd (b)(2) [demand for inspection]; Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.300, subd. (b)(1) [interrogatories].)   “A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts  showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each  issue presented by the motion.”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)   Plaintiff has provided meet and confer declarations.  D.      Separate Statement  With  exceptions that do not apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,  requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a separate  statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of  factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is  warranted.   Plaintiff has filed separate statements.  APPLICABLE LAW  A.   Demand for inspection  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 provides in part:  “(a) On receipt of a response to a demand for  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an  order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems  that any of the following apply:  “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is  incomplete.  “(2) A representation of inability to comply is  inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  “(3) An objection in the response is without merit or  too general.  “(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with  each of the following:  “(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing  good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.  “(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and  confer declaration under Section 2016.040.  “(3) In lieu of a separate statement required under  the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a  concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.  “(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45  days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified  response, or on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party  and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any  right to compel a further response to the demand.  * * *   “(h) Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1031.310,  subds. (a), (b), (c), (h).)  B.   Interrogatories  Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides in  part:  “(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the  propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the  propounding party deems that any of the following apply:  “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is  evasive or incomplete.  “(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents  under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those  documents is inadequate.  “(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit  or too general.  “(b) (1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be  accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.  “(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under  the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a  concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.  “(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45  days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified  response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding  party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party  waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.  “(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further  response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make  the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,  subds. (a), (b), (c), (d).)   DISCUSSION  A.   Plaintiff’s motion to compel EHA’s further  responses to request for production of documents, set one  Served:                   November 13, 2023          Responses:             January 26, 2024          Further responses: April  26, 2024          Motion filed:         June  7, 2024            EHA has not carried its burden of  establishing the preliminary facts that are essential to its claims of attorney-client  privilege and work product protection.   (See L.
