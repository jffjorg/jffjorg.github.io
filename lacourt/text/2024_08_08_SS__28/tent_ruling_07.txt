PARTY’S REQUESTS Defendant

LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to

 “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. . . .” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g)(1).) 
DISCUSSION 
On
February 26, 2024, Defendant’s counsel asked Plaintiff’s counsel for dates to
take Plaintiff’s deposition. (Pacheco Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s counsel
responded that he would look at his calendar. (Pacheco Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. B.)
However, Plaintiff’s counsel did not provide dates.  (Pacheco Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. B.) On February 28,
2024, Defendant’s counsel asked Plaintiff’s counsel to provide dates when
Plaintiff would be available for deposition. (Pacheco
Decl., ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond to the February 28, 2024
email or provide any dates. (Pacheco Decl., ¶ 4.) 
On
May 29, 2024, Defendant’s counsel served a notice of deposition setting the
deposition on June 17, 2024. (Pacheco Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. D.) On June 13, 2024,
four days before the deposition, Plaintiff’s counsel served an objection
stating that he was unavailable. (Pacheco Decl., ¶ 6; Exh. E.)  Plaintiff’s counsel has not provided any dates
for the deposition since then. (Pacheco Decl., ¶ 6.) 
The
Court grants the motion.  Defendant’s
counsel asked Plaintiff’s counsel for dates when Plaintiff and his
counsel were available for a deposition but Plaintiff’s counsel did not provide any dates.  In light of these facts, Plaintiff’s
objection based on unavailability was not valid for purposes of Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.410.  The Court
orders Plaintiff to appear for deposition within 30 days of the hearing on this
motion. 
Defendant
requests $825.00 in sanctions based on 4.5 hours of attorney time at a rate of $170.00
per hour and one $60.00 filing fee.  Counsel
spent two hours drafting the motion and anticipated spending an additional two
hours reviewing an opposition and preparing a reply as well as 30 minutes for
appearance at the motion. 
The
Court awards $570.00 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney time and one
filing fee. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Robert
Romo’s motion to compel Plaintiff John
Dunton’s deposition.  Plaintiff is to
appear for a deposition within 30 days of the hearing on this motion.
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Robert Romo’s request
for sanctions and orders Plaintiff John
Dunton and his counsel to pay Defendant Robert Romo $570.00 within 30 days of
the hearing on this motion. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice. 
Moving
party is ordered to file a proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
