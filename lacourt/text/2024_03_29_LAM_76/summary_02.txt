And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to compel Plaintiff's mental examination. The Plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to sex and disability harassment and discrimination, which caused her to take a medical leave and be further harassed upon her return. The Defendant, Rogelio Navarete, filed a Cross-Complaint alleging emotional distress.

The judge has granted the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff's mental examination by Dr. Dennis Greenberger. The judge found that the Plaintiff's mental condition is in controversy in the action, as she claims that emotional distress is continuing/ongoing. The judge also noted that the Defendant's counsel, Bree Oswald, had submitted a declaration reflecting a sufficient meet and confer effort.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2032.020(a), 2032.310, and 2032.320, which govern mental examinations. The judge found that the Plaintiff's allegations of harassment and discrimination put her mental condition in controversy, and therefore, the Defendant is entitled to a mental examination. The judge granted the motion, but noted that the Plaintiff may be able to show the total amount of loss of earnings at the time of trial.
