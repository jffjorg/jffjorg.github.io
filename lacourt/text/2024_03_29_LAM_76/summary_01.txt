And here is the English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel compliance with a subpoena served on Clearwater Properties. The subpoena was served by Plaintiff Patricia Van Santen, who is seeking to compel the production of documents related to gun mounts. Defendant Robert Van Santen, who owns and operates Clearwater, objected to the subpoena. The Judge denied the motion without prejudice, finding that Plaintiff has not made a fact-specific showing of good cause for the production of each category of documents. The Judge cited California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1987.1(a), 2017, and 2031, subdivision (l), as well as case law, in support of the ruling. The Judge noted that while fishing expeditions may be permissible in some cases, the subpoena in this case is overly broad and does not demonstrate a sufficient showing of good cause for the production of the requested documents.
