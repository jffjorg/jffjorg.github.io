And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel discovery responses filed by defendant Ramin Delavari. The motion sought to compel plaintiffs Jacon Eghbalieh and Ivet Eliasi to respond to discovery requests, but the plaintiffs have not opposed the motion. The Judge has already ordered the plaintiffs to respond to the discovery requests, and therefore, the motion is moot. However, the Judge finds that the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the court's order is an abuse of the discovery process and imposes sanctions in the amount of $961.65, which is the amount of attorney fees incurred by the defendant. The Judge orders the plaintiffs and their counsel to pay the sanctions within 30 days. The matter is continued to August 2, 2024, for a final status conference, and the Judge warns that terminating sanctions may be imposed if the plaintiffs fail to comply with the court's order prior to that date.
