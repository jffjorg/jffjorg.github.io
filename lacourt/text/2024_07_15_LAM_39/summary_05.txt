And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the motion for a protective order filed by Jane Doe, the plaintiff, seeking to limit the questioning at her deposition session with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., the defendant. The court has ordered a further deposition session on June 13, 2024, without a four-hour limit. The plaintiff argues that the defendant should identify in writing the new topics it intends to question her about and limit the questioning to those topics. However, the plaintiff has failed to establish good cause for such an order and has not specified the topics not to be covered. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for a discovery referee and for the next deposition session to take place at the courthouse, as these requests were not made in the notice of motion and the plaintiff has not adequately established the circumstances warranting the involvement of a referee. The defendant is to give notice of this order and file proof of service.
