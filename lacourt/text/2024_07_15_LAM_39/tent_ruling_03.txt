MOTION
Defendant Ramin Delavari (“Defendant”) moves
to compel Plaintiffs Jacon Eghbalieh and Ivet Eliasi (“Plaintiffs”) to respond
to Form Interrogatories, set one (“FROG”), Special Interrogatories, set one
(“SROG”), and Requests for Production of Documents, set one (“RPD”).  Plaintiffs have not opposed the motion.
ANALYSIS
In its order of December 12, 2023, the court
ordered Plaintiffs to respond to the FROG, SROG, and RPD.  (See December 12, 2023 Minute Order.)  As such, the court has already entered the
order Defendant seeks.  Defendant now
asks this court to compel Plaintiffs to comply within 10 days with that order, citing
no authority for the court to do so.  Defendant’s
remedy is to seek sanctions (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (e), 2031.320,
subd. (c)), which Defendant appears to request as a fallback position.  The Court, therefore, denies as moot that
portion of Defendant’s motion requesting the court to compel Plaintiffs to
respond to the FROG, SROG, and RPD.  
The Court does find Plaintiffs’ failure to
respond to the FROG, SROG, and RPD in compliance with this court’s order of
December 12, 2023 is an abuse of the discovery process and imposes
sanctions.  (Code Civ Proc., § 2023.030.)  The court imposes sanctions against
Plaintiffs and their counsel of record, Negar Tehrani and the Tehrani Law Firm,
jointly and severally, in the amount of $961.65, which Defendant represents is
the amount of attorney fees Defendant incurred in connection with this motion,
plus the filing fee.  (Declaration of
Stephen S. Smyth, ¶¶ 5, 6.)[1]  Plaintiffs
and their counsel of record are to pay $961.65 to Defendant, by and through
counsel, within 30 days of the notice of this order.
The court otherwise continues this matter to August
2, 2024, the date set for the final status conference.  The court gives notice if Plaintiffs fail to
comply with the court’s December 12, 2023 order prior to that date, the court
intends to impose terminating sanctions.
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this
order and to file proof of service concerning it.
