MOTION
            Plaintiffs
and Judgment Creditors MHJ Group, Inc. and Kai Hou Liang (“Plaintiffs”) move to
foreclose on a charging order against the membership interests of Defendant and
Judgment Debtor AA Sunrise, Inc. (“Defendant”) in Yorba Linda Garden, LLC
(“Yorba Linda Garden”).  The court
entered judgment against Defendant in the amount of $7,700,000 in its order of
September 5, 2023.
 ANALYSIS
Assets in a
limited liability company are not subject to a monetary judgment against a
member personally.  A judgment creditor
must obtain a court order charging the assets in a limited liability company
with the amount of the judgment against the member.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 699.720(a)(2),
708.310.)  The judgment creditor may make
a motion for a charging order in the court that entered the judgment.  (See Corps. Code, §§ 15907.03, subd. (a),
16504, subd. (a), 17705.03, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §§ 708.310, 708.320.)  
The judgment
creditor’s personal service of the motion on the limited liability company
creates a lien on the judgment debtor’s interest in the limited liability
company.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.320.
subd. (a).)  Unless the court refuses to
issue the charging order, the lien continues until the judgment becomes
unenforceable.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
697.030, 697.040, 708.320, subd. (b).) 
In its order of February 5, 2024, the Court issued a charging order
against Defendant’s interest in Yorba Linda Garden.  (See February 5, 2024 Minute Order.)  Now, Plaintiffs seek to foreclose on that
interest.  
Plaintiffs’
judgment against Defendant remains unsatisfied. 
Neither Defendant nor Yorba Linda Garden has objected to or opposed this
motion.  Accordingly, the court orders
foreclosure on Defendant’s interests in Yorba Linda Garden.  (See Hellman v. Anderson (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d
840, 852; Corps. Code, §§ 15907.03, subd. (b), 16504, subd. (b), 17705.03,
subd. (b).)  
Plaintiffs are to
give notice of this order and file proof of service of same.
