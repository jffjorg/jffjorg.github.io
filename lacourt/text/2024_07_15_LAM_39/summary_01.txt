English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's thoughts on the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants. The defendants, Muranaka Farm and its owners, are seeking summary judgment on the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, failure to pay all wages due, and false promise. The plaintiff, Miguel Magdaleno, alleges that the defendants breached an oral agreement for employment and profits, and seeks damages for the alleged breach. The defendants argue that the statute of frauds bars the plaintiff's claims, and that the parties did not orally agree to the terms of the contract. The judge has determined that the defendants have not met their burden of showing that the statute of frauds bars the plaintiff's claims, and that the parties did partially perform on the agreement. The judge has also determined that the defendants have satisfied their burden of showing that the plaintiff cannot prevail on his claims for quantum meruit, failure to pay all wages due, and false promise. The judge has ordered the defendants to file a new separate statement in compliance with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1350, and has continued the matter to an appropriate date based on the court's calendar.
