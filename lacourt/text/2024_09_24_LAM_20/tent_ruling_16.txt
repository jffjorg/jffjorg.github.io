 This is an action in which Plaintiff Latoya S. Redd claims that Defendants failed to pay her $35,489.51 attorneys’ fee lien with settlement funds from case no. YC072873.  Defendants Thomas Kovich, William R. Johnson, and Defendant Tyson & Mendes, LLP (“T&M”), joined by Defendant Safeco Insurance Company of America, now assert an Anti-SLAPP Motion or Special Motion to Strike the entirety of the Complaint pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16.Johnson is an attorney at T&M.  Johnson/T&M represented Kovich as a defendant in  YC072873.  Kovich’s liability for the settlement was apparently $1,500.  Redd represented the plaintiff in YC072873.  Around September 25, 2019, Redd’s representation of the client was terminated.  Redd then asserted a fee lien.  Redd contends that it was wrongful for Defendants not to pay her lien and instead attempt to “settle around” the lien.  In this action, Redd now asserts claims for (1) concealment, (2) intentional interference with prospective economic damage, (3) intentional interference with contractual relations, (4) breach of fiduciary duty, (5) common count, and (6) negligent interference with prospective economic damages.  Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 sets forth the procedure governing anti-SLAPP motions.  In pertinent part, the statute states, “A cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(b)(1).)  The purpose of the statute is to identify and dispose of lawsuits brought to chill the valid exercise of a litigant’s constitutional right of petition or free speech.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(a); Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1055-1056.)Courts employ a two-step process to evaluate anti-SLAPP motions.  (Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 61.)  To invoke the protections of the statute, the defendant must first show that the challenged lawsuit arises from protected activity, such as an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.  (Ibid.)  From this fact, courts “ ‘presume the purpose of the action was to chill the defendant’s exercise of First Amendment rights.  It is then up to the plaintiff to rebut the presumption by showing a reasonable probability of success on the merits.’ ”  (Ibid.)  In determining whether the plaintiff has carried this burden, the trial court considers “the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(b)(2); see Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 291 (“Soukup”).)To meet their burden for the first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis, Defendants must demonstrate that the Complaint’s causes of action arise from protected activity.  That is, it must be that “defendant’s conduct by which plaintiff claims to have been injured falls within one of the four categories described in subdivision (e) . . . ‘the act underlying the plaintiff’s cause’ or ‘the at which forms the basis for the plaintiff’s cause of action’ must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.’ ”  (Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 63 (internal citations omitted).)  An “ ‘act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue’ includes: (1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e).)Subsections (e)(3)-(4) do not apply because the lien payment is not a matter of public interest.  Indeed, a statement concerns a “public issue” where it either “[(1)] concerned a person or entity in the public eye [Citations], [(2)] conduct that could directly affect a large number of people beyond the direct participants [Citations] or [(3)] a topic of widespread, public interest.”  (Rivero v. Am. Fed'n of State, Cty., & Mun. Employees, AFL-CIO (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 913, 924.)  None of these situations encompass the issue at hand: the failure to pay the subject fee lien.   Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e)(1) relates to statements made before an official proceeding.  This subsection does not apply because the claims at issue do not target filings or statements made directly to the Court in YC072873.  Rather, all of Plaintiff’s claims generally target Defendants’ failure to disburse funds to Plaintiff after a motion to enforce settlement was granted in the underlying matter.  Moreover, the court’s orders in YC072873 have not been challenged.  Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e)(2) relates to statements made in connection with an issue under consideration by a government body.  (See City of Costa Mesa v. D’Alessio Investments LLC (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 358, 372-273.)  The challenged statements need not be made before an official body, but must “relate[] to the substantive issues in the [underlying] litigation and [must be] directed to persons having some interest in the litigation.”  (Neville v. Chudacoff (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1266.)  The defendant need not separately demonstrate that a statement or writing concerned an issue of public significance if it was made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by an official proceeding or body.  (Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope and Opportunity (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1113.)Again, the premise of all of the claims at issue is Defendants’ failure to pay the subject lien; these claims do not target substantive litigation activity or communications.  (See, e.g., Shenoi Koes LLP v. Bank of Am., Nat'l Ass'n (Cal. Ct. App. June 18, 2015) 2015 WL 3814373, at *6 [“The settlement agreement itself and the conduct related to the settlement are incidental to [the] claim that its lien was unpaid. Thus . . . ‘[a]ny assertedly protected activity is not the root of the complaint; it is merely the setting in which the claims arose.’ ”].)    Because Redd’s claims do not arise from protected activity, the Motion is denied.  The RJNs are granted.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
