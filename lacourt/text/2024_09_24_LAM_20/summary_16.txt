And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the anti-SLAPP motion filed by the defendants. The defendants, Thomas Kovich, William R. Johnson, and Tyson & Mendes, LLP (T&M), joined by Safeco Insurance Company of America, have moved to strike the complaint brought by Latoya S. Redd, alleging that Redd's claims arise from protected activity under California Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16.

The judge finds that Redd's claims do not arise from protected activity and therefore denies the anti-SLAPP motion. The judge concludes that the claims at issue are not related to the settlement of case YC072873 or the substantive litigation activity or communications that occurred during the case. Rather, the claims are based on the defendants' failure to pay the attorney's fee lien, which is not a matter of public interest.

The judge also grants the request for relief from notice of the tentative ruling and directs the moving party to give notice. Counsel are encouraged to submit on the tentative ruling or appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
