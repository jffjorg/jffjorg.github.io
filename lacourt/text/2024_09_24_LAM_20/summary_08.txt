And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling finds that the Motion for Leave to Amend is granted because any prejudice would be minimal. The Motion to Compel Arbitration is also granted because the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, and there is no waiver of arbitration. The Court notes that arbitration is a highly favored means of settling disputes and will not find waiver because the jury trial is set for January 2026 and it is not apparent how the Plaintiff was prejudiced. The Court finds that the existence of the subject agreement, as well as the Plaintiff's consent, has been established. The action is stayed pending the resolution of arbitration.
