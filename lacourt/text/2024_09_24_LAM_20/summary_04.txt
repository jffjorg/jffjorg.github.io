And here is a summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the Judge is considering a request from the defendant, Katie Little, to file an amended answer to the original complaint. The amended answer will add new facts and affirmative defenses. The trial date is set for January 27, 2025. California law allows parties to amend their pleadings to further the interests of justice, and the Court will generally grant such requests unless the party seeking to amend has been dilatory in bringing the proposed amendment before the Court. In this case, it does not appear that there would be prejudice to the opposing party if the amended answer is granted, so the motion is granted. The Judge encourages counsel to give notice of the ruling and notes that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, counsel may appear remotely by LACourtConnect rather than in person.
