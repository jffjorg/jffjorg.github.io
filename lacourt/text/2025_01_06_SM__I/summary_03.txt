```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to TBWA's demurrer, which argues that the indemnity clause in the lease between SLG and TBWA covers the plaintiff's claim against SLG. The judge has granted TBWA's request for judicial notice and has found that the demurrer is sustained. The judge has concluded that the indemnity clause does not apply to the plaintiff's claim, as the injury occurred in the common area (the garage) and not in the leased premises. The judge has given SLG 30 days to amend its complaint to allege facts that would put TBWA within the indemnity provision in the lease. The judge has also noted that if SLG can amend its complaint to allege facts that support the indemnity clause, the court may reconsider its ruling.
