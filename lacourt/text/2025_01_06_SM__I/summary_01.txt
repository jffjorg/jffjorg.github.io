And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a case that was scheduled for a Final Settlement Conference (FSC) on January 6, 2025. However, no FSC materials were filed in a timely manner. The Court is unsure whether the case settled and the parties forgot to file a notice of settlement, which would be an acceptable reason for the delay. Alternatively, the Court may need to discuss why both parties ignored the Court's FSC order. In either case, the trial date is vacated. The Court will either set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re: Dismissal (Settlement) or an OSC re: sanctions against each party and counsel not to exceed $5000 each for their failure to follow the Court's orders.
