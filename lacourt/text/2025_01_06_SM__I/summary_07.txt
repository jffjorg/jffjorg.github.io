And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues in the case. The court has assigned tasks to the parties regarding trial notebooks and objections to exhibits, and assumes they will be presented during the hearing. The court also struck Buckley's 170.1/170.3 challenge as improper and intends to proceed with the trial. Buckley has the right to seek writ relief and a stay from the Court of Appeal, and if granted, the court will stay the case pending the outcome. Pomerantz filed a statement indicating he does not intend to seek damages other than economic damages and punitive damages, and the court will interpret this to mean he will not pursue other remedies at trial. If the trial does not go forward, Pomerantz reserves the right to pursue other claims and remedies in a later trial.
