 Case Number:  SC128659    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  I The court has the following comments.
 
First, the court assigned the parties tasks
concerning trial notebooks.  The court
assumes they will be presented this morning. 
Second, the court assigned tasks concerning objections to
exhibits.  The court presumes that those
objections will be incorporated into the trial notebooks as appropriate.  Third, the court received Buckley’s
170.1/170.3 challenge.  The court struck
it as improper the date it was received—January 3, 2025.  The court does not intend to stay this
action pending any writ relief Buckley might seek.  The court did that last time, but the court
believes that because the challenge was improper on its face and that this is
the second challenge, the case ought to go forward.  Of course, Buckley has the right to seek a
writ and also to seek a stay from the Court of Appeal.  If the DCA issues such a stay, or indicates
that it will consider the writ on its merits by way of an OSC or alternative
writ, the court will stay this case pending the outcome.  Otherwise, it goes forward.  Fourth, the court had instructed
Pomerantz that if he wanted the trial to go forward this week, he needed to
file a statement that he did not intend to seek damages other than economic
damages (by which the court understands the fee he claims he is owed plus any
interest thereon) and potential punitive damages should the jury so award.  The court did see such a filing.  The court will interpret that filing to mean
that Pomerantz will not pursue the other remedies as part of this trial.  If the trial goes forward and concludes, the
remedies will be lost forever under res judicata principles.  On the other hand, if the case mis-tries or
does not go forward for any reason, the court, pursuant to the discussion on
January 2, 2025, understands that Pomerantz reserves his right to pursue the
other claims and remedies in a later trial.
