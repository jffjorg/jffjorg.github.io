  Case Number:  23SMCV00555    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  I The matter is here for an FSC.  The court gave its FSC order on September 7,
2023.  However, no FSC materials were
timely filed.  That could be because the
case settled and the parties forgot to file a notice of settlement.  The court hopes that is the reason, because
it would be an excellent reason. 
However, if the case did not settle, the court will need to discuss the
reasons why both parties seemed to ignore the court’s order.  In either case, the matter is NOT READY FOR
TRIAL.  The trial date is therefore
VACATED.
 
The court will either set an OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement)
or an OSC re: sanctions against each party and each counsel not to exceed $5000
(each) for the failure to follow the court’s orders.
