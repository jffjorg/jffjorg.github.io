The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a UD case involving Viontre Hausey, who claims a right of possession. The original tenant is deceased, and Viontre claims to hold a month-to-month tenancy. However, the court does not understand the basis for Viontre's claim, and wants to know how it differs from those previously denied by Judge Tillman. The court is seeking more detail from Viontre before making a decision on the claim of possession. The hearing on December 30, 2024, was postponed, and no new papers have been filed since then. The court will need to hear more information from Viontre before proceeding.
