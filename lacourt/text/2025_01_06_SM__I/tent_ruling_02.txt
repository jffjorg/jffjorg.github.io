 Case Number:  23SMCV00851    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  I The matter is here for an FSC.  The court issued its FSC order on August 28,
2023.  The court has received no FSC
materials.  The court notes that the
parties requested a continuance, but the request was denied on December 20,
2024.  The lack of FSC materials might be
because the parties have settled, but the parties forgot to file a notice of
settlement.  The court hopes that is the
case because it would be an excellent reason for not filing such papers.  If that is not the reason, though, then the
court will need to understand why it is that the parties elected to ignore the
court’s FSC orders.  Either way, the
matter is NOT READY FOR TRIAL and the trial date needs to be VACATED.  The court will either set an OSC re:
Dismissal (Settlement)—if the case settled—or an OSC re: sanctions not to
exceed $5000 as to each party and each counsel for their collective failure to
conform to the court’s prior order.
