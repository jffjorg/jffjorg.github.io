 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to strike 
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations

Plaintiff Seda
Kangani Rashidi (“Plaintiff”) is alleged to be the owner of the rental property
located at 3755 Mound View, Studio City, California 91604.  This action arises out of an insurance claim
made by Plaintiff resulting from water loss to the property, which occurred on
January 8, 2021, when rainwater entered through the roof of the subject
property causing significant damage.  Plaintiff
alleges that she had an insurance policy with Defendant State Farm General
Insurance Company (“Defendant”) and that the water loss was covered under the
subject policy.  Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant failed to fully pay monies due under the policy and eventually
stopped communications with her.  
The second
amended complaint (“SAC”), filed May 16, 2023, alleges causes of action for:
(1) breach of contract; (2) breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing – bad
faith; and (3) financial elder abuse. 
B.    
Motion on Calendar 
On November 22,
2023, Defendant filed a motion to strike portions of the SAC. 
On January 22,
2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition brief.
On January 26,
2024, Defendant filed a reply brief. 
DISCUSSION

            Defendant
moves to strike allegations for punitive damages from the SAC in paragraphs 3,
48, 56, 63, 75, 90, 92, 106, 111, 112, 126, and 129, and the prayer for damages
at paragraph 3. 
A complaint including a request for
punitive damages must include allegations showing that the plaintiff is
entitled to an award of punitive damages.  (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253,
1255.)  A claim for punitive damages cannot be pleaded generally and
allegations that a defendant acted "with oppression, fraud and
malice" toward plaintiff are insufficient legal conclusions to show that
the plaintiff is entitled to an award of punitive damages.  (Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73
Cal.App.3d 864, 872.)  Specific factual allegations are required to
support a claim for punitive damages.  (Id.)
Civil Code § 3294
authorizes a plaintiff to obtain an award of punitive damages when there is
clear and convincing evidence that the defendant engaged in malice, oppression,
or fraud.  Section 3294(c) defines the terms in the following manner:
(1)  
"Malice" means conduct which is
intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.
(2)  
"Oppression" means despicable
conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious
disregard of that person's rights.
(3)  
"Fraud" means an intentional
misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the
defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving
a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury. 
Further, when the punitive damages are sought against
an employer, Civil Code § 3294(b) requires the plaintiff to establish the
following:
(1)  
the
employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed
him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or
authorized,
(2)  
the
employer ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded, or
(3)  
the
employer was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.
In the Court’s prior ruling on the motion to strike
the allegations for punitive damages in the FAC, the Court found: “At most, the
allegations [in the FAC] are conclusory that Defendant acted intentionally,
maliciously, oppressively, or fraudulently. 
While Plaintiff alleges that Defendant intended to delay or deny paying
policy benefits to Plaintiff, the allegations do not rise to a specific showing
that Defendant’s conduct was malicious, oppressive, or fraudulent.”  (10/6/23 Order at pp. 7-8.)  The Court previously found that Plaintiff’s
use of “buzz words” from section 3294 were not sufficient to allege oppression,
fraud, or malice.  (Id. at
p.8.)  
In the SAC, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant delayed
making payments, delayed in communications with Plaintiff and her counsel, handled
the claim oppressively/maliciously/fraudulently, etc., which forced Plaintiff
to expend her own funds to return the property to its pre-loss condition and
the delays allowed looters and vandals to enter her property, steal property,
and cause property damage.  
According to the SAC, the subject incident resulting
in the water loss to the property occurred on January 28, 2021 and Plaintiff
“timely” reported the incident to Defendant. 
(SAC, ¶¶9-11.)  Plaintiff alleges
that she retained an attorney on April 28, 2021 to communicate with Defendant
and that Plaintiff’s counsel sent numerous letters to Defendant to discuss the
loss and claim of damages. (Id., ¶¶15-21.)  Defendant’s agent responded on June 5, 2021
and Plaintiff discovered on June 8, 2021 that the property had been
vandalized.  (Id., ¶22-24.)  The parties communicated about finalizing
estimates and issuing payment, and the claim was reassigned to another adjuster
in June 2021.  (Id., ¶¶25-36.)  On July 23, 2021, Defendant issued a payment
of $30,395.19 for the dwelling repair portion of the claim.  (Id., ¶37.)  Plaintiff’s counsel continued to contact
Defendant to ask for someone to contact him to discuss the claim in August and
September 2021.  (Id.,
¶¶38-44.)  On September 23, 2021,
Defendant issued a supplemental dwelling payment on their revised estimate in
the amount of $13,467.90.  (Id.,
¶45.)  Plaintiff’s counsel continued to
contact Defendant in September and October 2021.  (Id., ¶¶46-47.)  On October 14, 2021, Defendant issued a payout
of $74,032.38 for the loss of income portion of Plaintiff’s claim.  (Id., ¶48.)  Plaintiff’s counsel contacted Defendant in
November 2021 for the supplemental dwelling payment and Defendant requested a
reinspection of the property, but the parties arrived at the inspection on
different dates.  (Id.,
¶¶49-54.)  The parties then underwent the
inspection in January 2022 and the inspector’s report was delayed.  (Id., ¶¶58-62.)  Plaintiff alleges that in February 2022, she
was assigned a new adjuster, and another inspection of the property was
ordered.  (Id., ¶¶63-64.)  The parties underwent another inspection and
on February 19, 2022, Defendant issued a supplemental payment of $130,825.48
for dwelling repairs and $8,467.62 for loss of income.  (Id., ¶68.)  In May 2022, the claim was reassigned to a
new adjuster and on June 8, 2022, Defendant issued a supplemental payment for
the cabinets in the amount of $27,569.55. 
(Id., ¶¶71-72.)  Plaintiff
alleges that on June 23, 2022, Defendant sent a “closing letter” to Plaintiff
and Defendant refused to pay the entirety of the policy benefits owed under the
policy.   (Id., ¶¶73-74.)  
Plaintiff alleges many delays in the insurance claims
process, such that she waited nearly a year and a half until Defendant sent its
“closing letter.”  While there have been
delays in the process of handling Plaintiff’s claims (including re-inspections
of the property and new adjusters), Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant
acted with malice, or that Defendant intended to cause Plaintiff injury or
despicable conduct that was in willful and conscious disregard to the right and
safety of Plaintiff.  Further, the
allegations fail to rise to a showing of oppression, or despicable conduct that
subjected Plaintiff to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of Plaintiff’s
rights.  Finally, Plaintiff has not alleged
facts showing that Defendant acted fraudulently, or made intentional misrepresentations
of fact to Plaintiff or her counsel.  At
most, Plaintiff has alleged that there were some delays and Defendant
ultimately decided that a full payout of Plaintiff’s policy was not required.  However, this in itself is not sufficient to
warrant punitive damages.  As alleged,
the SAC shows that Defendant was handling Plaintiff’s claim, was putting
adjusters on Plaintiff’s claim, required inspections to verify estimates and
claims of loss, and paid Plaintiff on her claim numerous times after
evaluations and inspections.  At this
time, the Court does not find that the allegations of the SAC rise to a level
of showing that Defendant acted with malice, oppression, and/or fraud to
warrant the imposition of punitive damages.
As such, the motion to strike is granted.  If Plaintiff discovers facts during the
discovery process that may support a showing that punitive damages are
warranted, the Court would be inclined at that time to consider where leave to
amend the complaint is proper to request punitive damages.  However, at this time, the SAC fails to rise
to this showing. 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
            Defendant
State Farm General Insurance Company’s motion to strike allegations for
punitive damages is granted without leave to amend.  
Defendant
shall
give notice of this order.  
            Note: The Court will be handling
hearings remotely on February 2, 2024. If you wish to be heard in person,
please inform the clerk and your matter will be continued to allow you to
appear personally.
