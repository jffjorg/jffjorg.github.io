And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the motion to strike allegations for punitive damages in the complaint filed by Plaintiff Seda Kangani Rashidi against Defendant State Farm General Insurance Company. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to fully pay monies due under the insurance policy and that the company's handling of the claim was malicious, oppressive, and fraudulent. The defendant argues that the allegations do not rise to the level of showing malice, oppression, or fraud to warrant punitive damages.

The judge finds that the allegations in the complaint are conclusory and do not provide specific factual allegations to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's use of "buzz words" from Civil Code § 3294, which defines the terms "malice," "oppression," and "fraud," are not sufficient to allege the necessary elements of those claims.

The judge grants the defendant's motion to strike the allegations for punitive damages and denies the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to add those allegations. The judge notes that if the plaintiff discovers facts during the discovery process that may support a showing that punitive damages are warranted, the court may consider allowing the plaintiff to amend the complaint at a later time.
