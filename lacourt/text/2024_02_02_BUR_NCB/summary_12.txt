And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented in the case, including the fact that the defendant, a public employee, was driving a government vehicle at the time of the accident. The plaintiff, John Doe, was a passenger in the vehicle and suffered injuries as a result of the accident. The judge notes that the defendant is liable for the injuries under Government Code, § 815.2(a), which states that a public entity is liable for injuries caused by an employee's act or omission within the scope of their employment. The judge also references Government Code, § 820, which holds that a public employee is liable for injuries caused by their act or omission to the same extent as a private person. The judge's ruling suggests that the defendant's negligence during the accident is the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries, and that the plaintiff is entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The case is set for a hearing on 2022-02-15, at which time the judge will issue a final ruling.
