Government Code, § 815.2(a) states: “A public
entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an
employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or
omission would, apart from this section, have given rise to a cause of action
against that employee or his personal representative.”  
Government Code, § 820 states: “(a)
Except as otherwise provided by statute (including Section 820.2), a public
employee is liable for injury caused by his act or omission to the same extent
as a private person. [¶] (b) The liability of a public employee established by
this part (commencing with Section 814) is subject to any defenses that would
be available to the public employee if he were a private person.”
