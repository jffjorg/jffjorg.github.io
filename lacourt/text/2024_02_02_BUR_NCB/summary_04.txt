Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a Tentative Ruling in the case of Khachik Grigorian v. Bank of America N.A., et al. (Case No. 23BBCV01345). The Plaintiff, Khachik Grigorian, alleges that he was pepper-sprayed and punched/kicked by unidentified individuals at a Bank of America branch in July 2021. The Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging premises liability and negligence, and later filed a motion to compel the Defendant's further responses to requests for production of documents.

The Court has denied the motion to compel further responses as moot, as the Defendant has since provided further responses to the discovery requests. The Court has also declined to award sanctions to either party, finding that the Plaintiff did not adequately meet and confer on discovery issues, but that the Defendant's failure to provide responses until after the motion was filed also contributed to the delay.

The Court has ordered that the Plaintiff provide notice of this order, and noted that the hearing in this case will be handled remotely on February 2, 2024.
