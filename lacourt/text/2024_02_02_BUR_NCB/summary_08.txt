And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a disclosure about potential bias in the case due to their own past work on Ford Motor Company matters at the law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed. John Kralik, a former associate and partner at the firm, worked on Ford matters during his time at the firm, and the court acknowledges that this could create an appearance of bias. The court does not believe it is biased, but recognizes that the parties may have a different perception. The court is offering the opportunity for either party to request recusal if they feel that the judge's prior work creates an appearance of bias. Additionally, the court will be handling hearings remotely on February 2, 2024, and parties who wish to appear in person must inform the clerk to have their matter continued to a later date.
