And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion for protective order filed by the defendants, Triumph Motorcycles (America) Ltd and BMW Motorcycles of Burbank, in a case brought by plaintiff Philippe Emile Van Doorne. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to conform their vehicle to express warranties and breached the implied warranty of merchantability. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's discovery requests are excessive and seek irrelevant information, and they request that the court limit the scope and amount of discovery.

The court declines to grant the defendants' motion outright, but grants their alternative request to limit the amount of discovery propounded on them. The court limits the number of discovery requests that the plaintiff may propound on TMA to 35 RFAs, 35 SROGs, and 35 RPDs, and allows the plaintiff to re-propound the remaining requests or re-draft the written discovery. The court also orders BMWMB to respond to the 30 RFAs, 32 SROGs, and 35 RPDs propounded by the plaintiff.

The court's decision is based on its discretion and its duty to ensure that the discovery process is efficient and reasonable. The court notes that the number of discovery requests propounded by the plaintiff is excessive and that the defendants have a right to be protected from unnecessary discovery requests. The court also encourages the parties to meet and confer about the relevant discovery at issue.
