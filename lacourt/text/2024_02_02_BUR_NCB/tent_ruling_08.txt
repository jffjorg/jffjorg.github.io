 Case Number:  23BBCV01882    Hearing Date:   February 2, 2024    Dept:  NCB In lieu of a tentative, the Court makes the following disclosure:FORD MOTOR COMPANY COURT DISCLOSURE 
 
DISCLOSURE:
John Kralik was an associate of the Law Firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed from
1979-87 and a partner in Hughes Hubbard & Reed from 1988-93. During that
time he worked on Ford Motor Company matters. Ford was a major client during
his partnership with the firm, and so some portion of his partner draw would
have originated with Ford. The Court does not feel that it is biased in this
matter but recognizes that the parties may have a different perception. If any
party feels that the Court’s prior work at Hughes Hubbard creates an appearance
of bias, please file an appropriate request for the Court to recuse prior to
the next hearing in this matter. 
 Note:
The Court will be handling hearings remotely on February 2, 2024. If you wish
to be heard in person, please inform the clerk and your matter will be
continued to allow you to appear personally.
