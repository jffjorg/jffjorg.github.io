And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion of defense counsel, Jennifer B. Gardner, to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Selling N. Atlanta, LLC and Selling N. Charleston LLC. Counsel filed the motion on December 29, 2023, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship due to the failure of the Defendants to communicate and cooperate in the representation. The Court grants the motion and sets an Order to Show Cause re Status of Representation of Defendants for March 1, 2024. The Court also notes that the Defendants are corporate entities and cannot represent themselves, and therefore, substitute counsel will need to be obtained. The hearing will be handled remotely on February 2, 2024, and parties may request to appear in person.
