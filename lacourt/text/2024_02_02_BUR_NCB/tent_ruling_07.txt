[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motions to be relieved as counsel
 



 
Defense counsel, Jeffery P. Boykin
(“Counsel”), moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Michael Donoho and
We Waffle LLC (“Defendants”).  
Counsel filed these two motions to be
relieved as counsel on December 12, 2023.  Counsel has filed the requisite forms pursuant
to CRC Rule 3.1362.  
According to the declaration of Counsel,
Counsel seeks to be relieved as counsel because Defendants did not voluntarily
consent to Counsel’s request to be relieved despite several email and telephone
requests.  (MC-052, §2.)  For these reasons, Counsel seeks to withdraw
from representing Defendants in this action. 

Counsel properly served Defendants at their
last known mailing address, which was confirmed by telephone within the past 30
days of filing the motion.  
As for future hearing dates, the Case
Management Conference and OSC re: Dismissal of Case are concurrently set for February
2, 2024.  No trial date has been
set.  Thus, there is sufficient time for Defendants
to obtain substitute counsel. 
Accordingly, the motions to be relieved as
counsel are granted.  The orders
electronically lodged by Counsel will be signed at the hearing.  The orders will become effective upon the
filing of a proof of service of a signed copy of the order on each of the
Defendants.  
In addition, as Defendant We Waffle LLC is
a corporate entity, it cannot represent itself in propria persona.  (See Rogers
v. Municipal Court (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1314, 1318.)  Thus, the Court will set an Order to Show
Cause re Status of Representation of Defendant We Waffle LLC for March 14, 2024
at 8:30 a.m. 
Notice to be provided by Counsel.
