Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Los Angeles Unified School District and Kirk Jeppson, and has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, John Doe. The plaintiff alleges that the school administrators failed to protect him from bullying and that they are liable for the harm he suffered as a result.

The judge found that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to allege a claim for negligence based on failure to warn against the defendants. The judge also overruled the demurrer to the 2nd and 3rd causes of action, which alleged that the school administrators failed to report incidents of bullying and child abuse as required by law.

However, the judge granted the motion to strike paragraphs 16-21 and 25-27 of the complaint, which contained irrelevant and unnecessary information. The judge also granted the motion to strike without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will not be allowed to re-file the stricken paragraphs.

The judge ordered the defendants to answer the complaint and scheduled a hearing for February 2, 2024. The judge also noted that he will be handling hearings remotely and that parties who wish to be heard in person must inform the clerk and have their matter continued to allow them to appear personally.
