And here is the English text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge John J. Kralik in the case of Bala Palanisamy v. Waste Management Solution, LLC, et al. (Case No. 23BBCV01940). The motion to strike portions of the First Amended Complaint was filed by Defendant Rawiwan W. Klos. The Court declines to strike paragraphs 17, 44, and 5 of the First Amended Complaint, as they provide background facts regarding the terms of the loan and note. The Court also declines to strike paragraph 52 of the 3rd cause of action for breach of guaranty against Klos, as the post-maturity interest is not based on a usurious interest rate. The Court allows the allegations regarding the contract's terms to remain, as there are more parties in this action than Klos only. The motion to strike is denied.
