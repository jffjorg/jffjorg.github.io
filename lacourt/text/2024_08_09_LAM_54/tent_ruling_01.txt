BACKGROUND
 
This is a wage and hour and wrongful termination
action. Plaintiff Marion Martinez filed the operative Second Amended Complaint
(“SAC”) on December 18, 2023, alleging violations of Labor Code Sections
1102.5, 6310, and 6311; violation of Health and Safety Code Section 1278.5;
wrongful termination in violation of Public Policy; defamation; and Private
Attorney General Act against Defendants West Hills Hospital; HCA Healthcare
Inc.; HCA Healthcare; CHC Payroll Agent, Inc.; HCA Human Resources, LLC; HCA
Human Resources Group; Los Robles Regional Medical Center; Charlene Timms; and Adam
Gardner.  
 
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.        FROGs
 
The propounding party may file motions to compel
further responses to interrogatories if it believes the responses received are
(1) evasive, (2) incomplete, or (3) if the objections raised are meritless or
overly general. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(a).) In response to a motion to
compel further responses, the respondent bears the burden of justifying any
objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245,
255.)
 
Plaintiff's Form Interrogatory 12.1 requests the
names, addresses, and phone numbers of individuals with knowledge of the
incident leading to the action. Defendant objects based on invasion of privacy.
 
Plaintiff argues that witness contact
information is discoverable under Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010, which allows
discovery of any non-privileged matter relevant to the case. This includes
information that might assist in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or
facilitating settlement. (Glenfed Development v. Superior Court (1997)
53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.) Discovery may include the identity and location of
persons with knowledge of any discoverable matter, as routine and essential
pretrial discovery. (Puerto v. Superior Court (2008) 158 Cal. App. 4th
1242, 1251-52 (2008); Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) Plaintiff argues
that Defendant’s responses are insufficient as they only list names without
providing contact information, directing Plaintiff to contact witnesses through
counsel instead. 
 
In opposition, Defendants argue that FROG No.
12.1 improperly seeks contact information of represented parties and third
parties whose information cannot be disclosed due to privacy concerns. Defendants
claim that Plaintiff’s counsel is ethically prohibited from contacting
employees whose actions might bind Defendant or establish liability. (Triple
A Machine Shop, Inc. v. State of California (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 131, 140.)

 
Plaintiff has demonstrated that the information
sought is relevant and necessary for trial preparation. Defendant’s objections
based on privacy concerns are not sufficient to outweigh Plaintiff’s need for
the information. Basic contact information does not constitute a serious
invasion of privacy. Defendant’s failure to provide timely and complete
responses, despite repeated assurances and extensions, justifies Plaintiff’s
motion to compel. Defendant’s compromise to allow contact through counsel is
insufficient, particularly when counsel does not represent all identified
witnesses. Plaintiff must be able to secure witness testimony independently to
prepare adequately for trial. 
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses to FROG no. 12.
 
B.        RPDs
 
On receipt of a response to a Request for
Production of Documents, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further responses to the demand if the demanding party deems that (1) a
statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete, (2) a representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or (3) an objection
in the response is without merit or too general. (CCP § 2031.310(a).)   
 
The RPDs involves three categories of documents:
 
1.    Documents regarding Plaintiff’s employment
terms, termination, and performance (Requests No. 1-24, 32, 35, 39).
2.    Notes, emails, and text messages about Plaintiff
from managers and coworkers (Requests Nos. 4, 6-22).
3.    Documents related to Plaintiff making complaints
during employment (Requests Nos. 4, 6-22, 29, 30).
Defendants’ objections largely consist of
boilerplate. Notwithstanding these objections, Defendant agrees to produce
Plaintiff’s termination document. Defendant objects to producing any additional
documents.
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ statements of
compliance are evasive, failing to identify specific responsive documents and
not complying with CCP § 2031.210 and § 2031.280(a). Responses must specify
what documents are being produced and identify documents withheld based on
privilege. (CCP § 2031.240(b).) 
 
In opposition, Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s
motion is largely moot because Defendant served supplemental responses to these
requests on June 19, 2024, and July 15, 2024, along with additional documents
and a production log prior to the Person Most Knowledgeable Deposition. (Lewis
Decl., ¶¶ 9, 13, Exs. 3, 5-6.) Defendant asserts that it never agreed to
supplement its response to Request No. 42. Defendants assert that Plaintiff
falsely claims that Defendants’ responses fail to identify what responsive
documents have been produced. Defendant provided a production log identifying
the responsive documents on July 15, 2024. (Lewis Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. 6.) Defendant
also contends that Plaintiff’s discovery requests are overbroad, unduly
burdensome, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. 
 
            As to the untimeliness
of the opposition, the Court will consider the brief in its discretion; there
is no showing of prejudice. Given Defendants’ supplemental responses after the
filing of this motion, the Court finds that the motion as to all except RPD no.
42 is moot. RPD 42 is not overbroad. The request specifies items such as
“emails, text messages, handwritten notes, and memoranda, personal journals,
and calendars.” Defendants’ response is inadequate.
 
            The Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further response to RPD no. 42.
 
D.        Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the
amount of $2,550 for the FROGS and $4,250 for the RPD. As the prevailing party,
Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions. Counsel claims a rate of $425 per hour and
anticipates spending 6 hours for the FROG motion and 10 hours for the RPD
motion. The Court reduces the hourly rate to $300. Aside from the statement
that counsel was previously awarded the $425 rate, there is no information to
ascertain whether this rate is reasonable for Plaintiff’s attorney. As for the
hours spent, the Court reduces the hours to 3 for the FROG motion and 4 for the
RPD motion. 
 
The Court awards sanctions to Plaintiff
in the amount of $2,100. Sanctions are to be paid to Plaintiff’s counsel by
Defendants and Defendants’ counsel, jointly, within 30 days.
