Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a wage and hour and wrongful termination action brought by Plaintiff Marion Martinez against Defendants West Hills Hospital, et al. The Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories (FROGs) and Requests for Production of Documents (RPDs) that were served on Defendants.

The judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to FROG no. 12, which requests witness contact information, finding that Plaintiff has demonstrated a need for the information and that Defendants' objections based on privacy concerns are not sufficient to outweigh that need.

The judge also grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel further response to RPD no. 42, finding that Defendants' responses were inadequate and that the request was not overbroad.

Finally, the judge awards sanctions to the Plaintiff in the amount of $2,100, which is to be paid by Defendants and their counsel within 30 days. The sanctions were awarded due to Defendants' non-compliance with discovery requests and their failure to adequately respond to Plaintiff's motions.
