Plaintiff disputes this fact, no admissible evidence is presented to support
the allegation that Williams was “working as an agent of his mother, a manager
at AHM, and AHM at the time of the accident.” (Pl. Resp. to UMF 11, 12.)

Plaintiff argues that the “documents provided are unclear on this point.” (Pl.
Resp. to UMF 18.) However, Part I, Item 1 of AHFC’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
states: “AHFC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Honda Motor Co., Inc. …
AHM is a wholly-owned subsidiary … of Honda Motor Co., Ltd.” (Julian Decl.,
Exh. F, at p. 1.)
