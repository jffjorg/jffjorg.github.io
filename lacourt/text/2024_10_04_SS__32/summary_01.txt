And here is a summary in English text:

The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., has moved for summary judgment in a lawsuit filed by plaintiffs Brian Massey and Latanya Wiggs, alleging that the defendant owned, operated, or negligently entrusted a vehicle that collided with their vehicle on August 24, 2020. The defendant argues that the plaintiffs cannot establish vicarious liability or independent negligence, and that the Graves Amendment preempts California law. The plaintiffs argue that there is a question of fact regarding whether Trenton Williams, the driver of the vehicle, was an employee of AHM or merely a permissive user of the vehicle.

The court finds that the defendant has met its initial burden to establish the absence of a triable issue of fact and that the plaintiffs have failed to raise a triable issue of fact regarding vicarious liability or independent negligence. The court also finds that the Graves Amendment applies and that the defendant is not liable for the accident.

As a result, the court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and orders the defendant to file and serve a proposed judgment within 10 days.
