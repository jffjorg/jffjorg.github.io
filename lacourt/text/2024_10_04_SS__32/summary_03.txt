And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff, Jose Ariel Mejia-Morales, to submit to a mental examination by Dr. Ari Kalechstein. The plaintiff does not oppose the motion. The judge finds that the plaintiff's assertions of symptoms consistent with traumatic brain injury and his claims that doctors have recommended continuing and follow-up treatment to address his cognitive issues resulting from the accident place his mental health at issue, such that good cause exists for the examination. The defendants have properly specified the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, and the proposed order specifies the diagnostic tests and procedures to be employed. The motion was also accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. The judge orders that the plaintiff shall appear for examination within 30 days and that the defendants shall provide notice of this ruling and file a proof of service of such.
