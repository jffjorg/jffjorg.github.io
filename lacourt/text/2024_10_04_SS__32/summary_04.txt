```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Roberto Frausto Acevedo. The motion is based on Plaintiff's failure to respond to Defendant's special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The judge notes that Plaintiff's counsel was informed that Plaintiff may be held in a correctional facility, which raises concerns about whether Plaintiff had actual notice of the motion. The judge is denying the motion without prejudice, meaning that Defendant can re-file the motion if it can provide additional evidence of Plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests.
