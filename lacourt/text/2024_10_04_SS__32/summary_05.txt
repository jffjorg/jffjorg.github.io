And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by plaintiff Rodney Antonio Howard to amend the complaint to add allegations supporting a request for punitive damages against defendants Imperial Western Products aka Biotane Pumping, Co-West Commodities, Inc., and Denali Water Solutions, LLC. The motion is unopposed and the judge has granted the request. The judge notes that the plaintiff has complied with the California Rules of Court requirements for a motion to amend a pleading and that the amendment is necessary and proper because the claim for punitive damages more fully comports with the law and the events that transpired on the date of the incident. The judge also finds that the defendants will not be prejudiced by the amendment, as trial is not until April 22, 2025, and the factual basis for the assertion for punitive damages was available to the defendants even prior to it becoming known to the plaintiff.
