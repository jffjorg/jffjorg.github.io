And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Lastotchkina's unopposed motion to quash service of the summons and complaint in an unlawful detainer action. Lastotchkina argued that Shores Barrington, LLC did not properly serve a three-day notice to pay rent or quit, which is required under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง1161. However, the judge found that the requirement to serve a three-day notice to pay rent or quit is not a jurisdictional requirement, but rather an element of the unlawful detainer cause of action. The judge cited binding precedent from the Second District Court of Appeal in Borsuk v. Appellate Division of the Superior Court (2015), which held that a motion to quash is not the proper vehicle for challenging service of a three-day notice to pay rent or quit. Therefore, the judge denied Lastotchkina's motion and allowed the unlawful detainer action to proceed.
