Shores Barrington,
LLC v. Lastotchkina, Case No. 23SMCV05805
Hearing Date
February 13, 2024
Defendant
Lastotchkina’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint (UNOPPOSED) 
 
In this unlawful
detainer action defendant Lastotchkina moves to quash service of the summons
and complaint on the grounds that plaintiff Shores Barrington, LLC did not
properly serve the three-day notice to pay rent or quit required under Cal.
Code of Civ. Proc. §1161. 
 
“On a motion to
quash [summons], the issue before the trial court and on review is ‘strictly
limited to the question of jurisdiction over the defendant.’” School
District of Okaloosa County v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1126, 1131.
The requirement to serve a three-day notice to pay rent or quit is an element
of an unlawful detainer cause of action, not a jurisdictional requirement. Borsuk
v. Appellate Division of the Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 607,
613. Therefore, “a motion to quash is not the proper vehicle” for challenging
service of a three-day notice to pay rent or quit. Id. at 618. 
 
Borsuk, binding precedent
from the Second District Court of Appeal, is on point. Lastotchkina
cannot quash Barrington’s summons and complaint by challenging the three-day
notice. Proper service of the three-day notice does not confer jurisdiction on
this court; proper service of the complaint does. Lastotchkina does not argue
that the complaint was improperly served. 
DENIED.
