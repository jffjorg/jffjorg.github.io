Essex Management
Corporation v. Shontel Johnson, Case No. 23SMUD01577
Hearing Date February
13, 2024
Defendant Shontel
Johnson’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Written Discovery (UNOPPOSED) 
 
Plaintiff Essex
sues defendant Johnson for unlawful detainer. Johnson’s defenses include a
claim that Essex breached the warranty of habitability. The unlawful detainer
case has been consolidated with Johnson’s lawsuit against Essex for breach of
the warranty of habitability and related claims. 
 
On November 7,
2023 Johnson propounded special interrogatories, form interrogatories, requests
for production of documents, and requests for admission. Johnson argues Essex
to date has not provided compliant responses.
 
On January 24,
2024 the parties appeared at an informal discovery conference, after which the
court gave Johnson leave to file a discovery motion “if necessary.” Johnson now
moves to compel further responses to written discovery.
 
There is no
opposition to the motion, which the court will treat as an admission that Johnson’s
arguments have merit and that Essex’s discovery responses were insufficient. 
 
Essex is ordered
to supplement its discovery responses as requested in Johnson’s motion. The
court declines to issue sanctions, however, as Essex has consistently responded
to Johnson’s discovery requests, supplemented them, and participated in the
discovery process. The responses at issue here, though deficient, were not made
in bad faith. 
 
Further, the
requests for admission will not be deemed admitted, as such an order would be
tantamount to issuing terminating sanctions against Essex, an unduly harsh
outcome. Essex is ordered, however, to supplement its responses to RFAs,
without the objections identified as baseless in the motion. 
 
GRANTED.
