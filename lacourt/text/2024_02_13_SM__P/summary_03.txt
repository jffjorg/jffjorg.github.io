And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to Defendant Shontel Johnson's motion to compel further responses to written discovery. The Plaintiff, Essex Management Corporation, sued Johnson for unlawful detainer, but Johnson claims that Essex breached the warranty of habitability. The court has consolidated the cases. Johnson propounded discovery requests on November 7, 2023, but Essex has not provided compliant responses. The parties appeared at an informal discovery conference on January 24, 2024, and the court gave Johnson leave to file a discovery motion. The motion was unopposed, and the court will treat it as an admission that Johnson's arguments have merit. The court orders Essex to supplement its discovery responses as requested in Johnson's motion, but declines to issue sanctions because Essex has consistently responded to Johnson's discovery requests. The court also orders Essex to supplement its responses to requests for admission without objections.
