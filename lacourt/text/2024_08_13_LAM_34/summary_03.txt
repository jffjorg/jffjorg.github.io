And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the Highlands Owners Association's unopposed motion to file a cross-complaint. The cross-complaint alleges causes of action against Christy Cuozzo, the plaintiff, for breach of CC&Rs, preliminary and permanent injunction, and declaratory relief. The judge finds that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiff's complaint. The judge also finds that the defendants have acted in good faith and have not opposed the motion, and therefore grants the motion. The defendants are ordered to file the cross-complaint within 10 days.
