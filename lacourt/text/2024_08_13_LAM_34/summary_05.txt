And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Highlands Owners Association's unopposed motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Christy Cuozzo, the plaintiff. The proposed cross-complaint alleges causes of action against the plaintiff for breach of CC&Rs, preliminary and permanent injunction, and declaratory relief. The judge found that the proposed cross-complaint is compulsory and arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiff's complaint. The judge also found that the defendant has acted in good faith and granted the motion, ordering the defendant to file the cross-complaint within 10 days.
