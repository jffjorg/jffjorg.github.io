ANALYSIS:
Legal Standard
“Any party to an arbitration in
which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or
vacate the award. The petition shall name as respondents all parties to the
arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration
award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) 
“A petition under this chapter shall:
(a)            
Set forth the substance of or have
attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the
existence of such an agreement.
             (b)            
Set forth names of the arbitrators.
(c)            
Set forth or have attached a copy of the
award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4, subds. (a)–(c).)
“If a petition or response under
this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as
made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in accordance
with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates
the award or dismisses the proceedings.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)
“If an award is confirmed, judgment
shall be entered in conformity therewith. The judgment so entered has the same
force and effect as, and is subject to all the provisions of law relating to, a
judgment in a civil action of the same jurisdictional classification; and it
may be enforced like any other judgment of the court in which it is entered, in
an action of the same jurisdictional classification.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1287.4.)
Discussion
“We begin with the premise that
courts will not render opinions on moot questions.” (Watkins v. Wachovia
Corp. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1576, 1588, citation omitted.)
Here, it is undisputed that the
Arbitrator issued a Final Award in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in
the total amount of $61,193.50. (Decl. Golden, Exh. 3, pp. 30–31 [emphasis
added].) The Final Award was “in full resolution of all of the Parties’ claims
submitted in the arbitration”, and the Arbitrator clearly noted that “[a]ll
claims not expressly granted herein are denied.” (Id. at p. 31.)
It is also undisputed that
on or about May 29, 2024 (which was after the Final Award was issued but before
the Petition was filed), Defendant fully paid Plaintiff the award amount of
$61,193.50. (Points & Authorities, p. 3:11; Decl. Golden, ¶ 8; Opposition,
p. 1:24–26 [emphasis added].)
Thus, there is no controversy left
for the court to adjudicate. Plaintiff has litigated all of his claims, and
Defendant has paid all of its liabilities.
Yet Plaintiff’s Counsel still
petitions the Court to confirm the arbitration award and enter judgment,
claiming “[t]he mere fact a defendant has satisfied its obligation does not
divest the court of authority to confirm the award.” (Points & Authorities,
p. 3:16–22.)
Defense Counsel disagrees, arguing
that the “Petition is wholly unnecessary” and that “[c]onfirmation of the
[Final] Award is not mandatory in California.” (Opposition, pp. 1:24, 2:24; see
Cal. Civ. Proc., § 1286.) Defense Counsel then requests that the court deny the
Petition and dismiss the proceeding instead of entering judgment on the Final
Award. (Id. at p. 3:2–9.)
In his Reply, Plaintiff’s Counsel
argues that the court’s only option is to confirm the Final Award. (Reply, p.
1:23–27.) Plaintiff comes to this argument through citations to Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1285, 1286, and 1287.2, and 1287.4. (Id. at pp.
1:23–2:20.) Of note, Plaintiff’s Counsel omits any mention of Code of Civil
Procedure section 1285.2, cites non-binding case law from other jurisdictions,
and argues that Defense Counsel is the one misconstruing the law. (Id. at
pp. 1:28, 2:21–26.)
The court
agrees with Defense Counsel’s reading of the law.
“Any party to an arbitration in
which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or
vacate the award. The petition shall name as respondents all parties to the
arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration
award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) 
“A response to a petition under this
chapter may request the court to dismiss the petition or to confirm, correct or
vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.2.)
“If a petition or response under
this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as
made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in accordance
with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates
the award or dismisses the proceedings.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)
“The court shall dismiss the
proceeding under this chapter as to any person named as a respondent if the
court determines that such person was not bound by the arbitration award and
was not a party to the arbitration.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1287.2.)
            As applied
here, these sections mean that Plaintiff is allowed to file his Petition,
Defendant is allowed to request its dismissal, and the court need not confirm
the award if it dismisses the proceedings.
            Furthermore,
the language used in Code of Civil Procedure section 1287.2 does not indicate
that there is only one ground for a dismissal in accordance with the
chapter. Rather, taken in the context of the chapter as a whole, Code of Civil
Procedure section 1287.2 appears to be just one mandatory provision regarding
dismissal.
This reading is confirmed by
repeated opinions from our Courts of Appeal. For example, as one panel recently
stated:
The court must dismiss the proceeding as to respondent if the
court determines the person ‘was not bound by the arbitration award and was not
a party to the arbitration.’ (Code Civ. Proc., § 1287.2.) Courts have suggested additional circumstances exist that
would allow the court to dismiss the proceeding. (Karton, supra, 176 Cal.App.4th at p. 8, fn. 12 [stating in dicta that other
procedural bases may exist for dismissal of a proceeding, such as when a
petition is filed after the four-year statute of limitations set forth in Code
Civ. Proc., § 1288, a party to a nonbinding arbitration award filed a timely
request for trial de novo, or any procedural basis that would justify dismissal
of any other civil action]; Cinel v.
Christopher, supra, 203
Cal.App.4th at p. 767 [dismissal was proper when there was no ‘award’ within
the meaning of Code Civ. Proc., § 1283.4]; Maplebear,
Inc. v. Busick (2018) 26
Cal.App.5th 394, 399–401 [237 Cal. Rptr. 3d 98] [concluding from case law that Code
Civ. Proc., § 1287.2 does not contain exclusive grounds for dismissal of
proceeding].) 
 
(Soni v.
SimpleLayers, Inc. (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 1071, 1086, footnote omitted.)
            The final
question is whether dismissal is appropriate here. 
“In the event of satisfaction [of
an arbitration award], judicial relief will not be necessary, conserving court
resources.” (Eternity Invs., Inc. v. Brown (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 739,
746.)
 
As the Final Award has been
satisfied, the Petition is moot and there is no need for further proceedings. Thus,
dismissal of the Petition and the associated proceedings is both completely
appropriate and in accordance with basic judicial principles. 
Conclusion[1]
The Request to Dismiss Petition to
Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award is GRANTED. 
The Petition to Confirm Contractual
Arbitration Award and the associated proceedings are DISMISSED.
