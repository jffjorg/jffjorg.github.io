ANALYSIS:
Legal Standard
“A
summons may be served on a corporation by delivering a copy of the summons and
the complaint by any of the following methods:
 
(a) To the person designated as
agent for service of process as provided by any provision in Section 202, 1502,
2105, or 2107 of the Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303, inclusive, or
Sections 6500 to 6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in effect on
December 31, 1976, with respect to corporations to which they remain
applicable).
 
(b) To the president, chief
executive officer, or other head of the corporation, a vice president, a
secretary or assistant secretary, a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a
controller or chief financial officer, a general manager, or a person
authorized by the corporation to receive service of process.
 
(c) If the corporation is a bank,
to a cashier or assistant cashier or to a person specified in subdivision (a)
or (b).
 
(d) If authorized by any provision
in Section 1701, 1702, 2110, or 2111 of the Corporations Code (or Sections 3301
to 3303, inclusive, or Sections 6500 to 6504, inclusive, of the Corporations
Code, as in effect on December 31, 1976, with respect to corporations to which
they remain applicable), as provided by that provision.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 416.10.)
“A defendant, on or before the last day
of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for
good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the
following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
418.10, subd. (a)(1).)
Discussion
Specially-Appearing
Defendant moves the court to: (1) quash the First Proof of Service filed in
this matter; (2) quash the Second Proof of Service filed in this matter; and (3)
dismiss Plaintiff’s claims against Specially-Appearing Defendant. (First Motion
to Quash, p. 6:5–7; Second Motion to Quash, p. 6:16–18.)
 
Specially-Appearing
Defendant argues that these two forms of relief are appropriate because
Plaintiff did not comply with the statutes governing service of process, which
in turn means that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over
Specially-Appearing Defendant. (First Motion to Quash, pp. 3:14–22, 4:15–16;
Second Motion to Quash, pp. 4:25–26, 5:9–6:14.)
 
The First Proof of
Service indicates that it was served on “Meski S. Gebrekirstos” at “65 E. State
Street Suite 1100 Columbus, OH 43215”. (First Proof of Service, Items 3.b., 4.)
 
The Second Proof of
Service indicates that it was served on “UB GREENSFELDER LLP, Mary Ann L.
Wymore c/o Mary Burns” at “10 South Broadway Suite 2000 3. St. Louis, MO
63102”. (Second Proof of Service, Items 3.a., 3.b.)
 
It appears to the court
that both the First Proof of Service and the Second Proof of Service are
defective, albeit for different reasons.
 
The First Proof of
Service appears to be defective in that the purported service was improperly
made on someone who was not Specially-Appearing Defendant’s registered service
agent or someone else authorized to receive service on behalf of Specially-Appearing
Defendant. (First Proof of Service, Item 3.b.; First Motion to Quash, Exh. B.) 
 
The Second Proof of
Service appears to be defective in that the process server used Judicial
Council Form POS-020 instead of Judicial Council Form POS-010 to file proof of
service of the Summons and the Complaint. However, Judicial Council Form
POS-020 contains this explicit instruction: “Do not use this Proof of Service
to show service of a Summons and Complaint.”
As it appears both
proofs of service are defective, the Court shall grant both motions. However,
there are two items to note.
First, the First Proof
of Service is quashed because the attempt at service on March 29, 2024 was
ineffective. However, the Second Proof of Service is quashed because the
incorrect form was used. At this time, the court does not reach the question of
whether the Second Proof of Service is also defective because service on June
3, 2024 was ineffective.
Second, it would not be
appropriate to dismiss the Complaint at this time. Specially-Appearing
Defendant has argued that the Court has not obtained personal jurisdiction
because Plaintiff has not correctly complied with the service statutes, not
because Specially-Appearing Defendant lacks minimal contacts to establish
personal jurisdiction in the first instance. 
Conclusion
The First
Motion to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED in part. The First Proof of
Service, filed May 7, 2024, is QUASHED. The motion is DENIED as to all else.
 The Second
Motion to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED in part. The Second Proof of
Service, filed June 10, 2024, is QUASHED. The motion is DENIED as to all else.
