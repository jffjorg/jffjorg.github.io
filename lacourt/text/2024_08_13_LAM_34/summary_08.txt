```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the First and Second Motions to Quash Service of Summons in part. The First Proof of Service, filed on May 7, 2024, is quashed because it was improperly served. The Second Proof of Service, filed on June 10, 2024, is quashed because the incorrect form was used. The motions are denied as to all else. The court finds that both proofs of service are defective and that the service was not properly made. The court does not dismiss the complaint at this time, as the defendant has not argued that it lacks minimal contacts to establish personal jurisdiction. The hearing is continued to August 13, 2024.
