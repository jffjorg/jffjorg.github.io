And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The defendant argued that the preliminary injunction is mandatory and should be stayed, and alternatively, that the court should exercise its discretion to stay the injunction. The plaintiff disagreed, arguing that the defendant had waived its challenge to the injunction and that a discretionary stay is not appropriate.

The court found that the preliminary injunction is a mandatory injunction that is automatically stayed upon the perfecting of an appeal. The court also noted that even if the preliminary injunction were prohibitory in nature, a discretionary stay would still be appropriate.

The court concluded that it is wholly appropriate to stay the preliminary injunction and allow the Court of Appeal to proceed unimpeded with its review of the matter. The court recognized that the balance of harms tips in favor of issuing a preliminary injunction, but also noted that it would be prudent to allow the Court of Appeal to finish its review before the status quo is changed.
