And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

"This tentative ruling denies a motion filed by the defendant to continue the trial and related dates to May 8, 2025. The defendant had previously filed an answer to the complaint on January 11, 2024, and then filed a motion to continue the trial on October 4, 2024. The court had granted an ex parte application to continue the trial and related dates on October 11, 2024, which made the defendant's motion to continue moot. As a result, the court denies the defendant's motion as moot."
