considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
August 31, 2021, Plaintiff Emanuel Earl Brumfield (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendants Zhaneta Grigoryan (“Grigoryan”), Petros Markosyan (“Markosyan”),
and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
February 28, 2023, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice.  On December
12, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for relief from dismissal and
vacated the dismissal. 
On
December 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed proofs of service showing personal service
of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on
Markosyan and Grigoryan on December 12, 2023. 
On
April 22, 2024, the clerk entered Markosyan’s and Grigoryan’s defaults. 
Also
on April 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a statement of damages claiming general
damages “[i]n excess of” $1,000,000.00 and special damages “[i]n excess of”
$1,000,000. 
On
September 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application for entry of default
judgment against Defendants. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff’s
CIV-100 form asks the Court to grant default judgment against Defendants and
award Plaintiff $20,000.00 in general damages and $1,148.00 in costs. 

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff has not dismissed the Doe defendants or applied
for separate judgments against them. 
(See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
          The cost amount listed in the attorney declaration and
proposed judgment ($1,148.80) is different from the cost amount listed in the
CIV-100 form ($1,148.00). 
          The CIV-100 form omits the following: 
·       The total amount requested (Section 2f)
·       Counsel’s signature after Section 3
·       Declarant’s signature after Sections 4, 5, and 6
·       Memorandum of costs information and signature (Section
7)
·       Declarant’s signature at the end of Section 8
 The
Court denies the application.         
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff Emanuel
Earl Brumfield’s application for default judgment against Defendants Zhaneta Grigoryan and Petros Markosyan filed on September
18, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
