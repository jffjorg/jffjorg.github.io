Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default judgment and rules as follows. The case involves a motor vehicle tort, general negligence, premises liability, and conspiracy between Plaintiffs Ki Sik Song, Hwa Ja Song, and Wan Ryung Song, and Defendant Bok Sik Park.

The Plaintiffs filed a complaint requesting $100,000 in damages. The Defendant was served with the summons and complaint on October 16, 2022. The Plaintiffs filed a statement of damages listing various amounts, including $3,000 for pain, suffering, and inconvenience, $3,000 for emotional distress, $12,000 in past medical expenses, and $12,000 in property damage.

The Defendant was entered in default on January 13, 2024, and the Doe defendants were dismissed without prejudice on May 7, 2024. The Plaintiffs filed an application for default judgment, which was denied without prejudice. The Plaintiffs then filed a supplemental declaration with additional evidence to support their assertion of damages.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiffs have presented prima facie evidence that they incurred $11,861.40 to repair their car as a result of the Defendant's negligence. The Judge declines to award damages for the time the Plaintiff spent arranging for the vehicle repairs. The total damages awarded to the Plaintiff are $17,861.40.

The Judge grants the Plaintiff's application for default judgment and awards the Plaintiff this amount. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
