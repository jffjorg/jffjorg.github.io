On
October 7, 2020, Plaintiff Janice Michelle Supe (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendants City of Los Angeles (“City”), County of
Los Angeles (“County”), and Does 1-50 for general negligence and premises
liability. 
On
May 6, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against the City, the
County, and Does 1-50 for premises liability. 
On
June 10, 2022, the City filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Roes 1-10 for indemnification, apportionment of fault, and
declaratory relief. 
On
August 10, 2022, the Court dismissed the County without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
June 27, 2023, the City amended its cross-complaint to include Cross-Defendant
Montshire, LLC as Roe 1 (“Montshire”).  On December 15, 2023, Montshire filed an
answer to the cross-complaint. 
On May 8, 2024, the Court (1) granted Montshire’s
motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to Montshire's request for production of documents, set one,
and ordered Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses without
objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored information,
and/or other things requested without objections by June 7, 2024, (2) granted
Montshire’s motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to Montshire's special interrogatories, set one,
and ordered Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to the
special interrogatories without objections by June 7, 2024, and (3) granted
Montshire’s motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to Montshire's form interrogatories, set one,
and ordered Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to the form
interrogatories without objections by June 7, 2024.  
On
October 7, 2024, Montshire filed (1) a motion to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to request for production of documents, set one, and for
sanctions, (2) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to special interrogatories,
set one, and for sanctions, and (3) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to
form interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions.  The motions were set for hearing on December
4, 2024.  Plaintiff has not filed
oppositions. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Montshire
asks the Court to dismiss Plaintiff's case if Plaintiff does not comply in 30 days with the Court's May 8, 2024 order granting Montshire's motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to request for production of
documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories,
set one.  Montshire also asks the Court
to impose monetary sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
 “If a party to
whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails
to serve a timely response to it, the following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
DISCUSSION 
As
noted, on May 8, 2024, the Court (1) granted Montshire’s motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to Montshire's request for production of documents, set one, and ordered
Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses without objections and
to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other
things requested without objections by June 7, 2024, (2) granted Montshire’s
motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to Montshire's special interrogatories, set one, and ordered
Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to the special
interrogatories without objections by June 7, 2024, and (3) granted Montshire’s
motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to Montshire's form interrogatories, set one, and ordered
Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses to the form
interrogatories without objections by June 7, 2024.  
Montshire now contends that Plaintiff failed to comply with the Court’s May 8, 2024 order.  Montshire asks the Court to order that if Plaintiff
does not comply with the May 8, 2024 order within 30 days, the Court will
dismiss the case.  Montshire also asks
the Court to impose monetary sanctions. 
If a
party fails to obey a Court order compelling a response to a request for
production of documents or compelling answers to interrogatories, “the court may make those orders
that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence
sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to that sanction,
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
The
Court orders Plaintiff to comply with the Court’s May 8, 2024 order by January
3, 2025.  If Plaintiff has not complied
with the Court’s May 8, 2024 order by January 3, 2025, the Court will consider
dismissing Plaintiff’s case under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290,
subdivision (c), and 2031.300, subdivision (c). 
The
Court grants Montshire’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c),
2031.300, subd. (c).)  Montshire requests
$3,690.00 in sanctions on each motion.  In declarations included in each motion,
Montshire’s counsel states: “As the result of Plaintiff’s failure to provide
any responses to written discovery requests, I have had to write letters and
make phone calls, in attempts to resolve these issues. I have also been
compelled to file multiple motions and have been prevented from meaningfully
investigating the incident or effectively defending this action and preparing
for trial. In all, I have expended approximately 9 hours in pursuit of this
matter, including drafting motions. I expect to spend another 2 hours drafting
any reply that might be necessitated and appearing at the hearing of this
motion. My hourly billing rate in this matter is $330. In addition, I have paid
$360 in filing fees for my prior motion and $360 in filing fees for the instant
motion. Therefore, Cross-Defendant requests that Plaintiff and/or her counsel,
be ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the sum of $3,690.” 
The
Court awards Montshire $930.00 in sanctions for all three motions based on
three hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour plus
three $60.00 filing fees.
