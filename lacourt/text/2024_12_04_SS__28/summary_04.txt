And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by Defendants Skip Presley and Southern California Orthopedic Institute LP to require Plaintiffs Tracy Sorcelli and Henry Sorcelli to file an undertaking as security for costs. The judge found that Plaintiffs have carried their burden of showing that they are entitled to relief from the undertaking requirement under Code of Civil Procedure section 995.240. The judge noted that Plaintiffs are indigent and unable to pay the requested undertaking, and that they have submitted declarations stating their financial information. The judge also rejected Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs must provide substantive documentation to support their declarations, citing the Court of Appeal's decision in Alshafie v. Lallande. The judge denied the motion and ordered the moving parties to give notice of the ruling.
