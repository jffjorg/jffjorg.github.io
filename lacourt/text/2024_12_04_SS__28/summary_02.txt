And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default judgment and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Emanuel Earl Brumfield, filed an action against defendants Zhaneta Grigoryan, Petros Markosyan, and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The action was initially dismissed without prejudice, but the plaintiff was later granted relief from dismissal and the case was reinstated. The defendants were served with summons and complaint on December 12, 2023, and subsequently defaulted on April 22, 2024. The plaintiff filed an application for entry of default judgment against the defendants and requested $20,000 in general damages and $1,148 in costs.

However, the court finds that the plaintiff's CIV-100 form is incomplete and therefore denies the application for default judgment without prejudice. Specifically, the form omitted the total amount requested, counsel's signature, declarant's signature, memorandum of costs information, and declarant's signature at the end of Section 8. The court orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.

The court's decision is based on California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a), which sets forth the requirements for a default judgment, as well as Code of Civil Procedure sections 580 and 585, which govern the amount of damages that can be awarded in a default judgment. The court also cites Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, which holds that a trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages.
