Plaintiff asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant and award Plaintiff $18,000.00, consisting of $17,840.00 as the demand
of the complaint and $160.00 in costs. 

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: “[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56, citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
The
relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed
the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal injury cases where
damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount listed in the statement
of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585, subd. (b).) “The notice
requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental fairness.” (Becker
v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures
that “defendants in cases which involve a default judgment have adequate notice
of the judgments that may be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment
other than that which is demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has
been deprived of his day in court—a right to a hearing on the matter
adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction
if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified in the complaint or
statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          In the Court’s June 6, 2024 order, the Court observed that
Plaintiff stated in his declaration that he incurred $12,000 to repair his car.
Plaintiff provided photographs of his damaged car but he did not provide any
receipts or damage estimates to support his statement that he incurred $12,000
to repair the car after the accident.  The
Court denied Plaintiff’s application for default judgment without prejudice and
stated that Plaintiff could submit another application that contains evidence supporting
his assertion that he incurred $12,000 to repair his car as a result of the
accident which Defendant allegedly caused. 
          In Plaintiff’s supplemental declaration filed June 28,
2024, Plaintiff submitted copies of (1) an estimate dated 10/7/22 from Beverly
Auto Body Shop listing charges of $4,598.40, with a red “Paid” stamp and the
handwritten date 10/18/22, (2) a receipt from “Apache Auto [unclear]” for
$7,000 for what appears to be electric power steering parts and labor, dated
either July or September 24, 2023, and (3) a receipt from “[unclear] [unclear]”
for $263.00 for labor and parts dated 05/01/2024. 
          Plaintiff’s supplemental declaration states that the
Beverly Auto Body Shop document shows that “the expense of body works of the
car was $4,598.40.”  Plaintiff states
that the two receipts show that “the expense of repairing internal parts of the
car was $7,236 [sic].”  Plaintiff
also requests $165.60 in damages to compensate him for the time he spent “to
visit the body shop and repairing mechanic and purchase car parts, etc.” 
          According to Plaintiff, the accident occurred on February
28, 2022.  Plaintiff does not explain why
his car underwent repairs as late as May 2024 for damage caused by the 2022
accident. 
          Nonetheless, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s supplemental
declaration and attached exhibits together constitute prima facie evidence that
Plaintiff incurred $11,861.40 to repair his car as a result of Defendant’s
negligence.  The Court declines, however,
to award Plaintiff $165.60 in damages based on the time he spent arranging for
the vehicle repairs. 
          Adding $11,861.40 for car repairs to the amounts addressed
in the Court’s June 6, 2024 order ($3,840 in medical expenses, $2,000 for pain,
suffering, and emotional distress, and $160 in costs) brings Plaintiff’s
damages to $17,861.40.  The Court grants
Plaintiff’s application for default judgment and awards this amount to
Plaintiff.         
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Ki Sik Song’s application for default judgment against Defendant
Bok Sik Park and awards Plaintiff Ki Sik
Song $17,861.40. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
