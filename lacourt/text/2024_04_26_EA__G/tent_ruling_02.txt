 Case Number:  22PSCV00681    Hearing Date:   April 26, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff National Commercial Recovery, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff National Commercial Recovery, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action. In August 2017, Miravalle Foods, Inc.
(Miravalle Foods) entered into an agreement with Defendant Yucaipa Trading Co.,
Inc. (Yucaipa Trading), doing business as Rio Ranch Market, in which Yucaipa
Trading agreed to purchase $3,000,000 worth of packaged spices from Miravalle
Foods. As is customary, Miravalle Foods also advanced slotting fees of 5% to Yucaipa
Trading in the amount of $150,000. Yucaipa Trading is alleged to have only
purchased $548,581.53, leaving a balance to be ordered of $2,451,418.47 and
damaging Miravalle Foods in the amount of $735,425. Yucaipa Trading also did
not return to the unused slotting fees, leaving Miravalle Foods with further
damages in the amount of $122,550 for total damages of $857,975.54. Since Yucaipa
Trading’s alleged breach, Miravalle Foods assigned their right, title, and
interest in the claim to Plaintiff National Commercial Recovery, Inc. (NCR)
On
July 6, 2022, NCR filed a complaint against Yucaipa Trading and Does 1-10,
alleging breach of written contract and a common count of money had and
received.
On
July 7, 2022, NCR filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the same
parties alleging the same causes of action.
On August
9, 2022, NCR’s process server personally served Yucaipa Trading in Newport
Beach. Yucaipa Trading filed an answer on September 26, 2022. On January 30,
2024, the Court struck Yucaipa Trading’s answer after Yucaipa Trading failed to
appear. The Court
then entered default against Yucaipa Trading on April 16, 2024, and NCR submitted
the present application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for April 26, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on the
default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief
summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support
of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
NCR
seeks default judgment against Yucaipa Trading in the total amount of $729,503.48,
including $617,376.08 in damages, $111,632.40 in interest, and $495 in costs. Because
the Court finds NCR has submitted sufficient evidence, the Court GRANTS their
application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, NCR’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
