Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING

Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action. Within the last four years, Plaintiff Maersk Agency
USA, Inc. (Maersk) entered into a Uniform Interchange and Facilities Access
Agreement (UIFAA) with Defendant Marck Anthony Gomez. Maersk alleges Gomez now owes
an outstanding balance of $29,730 for the interchange of shipping containers
and has failed to may payment upon demand.
On July

following causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) open book account, (3)
account stated, and (4) unjust enrichment.
On
September 1, 2023, Maersk’s process server served Gomez with substitute service
in West Covina. After Gomez failed to file a timely answer, the Court entered
default against Gomez on April 2, 2024 and Maersk submitted the present
application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for April 26, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Maersk
seeks default judgment against Gomez in the total amount of $34,299.14,
including $29,730 in damages, $2,736.79 in interest, $1,281.90 in attorney
fees, and $550.45 in costs. Because the Court finds Maersk has submitted
sufficient evidence, the Court GRANTS their application for default
judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based
on the foregoing, Maersk’s application for default judgment is GRANTED.
