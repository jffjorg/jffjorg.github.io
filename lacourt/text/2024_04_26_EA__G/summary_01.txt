And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Jose R. Pilpa's motion to enforce the settlement agreement between Pilpa and Ibrahim Ghanem. The court finds that Pilpa and Ghanem entered into a stipulated settlement agreement on November 2, 2023, in which Ghanem agreed to pay $20,000 to Pilpa before January 31, 2024. However, Pilpa has failed to make the payment, and the court grants Pilpa's motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The court relies on Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, which provides a summary procedure for enforcing settlement agreements. The court finds that Pilpa has established grounds for the entry of stipulated judgment.
