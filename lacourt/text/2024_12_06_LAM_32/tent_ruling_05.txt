     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
non-party g.r. isidro’s motion to set
  aside satisfaction of judgment 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 28, 2014, Plaintiffs
Connie Hur and Marvin Hur filed this action against Defendants Soo Young Biun
and Equity & Trust Company. 
            On April 27, 2016, default judgment
was entered against Defendants in the amount of $47,519.72. 
            On June 5, 2018, non-party G.R.
Isidro filed a notice of assignment of judgment, representing that
Plaintiffs/Judgment Creditors assigned all title, rights, interests, and
authority in the judgment to Isidro. 
            On January 24, 2020,
Plaintiffs/Judgment Creditors Connie Hur and Marvin Hur filed an acknowledgment
of satisfaction of judgment, indicating that the judgment had been satisfied in
full. 
            On May 28, 2024, G.R. Isidro filed a
motion to set aside the satisfaction of judgment. The Court denied this motion
on October 2, 2024.
            On October 22, 2024, Isidro filed
the instant motion to set aside the satisfaction of judgment. 
DISCUSSION
            Initially, the Court notes that
there is no proof of service of the motion. Therefore, the motion is denied for
lack of proper service.
Additionally, the Court already rejected
Isidro’s arguments in denying the first motion to vacate. Isidro has filed this
second motion to vacate the satisfaction of judgment based on the exact same
grounds as his first motion, making no new arguments and presenting no new
legal authority in support of his position. 
CONCLUSION
            Non-party G.R. Isidro’s motion to
set aside satisfaction of judgment is DENIED.
