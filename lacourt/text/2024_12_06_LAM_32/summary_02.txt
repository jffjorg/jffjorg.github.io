And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant. The plaintiff filed the motion on November 1, 2024, which is beyond the 45-day deadline for filing a motion to compel. The judge finds that the motion is untimely as to the interrogatories, but grants the motion as to the requests for production. The defendant is ordered to provide written responses to the requests for production within 15 days of the order. The judge denies sanctions.
