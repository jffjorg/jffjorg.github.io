  et al., 
                        
                        Defendants. 


 
  Case No.:  22STCV17630
  Hearing Date:  December 6, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to quash subpoena 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 27, 2022, Plaintiff Omar
Kader filed this employment action against various Defendants. Plaintiff is a
gay man who worked for Defendant Southern California Medical Center, Inc.
(“SCMC”) as CFO and COO. The operative First Amended Complaint was filed on May
20, 2024. The complaint stems from a series of sexual assaults allegedly
committed by SCMC’s founder, Defendant Mohammad Rasekhi, from 2018 to 2022.
Defendants ModernHR and ADP Total Source are human resource agencies who
partnered with SCMC. Defendant R&B Medical Group is another company owned
by Rasekhi, where Plaintiff also worked preparing finances. Defendant Sheila
Busheri is the CEO of SCMC, cofounder of R&B, and Rasekhi’s wife. The
remaining individual Defendants are SCMC board members. 
            On October 14, 2024, Defendant SCMC
issued a subpoena to Kaiser Permanente seeking Plaintiff’s medical records from
October 1, 2021 to present. 
            On October 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to quash. Defendant filed its opposition on November 21,
2024. Plaintiff filed his reply on November 27, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
“If a subpoena requires the attendance of
a witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored
information, or other things …, the court, upon motion reasonably made by [a
party] . . . may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or
directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall
declare, including protective orders.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a),
(b).) Good cause must be shown to compel a nonparty to produce documents. (See Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.)   
DISCUSSION
            Good cause exists for Plaintiff’s
medical records because Plaintiff alleges sexual assault and emotional distress
in his complaint. (See Vinson v. Sup. Ct. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 840.)
Plaintiff argues that production should be limited to psychiatric and mental
health records. However, Plaintiff alleges sexual assault and physical injuries
in the complaint. (See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 5, 36, 116, 134.) Defendant is
entitled to obtain discovery regarding the alleged physical assault and
physical injuries, not just the emotional injuries. The subpoena is
appropriately limited in time. 
            While medical records are subject to
the right of privacy, in this particular case, Plaintiff has placed his medical
records directly at issue. The records are directly relevant, and Defendant’s
need for the information outweighs Plaintiff’s interest in privacy. (See Williams
v. Sup. Ct. (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552.) Plaintiff speculates without
support that Defendant may use his medical information to intimidate or attack
Plaintiff and his family. A protective order sufficiently addresses the privacy
concerns. (See See Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7
Cal.4th 1, 38.) Plaintiff chose to file this lawsuit and cannot prevent
Defendant from conducting relevant discovery based on his personal discomfort
at disclosure. 
 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to quash is
DENIED.
