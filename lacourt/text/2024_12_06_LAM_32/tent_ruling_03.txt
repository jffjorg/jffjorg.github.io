  Case No.:  23STCV17990
  Hearing Date:  December 6, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motions to compel production
  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 31, 2023, Plaintiffs Krystal
Latoya Montgomery, Jeremiah Daquan Montgomery, Anterrika DeShante Willis, and
Kristina Lashay Simpson, individually and as guardians at litem for
various minors, filed this action against Defendants George Morcos and Mervat
Morcos. The complaint alleges (1) breach of the implied warranty of
habitability, (2) negligence, (3) nuisance, and (4) violation of Civil Code
section 1942.4. On October 2, 2024, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the fourth
cause of action without prejudice. 
            On November 4, 2024, Plaintiff
Krystal Montgomery filed the instant two motions to compel Defendants to
produce documents in accordance with their statements of compliance. Defendants
filed their oppositions on November 22, 2024. Plaintiff filed her replies on
November 27, 2024 and December 2, 2024.  
            Because the motions are
substantively identical, they are advanced and heard on this date (December 6,
2024). 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
“If a party filing a response to a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling . . . thereafter fails to permit
the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance with that party’s
statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
compliance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320(a).)
DISCUSSION
            Defendants responded to the RFPs on
April 12, 2024. (Gi Decl. ¶ 4; Ohn Decl. ¶ 4.) In response to RFP Nos. 11 and
33, Defendants identified the documents that they intend on producing. (Id.,
Ex. B.) However, Defendants did not produce the documents. (Id., ¶ 6.)
These motions followed. 
            Defendants produced documents on
November 4, 2024. (Michels Decl. ¶ 9.) However, the documents are redacted and
incomplete. (See Gi Supp. Decl.) Defendants have not included any privilege log
explaining the redactions. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240(c).) Thus, an order
compelling production is required.  
As for sanctions, Defense counsel
mistakenly believed that the documents had been produced along with Defendants’
written responses. (Michels Decl. ¶ 6.) The Court finds this to be substantial
justification for the failure to produce. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel
production is GRANTED. Defendants shall produce responsive documents within 15
days of this order. Sanctions are denied.
