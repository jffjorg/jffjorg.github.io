And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to quash a subpoena issued by the defendant, Southern California Medical Center, Inc. The plaintiff, Omar Kader, alleges sexual assault and emotional distress in his complaint against the defendant and other defendants. The defendant issued a subpoena to Kaiser Permanente seeking the plaintiff's medical records from October 1, 2021 to present. The plaintiff argues that the subpoena should be quashed because it infringes on his privacy, but the judge finds that good cause exists for the production of the medical records because they are directly relevant to the case. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has placed his medical records directly at issue and that the defendant's need for the information outweighs the plaintiff's interest in privacy. The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to quash and allows the defendant to obtain the plaintiff's medical records.
