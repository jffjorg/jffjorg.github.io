As for the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel Optum, Inc.'s compliance with a deposition subpoena. The Plaintiff had issued the subpoena to obtain information about Optum's handling of the Plaintiff's surgery request and its corporate relationship with UHC of California. Optum had served objections to the subpoena, but the Judge finds that there is good cause for the information and that the Plaintiff is entitled to ascertain the relationship between Optum and UHC. The Judge also finds that Optum has not properly complied with the subpoena, despite its claims to have identified a PMQ and produced documents. As a result, the Judge orders Optum to comply with the subpoena and produce the requested information.
