            v.
 
WILLIAM ROGERS, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV16188
  Hearing Date:  December 6, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 11, 2023, Plaintiff Nydia
McFadden filed this action against Defendant William Rogers, asserting sixteen
causes of action arising from alleged habitability issues, harassment,
discrimination, and illegal rent increases.
            On November 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests
for production. Defendant filed his opposition on November 21, 2024. Plaintiff
filed her reply on November 27, 2024.  
DISCUSSION
I.
Jurisdictional Deadline
            The deadline for a motion to compel
further responses is 45 days after receipt of the responses. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.300(c).) This deadline is “mandatory and jurisdictional.” (Sexton v.
Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) Here, Defendant served
his responses to interrogatories on August 21, 2024 and September 4, 2024.
(Wobbe Decl. ¶ 7.) Plaintiff filed this motion on November 1, 2024, beyond 45
days. 
            Plaintiff argues that defense
counsel granted a motion extension to November 1, 2024, citing Exhibit B to the
declaration of Julia Wobbe. (Reply 2:16-17.) No declaration is attached to the
reply. Assuming Plaintiff is referring to the original declaration of Julia
Wobbe, filed with the moving papers, the Exhibit B thereto is a meet and confer
letter from Ms. Wobbe herself. This letter does not, nor could it, show
opposing counsel agreeing to an extension. Plaintiff otherwise cites no
authority for her proposition that the deadline is tolled while meet and confer
is ongoing. At most, the Code allows the parties to agree in writing to an
extension. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(c).) 

Thus, the motion is untimely as to the
interrogatories. 
II.
Requests for Production
            A party has thirty days to respond
to requests for production. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260(a).) If the responding
party fails to produce timely responses, the propounding party may move for an
order compelling the responses. (Id., § 2031.300(b).) Here, Defendant
produced a flash drive of hundreds of unlabeled documents, but never served
written responses to the RFPs. (Wobbe Decl. ¶ 10.) Thus, an order compelling
the responses is warranted. 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff
failed to meet and confer. However, no meet and confer is required for a motion
to compel responses in the first instance. Defendant also contends that he is
not required to bates stamp the documents. However, “[a]ny documents or
category of documents produced in response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling shall be identified with the specific request number to
which the documents respond.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.280(a).) Thus, Defendant
must either label his production accordingly, or provide the corresponding
bates stamps in his responses to each RFP. 
 
 
 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel is
GRANTED as to the RFPs and DENIED as to the interrogatories. Defendant shall
provide written responses to the RFPs within 15 days of this order. Sanctions
are denied.
