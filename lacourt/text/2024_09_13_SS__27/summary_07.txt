And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Universal Protection Service LLC. The demurrer and motion to strike are rendered moot because the Plaintiff, Gevorg Badalyan, filed an amended complaint on July 15, 2024, after the demurrer was filed but before it was decided. As a result, the demurrer must be overruled as moot. If the Defendant wishes to demur or strike portions of the first amended complaint, it can do so through a new motion. The parties are notified that they must submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear at the hearing on September 13, 2024, to argue their positions.
