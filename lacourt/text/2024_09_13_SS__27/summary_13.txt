As for the English summary, here it is:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to certain discovery requests, but denies the motion with respect to other requests. The court finds that the parties have sufficiently met and conferred, and that the plaintiff's separate statement lacks specific reasoning as to why Defendant's responses are not code-compliant. The court grants the motion to compel further responses to requests Nos. 1, 3, 4, 6, 21, and 22, and denies the motion with respect to requests Nos. 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 23, and 25. The court orders Defendant to provide code-compliant responses within 20 days. Sanctions are denied for both parties.
