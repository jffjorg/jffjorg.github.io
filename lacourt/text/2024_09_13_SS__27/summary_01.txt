And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant Hertz's motion to dismiss the case, citing the automatic stay of the bankruptcy proceedings and the exclusion of the time during which the case was stayed from the computation of time. The case was filed on December 18, 2018, and the stay was ordered on October 9, 2020. Since the case was filed less than two years before the stay was ordered, neither the three-year nor the five-year deadline for bringing the case to trial has passed.

The Judge has granted Defendant Hertz's request for sanctions against Plaintiff Maria Gabriela HashemiPour for her failure to appear at multiple status conferences relating to Defendant's bankruptcy. The sanctions are in the amount of $897, which is reasonable under the circumstances. Plaintiff is ordered to pay Defendant sanctions within 20 days of today.
