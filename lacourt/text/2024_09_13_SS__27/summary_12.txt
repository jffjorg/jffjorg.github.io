And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to continue the trial, which was unopposed by the defendant. The trial was originally set for October 2, 2024, but the plaintiff's attorney has an upcoming trial on October 3, 2024, and will be unavailable for the instant case. The court has set a new trial date for January 6, 2024, and has continued the Final Status Conference to December 30, 2024. However, fact discovery will not be extended, and expert discovery will continue. The parties are warned that if they do not submit to the tentative ruling, they may be required to appear at the hearing to argue.
