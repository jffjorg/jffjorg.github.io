  Case Number:  18STCV08904    Hearing Date:   September 13, 2024    Dept:  27 Hon. Lee S. Arian, Dept 27
 
MOTION TO DISMISS AND REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS
Hearing Date: 9/13/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 18STCV08904 MARIA GABRIELA
HASHEMIPOUR vs HERTZ VEHICLES LLC, et al.
Moving Party: Defendant Hertz 
Responding Party: Plaintiff 
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO DISMISS IS DENIED; REQUEST
FOR SANCTIONS IS GRANTED
 
On December 18, 2018,
Plaintiff filed this action. On July 28, 2020, Defendant Hertz filed a notice
of stay of proceedings due to Defendant’s bankruptcy proceedings. On October 9,
2020, the court ordered the entire action to be stayed. Defendant Hertz now
moves the court to dismiss the case based on Code of Civil Procedure § 583.420
for failure to prosecute and not bringing this action to trial within three
years, and under Code of Civil Procedure § 583.310 for not bringing this case
to trial within five years after the action commenced. No opposition has been
filed.
For both failure to
prosecute the case and failing to bring the action to trial within three years
under § 583.420 or failing to bring the case to trial within five years under §
583.310, the time during which the action was stayed is excluded from the computation
of time (see §§ 583.340(b), 583.420(b)). The case has been stayed since October
9, 2020, and the automatic bankruptcy stay prevents any party from proceeding
with the stayed action (Weakly-Hoyt v. Foster (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th
928, 933).
If the time during
which the case is stayed is excluded from the computation of time, then neither
the three-year nor the five-year deadline has passed since the case commenced
on December 18, 2018. The case was filed less than two years before the stay
was ordered. The court is well aware that Plaintiff did not appear at the
status conference relating to Defendant’s bankruptcy; however, Defendant’s
motion to dismiss requires that the action was not brought to trial within
three or five years. Since three or five years have not passed due to the
automatic stay, Defendant’s motion to dismiss is denied. 
Defendant also requests
sanctions against Plaintiff for her failure to appear at multiple status
conferences relating to Defendant’s bankruptcy: February 29, 2024, May 29,
2024, and July 3, 2024. The status conference was continued three times due to
Plaintiff’s non appearance and as a result, Defendant incurred unnecessary
attorney’s fees in having to attend these status conferences. Sanctions are
appropriate under the circumstances, and Defendant’s request in the amount of
$897 is reasonable. Plaintiff is hereby ordered to pay Defendant sanctions in
the amount of $897 to Defendant Hertz within 20 days of today.
