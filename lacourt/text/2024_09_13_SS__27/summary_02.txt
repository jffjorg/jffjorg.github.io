And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff's contention that she fell a second time in April 2018 is undermined by her own conduct, including her failure to inform the property manager of the fall and the lack of any incident report or corroborating evidence. The plaintiff's self-serving declaration is also unsupported by credible evidence and is therefore not sufficient to defeat summary judgment. The judge has found that the plaintiff's testimony and declaration are not credible and are not sufficient to create a triable issue of material fact. The motion for summary judgment is granted.
