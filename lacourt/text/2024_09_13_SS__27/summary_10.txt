Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion contesting the good faith settlement between Plaintiff Hector Hipolito, Defendant M2 Concrete Pumping, LLC, and Everest National Insurance Company. The settlement was reached on February 26, 2024, during mediation, and it is for the full amount of Defendant M2's insurance coverage of $1,000,000. Defendant Catalina Pacific contests the settlement on the basis that the settling parties failed to specify the proportion of the settlement between Plaintiff Hipolito and Everest.

The judge finds that the settlement is within the ballpark and a good faith settlement, and grants Defendant M2's application for good faith settlement. The judge also notes that Everest is a workers' compensation carrier seeking to recover in subrogation disability and medical bill payouts made on behalf of Plaintiff Hipolito, and that the settlement will be used to pay Plaintiff Hipolito's past medical expenses.

Defendant Catalina Pacific's motion is denied, as the court finds that the settlement is not inconsistent with the equitable objectives of the statute, which encourages settlement and equitable sharing of costs among tortfeasors. The judge also notes that Defendant M2 has provided documentation that Everest seeks to recover $372,807.63 in medical expenses from Plaintiff Hipolito.
