And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for sanctions filed by the defendant. The motion is granted in part. The judge finds that the plaintiff's attorney, Mr. Sullivan, did not outright lie in his expert disclosure declaration, but rather there was a difference in understanding between the parties regarding the term "retained". The judge orders the plaintiff's counsel to pay a sanction of $1,000 to the defendant for the suspicious request to delete certain admin emails. The judge declines to impose terminating, issue, and evidentiary sanctions, but finds that the discovery sanction is warranted due to the troubling request to delete items.
