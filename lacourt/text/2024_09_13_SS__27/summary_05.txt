And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for a protective order, which seeks to limit the number of expert witnesses that the plaintiff is allowed to call at trial. The plaintiff had served an expert designation that listed 4 retained experts and 43 non-retained experts, but the defendants argue that this list is too broad and does not give fair notice of who will actually testify at trial. The court agrees with the defendants and has ordered the plaintiff to amend its expert disclosure to list only the non-retained experts that it expects will testify at trial. The plaintiff has 5 days to provide this amended list to the defendants. The court's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure, which requires that a party provide the name and address of any person whose expert opinion it expects to offer in evidence at trial. The court concludes that the plaintiff's list is too broad and does not comply with this requirement.
