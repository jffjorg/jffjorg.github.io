And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial to June 2025, so that the summary judgment motion can be heard. The defendant filed its summary judgment motion 110 days prior to the original trial date, which is sufficient under the law. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiff is entitled to trial preference, that the summary judgment motion is meritless, and that the defendant should have submitted the motion sooner. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's arguments are misplaced and that the defendant has fulfilled its obligations under the law. The new trial date is set for June 2, 2025, and the final status conference is continued to May 20, 2025.
