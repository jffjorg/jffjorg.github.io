And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants plaintiff Nicolas Perez's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $33,742.00. The fees are calculated based on the lodestar method, with a reduction of 39% for inefficient or duplicative efforts. The court finds that $400 per hour incurred by Diana Rivero and $210 per hour incurred by Robert Aguilar are reasonable.

The judge also denies defendant General Motors, LLC's motion to tax costs. The court finds that the costs incurred by plaintiff, including filing fees, discovery motions, and court reporter fees, were reasonable and necessary for the prosecution of the case. The court also finds that the expenses incurred by plaintiff, including advanced and nonrefundable jury fees, notice of change of address fees, and related notices, were reasonably incurred.

The judge's ruling is based on the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (SBA) and California Civil Code and Code of Civil Procedure sections. The court has discretion to calculate reasonable attorney's fees and may apply a reduction in hours for duplicative and excessive billing. The SBA permits the buyer's recovery of "costs and expenses... determined to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer".
