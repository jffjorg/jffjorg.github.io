The Judge finds that Defendant has shown diligence and reason for the delay in amending the answer, and that Plaintiffs have not shown that the motion is frivolous and requires imposition of sanctions. The Judge also denies Plaintiffs' request for sanctions. The case is set for trial on November 20, 2024.
