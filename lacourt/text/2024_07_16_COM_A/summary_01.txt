Here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is an overruling of the demurrer to the fourth amended complaint by Defendant Dr. Stein. The case concerns medical negligence allegations arising from the alleged failure to care and treat Alberta Childress for lung and breast cancer. The decedent died on December 14, 2019, and the plaintiff, Tinisha Clay, decedent's daughter, alleges a survival action on behalf of the decedent's estate, wrongful death, and breach of informed consent. The defendant argues that the claim for breach of informed consent is duplicative and unnecessary, while the plaintiff argues that it arises from a different set of alleged facts. The court finds that the claim for lack of informed consent is not duplicative of the medical negligence claim and overrules the demurrer.
