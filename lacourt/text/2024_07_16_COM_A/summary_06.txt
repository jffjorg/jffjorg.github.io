And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The case involves a dispute over a 2022 Hyundai Palisade purchased by Plaintiff Juliana Santoyo, which developed defects that Defendant Hyundai Motor America could not repair. The Judge finds that the warranty agreement between the parties requires binding arbitration for any disputes, and that Plaintiff has not established any defenses to enforcement of the contract. The Judge also finds that the agreement is not procedurally or substantively unconscionable, and that Plaintiff is estopped from denying the validity of the arbitration agreement while claiming benefits under the manufacturer's warranty. The Judge sets an OSC re: Arbitration for February 10, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
