And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to quash service of summons due to lack of personal jurisdiction. The defendant, Cosmetic Specialties, Inc., is incorporated in New Jersey and has its principal place of business in Merchantville, New Jersey, and therefore is not subject to California's general jurisdiction. The court found that the plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the defendant's contacts with California justify personal jurisdiction. Specifically, the plaintiffs did not identify the specific Avon products that Otilia Rosas used or the time period she used those products, and did not file a supplemental brief or additional evidence showing that the claims arise out of or relate to the defendant's contacts with California. As a result, the complaint against Cosmetic Specialties, Inc. is dismissed without prejudice.
