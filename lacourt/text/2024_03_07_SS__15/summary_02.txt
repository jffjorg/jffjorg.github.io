- The mere "possibility" of exposure is insufficient to establish causation.
- The court assumes plaintiff intends to allege that defendant concealed something from plaintiffs.
- A duty to disclose arises only when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff, or when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff, or when the defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses some material facts.

And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment in a case involving asbestos exposure. The plaintiff, Remo Guidi, alleges that he was exposed to asbestos while working on compressors and that the defendant, Calaveras Asbestos Ltd., failed to warn him of the dangers of asbestos. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish a material issue of fact and that the plaintiff has not shifted the burden of proof.

The judge finds that the defendant has shifted the burden of proof by presenting evidence that the plaintiff did not possess and could not reasonably obtain needed evidence. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's deposition testimony is insufficient to establish a material issue of fact.

The judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the third and fourth causes of action, which alleged intentional tort and punitive damages, respectively. The judge denies the motion for summary judgment on the first and second causes of action, which alleged negligence and strict liability, respectively.

The judge's ruling is subject to change based on further evidence and argument presented at the hearing.
