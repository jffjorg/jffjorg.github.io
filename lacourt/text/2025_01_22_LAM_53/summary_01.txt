And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Skyler Wells' motion for sanctions against Defendant Homesite Insurance Company of California. The motion was filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, which allows the court to impose sanctions on a party that files a frivolous or harassing motion. The judge found that Plaintiff failed to show that Defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication was factually frivolous or presented for an improper purpose. The judge noted that Plaintiff did not present adequate argument and evidence to support his contention that Defendant's motion was presented for an improper purpose, and that the motion was not factually frivolous. Therefore, the court denied the motion for sanctions.
