  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion for sanctions (code civ.
  proc., § 128.7)
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Skyler Wells 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Sanctions
The court considered the moving and reply papers filed in connection
with this motion. 
The court notes that, although the caption of the reply papers state
that it is a “reply to opposition to motion for sanctions pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 128.7[,]” no opposition papers were filed with the
court.  (Jan. 14, 2025 Reply, p.
1:14-15.) 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Skyler Wells (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
imposing sanctions against defendant Homesite Insurance Company (“Defendant”)
in the amount of $73,457.58 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7,
on the ground that Defendant filed its motion for summary judgment or,
alternatively, summary adjudication (1) for an improper purpose, including to
harass Plaintiff and needlessly increase the cost of litigation, and (2) was
factually without merit since Defendant’s factual contentions lack evidentiary
support and are contradicted by Plaintiff’s evidence. 
“Section 128.7 applies only in limited circumstances.  It ‘authorizes trial courts to impose
sanctions to check abuses in the filing of pleadings, petitions, written
notices of motions or similar papers.’” 
(Kumar v. Ramsey (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 1110, 1120.)  Thereunder, “‘there are basically three types
of submitted papers that warrant sanctions: factually frivolous (not well
grounded in fact); legally frivolous (not warranted by existing law or a good
faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law);
and papers interposed for an improper purpose.’”  (In re Marriage of Sahafzadeh-Taeb &
Taeb (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 124, 133, n. 4.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 should
be utilized only in ‘the rare and exceptional case where the action is clearly
frivolous, legally unreasonable or without legal foundation, or brought for an
improper purpose.’”  (Kumar, supra,
71 Cal.App.5th at p. 1121.) 
First, as a threshold matter, the court finds that Plaintiff has met
his burden to show that he complied with the 21-day safe harbor provision by (1)
serving this motion on Defendant on November 22, 2024, and (2) filing it more
than 21 days later (plus two court days for electronic service), on December
19, 2024.  (Mot., PDF p. 706 [proof of service
of moving papers on November 22, 2024 by email]; Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7,
subd. (c)(1) [“Notice of motion shall be served as provided in Section 1010,
but shall not be filed with or presented to the court unless, within 21 days
after service of the motion, or any other period as the court may prescribe,
the challenged paper . . . is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected”].) 
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication advanced
arguments “not well grounded in fact” and therefore has not shown that the
motion was factually frivolous.  (Kumar,
supra, 71 Cal.App.5th at p. 1120 [“to obtain sanctions, the moving party
must show the party’s conduct in asserting the claim was objectively
unreasonable”].)  Although Plaintiff has
argued that Defendant’s motion rested, in its entirety, “on inadmissible
secondhand hearsay of third party alleged experiences and sham testimony[,]”
the court disagrees.  (Mot., p. 11:6-7.)  For example, the court determined that certain
exhibits, including the claim report file on which Defendant relied, was not
made inadmissible by the hearsay rule since Defendant met its burden to show
that those exhibits satisfied the requirements of Evidence Code section
1271.  (Jan. 7, 2025 Order, p.
2:5-23.)  Further, Plaintiff’s presenting
evidence that was sufficient to show that a triable issue of material fact
existed as to whether Plaintiff could prove certain elements of his claims does
not show that Defendant’s motion was not well grounded in fact and not objectively
reasonable.[1]  (Kumar, supra, 71 Cal.App.5th
at pp. 1120, 1126 [“To avoid sanctions under 128.7, ‘the issue is not merely
whether the party would prevail on the underlying factual or legal argument,’
but rather whether any reasonable attorney would agree that the claim is
totally and completely without merit”].) 
            Third, the court finds that
Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that Defendant presented its motion
for summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication for an improper
purpose because (1) Plaintiff did not present adequate argument and evidence to
support that contention, and (2) Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant’s
motion was factually frivolous, and the nonfrivolous nature of the motion
establishes Defendant’s good faith.  (Ponce
v. Wells Fargo Bank (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 253, 265 [“they argue that the
nonfrivolous nature of the claims asserted . . . necessarily establishes their
good faith.  We agree[;]” “a nonfrivolous
complaint cannot be presented for an improper purpose under section 128.7”].) 
            For the reasons set forth above, the
court denies Plaintiff’s motion.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (b).)
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Skyler
Wells’s motion for sanctions. 
            The court orders defendant Homesite
Insurance Company of California to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
