[1] On
November 6, 2024, the court issued an order in this action, exercising the
court’s discretion to continue the hearing on InterSolutions, LLC’s demurrer
and motion to strike to be heard at the same time as the other responsive
pleadings directed to the First Amended Complaint.  (Nov. 6, 2024 Order, pp. 2:11-18, 2:20-3:3.) 


[2]
Plaintiff appears to allege these theories of liability in connection with his
other causes of action.  (See, e.g., FAC
pp. 7:16-18 [alleging first and second causes of action “under CA PC 31 Aiding
and Abetting and RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR”], 14:18-20 [alleging third through
seventh causes of action “under CA PC 31 Aiding and Abetting and RESPONDEAT
SUPERIOR”].) 


[3] The
court notes that InterSolutions has also argued that Plaintiff cannot allege
these causes of action against it pursuant to the theory of aiding and
abetting.  (InterSolutions Dem., pp.
14:1-15:4.)  However, because
InterSolutions has not met its burden to show that respondeat superior does not
apply, it has not shown that these causes of action fail in their entirety.    


[4] The
court notes that the Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance expressly defines
“tenant” to “refer[] to any . . . subtenant . . . .”  (Los Angeles Municipal Code, Chapter IV, Art.
5.3, § 45.32 [emphasis added].)
