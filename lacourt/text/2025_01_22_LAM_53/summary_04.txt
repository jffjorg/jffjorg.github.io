And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving InterSolutions, LLC and the plaintiff. The plaintiff has alleged various causes of action, including aiding and abetting and respondeat superior, against InterSolutions. InterSolutions has argued that the plaintiff cannot allege these causes of action against it. The judge has decided to continue the hearing on InterSolutions' demurrer and motion to strike, which will be heard at the same time as the other responsive pleadings directed to the First Amended Complaint. The judge notes that InterSolutions has not met its burden to show that respondeat superior does not apply, and therefore, has not shown that the plaintiff's causes of action fail in their entirety. The judge also references the Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance, which defines "tenant" to include subtenants. The judge intends to consider the demurrer and motion to strike in light of these facts.
