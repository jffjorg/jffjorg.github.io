Summary in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to relieve Attorney Dan B. Yakobian as counsel for two plaintiffs, Angela Willms and Najlah Muhammad-Ringgold, in a habitability defect action against Essex Warner Center, L.P. The motion is granted, contingent on moving counsel serving notice on all parties within 10 days. The court finds that the risk of prejudice to the parties is low, and moving counsel has demonstrated good cause for withdrawal due to an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The ruling also notes that the court has discretion to deny an attorney's request to withdraw where the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding.
