STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a habitability defect action on behalf of 21 Plaintiffs alleging that
the apartment building owned and operated by Defendants in which the Plaintiffs
reside contains extensive deficiencies. Plaintiffs allege that these
deficiencies include widespread leaks, chronic mold, vermin infestations,
physical dilapidation, inadequate sanitation and accumulation of garbage,
inadequate security, and incessant fire alarms. 
 
            Attorney
Dan B. Yakobian, Counsel for Plaintiffs Angela Willms and Najlah
Muhammad-Ringgold, moves to be relieved as counsel.
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Dan
B. Yakobian’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Angela Willms is
GRANTED, contingent on Moving Counsel serving notice on all parties within 10
days of this order. 
 
            Attorney
Dan B. Yakobian’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Najlah
Muhammad-Ringgold is GRANTED, contingent on Moving
Counsel serving notice on all parties within 10 days of this order.
DISCUSSION:
 
            Attorney
Dan B. Yakobian, Counsel for Plaintiffs Angela Willms and Najlah
Muhammad-Ringgold, moves to be relieved as counsel.
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) and filed proofs of service with the Court. Moving counsel served
the motions on the Plaintiffs by mail and confirmed that the addresses were
current by email. (MC-052 ¶ 3(b).) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause so long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
            Here, trial in this matter is set
for June 10, 2025. The only other hearings in this matter are a Status
Conference re: Alternative Dispute Resolution set for January 3, 2025 at 8:30
AM, and a Final Status Conference on May 28, 2025 at 9:00 AM. The risk of
prejudice to these Plaintiffs is therefore low. Moving Counsel states that
withdrawal is necessary because there has been an irreparable breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship that makes continuing representation impossible.
(MC-052 ¶ 2.) In light of the low risk of prejudice to the parties at this
juncture, the Court finds that Moving Counsel has demonstrated good cause for
withdrawal. 
 
 Accordingly, Attorney Dan B. Yakobian’s Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Angela Willms is GRANTED, contingent on
Moving Counsel serving notice on all parties within 10 days of this order. 
 
            Attorney
Dan B. Yakobian’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Najlah
Muhammad-Ringgold is GRANTED, contingent on Moving
Counsel serving notice on all parties within 10 days of this order.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
