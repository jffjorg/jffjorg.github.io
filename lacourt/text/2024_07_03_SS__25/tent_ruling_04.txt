 
BACKGROUND
 
On May
16, 2022, Plaintiff South Bay Credit Union (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint
against Defendants Wilbert Orton Staine, Cassandra Staine, Alexis Nicole
Jackson, Sheila Yvonne Kelly (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 through
100, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach of Agreement; (2)
Passing Bad Checks; (3) Fraud; (4) Breach of Agreement; and (5) Breach of
Agreement.  
 
On November
13, 2023, there were no appearances by or for either side at non-jury trial.
(11/13/23 Minute Order.) The Court dismissed the Complaint filed by Plaintiff
on May 16, 2022 without prejudice. (11/13/23 Minute Order.) The Court’s
November 13, 2023 order was mailed to Plaintiff’s counsel on such date. (See
11/13/23 Certificate of Mailing.) 
 
On May 7,
2024, Plaintiff filed and served the instant Motion to Vacate the Dismissal of
the Case (the “Motion”). Pursuant to the Motion, Plaintiff seeks an order
vacating the Court’s November 13, 2023 order of dismissal.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Setting
Aside the Dismissal     
A.               
Legal Standard 
“The court may, upon any
terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) Relief under CCP § 473(b) is mandatory when
based on an attorney affidavit of fault; otherwise, it is discretionary. Ibid.
“Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or
other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall
not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
was taken.” Ibid. “It is well settled that appellate courts have always
been and are favorably disposed toward such action upon the part of the trial
courts as will permit, rather than prevent, the adjudication of legal
controversies upon their merits.” Benjamin v. Dalmo Mfg. Co. (1948) 31
Cal.2d 523, 525.  
B.        Discussion  
Plaintiff’s counsel, A. Lysa Simon
(“Simon”), provides a declaration in support of the Motion. Ms. Simon declares
that she has closed down almost all of her old practice and is now an employee
for a credit union. (Simon Decl., ¶ 8.) Counsel states that she never received
any notice about a November 13, 2023 hearing and the docket in this case does
not show that notice of such hearing was issued to her by the Court. (Simon
Decl., ¶ 9.) Counsel states that she made a mistake and was not aware of the
hearing. (Simon Decl., ¶ 14.) Had she been aware of the hearing, Ms. Simon
states that she would have appeared through Court Connect. (Simon Decl., ¶ 14.)

The Court has reviewed the docket in
this action and the register of actions. The register of actions indicates that
non-jury trial was scheduled for November 13, 2023 and such scheduling occurred
on May 17, 2022. However, based upon the review of the docket, none of the
parties were ever notified by the Court of the November 13, 2023 non-jury trial
date. 
As such, the Court finds that the
failure of counsel to appear at the November 13, 2023 non-jury trial was not
due to the fault of counsel as counsel was not notified by the Court of such
trial date. The Court finds that Plaintiff has shown a basis for relief from
dismissal. The failure to appear was inadvertent. 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
Motion to Vacate the Dismissal of the Case. 
 
            The Court on its on Motion sets an
OSC Re: Default Judgment for August 29, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. 25.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
