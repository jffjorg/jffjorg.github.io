And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motions of counsel, Mills Sadat Dowlat LLP, to be relieved as counsel for defendants Kreation Juicery, Inc. and Marjan Sarshar. The motions were filed on May 30, 2024, and the judge found that the declarations submitted in support of the motions did not provide a generalized basis for why counsel was seeking to withdraw. The judge noted that counsel's declarations only stated that it would no longer be able to represent the defendants and suggested that they retain new counsel, but did not provide any specific reasons for its decision. The judge found that this lack of transparency made it impossible to determine whether there had been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship or whether there were irreconcilable differences that rendered representation impossible. As a result, the judge denied the motions without prejudice, meaning that counsel may refile the motions with additional information or evidence.
