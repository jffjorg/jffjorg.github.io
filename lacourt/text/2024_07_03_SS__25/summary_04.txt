And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a Motion to Vacate the Dismissal of a case filed by South Bay Credit Union (Plaintiff) against Wilbert Orton Staine, Cassandra Staine, Alexis Nicole Jackson, Sheila Yvonne Kelly (Defendants). The Plaintiff's counsel, A. Lysa Simon, argues that the Motion should be granted because she never received notice of a November 13, 2023 hearing and lost track of the case due to "extremely unusual circumstances". The Court finds that the failure of counsel to appear at the hearing was not due to her fault, as she was not notified by the Court of the trial date. Therefore, the Court grants the Motion to Vacate the Dismissal and sets a new hearing date for August 29, 2024.
