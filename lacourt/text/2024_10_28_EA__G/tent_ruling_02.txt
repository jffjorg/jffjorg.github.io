 Case Number:  23PSCV03469    Hearing Date:   October 28, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant Homes by Millenium Inc.’s Motion for Leave  to File Cross-Complaint Respondent: NO OPPOSITION TENTATIVE RULING Defendant Homes by Millenium Inc.’s Motion for Leave  to File Cross-Complaint is GRANTED. BACKGROUND This is an action for  conversion and fraud arising from a dispute over a mobile home. On October 2,  2023, Plaintiff Todd Franssen was appointed as executor for the estate of Diane  Renee Hild, Franssen’s mother. At the time of Hild’s death in May 2023, Hild  owned a 1981 Somerset mobile home and rented a space for the mobile home at  property owned by Defendant Rancho San Jose Manufactured Home Community, LLC  (Rancho San Jose) in Covina. Following Hild’s death, Rancho San Jose’s manager,  Defendant Gayle Hyatt, began contacting Franssen regarding missed rent  payments. Franssen allegedly promised to pay the past due rent in full once  Franssen was appointed executor. While Hyatt initially indicated that this  arrangement was acceptable, Hyatt sent Franssen an email on June 12, 2023, that  requested payment or termination of possession. But Franssen alleges that Hyatt  then informed Franssen that the notice was a mere formality and that Rancho San  Jose understood payments would be made once Franssen was appointed executor of  Hild’s estate. On September 13, 2023,  Franssen received a notice of warehouse lien for the mobile home with a sale  date of October 26, 2023. On September 27, 2023, Franssen’s counsel sent a  letter to Rancho San Jose’s counsel that requested an extension of time to pay  the warehouse lien. On October 2, 2023, the court issued an order appointing  Franssen as the executor of Hild’s estate. On October 23, 2023, Franssen went  to Rancho San Jose’s offices and sought to pay off the warehouse lien with a  personal check. Franssen then alleges Hyatt told Franssen to wait until Hyatt  could confirm the total lien amount from Hyatt’s boss, Defendant Allan Alt, and  to make the payment with a cashier’s check. The next day, Hyatt told Franssen  that Hyatt would have the total lien amount after 2:30 PM. Later in the  afternoon, Hyatt told Franssen that Hyatt still did not know the lien amount.  Hyatt also told Franssen that Alt would reach out to Franssen and that the  auction for the mobile home had been postponed. On October 25, 2023, Hyatt  told Franssen that Alt would be emailing paperwork to Franssen by the next day.  Franssen alleges no paperwork came the next day. On October 27, 2023, Hyatt  emailed Franssen a proposed settlement agreement that requested Franssen make a  payment of $13,074.41 by October 28, 2023. Franssen alleges Franssen missed  this email and did not learn about it until October 30, 2023 when Hyatt emailed  Franssen with a notice that the mobile home had been sold and that Franssen had  until November 15, 2023 to retrieve Hild’s property from mobile home. Franssen  alleges Defendants Jonathan K. Romuzga and Homes by Millenium Inc. (HBM)  purchased the mobile home without an auction for approximately $5,000 and  subsequently listed the mobile home for sale with a listing price of $159,000. On November 7, 2023,  Franssen, as the administrator of Hild’s estate, filed a complaint against  Rancho San Jose, Rancho San Jose Covina LLC (Rancho San Jose Covina), Alt,  Hyatt, Romuzga, HBM, and Does 1-25, alleging the following causes of action:  (1) conversion, (2) intentional interference with prospective economic  advantage, (3) violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 et  seq., (4) fraud, and (5) conspiracy. On November 29, 2023,  Franssen dismissed Rancho San Jose Covina from the present action. On July 25, 2024, HBM filed  the present motion. A hearing on the present motion is set for October 28,  2024, along with a case management conference/status conference re: ADR. ANALYSIS HBM  seeks leave to file a cross-complaint against Rancho San Jose, Rancho San Jose  Covina, Mark Wheeler, and Roes 1-25 that alleges causes of action for (1)  breach of oral contract, (2) breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing,  (3) breach of implied covenant of merchantability, (4) indemnity and  contribution, and (5) fraud and concealment. For the following reasons, the court  DENIES HBM’s motion. Legal  Standard Pursuant  to Code of Civil Procedure section 428.50, subdivision (a), a party is entitled  to “file a cross-complaint against any of the parties who filed the complaint  or cross-complaint against him or her before or at the same time as the answer  to the complaint or cross-complaint.” Furthermore, “[a]ny other cross-complaint  may be filed at any time before the court has set a date for trial.” (Code Civ.  Proc., § 428.50, subd. (b).) If a cross-compliant is not filed within these  guidelines, it may only be filed with leave of the court, who may grant it “in  the interest of justice at any time during the course of the action.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 428.50, subd. (c).) A  cross-complaint is compulsory when a related cause of action existed at the  time of serving the defendant’s answer to the complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., §  426.30, subd. (a); see also Crocker Nat. Bank v. Emerald (1990)  221 Cal.App.3d 852, 864.)  A “‘[r]elated cause of action’ means a cause of  action which arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of  transactions or occurrences as the cause of action which the plaintiff alleges  in his complaint.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 426.10, subd. (c).)  Leave must be  granted to file a compulsory cross-complaint when the defendant is acting in  good faith. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 426.50.) “[W]hat  constitutes ‘good faith’—or lack of it—under Code of Civil Procedure Section  426.50 must be determined in light of and in conformity with the liberality  conferred upon the trial courts by the section and by prior law. … [T]his  principle of liberality requires that a strong showing of bad faith be made in  order to support a denial of the right to file a cross-complaint under this  section.” (Foot’s Transfer & Storage Co. v. Superior Court (1980)  114 Cal.App.3d 897, 902.) A determination of bad faith may be premised on  “substantial injustice or prejudice” to the opposing party.  (Id., at  p. 903; see also Gherman v. Colburn (1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 544, 560, fn. 9  [stating leave was properly denied where defendant’s motion “was merely a  tactical strategic maneuver to deprive plaintiffs of a right to a jury  trial”].) Discussion In this case, HBM filed an  answer on December 11, 2023. While HBM began the process of filing a  cross-complaint on February 21, 2024, HBM postponed its efforts while parties  engaged in settlement negotiations. (LeBlanc Decl., ¶ 3-4.) Only after the  discussions failed in May 2024 did HBM bring the present motion in July 2024.  (LeBlanc Decl., ¶ 4-5.) The court is also not in receipt of any timely  opposition from Franssen. Because Code of Civil Procedure section 426.50 is  liberally construed in favor of granting a motion to file a cross-complaint and  such a motion should be granted unless the moving party acts in bad faith, the court  discerns no bad faith on HBM’s part and GRANTS HBM’s motion. CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, HBM’s motion to file a
cross-complaint is GRANTED. The proposed cross-complaint attached as
Exhibit A to HBM’s supplemental brief is ordered to be filed separately
forthwith.
