And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint and motion to strike prayer for punitive damages and attorneys' fees are continued to a date to be determined at the hearing in Department G (Pomona). The judge has also ordered the defendant's counsel to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel regarding the demurrer and motion to strike and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing. The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the parties did not adequately meet and confer prior to the filing of the demurrer, and that the defendant's counsel failed to describe any attempt at telephonic communication in their declaration.
