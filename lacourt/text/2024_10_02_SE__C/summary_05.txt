And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Francisco Garcia Asprilla's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests from Defendant Ford Motor Company. The motion was filed in response to Ford's partial compliance with the requests and objections to the scope of the requests.

The judge finds that some of the requests are entitled to further responses, while others are overbroad or irrelevant. Specifically, the judge grants in part the requests for:

* Documents related to the transmission defects in the 2018 Ford EcoSport, including internal analyses and investigations, and communications with suppliers and government agencies.
* Documents related to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, including policies and procedures for issuing refunds or replacements.
* Training manuals related to lemon law repurchase requests.

The judge denies in part the requests for:

* Documents related to the design and manufacturing of the transmission, including failure mode and effects analysis reports.
* Documents related to the recall process, including recall policies and procedures.
* Documents related to the retention of documents, including document retention policies.

The judge also finds that some of the requests are overbroad or irrelevant, and denies those requests. The judge denies Defendant's request for sanctions.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after the parties have an opportunity to review and respond to the ruling.
