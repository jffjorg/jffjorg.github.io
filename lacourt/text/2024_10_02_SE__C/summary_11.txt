And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint and to Add Fictitiously Named Parties. The Plaintiff, Sandra Lucia Tebache, had initially believed that Jesus Ramirez was the driver of the vehicle involved in a motor vehicle accident on December 19, 2021. However, the Court found that the Plaintiff was not ignorant of the driver's identity, as she had received a copy of Andrew De La Rosa's driver's license immediately following the accident and had taken a photograph of it. The Court also found that the Plaintiff had unreasonably delayed in filing the motion, as she had learned of the driver's identity in April 2022 but did not file the motion until June 2024. As a result, the Court denied the motion, citing the statute of limitations and the lack of good cause for the amendment.
