And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) to October 31, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. The Court has also given the Plaintiffs an opportunity to file additional papers clearly specifying the allegations to be added and removed, in compliance with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subdivision (a). The Court's decision is based on the fact that the SAC does not clearly specify the allegations to be added or removed, and therefore does not comply with the California Rules of Court. The judge has also noted that the Plaintiffs have failed to provide a detailed chart of the changes sought in the SAC, despite the fact that the parties have met and conferred regarding the SAC. The Court has also considered the fact that the filing of the SAC would require additional discovery, which could cause prejudice to the defendants.
