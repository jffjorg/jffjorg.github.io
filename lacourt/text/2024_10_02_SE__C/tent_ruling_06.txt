Attorney’s Fees
 
Civil Code § 1717(a) provides: 
 
In any action on a contract, where
the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are
incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
party prevailing on the contract . . . shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.”  
 
The party seeking fees and costs “bear[s] the burden of
establishing entitlement to an award and documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates.”  (ComputerXpress,
Inc. v. Jackson (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1020.)  In determining a reasonable attorney fee
award, a court decides the “reasonable hours spent” on the case and multiplies
the number by “the hourly prevailing rate for private attorneys in the
community conducting noncontingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133.)  The result is called the “lodestar”
figure. (Id.)  
 
Reasonable attorneys’ fees are determined by examining the
time spent and the reasonable hourly rate charged.  (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25,
48-49.)  Other considerations that may
result in an upward or downward shift of the fees include the novelty and
difficulty of the case, the legal skill needed to render services to the
prevailing party, the customary fee for similar work, whether the case was
taken under contingency, the attorneys’ experience and reputation, and other
circumstances. (Id.)  
 
          Plaintiff
is the Prevailing Party
 
The “prevailing party” is the “party who recovered a greater
relief in the action on the contract.” 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1717(b)(1).) 
 
Here, Plaintiff was awarded a judgment of $96,851.52.  There was no award to Defendant, therefore,
Plaintiff was the prevailing party. 
 
          Calculation
of the Fee Award
 
A court determining the number of hours reasonably expended
on a case “must carefully review attorney documentation of hours expended.”  (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at
1132.)  In doing so, the court must
exclude hours that were “duplicative or excessive.”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 140, 161.)  “Reasonable
compensation does not include compensation for ‘padding’ in the form of
inefficient or duplicative efforts.”  (Donahue
v. Donahue (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259, 271 [quoting Ketchum, supra,
24 Cal.4th at 1131–1132].)  
 
It is well established that “[w]hen the trial court is
informed of the extent and nature of the legal services rendered, it may rely
on its own experience and knowledge in determining their reasonable value.”  (In re Marriage of Huntington (1992) 10
Cal.App.4th 1513, 1524.)  “‘In making its
calculation [of a reasonable hourly rate], the court may rely on its own
knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the experience,
skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees [citation], the difficulty
or complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied [citations],
and affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community
and rate determinations in other cases.’ [Citation.]”  (Morris, supra, 41 Cal.App.5th
at 41; see Mountjoy v. Bank of America, N.A. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266,
272 (“[A] reasonable hourly rate is the product of a multiplicity of factors
.... the level of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount to be obtained
in the litigation, the attorney's reputation, and the undesirability of the
case.”).)  
 
Here, Plaintiff contends that its counsel spent a total of
29.90 hours working on this matter.  Upon
review of counsel’s testimony and the record in this action, and given the
Court’s experience and observation thereof, the Court finds the requested
amount to be reasonable.  Plaintiff’s
counsel also requests that the court set a variable billing rate between $275
to $340.  The Court finds the hourly rate
to be reasonable given the experience of each attorney. 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the
amount of $5,975.50.
