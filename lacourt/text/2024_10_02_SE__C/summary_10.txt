And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion of Plaintiff Choong Hee Nahm for an order allowing service of summons and complaint through the California Secretary of State. The motion is unopposed. The ruling is based on the court's finding that the certified process server's declaration of diligence is sufficient to establish that Unimae, Inc. cannot be served on its agent for service, Defendant Kim, with reasonable diligence. The court also finds that the plaintiff's counsel made six separate attempts to serve Unimae through its agent, and that the agent has resigned and has not been replaced. Therefore, the court grants the motion and allows service of the summons and complaint through the California Secretary of State.
