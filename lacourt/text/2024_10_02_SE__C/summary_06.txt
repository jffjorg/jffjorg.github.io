The judge has tentatively ruled that the Plaintiff, LBS Financial Credit Union, is entitled to attorney's fees in the amount of $5,975.50. The fees were incurred to enforce the contract and were specifically provided for in the contract. The judge found that the Plaintiff was the prevailing party, having recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract. The judge also found the requested amount to be reasonable, based on the time spent and the reasonable hourly rate charged by the Plaintiff's counsel. The judge relied on its own experience and knowledge in determining the reasonable value of the legal services rendered.
