And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Marivel Cardoza vs. Alan Gilbert Hernandez, granting Plaintiff's unopposed motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Alan Gilbert Hernandez. The Plaintiff alleged general negligence and motor vehicle negligence against the Defendant, who failed to appear for examination at a scheduled deposition. The Defendant's attorney was unable to contact the Defendant, and the Plaintiff filed the motion to compel deposition after meet and confer efforts were made. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's efforts were sufficient to fulfill the procedural requirement, and therefore granted the motion, requiring the Defendant to attend the deposition and produce any relevant documents or information.
