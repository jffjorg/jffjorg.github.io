TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant’s demurrer to
plaintiff’s second amended complaint is OVERRULED. 
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.

 
Defendant California Department of Corrections
and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Justice (Defendant) demurs to
plaintiff Terry Taylor’s (Plaintiff) first cause of action on the grounds that plaintiff
has failed to state a statutory basis for liability and that plaintiff has
failed to present a government claim as required under the Government Claims
Act.
 
JUDICIAL NOTICE is taken of Plaintiff’s
exhibits.  (Ev. Code 452.)
 
Procedural
History
 
Plaintiff alleges that from approximately 1984
to 1985, when Plaintiff was a minor housed in the Fred C. Nelles Youth
Correctional Facility, located in Whittier, California, and operated by Defendant,
he was repeatedly sexually assaulted by a Group Supervisor/Night Warden at the
Facility. (SAC, ¶ 2.) On December 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint against
Defendant for violation of the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act (Bane Act). On
December 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed the second amended complaint against
Defendant. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant interfered, through violence,
intimidation, and coercion, with Plaintiff’s rights to free speech, freedom
from discrimination on the basis of sex, freedom from cruel and unusual
punishment, and privacy. (SAC, ¶ 33.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated
a duty of care by conspiratorial silence and inaction leading to failure to
protect Plaintiff from sexual assault perpetrated by one of Defendant’s
employees. (SAC, ¶¶ 19, 23, 34.)
 
On January 22, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant demurrer to the second amended complaint.
 
On September 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition to the demurrer.
 
On September 20, 2024, Defendant filed a reply
to the opposition.
 
Merits
 
Defendant demurs to the entire complaint on the
grounds that Plaintiff has failed to state a statutory basis for liability and
that plaintiff has failed to present a government claim as required under the
Government Claims Act. (Demurrer, p. 3.)
 
“The primary function of a pleading is to give
the other party notice so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect
in a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect
substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th
203, 240 (Harris).)¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
“A¿demurrer¿tests the legal sufficiency of the
factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The Court looks to whether “the complaint alleges
facts sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses a complete defense.” (Ibid.)
The Court does not “read passages from a complaint in isolation; in reviewing a
ruling on a demurrer, we read the complaint ‘as a whole and its parts in their
context.’ [Citation.]” (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214
Cal.App.4th 780, 804.) The Court “assume[s] the truth of the properly pleaded
factual allegations, facts that reasonably can be inferred from those expressly
pleaded and matters of which judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris, supra,
56 Cal.4th at p. 240.) “The court does not, however, assume the truth of
contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
A general demurrer may be brought under Code of
Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) if insufficient facts are
stated to support the cause of action asserted or under section 430.10,
subdivision (a), where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading. All other grounds listed in Section
430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision (f), are special demurrers.
Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 92, subd. (c).)¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to show the court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
Meet and Confer
 
Prior to filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41 and
435.5.)
 
Defendant has submitted a declaration
establishing efforts to meet and confer with Plaintiff. The parties have been
unable to reach an agreement. (Whitmore Decl., ¶ 4.) The Court finds that the
meet and confer requirement has been satisfied.
 
          The Government Claims Act
 
A petition for relief under Government Code section
946.6 is a special proceeding in which a petitioner seeking to file a civil
action against a public entity asks the court for relief from the Government
Claims Act requirements. (Gov. Code, § 946.6; Jefferson v. County of Kern
(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 606, 612, fn. 16.) The purpose of the Government Claims
Act requirements is to provide a “public entity sufficient information to
enable it to adequately investigate claims and to settle them, if appropriate,
without the expense of litigation.” (City of San Jose v. Superior Court
(1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 455.)
 
The Government Claims Act requires potential
plaintiffs to present an administrative claim before filing a civil action
against “public entities.” (Gov. Code, § 945.4.) Courts have applied this
requirement to lawsuits against the California Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation and state prisons. (See Torres v. Department of
Corrections & Rehabilitation (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 844 [Government
Claims Act applied to suit for false imprisonment against CDCR]; see also State
of California v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1237, fn. 3
[Government Claims Act applied to suit against CDCR, California State
Prison—Wasco, Centinela State Prison, and Corcoran State Prison].)
 
An administrative claim under the Government
Claims Act for death or injury to person, personal property, or growing crops
must be presented not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.
(Gov. Code, §911.2, subd. (a).) A claim relating to any other cause of action
must be presented not later than one year after the accrual of the cause of
action. (Ibid.) However, former Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1,
as of the date of the filing of the original complaint in 2022, provides that
in an action for recovery of damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual
assault, “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, any claim for
[childhood sexual assault damages] that has not been litigated to finality and
that would otherwise be barred as of January 1, 2020, because of the applicable
statute of limitations, claim presentation deadline, or any other time limit
had expired, is revived…” (Stats. 2019, ch. 861, §1.) Code of Civil Procedure
section 340.1 has since been amended to state that an administrative claim need
not be presented prior to the commencement of an action. (Code Civ. Proc., §
340.1, subd. (q).)
 
Government Code, section 905(m) provides that
claims made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 for the recovery
of damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual assault are not subject to
the claim presentation requirement of the Government Claims Act. However, Code
of Civil Procedure section 905(m) applies only to “local public entities,”
which is defined as including “a county, city, district, public authority,
public agency, and any other political subdivision or public corporation in the
State, but does not include the State.” (Gov. Code § 900.4.) “State” means the
state of California and “any office, officer, department, division, bureau,
board, commission or agency of the State claims against which are paid by
warrants drawn by the Controller.” (Gov. Code § 900.6.) 
 
The interpretation of a statutory provision is
determined by first looking at the provision’s words in the context of the
substance of the statute to determine the scope and purpose of the provision,
keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute. (People v.
DeJesus (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 1124, 1130.) Whenever reasonably possible,
courts avoid reading statutory provisions in a manner that renders them
meaningless language. (People v. Fontenot (2019) 8 Cal.5th 57, 73.) Statutes
generally operate prospectively unless it is the clear and unambiguous intent
of the legislature that the statute operate retroactively. (Myers v. Philip
Morris Companies, Inc. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 828, 840.) However, where a
statute creates or expands a civil remedy without creating liability that did
not previously exist, constitutional issues against retroactive application
typically do not arise. (Coats v. New Haven Unified School District
(2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, 425 (Coats).)
 
The court finds that both the former and
current versions of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 overrides the
requirement that Plaintiff have filed an administrative claim under the
Government Claims Act. Defendant argues that only the current version does so,
and because the amendment to the statute was made after this claim was brought,
the former version is applicable. (Demurrer, p. 5.) Section 340.1 alters the
time limit for an action for recovery of damages, not an administrative claim. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 340.1; Stats. 2019, ch. 861, §1.) The current statute expressly
states that an administrative claim need not be presented prior to the commencement
of an action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.1, subd. (q).) The former statute has
been held to retroactively revive claims otherwise barred by a claim
presentation deadline. (Coats, supra, 46 Cal.App.5th at pp.
428-430.) Both the former and current versions of the statute state that,
notwithstanding any other provision of law a claim that would otherwise be
barred by the claim presentation deadline is revived. (Code Civ. Proc., §
340.1; Stats. 2019, ch. 861, §1.) Therefore, Plaintiff need not have
filed an administrative claim under the Government Claims Act. The instant
action is not barred on these grounds.
 
 
 
Statutory Basis for Liability
 
Government Code section 815 holds that a public
entity cannot be sued absent a statute permitting imposition of liability. The
Bane Act provides for a cause of action against a person or persons who “interferes
by threat, intimidation, or coercion, or attempts to interfere by threat,
intimidation, or coercion, with the exercise or enjoyment by any individual or
individuals of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States,
or of the rights secured by the Constitution or laws of this state.” (Civ. Code
§ 52.1, subd. (b).) Previous courts have found that public entities qualify as
persons under the Bane Act. (See, e.g., Reese v. County of Sacramento
(2018) 888 F.3d 1030; Murchison v. County of Tehama (2021) 69
Cal.App.5th 867.)
 
The Court finds that Defendant qualifies as a “person”
under the Bane Act. Defendant cites Towery v. State of California
(2017), 14 Cal. App.5th 226 (Towery) for the proposition that the Bane
Act does not permit imposition of liability against public entities. In Towery,
the court states that “nothing in the language of the Bane Act indicates that
it creates even a general rule of actionable duty for public entities.” (Id.,
at 233.) However, since Towery was decided and before this case was
filed, the Bane Act was amended to include express references to the
possibility of actions brought under the Bane Act against public entities that
employ peace officers or custodial officers. (Civ. Code § 52.1, subd. (n).) Accordingly,
the language of the Bane Act implicitly indicates that it permits imposition of
liability against public entities. Reading this in conjunction with other case
law indicating that public entities qualify as persons under the Bane Act, the
Court finds that Defendant qualifies as a “person” under the Bane Act and
Plaintiff has therefore adequately alleged a statutory basis of liability
against Defendant. The present action is not barred on these grounds.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is OVERRULED.
