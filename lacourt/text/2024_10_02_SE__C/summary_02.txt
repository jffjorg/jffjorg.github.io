And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Terry Taylor v. California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Justice. The case concerns allegations of sexual assault by a Group Supervisor/Night Warden at the Fred C. Nelles Youth Correctional Facility, where the Plaintiff was a minor from approximately 1984 to 1985.

The Defendant demurred to the entire complaint on the grounds that the Plaintiff failed to state a statutory basis for liability and that the Plaintiff failed to present a government claim as required under the Government Claims Act. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff need not have filed an administrative claim under the Government Claims Act, as the current version of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 does not require it.

The Judge also found that the Defendant qualifies as a "person" under the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act (Bane Act), and that the Plaintiff has adequately alleged a statutory basis of liability against the Defendant. The Judge therefore overruled the Defendant's demurrer and allowed the Plaintiff's complaint to proceed.

The ruling is based on the following legal authorities: Harris v. City of Santa Monica, Ivanoff v. Bank of America, N.A., West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Durell v. Sharp Healthcare, Goodwin v. Kennedy, Jefferson v. County of Kern, City of San Jose v. Superior Court, People v. DeJesus, People v. Fontenot, Myers v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc., Coats v. New Haven Unified School District, Reese v. County of Sacramento, Murchison v. County of Tehama, and Towery v. State of California.
