Moving party to give notice. 
 
On September 13, 2023, plaintiffs Carol Melika (Carol) and
Peter Melika (Peter) filed a personal injury suit against Downey Unified School
District (Defendant). Plaintiffs allege four causes of action: (1) Negligence;
(2) Negligence Per Se; (3) Negligent Act or Omission of Public Entity of Public
Employee; (4) Loss of Consortium. 
 
Defendant now files four motions to compel further responses
against Carol Melika, including: (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Documents; (3)
Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Admission; (4) Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories. Additionally, Defendant requests
sanctions for failure to respond. 
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
respond at all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order
compelling answers thereto. (CCP § 2030.290.) All that needs to be shown is
that the discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to
respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The
moving party is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to
resolve the matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to compel initial
discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely
filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all
objections.  
 
Here, Defendant propounded Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, Requests for Admission and Requests for Documents onto plaintiff
Carol Melika on April 8, 2024. Defendant also propounded Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories and Requests for Documents onto plaintiff Peter Melika
on April 8, 2024. The deadline to respond was May 10, 2024. On May 15, 2024, Plaintiffs
requested an extension for response. Defendant granted two extensions, leaving
the final deadline for response on June 10, 2024. On June 11, 2024, Plaintiffs severed
only objections to the Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request
for Admissions and Requests for Documents, Plaintiff Peter Melika served no
response at all to his Request for Documents. Plaintiffs’ responses were
untimely when they failed to request an extension by May 10, 2024. Because Carol’s
response was untimely, they waived all objections pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §
2030(a). 
 
Plaintiffs’ Opposition argues that the objections were
timely filed on the date of the extension, May 10, 2024. Plaintiffs also state
that they had “no alternative” but to submit only objections because they were
unable to obtain the requested information by the deadline. Plaintiffs do not
include any supporting evidence showing that Plaintiffs asked for additional
time to respond or that Defendant refused to provide additional time to
respond. 
 
Therefore, the Motions to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Requests for Documents, Requests for Admission and Special
Interrogatories are granted, and Plaintiffs are ordered to provide verified
responses without objection. If any objections are asserted, it will be
tantamount to no response at all and will be deemed a violation of this Court’s
order. 
 
Defendant is entitled to sanctions under Code Civ. Proc. §§
2031.220 and 2031.310(a). The Court finds reasonable 1 hour per Motion to Compel,
for a total of 7 hours, 1 hour for each of the consolidated reply brief, for a
total of 2 hours, and 1 hour for the hearing, for a sum total of 10 hours. The
Court finds $200.00 an hour reasonable. Additionally, the Court awards $60.00
for filing fees for each of the 7 motions. A total $2,420 in fees. 
 
Plaintiff CAROL MELIKA is ORDERED to provide verified
responses and documents to Form Interrogatories without objection no later
than 10 days from the Court’s Issuance of this Order. This date may be
extended pursuant to agreement of the parties. 
 
Plaintiff PETER MELIKA is ORDERED to provide verified
responses and documents to Form Interrogatories without objection no later
than 10 days from the Court’s Issuance of this Order. This date may be
extended pursuant to agreement of the parties.
