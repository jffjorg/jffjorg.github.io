And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The case arose from a car accident in which the plaintiff, Kena Huete, alleges that the defendant, Teddy Marquez, collided with her car near a highway off-ramp. The plaintiff suffered serious injuries. The defendant failed to respond to service, and the court dismissed the case for failure to file a proof of service. The plaintiff's counsel claims that the dismissal was the result of a clerical error in his office, which incorrectly noted that service had already been made. The judge found that the clerk's error was due to the plaintiff's counsel's mistake or inadvertence, and that the plaintiff was diligently attempting to serve the defendant before the error occurred. Given the strong public policy favoring a resolution of cases on their merits, the judge granted the motion to set aside the dismissal.
