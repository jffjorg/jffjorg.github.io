And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a special motion to strike the second cause of action for intentional interference with contract contained in the complaint of Norms Restaurants, LLC (Plaintiff). The Defendant, Eisenberg & Associates, has filed a special motion to strike the complaint. However, after the complaint was filed, the Plaintiff dismissed the case against the Defendant. The Defendant has since filed a motion for attorney fees. The judge has denied the motion to strike as moot, citing the Plaintiff's right to voluntarily dismiss the case under Code of Civil Procedure section 581. The judge has also noted that the motion for attorney fees must be heard before the court can rule on the merits of the motion to strike.
