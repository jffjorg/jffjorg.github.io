Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the defendants' motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories Nos. 23-28. The defendants had requested the identity of plaintiff Albert Hughes' alleged potential clients, which the plaintiff claimed was protected by attorney-client privilege and third-party right to privacy. The judge found that the identity and contact information of a client or potential client is not protected information, citing case law. The plaintiff had lodged client files for in camera review, but the files were never received by the court. The judge ordered the plaintiff to provide further responses to the interrogatories within 30 days and to pay $2,465 in sanctions to the defendants' attorney.
