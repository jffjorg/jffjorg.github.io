SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiffs
Albert Hughes III and Sabrina Crawford (Plaintiffs) are alleging that
Defendants Laura De Leon and FF Properties LP (Defendants) failed to disclose
to them a death in the common area of the apartment complex where they lived. Plaintiff
Hughes is claiming that he is an attorney who sometimes worked out of their
apartment and that he lost potential clients because they were scared to come
to the apartment complex. Plaintiffs are seeking $12.1 million in damages for
the alleged lost earnings.
 
As part of their
discovery requests, Defendants have requested information related to these
potential clients, including their identity. Defendants argue that Plaintiff
Hughes put the identities of these potential clients at issue by claiming $12.1
million in damages.

            The Parties’ Arguments
In their
motion, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have intentionally evaded relevant
discovery requests through their failure to provide substantive responses. They
argue that a client’s name is not privileged information. Defendants also argue
that Plaintiffs must produce the client information regardless of the Court’s in
camera review, and that Plaintiffs’ responses are incomplete and evasive. Next,
Defendants argue that Plaintiff Hughes’ argument that his client contact
information is protected wildly misinterprets case law. Finally, Defendants
argue that Plaintiffs should be sanctioned in the amount of $2,465.
 
Plaintiffs
argue in their opposition that the information sought by Defendants is
protected by the attorney-client privilege and that Plaintiff Hughes cannot
divulge the information. He also argues that no sanctions should be assessed
against him, and instead requests sanctions against Defendants, despite
Plaintiffs being in pro per.
 
Defendants
argue in their reply that client contact information is not entitled to
protection absent a specific factual showing of harm, which Plaintiffs have not
done. Next, Defendants argue that they are entitled to the responses to their
special interrogatories separate and apart from their document requests.
Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs’ citations in their opposition support
Defendants arguments. Finally, Defendants argue that they should be awarded
sanctions.
 
ANALYSIS
CCP § 2017.010
allows discovery relevant to the subject-matter of the lawsuit or reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Information should
be regarded as relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the
case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement. (Gonzalez v. Superior
Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.)
 
Under CCP §
2030.220, each answer should be as complete and straightforward as possible,
and if it cannot be answered completely, it should be answered to the extent
possible. 
 
Defendants in
this case seek the identity of Plaintiff Hughes’ alleged potential clients. “Normally,
a client’s identity is not protected by the privilege. As this court has
recently noted, ‘[i]t is well established that the attorney-client privilege,
designed to protect communications between them, does not ordinarily protect
the client’s identity.’” (People v. Chapman (1984) 36 Cal.3d 98, 110,
disapproved on other grounds by People v. Palmer (2001) 24 Cal.4th 856
(quoting Hays v. Wood (1979) 25 Cal.3d 772, 785; Brunner v. Superior
Court of Orange County (1959) 51 Cal.2d 616, 618 (“It is the general rule
that an attorney is not privileged to withhold disclosing by whom he has been
employed.”).)
 
Plaintiff
Hughes claims that he previously lodged his relevant client files on April 29,
2024, with the Court for in camera review to determine whether they should be
produced to Defendants, but the Court never received these documents. Defendants
argue that even if the Court were to deem some of those documents privileged,
the client’s and potential clients’ contact information is not privileged, and
that this information must be produced regardless of what the Court would deem
in an in camera review.
 
A limited
exception to the rule that a client’s identity is not protected is when disclosure
of the client’s identity might expose him to civil or criminal liability. (Hays
v. Wood, 25 Cal.3d at 785; see also Hooser v. Superior Court (2000
84 Cal.App.4th 997, 1005, disapproved of on other grounds by Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531.) People v. Stender (2012) 212
Cal.App.4th 614, 648 lists two exceptions to the general rule regarding
privilege: the above-mentioned potential exposure to civil or criminal
liability, and when the disclosure of the client’s identity would betray
personal, confidential information regarding the client. Plaintiff Hughes has
not demonstrated that his clients would be exposed to civil or criminal
liability, or that the disclosure of the clients’ identities would betray
personal, confidential information.
 
Plaintiff
Hughes argues in his opposition that he cannot disclose the confidential
information of a client, but the case law cited above demonstrates that client contact
information is not confidential information. Plaintiff also cites Paragraph 24
of the March 20, 2024, protective order between the parties, but that paragraph
only protects client files and communications, not the identities or contact
information of Plaintiff’s clients. It is also unclear whether Plaintiff is
invoking the protective order’s general provisions allowing a party to
designate information as confidential, which would trigger in camera review.
 
“Courts must .
. . place the burden on the party asserting a privacy interest to establish its
extent and the seriousness of the prospective invasion, and against that
showing must weigh the countervailing interests the opposing party identifies…”
(Williams, supra, 3 Cal.5th at 557.) Plaintiffs have not made any
such showing in this case.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants’ motion to compel further responses is granted.
 
            Sanctions
CCP § 2023.030
allows the Court to impose a monetary sanction on any party that misuses the
discovery process. CCP § 2030.290(c) allows the Court to impose a monetary
sanction on any party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories, unless it finds that the party acted with
substantial justification.
 
Plaintiffs did
not act with substantial justification in opposing this motion. Case law is
clear that the identity and contact information of a client or potential client
is not protected information. Sanctions should be assessed against Plaintiffs.
 
Defendants have
requested $2,465 in sanctions. This amount is based on Defendants’ attorney
spending 10 hours to draft the motion at $185 an hour, plus an additional 3
hours at $185 an hour to review opposition, draft and reply, and attend the
hearing, plus the $60 filing fee. (Mikel Decl., ¶ 8.) The Court finds that this
is a reasonable amount.
 
Defendants request
for sanctions is granted in the amount of $2,465.
