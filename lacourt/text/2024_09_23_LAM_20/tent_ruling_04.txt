Defendants City of Los Angeles, Henry James Williams, Glenn Barry, Zebbra Corbin, and Ana Romero seek to dismiss this lawsuit because it has not been brought to trial within 5 years and 6 months.A civil action must be brought to trial within five years after it is commenced against the defendant. (Code Civ. Proc. § 583.310.)  If the action is not brought to trial within that time, dismissal is mandatory on the motion of any party or on the court’s own motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 583.360; Martinez v. Landry's Restaurants, Inc. (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 783, 794.)An action is “brought to trial” for purposes of the five-year dismissal statute when the jury is sworn in a jury trial or when the first witness is sworn in a nonjury trial.  (Hartman v. Santamarina (1982) 30 Cal.3d 762, 765; Lakkees v. Superior Court (4th Dist. 1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 531, 536.)  A “jury” is the panel of prospective jurors, and trial commences when they are assembled in the courtroom for voir dire and sworn to tell the truth, even though the actual trial jurors selected will be sworn again.  (Stueve v. Nemer (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 746, 752.)This action was filed on January 9, 2019.  5 years from that date is January 9, 2024.  The COVID emergency rules extended this date by 6 months (Cal. Rules of Court, Emergency Rule 10(a)), or to July 9, 2024.  This action, however, has yet to go to trial.  Plaintiff argues that “Defendants’ multiple requests for continuances created a 392 day tolling period. Additionally, the court’s own continuances created an additional 54 day tolling period. Further, the court, by its own admission, was unavailable for a jury trial from April through June 2024 which was “an impossibility that made it such that the trial could not be commended until July 2024” thereby creating another tolling period of at least 60 days. Thus, given the aggregate of the applicable tolling periods and the 6 month extension of time due to Covid-19, Plaintiff was well within the five year limitation period on July 11, 2024 when plaintiff appeared ready for trial at the FSC. At the FSC, Defendants misrepresented that the five year period had expired two (2) days previous to the FSC on July 9, 2024 causing the court to vacate the trial date of July 15, 2024. However, Defendants’ statements to the court were incorrect as with the aggregate tolling periods for Defendants’ continuances and the court’s own continuances (a combined 446 days), the five year period does not run until at minimum September 28, 2025. And, with the additional tolling period of at least 60 days for the court’s unavailability for a jury trial due to illness from April through June 2024, the five year time period is further extended through the end of November 2025.”“In computing the time within which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article, there shall be excluded the time during which any of the following conditions existed:(a) The jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended.(b) Prosecution or trial of the action was stayed or enjoined.(c) Bringing the action to trial, for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile.”(Code Civ. Proc. § 583.340.)There is no contention that subsections (a)-(b) above apply.  The issue is whether subsection (c) applies.“In determining whether the impossibility exception applies, courts have crafted a three-part test. Under this test, the plaintiff has the burden to prove (1) a circumstance of impossibility, (2) a causal connection between that circumstance and the plaintiff's reason for not bringing the action to trial, and (3) the plaintiff's reasonable diligence in trying to bring the action to trial.”  (O'Connor's California Practice * Civil Pretrial Ch. 10-F § 4 (2024 ed.).)Plaintiff, without citing the source, quotes the Court’s prior tentative ruling in another matter, 18STCV05502, to argue that the Court was not available for trial due to absence of the judicial officer.  This statement, however, never became the Court’s final ruling and was abrogated.  While of little relevance here, since Plaintiff has chosen to mention 18STCV05502, the final ruling therein was to dismiss that action.  This argument is again rejected because the Court could have, upon proper application, reassigned this matter to another department for trial.  The Court also does not believe that the continuances in this matter constitute a proper basis for tolling.  This is because (a) Plaintiff took no action to ensure there would be a timely trial and (b) Defendants never promised to extend the 5-year rule.  Plaintiff primarily relies on the following statement from Rose v. Scott (1991) 233 Cal. App. 3d 537, 541: “Although an action must be brought to trial within five years after the action is commenced (§ 583.310), the general rule is that when a party seeks a continuance of trial, that party is estopped to assert limitation periods for bringing an action to trial. (Ward v. Levin (1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 1026, 1034 [208 Cal.Rptr. 312]; Borglund v. Bombardier (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 276, 281 [175 Cal.Rptr. 150].)”That statement, however, must be read in the context of the two cited authorities on which the statement was based—Ward, supra, 161 Cal.App.3d 1026, 1034, and Borglund, supra, 121 Cal.App.3d 276. (Rose, supra, 233 Cal.App.3d at p. 541.)  This is especially true, since the Rose opinion does not discuss the doctrine of estoppel or its application in the context of a section 583.360 dismissal other than citing without discussion Ward and Borglund.In Ward, the defendants obtained a continuance of the trial date based on an oral stipulation that the continuance would not prejudice the plaintiff in bringing his case to trial within the statutory deadline; and without an estoppel, the plaintiff was unable to enforce the defendants' express agreement. (Ward, supra, 161 Cal.App.3d at p. 1034.)  In contrast, here Defendants made no promises related either to the statutory deadline or to seeking a dismissal under section 583.360.Similarly, in Borglund, in response to the defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to bring the action to trial within five years of its commencement, the plaintiff's attorney testified that the defendants' attorney ‘said that he would not seek a motion to dismiss if the case progressed beyond the five-year anniversary of the filing of the complaint.’ (Borglund, supra, 121 Cal.App.3d at p. 278.)  However, because the trial court had erroneously concluded that it did not have the discretion to consider principles of estoppel, the appellate court reversed the dismissal and remanded with directions that the trial court consider, and “ ‘render a discretionary decision’ ” in the first instance, whether the plaintiff established an estoppel.  (Id. at p. 281.)Contrary to the defendants in Ward and Borglund, Defendants here did not agree or stipulate to anything on which Plaintiff could have relied in arguably lulling Plaintiff into a false sense of security resulting in inaction.The Court finds that this action was not timely brought to trial.  Thus, the Motion to Dismiss is granted.  The objections are overruled.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
