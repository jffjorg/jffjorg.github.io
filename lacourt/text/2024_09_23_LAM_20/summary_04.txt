And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling that the lawsuit filed by the plaintiff should be dismissed. The plaintiff had argued that the lawsuit was not dismissed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the multiple continuances that took place. However, the judge found that the lawsuit was not timely brought to trial and that the continuing circumstances of impossibility, impracticability, or futility did not apply.

The judge noted that the five-year deadline for bringing the lawsuit to trial was extended by six months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but that the lawsuit was not brought to trial within that extended deadline. The judge also found that the plaintiff had not demonstrated reasonable diligence in trying to bring the lawsuit to trial and that the court's own continuances did not constitute a proper basis for tolling.

The judge further noted that the plaintiff's reliance on the doctrine of estoppel was misplaced, as there was no stipulation or agreement between the parties that would have led the plaintiff to believe that the lawsuit would not be dismissed. The judge also found that the court's unavailability for trial due to illness was not a circumstance of impossibility, impracticability, or futility.

Based on these findings, the judge has granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
