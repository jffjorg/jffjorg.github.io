And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the motion of the defendants to compel the deposition of Stephen Brown, principal of Zeki Group, LLC. However, Brown failed to appear for the deposition, and the defendants are seeking terminating and monetary sanctions. The court noted that California discovery law authorizes a range of penalties for conduct amounting to "misuse of the discovery process." The court found that Brown's failure to appear for the deposition was a misuse of the discovery process and that the plaintiff does not wish to participate in the discovery process. Therefore, the court granted the motion for terminating sanctions and struck the complaint. The court did not award monetary sanctions or set an order to show cause re: contempt.
