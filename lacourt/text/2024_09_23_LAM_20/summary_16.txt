And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in an employment action lawsuit brought by Sofia Zermoglio against ADP TOTALSOURCE FL XVI, INC. The plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to her form interrogatories (FI) and requests for production from the defendant. The defendant has objected to one of the FIs, which asks about any civil actions filed by employees against the employer in the past 10 years. The defendant argued that this information is unlikely to be relevant because of the contractual nature of ADPTS and the worksite employers. However, the judge ruled that the scope of discovery is broad and discovery is permitted as long as it may eventually lead to relevant information. The judge granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the FI, ordering the defendant to provide a further response within 20 days. The judge also awarded the plaintiff reduced sanctions in the amount of $800. Additionally, the judge denied the defendant's motion to deny the plaintiff's request for discovery as moot, since the defendant has already served supplemental responses. The judge encouraged the parties to meet and confer if the responses are still insufficient. Finally, the judge awarded the defendant reduced sanctions in the amount of $300.
