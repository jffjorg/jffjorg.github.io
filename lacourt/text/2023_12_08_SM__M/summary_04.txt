Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motions to compel further responses from Defendant Perez and finds that they are all granted. The Defendant's objections to the discovery requests were boilerplate and unjustified, and the Defendant failed to provide substantive responses to the requests. The Court finds that the Defendant must provide further responses as to all discovery at issue. The Court will confer with counsel as to when defense counsel could secure substantive responses from Perez and then set a reasonable time frame for compliance.

Additionally, the Court finds that the Defendant must pay sanctions in the amount of $4,600.00, inclusive of costs, to the Plaintiffs' counsel within 30 days. The sanctions are awarded against the Defendant, not defense counsel, due to the Defendant's failure to participate in the litigation and failure to justify their objections.
