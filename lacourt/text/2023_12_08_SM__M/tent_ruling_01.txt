  Case Number:  20SMCV01355    Hearing Date:   December 8, 2023    Dept:  M CASE NAME:           GSI Exchange v.
Cowper
CASE NO.:                20SMCV01355
MOTION:                  Motion
to Deem Matters Admitted 
HEARING DATE:   12/8/2023

 
Legal
Standard
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(b), a
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). “Failure
to timely respond to RFA does not result in automatic admissions. Rather,
the propounder of the RFA must ‘move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction’ under §
2023.010 et seq.” (CCP, § 2033.280(b).) The court “shall” grant the motion to
deem RFA admitted, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP, § 2033.280(c).) 
 
Analysis
 
            Cross-Defendant GSI Exchange moves
to deem matters admitted against Cross-Complainant Mark Cowper due to his
failure to timely respond to the Requests for Admissions, set one (RFAs).  In opposition, Cowper claims that the instant
motion was not timely served. However, the proof of service shows timely
service on November 14, 2023.
 
            On August 6, 2023, GSI served Cowper
with RFAs, and other discovery. (Thompson Decl., ¶ 2.) GSI’s counsel then
implies that Cowper failed to serve a response. (Id. ¶ 3.) Cowper does not
dispute that he failed to timely respond to the instant RFAs. In opposition,
Cowper claims that he did not receive a “second” set of RFAs in August 2023
until this motion was served. (Belshaw Decl., ¶ 5.) Cowper’s counsel notes that
Cowper responded to earlier-served RFAs in January 2023. (Id. ¶¶ 3-4.) However,
the two sets of RFAs are substantially different, even if they share some of
the same requests. In any event, Cowper served a response to the subject RFAs
on November 27, 2023, well before the instant hearing date. Thus, the motion is
MOOT.
 
Monetary sanctions are mandatory,
without exception. Plaintiff claims 8 billable hours at the reduced billable
rate of $275, or $2,200, plus a filing fee of $61.65. (Thompson decl., ¶ 4.)
The Court finds this amount to be excessive, given the relative simplicity of
the motion and the presented issues. The Court will impose sanctions in the
reduced, reasonable amount of $1,086.65, inclusive of costs, against Cowper and
his counsel of record, jointly and severally. Sanctions to be paid to Plaintiff’s
counsel within 30 days.
