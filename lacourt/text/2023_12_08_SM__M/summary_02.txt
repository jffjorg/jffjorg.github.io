And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees. The plaintiff, Culver City BBT LLC, is seeking $19,570.00 in attorneys' fees for their work on the case. The Judge has determined that the plaintiff is the prevailing party and is entitled to contractual attorneys' fees under the lease agreement. The Judge has also determined that the reasonable fee for the attorneys' work is $17,820.00 using the lodestar method. The Judge has reduced the requested amount of attorneys' fees due to the lack of substantial evidence provided by counsel Nalbandian and has set her rate to a reasonable rate for an attorney with less than three years' experience. The Judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees in the reduced total amount of $17,820.00.
