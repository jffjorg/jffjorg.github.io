Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to strike the claim for punitive damages. The Judge finds that the plaintiffs have not alleged any acts of malice, oppression, or fraud, as required by Civil Code Section 3294. The Judge notes that the plaintiffs' allegations only show negligent conduct by the defendant, rather than intentional or malicious behavior. The Judge grants the motion to strike with ten days leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs have the opportunity to re-file their complaint with additional factual allegations to support their claim for punitive damages.
