```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to deem matters admitted against Mark Cowper due to his failure to timely respond to the Requests for Admissions (RFAs) served by GSI Exchange. The motion is granted despite Cowper's claim that the instant motion was not timely served, as the proof of service shows timely service on November 14, 2023. The judge finds that the motion is MOOT because Cowper served a response to the RFAs on November 27, 2023, well before the hearing date. The judge imposes sanctions in the amount of $1,086.65, inclusive of costs, against Cowper and his counsel of record, jointly and severally, for failing to timely respond to the RFAs.
