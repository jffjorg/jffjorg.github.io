REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT

(2)      
Judicial

II.      
ANALYSIS
 
        The Request for Default Judgment is
GRANTED in part. 
 
        Regarding costs, Plaintiff’s counsel provides
his declaration that the costs were “fair, reasonable and necessary.”  (Brown Declaration, ¶ 13.)  He also states that of the $2,377.59 in costs
incurred, $547.35 were for filing fees and $1,830.24 were for service
fees.  (Brown Declaration, ¶ 11.)  No further breakdown was provided. The Court
allows the total amount of filing fees requested. However, the amount of
service fees appears to be unreasonable, and thus the Court only allowed a
smaller amount than what was requested. 
 
        Default judgment is AWARDED in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendants, jointly and severally, in the total amount of
$176,418.89. This amount is comprised of $172,058.31 in damages (the total
amount allowable because that was the amount of damages listed on the
Complaint), $3,610.58 in attorney’s fees (the total amount allowable for fees
on this amount of damages), and $750.00 in costs, as indicated the chart below:
