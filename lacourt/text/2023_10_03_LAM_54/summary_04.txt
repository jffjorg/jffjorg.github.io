The defendant, Tesla, Inc., has moved to compel arbitration based on the arbitration provisions in the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement (MVOA) and the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) executed by the plaintiff and the defendant.

The Judge also finds that the RISC is not unconscionable and that the plaintiff has failed to show that the arbitration agreements are unenforceable. Therefore, the Judge grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stays the action.

## English Summary:

The judge tentatively rules in favor of Tesla, Inc. and orders the case to be resolved through arbitration. 

The judge finds that both the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement and the Retail Installment Sale Contract contain valid arbitration provisions.  Plaintiff argued that the Retail Installment Sale Contract is unconscionable because it limits Defendant's payment of arbitration costs to $5,000. The judge disagrees, finding that this provision is not sufficiently unfair to invalidate the agreement.


Therefore, the court will stay the legal action and allow the dispute to proceed to arbitration.
