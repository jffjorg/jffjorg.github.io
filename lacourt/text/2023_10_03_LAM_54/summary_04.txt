And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Flora Zhang vs. Tesla, Inc. (Case No. 23STCV08425). The defendant, Tesla, Inc., has moved to compel arbitration based on the arbitration provisions in the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement (MVOA) and the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) executed by the plaintiff and the defendant. The Judge finds that the defendant has met its burden to establish the existence of an agreement to arbitrate, and shifts the burden to the plaintiff to establish any defenses to enforcement. The Judge also finds that the RISC is not unconscionable and that the plaintiff has failed to show that the arbitration agreements are unenforceable. Therefore, the Judge grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stays the action.
