The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion for approval of the PAGA settlement is DENIED. The settlement provides for payment of $73,750.00, with $750.00 allocated for representative PAGA claims and $73,000.00 for the plaintiff's individual claims. The settlement also provides for the release of PAGA claims for all aggrieved employees, with a small allocation of $187.50 for approximately seven similarly aggrieved employees. The judge finds the settlement to be unreasonably low considering the release of claims and the plaintiff's large individual settlement. The motion is denied, and the parties are encouraged to submit any further arguments or evidence if they wish to contest the tentative ruling.
