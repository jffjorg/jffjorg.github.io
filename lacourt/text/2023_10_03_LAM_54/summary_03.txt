## English Summary

Judge Maurice A. Leiter has denied Plaintiff Cesar Ureña-Taswell's motion to approve a proposed settlement under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA).  

The settlement involved a total payment of $73,750.00, with $750.00 allocated to representative PAGA claims and $73,000.00 to Plaintiff's individual claims.  

Seven similarly aggrieved employees would receive $187.50 each in exchange for releasing their PAGA claims. The Judge found that this settlement was unreasonably low given the scope of the released claims and the significant individual settlement amount for the Plaintiff. Therefore, the motion was denied.
