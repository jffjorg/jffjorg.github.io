And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial, allowing them to hear their cross-complaint for specific performance of the settlement agreement before the plaintiff's claims. The judge finds that bifurcation is appropriate because it will either eliminate the need for a jury trial or streamline the jury trial. The judge cites cases that support the idea that equitable issues, such as those involved in the cross-complaint, should be tried before legal issues. The judge also notes that bifurcation does not deprive the plaintiff of her right to a jury trial, as she will still be entitled to a jury trial on her claims. The judge will address whether the cross-complaint states a claim when the plaintiff's demurrer is heard.

The judge believes that this will either eliminate the need for a jury trial altogether or streamline the process.

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial, meaning that the trial on the defendants' cross-complaint for specific performance of the settlement agreement will take place before the trial on the plaintiff's claims. The judge found that bifurcation is appropriate because it will either eliminate the need for a jury trial on the plaintiff's claims or streamline the jury trial. The judge also noted that the trial of the cross-complaint will likely take only one day. The plaintiff had argued that bifurcation would deprive them of their right to a jury trial, but the judge disagreed, stating that the plaintiff is not entitled to a jury trial on the cross-complaint. The judge will address whether the cross-complaint states a claim when the plaintiff's demurrer is heard.
