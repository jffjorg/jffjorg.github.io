And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial, allowing them to hear their cross-complaint for specific performance of the settlement agreement before the plaintiff's claims. The judge finds that bifurcation is appropriate because it will either eliminate the need for a jury trial or streamline the jury trial. The judge cites cases that support the idea that equitable issues, such as those involved in the cross-complaint, should be tried before legal issues. The judge also notes that bifurcation does not deprive the plaintiff of her right to a jury trial, as she will still be entitled to a jury trial on her claims. The judge will address whether the cross-complaint states a claim when the plaintiff's demurrer is heard.
