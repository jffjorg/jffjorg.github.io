And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to serve the defendants, Delia Rosalba Simental Crespo and Coco Chavita, via email. The plaintiffs had previously attempted to serve Crespo at her last known address in Mexico, but were unsuccessful. They then sent the complaint to three possible email addresses of Crespo, but two of the emails bounced back and one sent to a Hotmail address went through. The plaintiffs claimed that Crespo used this Hotmail address as of at least November 2019. However, the court was unpersuaded that serving the defendants via email would result in actual notice, as the attorney who received the email, Fernando Ortiz, did not respond to the request to accept service on behalf of Crespo and did not provide any evidence that the email would be seen by Crespo or Chavita. Additionally, the court noted that the summons and complaint were filed more than four years ago, and the court was not convinced that this was an appropriate case for alternative means of service.

The court has denied the plaintiffs' motion to serve defendants Delia Rosalba Simental Crespo and Coco Chavita by alternative means, specifically via email to Fernando Ortiz. The plaintiffs had attempted to serve Crespo at her last known address in Sinaloa, Mexico, but were unsuccessful. They claimed that Crespo used a specific email address as of 2019, but the court was unpersuaded that serving Ortiz would result in actual notice to the defendants. The court also noted that the plaintiffs had not explained why the three-year statute of limitations for serving the summons and complaint did not apply in this case. The plaintiffs' motion was denied, and they were ordered to notice the court. The court considered the moving papers and noted that no opposition had been received. The judge cited CCP § 413.30 and CCP § 583.210(a) in making the decision.

summary: Judge Maurice A. Leiter of the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' motion to serve Defendants Delia Rosalba Simental Crespo and Coco Chavita by alternative means. The Plaintiffs, Benthos Bioscience Corporation of America, Danny Qiu, Key Inspiration Limited, and Advance View Group Limited, sought to serve the summons on Crespo and Chavita via email to Fernando Ortiz, an attorney in Mexico representing Crespo. However, the Court was not persuaded that this method would result in actual notice to the Defendants, as Ortiz stated that he was not authorized to accept service for Crespo and there was no evidence that an email to Ortiz would give Crespo or Chavita notice of the complaint. Additionally, the Plaintiffs began the action more than four years ago, and the Court noted that they did not explain why CCP § 583.210(a) was inapplicable here.
