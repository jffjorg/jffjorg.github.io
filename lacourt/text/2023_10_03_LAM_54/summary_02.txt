And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to serve the defendants, Delia Rosalba Simental Crespo and Coco Chavita, via email. The plaintiffs had previously attempted to serve Crespo at her last known address in Mexico, but were unsuccessful. They then sent the complaint to three possible email addresses of Crespo, but two of the emails bounced back and one sent to a Hotmail address went through. The plaintiffs claimed that Crespo used this Hotmail address as of at least November 2019. However, the court was unpersuaded that serving the defendants via email would result in actual notice, as the attorney who received the email, Fernando Ortiz, did not respond to the request to accept service on behalf of Crespo and did not provide any evidence that the email would be seen by Crespo or Chavita. Additionally, the court noted that the summons and complaint were filed more than four years ago, and the court was not convinced that this was an appropriate case for alternative means of service.
