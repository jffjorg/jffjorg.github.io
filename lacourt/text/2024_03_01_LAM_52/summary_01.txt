And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The City of Los Angeles has moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that plaintiff Richard Owens has not alleged sufficient facts to support his causes of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The court rejects this argument, finding that plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support his claims that the City's policies and customs caused his constitutional rights violations. The court also disagrees with the City's contention that plaintiff must name individual City employees as defendants in order to proceed with his claims. Instead, the court finds that plaintiff's first amended complaint is sufficient to state a claim against the City. Finally, the court denies the City's motion for judgment on the pleadings.
