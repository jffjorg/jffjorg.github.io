 Case Number:  22STCV36102    Hearing Date:   March 1, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
Arthur Little’s Motion to Amend or Supplement the Second Amended Complaint
Plaintiff
Arthur Little moves for leave to file a third amended complaint.
Courts
have discretion to permit an amendment to any pleading “in furtherance of
justice, and on any terms as may be proper.” (CCP § 473(a)(1).)  “This discretion should be exercised
liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all
disputed matters in the same lawsuit.”  (Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)  Courts exercise their discretion “liberally
to permit amendment,” and “[t]he policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.”  (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428.)  
Courts
also have discretion to permit a supplemental complaint “alleging facts material to the case
occurring after the former complaint or answer.”  (CCP § 464(a).)  As with amending complaints, courts should
liberally exercise this discretion.  (Flood
v. Simpson (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 644, 647.)
Defendant
Regents of the University of California opposes
plaintiff’s motion on three grounds. 
First, it argues plaintiff’s proposed amendments are futile.  In ruling on a motion for leave
to amend, courts generally do not consider the amended pleading’s merits.  (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109
Cal.App.4th 739, 760.)  The court
exercises its discretion not to consider the merits of plaintiff’s proposed third
amended complaint. 
Second, defendant argues this motion improperly
attempts to circumvent the court’s order sustaining defendant’s demurrer.  In June 2023, the court sustained defendant’s
demurrer to plaintiff’s fourth cause of action for whistleblower retaliation
without leave to amend.  Plaintiff’s
proposed third amended complaint would revive that cause of action.  
The court exercises its discretion to permit plaintiff
to do so.  Plaintiff does not solely seek
to amend the complaint based on events that occurred before he filed this
action or any prior complaint.  Plaintiff
also moves to supplement the complaint based on “facts material to the case
occurring after the former complaint.” 
(CCP § 464(a).)  For example, the
proposed third amended complaint alleges, “On November 30, 2023, Plaintiff
filed an internal complaint, signed under oath, on UCLA Administrative Policies
& Compliance Office.  Plaintiff reported
a pattern of discriminatory and retaliatory conduct that has permeated the Department.
 His November 2023 complaint was filed
within 12 months of the most recent adverse personnel action, which is on-going
to date.”  (Proposed 3AC, ¶ 48.)  He could not have made that allegation when
he filed the second amended complaint in April 2023.  He also alleges other events occurring “in
2023” (id., ¶¶ 42, 43, 47) and “[t]hroughout 2022 and 2023” (id., ¶ 44).
            Third,
defendant argues plaintiff unreasonably delayed seeking to amend his
complaint.  Courts have discretion to
deny leave to amend when (a) the moving party has delayed bringing the proposed
amendment; and (b) the delay in seeking leave to amend will cause prejudice to
an opposing party.  (Hirsa v. Superior
Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490.) 
Plaintiff could have moved for leave to amend the complaint earlier.  Though he only made his internal complaint to
UCLA on November 30, 2023, he also could have done that earlier.  Defendant argues granting this motion will
increase the burden of discovery, increase litigation costs, and delay
resolution of the case.  Defendant has
not shown that any such prejudice outweighs the policy favoring resolution of
all related disputes between the parties in a single proceeding.
Disposition
            Plaintiff Arthur Little’s motion for
leave to amend the second amended complaint is granted.  Plaintiff shall file the third amended
complaint attached as Exhibit 1 to the declaration of Jacqueline Gil forthwith.
