 Case Number:  23STCV16265    Hearing Date:   March 1, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Default
Judgment
Plaintiff Michael Kim requests court judgment by default against defendants
Inheritance Transport, LLC and Edgar Olivarez. 
Plaintiff is not entitled to all $46,468.87 he seeks.  
Plaintiff
seeks excessive attorney fees of $10,491.50. 
Attorney fees for a default judgment are generally limited to a
specified schedule based on the amount of damages.  (Local Rules 3.207(a), 3.214(a).)  A plaintiff may recover “a fee greater than listed in the [default]
schedule because of extraordinary services.” 
(3.214(d).)  Plaintiff does not
show extraordinary services justifying a fee greater than the schedule.  Under the fee schedule, plaintiff’s
reasonable attorney fees are: $690 + 3% x ($35,977.37 - $10,000) = $1,469.32.  The court will reduce the judgment to include
only $1,469.32 in attorney fees, resulting in a total judgment of $37,446.69.
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is granted in part.  The
court will modify plaintiff’s proposed judgment on form JUD-100 and will enter
judgment.
