And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Gain Federal Credit Union, has requested a default judgment against the defendant, Tugsjargal Dukh. However, the plaintiff has failed to show valid service of summons on the defendant. The proof of service attests to substituted service, but the address used for service was not a proper place to attempt personal service on the defendant. The process server continued to attempt to serve the defendant at the same address despite being told that the defendant did not live there or receive mail. The court finds that the plaintiff has not shown that the address was a proper place to serve the defendant and therefore denies the request for default judgment. The court hereby vacates the default of the defendant and requires the plaintiff to either show that the address was a proper place to serve the defendant, serve the defendant at another address, or apply for service of summons by publication.
