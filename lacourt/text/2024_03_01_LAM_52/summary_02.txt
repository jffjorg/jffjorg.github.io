Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted plaintiff Arthur Little's motion for leave to amend the second amended complaint and to supplement the complaint. The judge notes that courts have discretion to permit amendments to pleadings in furtherance of justice and that this discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments. The judge also notes that courts have discretion to permit supplemental complaints alleging facts material to the case occurring after the former complaint.

The defendant, Regents of the University of California, opposed the motion on three grounds: that the proposed amendments are futile, that the motion improperly attempts to circumvent the court's order sustaining the defendant's demurrer, and that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed seeking to amend the complaint. The judge exercises its discretion not to consider the merits of the proposed amended complaint, but grants the motion to permit the plaintiff to revive a cause of action that was previously dismissed.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's proposed third amended complaint alleges new facts that could not have been alleged in the previous complaint, including events occurring in 2023. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's delay in seeking to amend the complaint does not outweigh the policy favoring resolution of all related disputes between the parties in a single proceeding.
