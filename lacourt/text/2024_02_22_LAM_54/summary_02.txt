And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV09776. The case involves a dispute between Lawana Denise Redman, the Plaintiff, and Centre of Positive Essentials, Inc. et al., the Defendants. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants breached their contract, committed fraud, and threatened to evict her from the rental property. The Defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff failed to file a creditor's claim against the Estate of Mary B. Steen, who was a party to the lease. The Judge overruled the demurrer, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to state a claim against the individual Defendants.

The Defendants also moved to strike certain claims, including the prayer for punitive damages, arguing that the Plaintiff failed to allege malice, oppression, or fraud with the requisite specificity. The Judge denied the motion to strike, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to allege malice, oppression, or fraud.

The Judge ordered the Defendants to file and serve answers to the first amended complaint within 30 days of the ruling. The case is set for a hearing on February 22, 2024, in Department 54.
