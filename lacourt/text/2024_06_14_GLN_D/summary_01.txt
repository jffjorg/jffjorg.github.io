**Tentative Ruling**

**Case Number:** 20GDCV00518
**Hearing Date:** June 14, 2024
**Case Name:** Golshan v. Kamali
**MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENAS**

**Facts:**

* Plaintiff Hamed Golshan alleges that defendant Mike Kamali was a 50% shareholder of Saint Glen, Inc., which operates a restaurant in Los Angeles County.
* In September 2019, Kamali agreed to sell his interest to Golshan for $750,000.
* The sale was to be consummated on December 30, 2019, but Kamali failed to perform his obligations.
* Golshan alleges that Kamali made false representations and failed to pay vendors, file taxes, and pay rent.

**Analysis:**

* Deponents Ali R. Mirhosseini and Mirhosseini Law Group, APC (MLG) seek to quash deposition subpoenas served on them.
* The subpoenas seek records relating to Saint Glen, Inc., including communications between Mirhosseini and Amir Talebi.
* The deponents claim that the subpoenas violate attorney-client privilege, as defendant Kamali seeks testimony and production of documents from MLG that would disclose confidential communications between Ataian and Talebi.

**Procedural Issues:**

* The deponents argue that the subpoenas must be quashed because defendant Kamali failed to comply with California Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.3(c), which requires that the subpoenaing party serve a proof of personal service or of service by mail attesting to compliance with subdivision (b) on the witness.
* The court finds that there was a failure to comply with CCP section 1985.3(c) in connection with the Mirhosseini subpoena.

**Attorney-Client Privilege:**

* The court finds that the deponents have met their burden of showing that the requests involve communications between the attorney and client in the course of an attorney-client relationship.
* The court orders the deponents to produce documents and respond to questions that pertain to matters that Talebi has not maintained in confidence.
* The deponents may also object to specific deposition questions that they believe remain subject to the attorney-client privilege, with the basis for the claim of privilege stated on the deposition record.

**Joint Attorney-Client Relationship:**

* Defendant Kamali argues that an implied attorney-client relationship existed between Mirhosseini and/or MLG and Kamali, so that Ataian may not claim attorney-client privilege with respect to the matter of common interest.
* The court finds that the totality of the circumstances does not imply an agreement by Mirhosseini not to accept other representations adverse to Kamali's personal interests.

**Ruling:**

* The court denies the motion to quash the subpoenas as to the requests that request documents reflecting communications with Talebi.
* The court grants the motion to quash the subpoena to Mirhosseini, as there was a failure to comply with CCP section 1985.3(c).
* The court will consider granting the motion as to the Mirhosseini subpoena on the ground that the subpoenaing party failed to comply with CCP section 1985.3(c) and will quash the subpoena without prejudice to defendant properly serving a subpoena on the witness, if necessary.
