And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of two employees of the defendant, Service Advisor Patrick Moradian and Technician David Diaz. The court finds that the motion does not comply with the court's case management order, specifically CCP § 2025.230, which requires that deponents be identified experts or the person most knowledgeable about the subject matter. The court orders the parties to meet and confer in good faith concerning compliance with the court's order, and to serve any further discovery and engage in further discovery proceedings in compliance with the order.
