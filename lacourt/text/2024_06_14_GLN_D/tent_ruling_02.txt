Arthur Young & Co. (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436.  In this case, plaintiff has failed to respond to an authorized method of discovery and defendants have submitted evidence that they have incurred expenses as a result of the conduct.  Since the motions are unopposed, there is no evidence that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.   Sanctions will be awarded.  The sanctions requested are $1,187.50 for each of the two motions.  The sanctions requested include 2 hours of time at $250 per hour for each motion to review opposition and prepare replies, but there are no oppositions, so that time will be minimal.  In addition, one hour of time is sought for each motion to attend the hearing, when both of the motions will be heard together and likely attended remotely.   The sanctions awarded are adjusted accordingly as follows: 1.75 hours at $250.00 per hour to prepare motions given there is no opposition filed and 1 hour to participate in hearing by remote appearance charged to one motion only.RULING:[No Opposition]Defendant CP IV Glendale, LLC’s UNOPPOSED Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production, Set One, to Plaintiff Sashile Wood is GRANTED. Plaintiff Sashile Wood is ordered to serve verified responses to Defendant CP IV Glendale, LLC’s Requests for Production of Documents to Plaintiff, Set One, without objection, and to permit inspection and copying, within 10 days.  Monetary sanctions requested by moving party:  Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $687.50 (2.75 hours @ $250/hour) [4.75 hours requested] plus $60 filing fee [Amount Requested $1,187.50 ], which sum is to be awarded in favor of defendant CP IV Glendale, LLC and against plaintiff Sashile Wood, payable within 30 days.  CCP sections 2031.300(c), 2023.010(d), 2023.030(a) and CRC Rule 3.1348(a).Counsel for moving party is ordered to prepare an order for sanctions and submit it on eCourt by noon today in accordance with this order. Defendant Glendale Real Estate Partners, LLC’s UNOPPOSED Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production, Set Two, to Plaintiff Sashile Wood is GRANTED. Plaintiff Sashile Wood is ordered to serve verified responses to Defendant Greystar Real Estate Partners, LLC’s Requests for Production of Documents to Plaintiff, Set Two, without objection, and to permit inspection and copying, within 10 days.  Monetary sanctions requested by moving party:  Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $437.50 (1.75 hours @ $250/hour) [4.75 hours requested] plus $60 filing fee [Amount Requested $1,187.50 ], which sum is to be awarded in favor of defendant Greystar Real Estate Partners, LLC and against plaintiff Sashile Wood, payable within 30 days.  CCP sections 2031.300(c), 2023.010(d), 2023.030(a) and CRC Rule 3.1348(a).Counsel for moving party is ordered to prepare an order for sanctions and submit it on eCourt by noon today in accordance with this order. DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCESPlease make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.  Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.  However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED. If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.
