And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion to enforce the settlement agreement in part and denies it in part. The court finds that the parties stipulated to the settlement agreement orally before the court and that the settlement agreement was memorialized on the record before the court. The court notes that it presided over the hearing at which the oral settlement agreement was entered into. The court grants the motion to enforce the settlement agreement in part by ordering the parties to enter into a stipulation for dismissal of the complaint and cross-complaint, which reserves to the court jurisdiction to enforce the oral settlement agreement. The court also orders the parties to pay defendant Suzanne Bloom, as trustee of her trust and individual, the sum of $2,800. The court denies the motion to enforce the settlement agreement in part by denying defendant's request for attorney's fees and costs.
