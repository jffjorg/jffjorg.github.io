The plaintiff, Rogelio Martinez, filed a motion to compel further responses to his requests for production of documents in a lawsuit against General Motors LLC. The defendant opposed the motion, alleging that the plaintiff's discovery requests were overly broad and burdensome. The court denied the motion without prejudice, citing the Standing Order Re Discovery (Song-Beverly Litigation) and the Notice to All Counsel Re: Lemon Law Cases for Department D, Customary Rulings Re Document Requests (Song Beverly Litigation). The court ordered the parties to meet and confer in good faith to resolve any remaining discovery disputes. The court also emphasized that any further objections to discovery requests must be accompanied by a Code-compliant privilege log.
