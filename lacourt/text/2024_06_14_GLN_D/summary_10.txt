And here is a summary in English:

The court's tentative ruling addresses a petition for approval of a transfer of structured settlement payment rights. The payee, Dawn Edwards, is transferring 215 monthly life-contingent payments of $915.00 to Apollo Mathers, LLC. The court finds that Edwards has made reasonable efforts to locate and secure copies of the missing documents. The court notes that the petition fails to include copies of the annuity contract or the underlying settlement agreement. The court also notes that the payee has previously assigned a portion of her structured settlement payments, with the last transfer completed in 2008. The court will inquire at the hearing concerning the service address for the annuity holder and interested parties. The court will also consider the payee's financial and economic situation, the terms of the transaction, and the payee's understanding of the transaction. The court grants the First Amended Petition for Approval for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights and sets a hearing date for June 14, 2024.
