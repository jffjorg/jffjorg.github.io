And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Kaplan Kenegos & Kadin, attorneys for the defendants, to be relieved as counsel of record. The motion was filed due to the client's failure to respond to the attorneys' attempts to communicate and attend mediation, trial preparation, and court hearings. The proposed order was incomplete and did not reflect the current status of the matter. The judge has ordered the attorneys to modify the order before it will be granted. The modified order will include the client's current or last known telephone number, the dates for future court hearings, and the status of the trial date. The judge has granted the motion, and the attorneys will be relieved as counsel effective upon the e-filing of the proof of service of the signed order.
