And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled on its merits. The defendant's demurrer is also untimely filed and served, and the judge will hear argument on the issue at the hearing. The judge notes that the defendant's demurrer appears to be a "speaking demurrer," which is improper at the pleading stage. The judge also denies the defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents. The judge reminds the parties that they must comply with the statutes, rules, and procedures governing this litigation, and that the court may refuse to consider pleadings that are not filed in conformity with these requirements.
