The defendant failed to show that the third-party deponent was personally served with the deposition subpoena, triggering personal jurisdiction or any duty to produce the requested records. The judge also denied the request for sanctions. The parties are ordered to meet and confer in good faith prior to the filing of any further motion on this issue.
