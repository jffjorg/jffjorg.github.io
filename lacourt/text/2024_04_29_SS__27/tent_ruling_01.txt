ON THE MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT 
 
Background
On July 12, 2019,
Plaintiff filed the present complaint under the Federal Employers’ Liability
Act (FELA) against Defendant Union Pacific Railroad Company. Plaintiff alleges
that on February 7, 2017, while he was operating a Hytracker or an excavator on
a rail yard in Van Nuys, California, he hit a broken rail and was derailed,
causing him injuries. Defendant now moves the court for summary judgment
against Plaintiff on the basis that Plaintiff cannot establish the elements of
causation and notice required under FELA. Plaintiff filed an opposition
introducing evidence of notice and causation.
Legal Standard 
 
In reviewing a motion for summary judgment,
courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the
pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent’s
claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence
of a triable, material factual issue.”¿ (Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) 
 
¿“[T]he initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima
facia showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.”¿ (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
1510, 1519.)¿ A defendant moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no
merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action .
. . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)¿ A moving
defendant need not conclusively negate an element of plaintiff’s cause of action.¿ (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826,
854.)
 
To meet this burden of showing a cause of
action cannot be established, a defendant must show not only “that the
plaintiff does not possess needed evidence” but also that “the plaintiff
cannot reasonably obtain needed evidence.” (Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at p. 854.) It is insufficient for the defendant to merely point out
the absence of evidence.¿ (Gaggero
v. Yura (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.)¿ The defendant “must also produce evidence that the plaintiff cannot reasonably
obtain evidence to support his or her claim.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ The
supporting evidence can be in the form of affidavits, declarations, admissions,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and matters of which judicial notice
may be taken.¿ (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at
p. 855.)
 
“Once the defendant . . . has met that burden,
the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or
more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)¿ The
plaintiff may not merely rely on allegations or denials of its pleadings to
show a triable issue of material fact exists, but instead, “shall set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the
cause of action.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary
judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)
 
Federal Employers’ Liability Act
“FELA imposes on
railroads a general duty to provide a safe workplace." (McGinn v.
Burlington Northern R.R. Co., (7th Cir. 1996) 102 F.3d 295, 300.) Because
it is meant to offer broad remedial relief to railroad workers, a plaintiff's
burden when suing under the FELA is significantly lighter than in an ordinary
negligence case. (Lisek v. Norfolk Western Ry. Co., (7th Cir. 1994) 30
F.3d 823, 832; Harbin v. Burlington Northern R.R., (7th Cir. 1990) 921
F.2d 129, 131.) Indeed, a railroad will be held liable where "employer
negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury." (Rogers
v. Missouri Pac. R.R. Co., (1957) 352 U.S. 500, 506.)
To recover under the
FELA, a plaintiff must show that (1) he was injured while in the scope of
employment; (2) his employment was in furtherance of his employer’s interstate
business; (3) his employer was negligent; and (4) the employer’s negligence
played some part in causing the injury for which he seeks compensation. (Green
v. River Terminal Ry. Co. (6th Cir. 1985) 763 F.2d 805, 808.) Therefore, in
a FELA negligence case, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the existence
of a duty owed by the defendant (that is, conduct unreasonable in the face of a
foreseeable risk of harm), a breach of that duty, causation, and damage. (Consolidated
Rail Corp. v. Gottshall (1994) 512 U.S. 532, 538.)
“[T]o establish that a
railroad breached its duty to provide a safe workplace, the plaintiff must show
circumstances which a reasonable person would foresee as creating a potential
for harm.” (Holbrook v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co. (7th Cir. 2005) 414
F.3d 739, 742.) The Supreme Court has made clear that “’reasonable
foreseeability of harm….is indeed ‘an essential ingredient of [FELA]
negligence.’” (CSX Transp. v. McBride (2011) 131 S. Ct 2630, 2643,
quoting Gallick v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. (1963) 372 U.S. 108,
117, 83 S. Ct. 659.) Thus, in order to be liable under the FELA, the railroad
must have actual or constructive notice of the alleged defect or dangerous
condition. (Sears v. Southern Pacific Co. (9th Circuit 1963) 313 F.2d
498; Holbrook, supra, 414 F.3d at 739.)
Request for Argument
The Court would like:
(1) Plaintiff to address what evidence, beyond his
own testimony, supports his claim.  And,
if the evidence is, as it appears to the Court, solely based on his own
testimony, why is that sufficient to defeat summary judgment in light of cases
that indicate that uncorroborated, self-serving testimony is insufficient to
defeat a motion for summary judgment. (See King v. United Parcel
Seruice, Inc. (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 426, 433; Villiarimo v. Aloha
Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d 1054, 1061 (9th Cir. 2002)).
(2) Defendant to address how specifically it met its
initial prima facie burden.  It appears
to rely primarily on the position that Plaintiff did not provide it with
sufficient information to investigate the basis for the alleged incident.  But, Plaintiff did identify that the the
broken rail at issue was in the Gemco Yard in Van Nuys, California, on
Plaintiff’s assigned routes on February 7, 2017, located next to a big mudhole
and has worn paint. Furthermore, the foreman would direct Plaintiff to the
specific track he was to work on. The foreman identified the track that
Plaintiff was responsible for on the date of the incident using numbers or
letters. (Deidel Depo. at 45:19-25.)   Thus,
even without knowing the exact location of the broken rail, it appears that Defendant
could have produced much stronger evidence to support its prima facie case such
as a declaration that it surveyed the track in which Plaintiff was assigned to on
February 7, 2017, and did not find any broken rails meeting these
characteristics provided by Plaintiff. The only affirmative evidence presented
by Defendant is the declaration of Jordan Morgan, who was Plaintiff’s manager
at the time of the incidents. He testified that there were no reports of any
broken rails, derailments, or out-of-level tracks on February 7, 2017. (Morgan
Decl. ¶ 14.) This does not appear to demonstrate that Defendant had no notice
of any broken rails on Plaintiff’s assigned route before the incident.
