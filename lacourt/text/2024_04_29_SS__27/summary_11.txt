And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the defendant's initial responses to the request for production, set one. The defendant provided initial responses on November 29, 2023, and the plaintiff did not request an extension to file a motion to compel further responses. The court has determined that the plaintiff's motion is untimely because the plaintiff did not file the motion within the statutory deadline. The court has also determined that the plaintiff has waived his right to compel further responses. The plaintiff's responsibility is to ensure that the motion to compel further is filed within the statutory deadline.
