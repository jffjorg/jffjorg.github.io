And the summary in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for leave to obtain the plaintiff's mental examination. The Court denied the motion, citing that the defendant did not utilize the six-month period provided to conduct limited discovery. The Court also noted that the defendant did not file a motion to reopen discovery, which is required by law. The Court further stated that the defendant's request to continue the trial date was denied earlier, and there is no reason to revisit that ruling.
