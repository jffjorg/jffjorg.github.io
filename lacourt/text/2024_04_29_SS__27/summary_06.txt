This tentative ruling by Judge LEE addresses a motion to continue the trial date from June 11, 2024 to August 9, 2024.

However, the defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence of prejudice and did not demonstrate sufficient diligence in its efforts to identify the plaintiff's health providers. The court granted a continuance of 6 weeks from the current trial date for mediation and trial preparation. The new trial date is set for July __, 2024, and fact discovery and expert discovery will not follow the new trial date.
