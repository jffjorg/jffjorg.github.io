Summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge is considering the Defendant's motion for summary judgment in a FELA case. The Plaintiff alleges that he was injured on February 7, 2017, while working on a rail yard in Van Nuys, California. The Defendant claims that the Plaintiff cannot establish causation and notice under FELA. The Judge is asking the Plaintiff to address the evidence supporting his claim and to explain why his testimony is sufficient to defeat summary judgment. The Judge is also asking the Defendant to address how it met its initial prima facie burden. The Judge notes that the Defendant could have produced stronger evidence to support its case, such as a declaration that it surveyed the track where the Plaintiff was assigned to work on February 7, 2017, and did not find any broken rails.
