And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial as moot. The plaintiff had previously filed an application to continue the trial and the court had granted the ex parte application. The court has already considered the plaintiff's arguments and granted the ex parte application, making the present motion unnecessary. The judge notes that the present motion is substantially the same as the previous application. The court will consider the motion at the hearing, but the parties are encouraged to submit their views on the tentative ruling by email to avoid the need for oral argument.
