Case No./Name:       20STCV48638 NATHAN THOMAS ECKLOFF vs WALTER
JOSEPH HARRIS
Motion:                    MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
Moving Party:           Plaintiff
Responding Party:    Unopposed
Notice:                      Sufficient
 
Ruling:                              MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS DENIED AS MOOT
 
On December 18, 2020,
Plaintiff filed the present motor vehicle case. On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an application to continue the trial and all trial-related deadlines. The
court granted the ex parte application and continued the trial from
April 22, 2024, to July 30, 2024. All procedural trial litigation deadlines were
to follow the new trial date. On March 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed the present
motion, which substantially has the same arguments as his March 26, 2024 ex
parte application. Since the Court has considered Plaintiff’s arguments and
granted the ex parte application, the present motion is moot and therefore DENIED.
