Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to reopen discovery and potentially continue the trial. The judge found that the defendant was not diligent in conducting their discovery and did not provide a sufficient justification for the delay. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions as the defendant acted with substantial justification. The judge's ruling is based on the law, which provides that the court has the discretion to reopen discovery and grant a continuance of the trial. The judge noted that the parties have been actively preparing for the trial, and reopening discovery or granting a continuance would significantly prejudice the plaintiff.
