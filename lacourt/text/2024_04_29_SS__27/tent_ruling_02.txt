 Case Number:  20STCV44666    Hearing Date:   April 29, 2024    Dept:  27 HON. LEE S. ARIAN DEPARTMENT 27 TENTATIVE RULING  Hearing Date:  4/29/2024 at 1:30 p.m. Case No./Name: 20STCV44666 SARKIS AVAGYAN vs THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Motion: MOTION FOR LEAVE TO OBTAIN PLAINTIFFS MENTAL EXAMINATION Moving Party: Defendant Jose Gabriel Martinez Responding Party:  Plaintiff Notice:    Sufficient  Ruling: MOTION FOR LEAVE TO OBTAIN PLAINTIFF’S MENTAL EXAMINATION IS DENIED  Background On November 20, 2020, Plaintiff filed the present automobile accident case. On January 8, 2021, Defendant Jose Gabriel Martinez served his answer. The initial trial date was set for May 20, 2022, and was subsequently continued multiple times. On September 21, 2023, the Court continued the trial date to April 11, 2024, and the court closed all discovery, except for limited discovery specifically related to orthopedics and neuropsychological independent medical examinations (IME). The deadline for the limited fact discovery was March 12, 2024. On March 5, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to continue the trial date and requested that the discovery cut-off date follow the new trial date. The Court issued a ruling on April 2, 2024, continuing the trial date from April 11, 2024, to July 29, 2024, and permitted expert discovery to proceed, in response to the parties’ request to depose 25 experts designated in the case. However, the Court did not open fact discovery because the parties had approximately six months, from September 2023 to March 2024, to conduct Plaintiff’s orthopedics and neuropsychological independent medical examinations. On February 19, 2024, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s mental examination for February 28, 2024. Defendant refused to produce Plaintiff on shortened notice and contends that Plaintiff never waived the 30-day notice period for mental examination as alleged by Defendant.  Defendant now moves the Court for leave to conduct Plaintiff’s mental examination. Legal Standard Pursuant to CCP § 2024.020, "except as otherwise provided in this section, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right … to have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day before the date initially set for the trial of the action. A continuance or postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen discovery proceedings." When the hearing for a discovery motion is held after the discovery motion hearing cut-off date, the Court cannot grant a motion to compel without first deciding on a motion to reopen discovery (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1588.) “The purpose of imposing a time limit on discovery is to expedite and facilitate trial preparation and to prevent delay. Without a cutoff date, the parties could tie up each other and the trial court in discovery and discovery disputes right up to the eve of trial or beyond. Furthermore, to be effective the cutoff date must be firm or some litigants will manipulate the proceedings to avoid the cut-off date” (Beverly Hosp. v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1289, 1295.) Analysis Defendant did not utilize the six-month period that the Court provided to conduct limited discovery. Defendant issued a notice for Plaintiff’s mental examination on February 19, 2024, and filed the present motion after the discovery cut-off date of March 12, 2024. All deadlines relating to Plaintiff’s mental examination were tied to the April 11, 2024 trial date. Thus, the last date to hear a discovery motion for mental examination was 15 days before April 11, 2024. The present hearing date of April 29, 2024, is far beyond that deadline. Given that the hearing for the present discovery motion occurred after the discovery motion hearing cut-off date, the Court cannot grant a motion to compel without first deciding on a motion to reopen discovery, which was not filed. (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1588.) Furthermore, the Court has already considered and denied Defendant’s request to reopen fact discovery in Defendant’s motion to continue trial on the basis that Defendant had approximately six months, from September 2023 to March 2024, to conduct Plaintiff’s mental examination.  No reason exists to re-visit that ruling. Thus, the present motion is DENIED.  PLEASE TAKE NOTICE:  If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept27@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.  Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.  If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.
