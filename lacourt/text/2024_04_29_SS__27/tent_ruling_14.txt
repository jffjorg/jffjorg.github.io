TENTATIVE¿¿ 
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of
Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video
conference call.
 
Plaintiffs' current attorney, Henry Peacor, states that
Plaintiffs' previous attorney, Chantly M. Geoulla, claims to have an attorney's
lien on the present case. Ms. Geoulla refuses to disclose the amount of
attorney’s fee she is seeking from Claimant. Mr. Peacor also claims that Petitioner
hired Greg Ashcraft to set up a special needs trust for Claimant, but Mr.
Peacor received no communication from Mr. Ashcraft regarding the details of the
special needs trust. The present attorney filed the minor's compromise so that
the issue relating to the special needs trust and the attorney’s lien may be
resolved at the hearing.
 
Besides the two issues detailed above, the
Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of Joziah Porter, a minor and found the following deficiencies:
 
·       
Attachment
11b(3), 11b(6), 12b(4)(c), 18b(4) need to be filed.
·
