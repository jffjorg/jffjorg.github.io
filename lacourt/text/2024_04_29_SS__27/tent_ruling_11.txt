Case No./Name:       23STCV14713 REGINALD WILSON vs JIYEON CHOI
Motion:                    MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE
Moving Party:           Plaintiff
Responding Party:    Defendant Ji Yeon Choi
Notice:                      Sufficient
 
Ruling:                              MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE, IS DENIED
 
For a motion to compel further, “unless notice
of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response,
or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date
to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to the demand”.
CCP § 2031.310(c). 
On November 29, 2023,
Defendant Ji Yeon Choi provided initial responses to Plaintiff's Request for
Production, Set One, via electronic transmission (Exhibit 2 to Motion). The
responses at issue, RFP Nos. 18 and 19, consisted solely of objections. Under
CCP § 2030.300(c), Plaintiff's deadline to file a motion to compel further
responses (“MTCF”) was January 16, 2024, accounting for 45 days plus an
additional 2 court days for electronic transmission. On November 29, 2023,
Plaintiff sent a meet and confer letter requesting further responses by
December 8, 2023. 
On December 4, 2023,
Defendant requested an additional three weeks to provide further responses by
December 29, 2023, but did not offer a reciprocal three-week extension to
Plaintiff’s MTCF deadline given that Plaintiff's MTCF deadline was January 16,
2024. (Exhibit 2 to Reply). Plaintiff did not request any type of extension.
On December 29, 2023,
Defendant requested an additional two weeks to provide further responses and
stated, “We are of course agreeable to providing a reciprocal two-week
extension on your client’s potential motion to compel” (Exhibit 3 to Reply). Plaintiff
agreed to the extension. 
On January 11, 2024,
Defendant again requested a two-week extension to January 26, 2024, to provide
further responses but did not state a reciprocal extension would be provided
(Exhibit 4 to Reply). Plaintiff granted the extension but did not inquire
whether the extension is reciprocal.
On January 24, 2024,
Defendant requested a one-week deadline extension and stated that a one-week
extension to Plaintiff’s motion to compel further would be given (Exhibit 5 to
Reply). On January 31, 2024, Defendant served further responses but did not supplement
responses to RFP Nos. 18 and 19.
On March 5, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the present motion, but it was denied on procedural grounds for
failing to provide sufficient notice. Plaintiff filed a renewed motion on the
same day.
Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s motion is untimely because she only granted reciprocal extensions
on December 4, 2023, and on January 24, 2024, when she explicitly stated in
e-mail exchanges that reciprocal extensions would be provided. Defendant
maintains that she granted only three weeks of extension, moving Plaintiff’s
initial deadline of January 16, 2024, to February 6, 2024. Consequently,
Plaintiff’s motion, filed on March 5, 2024, was untimely.
Plaintiff contends that
all extensions provided to Defendant were all reciprocal, regardless if it was
stated in the emails. This resulted in an eight-week extension to the original
January 16, 2024, deadline, extending it to March 12, 2024.
The Court finds that
the most reasonable interpretation is that the initial three-week extension
provided on December 4, 2023, was not reciprocal because Defendant did not
state it was reciprocal; there was no prior agreement for reciprocal
extensions, and there was no expectation for an extension since Plaintiff had
17 days to file his motion to compel further without the reciprocal extension.
Once Defendant requested another extension on December 29, 2023, and stated
that a reciprocal extension would be provided, it is at least arguable that subsequent
extensions would also be reciprocal, given this agreement and that without such
an extension, Plaintiff would only have a few days to file the motion to compel
further. For example, if the January 11, 2024, extension was not reciprocal,
Plaintiff would have only had five days to file his motion. Based on this generous
interpretation for the benefit of Plaintiff, Plaintiff was granted a total of
five weeks of reciprocal extension since December 29, 2023, when Defendant first
raised the idea of reciprocal extension. This would extend Plaintiff’s January
16, 2024, motion to compel deadline to February 20, 2024. Plaintiff’s motion is
still untimely, and the Court finds that Plaintiff has waived his right to
compel further responses for the responses at issue. 
It is Plaintiff's
responsibility to ensure that the motion to compel further is filed within the
statutory deadline. When the deadline depends on an agreement between the
parties, it becomes even more crucial for Plaintiff to seek clarification.
Through parties’ numerous email exchanges, Plaintiff failed to seek
clarification from Defendant about the agreed-upon deadline for Plaintiff’s
motion to compel, particularly given Defendant's inconsistent responses where
reciprocal extensions were provided in some instances and omitted in others. Plaintiff
argues that supplemental verified responses provided on January 31, 2024, reset
the clock for filing a motion to compel further responses to Defendant’s
initial responses. This interpretation misreads the statute. The service of
supplemental verified responses grants Plaintiff 45 days to bring a motion to
compel further as it relates to the supplemental responses only, not the
initial responses.
Thus, Plaintiff’s
motion is DENIED.
