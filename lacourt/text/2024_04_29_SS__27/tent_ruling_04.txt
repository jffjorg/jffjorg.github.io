PLAZA, LLC, et al.
Motion:                    MOTION TO COMPEL REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, SET
ONE, AND MOTION TO COMPEL REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, SET TWO

Responding Party:    Defendant AMC
Notice:                      Sufficient
 
Ruling:                    MOTION TO COMPEL REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, SET

THE
COURT WILL HEAR FROM THE PARTIES RELATING TO MOTION TO COMPEL REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, SET TWO.
 
This matter stems from
an incident on January 15, 2019, when Plaintiff was allegedly injured after a
piece of tile fell while she was visiting an AMC movie theater. On October 18,
2023, Defendant Simon Roofing served Defendant AMC with its first set of
Requests for Production (RFP Set One). AMC's responses were due by November 21,
2023, but an extension allowed AMC until December 20, 2023, to serve its
responses. On December 4, 2023, Simon Roofing served AMC with a second set of
Requests for Production (RFP Set Two), with responses due by January 5, 2024.
On January 23, 2024,
AMC sent overdue written responses to Simon Roofing's RFP, Set One, and
produced the responsive documents the next day. However, AMC did not send
responses to Simon Roofing's RFP, Set Two, and Exhibit C in response to RFP,
Set One, was corrupted. Simon Roofing now moves the Court to compel AMC to
provide responses to its RFP, Set Two, and produce Exhibit C to its RFP, Set
One.
Defendant AMC served
its opposition stating that it "will have already served substantive
verified responses before or by the hearing date of this Motion, which renders
this motion moot." In reply, Simon Roofing stated that as of April 22,
2024, it has not received Exhibit C nor responses to its RFP, Set Two.
The Court will hear
from the Parties on whether or not AMC has produced Exhibit C and responses to
Simon Roofing’s RFP, Set Two, before the hearing date.
As for Simon Roofing’s
request to compel initial responses without objections to RFP Nos. 7-10; 19-26;
28-30; 32-33; 44-46; and 56-60, the Court examined AMC’s initial responses to
Simon Roofing’s RFP, Set One, and notes that the responses were verified and
contained no objections. (Exhibit J). Therefore, Simon Roofing’s motion to
compel RFP, Set One, is denied.
If Simon Roofing seeks
to compel the production of documents responsive to RFP Nos. 7-10; 19-26;
28-30; 32-33; 44-46; and 56-60, the appropriate motion would be a motion to
compel compliance under C.C.P. § 2031.320, not the current motion to compel
initial responses under C.C.P. § 2031.300. Although Simon Roofing filed the
wrong motion, the Court hopes the Parties can resolve this issue without
judicial intervention.
Defendant Simon Roofing
did not request sanctions.
