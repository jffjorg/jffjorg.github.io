The plaintiff filed the suit on August 30, 2023, and the defendant failed to respond to the discovery requests. The plaintiff granted the defendant several extensions, but the defendant still failed to provide the discovery responses. The court finds that the defendant did not act with substantial justification and grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,250.00. The court also orders the defendant and his counsel to pay the sanctions jointly and severally.
