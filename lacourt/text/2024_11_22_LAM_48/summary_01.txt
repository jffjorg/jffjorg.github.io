And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on APPA Colorado LLC's motion to expunge or reduce Zwick Construction Company's mechanic's lien. The motion is granted in part. The judge finds that Zwick's mechanic's lien exceeds the reasonable value of the work and the price agreed to by the parties, and therefore reduces the lien to $784,545.57. The judge also finds that Zwick willfully included improper items and amounts in its lien, but does not order the entire lien forfeited because there is no evidence of an intent to defraud. The judge notes that Zwick has offered to reduce the amount of its lien by the amounts that APPA can prove that it paid to subcontractors. The judge's ruling is based on California law, including California Code of Civil Procedure sections 405.30 and 405.32, and California Civil Code sections 8422 and 8430.
