And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. The defendant, Essex Fountain Park Apartments, L.P., seeks to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff, Ford, alleging intentional interference with contractual relations due to Ford's alleged prevention of improvements and repairs on the property. The property is infested with mold, and Ford has not filed opposition to the motion. The judge grants the motion, citing the legislative mandate to grant motions to file cross-complaints absent bad faith. The judge notes that the case is only a few months old, no trial date has been set, and there is no prejudice in permitting the defendant to file the cross-complaint. The defendant is ordered to file the proposed cross-complaint within 10 days.
