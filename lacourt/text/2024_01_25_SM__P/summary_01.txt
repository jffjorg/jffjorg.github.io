```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to strike portions of the complaint alleging punitive damages. The defendants argue that the plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged punitive damages, but the judge finds that the alleged conduct of the defendant, including becoming intoxicated, driving inattentive to surrounding traffic, driving at excessive speeds, and fleeing the scene after a crash, is sufficient to state a claim for punitive damages. The judge notes that the alleged conduct is "despicable" under the law and that the plaintiff has alleged specific facts showing malice, oppression, or fraud. Therefore, the judge denies the defendants' motion to strike the punitive damages allegations.
