Ruling
Salinas
v. Garcia, et al., Case No. 23SMCV04215
Hearing
date January 25, 2024
Defendants
Garcia & Robinson’s Motion to Strike Portions of Complaint
Plaintiff
Salinas sues for injuries sustained when defendants’ vehicle struck plaintiff’s
bicycle. Defendants move to strike punitive damages allegations. Code Civ.
Proc. § 435/436. The motion is accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. Code
Civ. Proc. § 435.5(a). Defendants’ request for judicial notice of the court
file is granted, per Evidence Code § 452(d) as to the fact of filing and the
allegations made, but not the truth of the allegations.
To state a
claim for punitive damages (Civil Code 3294), plaintiff must allege specific
facts showing malice, oppression or fraud. Smith v. Superior Court
(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042. The basis for punitive damages must be pled
with specificity; conclusory allegations devoid of factual assertions are
insufficient. Id. A motion to strike may lie where the facts alleged, if
proven, would not support a finding that defendant acted with malice, fraud or
oppression. Turman v. Turning Point of Central California (2010) 191
Cal.App.4th 53, 63.¿ 
“Malice” is
defined in section 3294(c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to
cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with
a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” To prove
a defendant acted with “willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety
of others,” it is not enough to prove negligence, gross negligence or even
recklessness. Dawes v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 82, 87. Rather,
a plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating “defendant acted in such an
outrageous and reprehensible manner that the jury could infer that he [or she]
knowingly disregarded the substantial certainty of injury to others.” Id. at
90. The allegations must be sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude defendant’s
conduct was “despicable,” defined as “base, vile or contemptible.” College
Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal. 4th 704, 725.
Defendants
argue plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged punitive damages. Plaintiff alleges
defendant voluntarily became intoxicated despite knowing he was going to drive,
was aware of the probable consequences and potential peril to plaintiff, failed
to avoid the consequences by driving his vehicle inattentive to surrounding
traffic and at excessive speeds on a busy residential street at night, crashed
into plaintiff, fled the scene as plaintiff laid in the middle of the
intersection severely injured and was convicted of a felony. Complaint, p. 6.
In Taylor
v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 892, the court concluded operating
a motor vehicle while intoxicated may constitute an act of “malice” under
section 3294 if performed under circumstances which disclose a conscious
disregard of the probable dangerous consequences. Taylor¿fell short of
holding punitive damages are always appropriate in cases involving driving
while intoxicated. The Court noted, “we have concluded that the act of
operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated may constitute an act of ‘malice’
under § 3294 if performed under circumstances which disclose a conscious
disregard of the probable dangerous consequences.”¿Id.¿at¿p.¿892.
Dawes
v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 82, 89 likewise held driving while intoxicated does not
always give rise to a claim for punitive damages.¿Taylor¿was decided
prior to 1987, when the Legislature added the requirement to Civil Code Section
3294 that conduct be “despicable” to support imposition of punitive damages
under a malice/willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others standard.
Here, plaintiff
does not simply allege defendant was intoxicated but that he was inattentive,
drove at an unsafe speed and fled the scene without checking on plaintiff’s
condition. The alleged conduct, taken together, is sufficient to allege despicable
conduct sufficient to state a claim for punitive damages. DENIED.
