Ruling
Ford,
et al. v. Essex Fountain Park Apartments, Case No. 23SMCV04246
Hearing
date January 25, 2024
Defendant’s
Motion for Leave to File a Cross-Complaint
Plaintiff
Ford alleges the property rented from defendants is infested with mold. Defendant
Essex Fountain Park Apartments, L.P., erroneously sued as Essex Fountain Park
Apartments, seeks leave to file a cross-complaint for intentional interference
with contractual relations based on plaintiff’s alleged prevention of
improvements and repairs on the property, resulting in the termination of
plaintiff’s section 8 housing payments. Plaintiff has not filed opposition to
the motion.
The legislative mandate is clear. A policy of liberal
construction of section 426.50 to avoid forfeiture of causes of action is
imposed on the trial court. A motion to file a cross-complaint at any time must be
granted absent bad faith. Silver Organizations Ltd. v.
Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 98–99.
Defendant
seeks leave to file a cross-complaint, arguing inadvertence and oversight when
filing the answer on October 31, 2023. Defendant contends that no prejudice
will result in permitting leave to file a cross-complaint because the case is only
a few months old with barely any discovery having been conducted. Defendant argues
granting leave is be in the interest of judicial economy.
The case is only a few months old; no trial date has been
set. Additionally, plaintiff has not opposed, and there is no prejudice.
GRANTED. Defendants to file the proposed cross-complaint within 10 days.
