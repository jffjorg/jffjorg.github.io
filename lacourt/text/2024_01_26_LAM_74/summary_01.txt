And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for sanctions filed by Defendant JTH Mesa, LLC and has denied it. Defendant JTH argued that Plaintiff Yan Shalomov brought Defendant JTH into the action without a basis for doing so, but the court finds that the evidence suggests Defendant JTH may be involved with the subject property. The court notes that the standard for evaluating an attorney's certification is set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, subdivision (b), and that the court's decision is based on the light evidentiary burden required to escape sanctions.

Additionally, the court has awarded Plaintiff's counsel attorney fees in the sum of $7,500, as Plaintiff is the prevailing party and incurred fees in opposing Defendant JTH's motion. The court finds that Defendant JTH's motion needlessly increased the cost of litigation, and therefore, Plaintiff's counsel is entitled to reasonable attorney fees.
