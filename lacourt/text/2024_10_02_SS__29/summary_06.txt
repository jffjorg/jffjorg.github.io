And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies, without prejudice, the motion to consolidate three related cases that arise from the same accident. The cases are the Axelrod Action, the Rojas Action, and the Garcia Action. The motion is denied due to a procedural defect in that no notice of motion was filed in the Rojas Action or the Garcia Action. The purpose of consolidation is to enhance trial court efficiency by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence and the danger of inconsistent adjudications. However, the Court must deny the motion due to the procedural defect and the denial is without prejudice.
