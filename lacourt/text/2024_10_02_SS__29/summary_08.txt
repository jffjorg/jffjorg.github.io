Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by LA Live Properties, LLC, the defendant in a lawsuit filed by Sidney Gordon, the plaintiff. The lawsuit alleges that Gordon was attacked by a security guard near the exit door of a Yard House restaurant in Los Angeles. The judge has determined that the settlement between Gordon and LA Live is in good faith under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6.

In making this determination, the judge considered several factors, including the rough approximation of Gordon's total recovery, LA Live's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of the settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial, the settling party's financial conditions and insurance policy limits, and any evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants.

The judge found that the settlement amount of $20,000 is within the ballpark and in good faith under section 877.6. The judge also determined that LA Live has little to no proportionate liability for Gordon's injuries, likely between 0 and 10 percent.

The judge granted the motion and ordered LA Live to give notice of the determination.
