And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion to consolidate three cases (Laurie Action, Mokhtarzadeh Action, and GEICO Action) for all purposes. The motion was filed by Progressive Express Insurance Company and the Estate of Wade Hampton Link IV, and opposed by Plaintiff John D. Laurie. The judge based his decision on a procedural defect, noting that the requirements for a motion to consolidate were not satisfied. Specifically, the notice of motion was not filed in each of the three cases sought to be consolidated. The denial is without prejudice, meaning that the parties can re-file the motion if the procedural defect is corrected.
