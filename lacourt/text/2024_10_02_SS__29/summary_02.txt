And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of nonparty witness Oswaldo Ocampo without prejudice. The Plaintiff had previously filed a motion to compel the deposition, which was denied without prejudice on August 29, 2024, as the Plaintiff had not filed a proof of personal service on the nonparty witness. The Plaintiff has now filed a second motion to compel the deposition, but the Court has denied it again without prejudice due to the lack of evidence showing that Mr. Ocampo was personally served with a subpoena. The Court has emphasized the importance of personal service and has ruled that the motion must be personally served on the nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees to accept service by mail or electronic service.
