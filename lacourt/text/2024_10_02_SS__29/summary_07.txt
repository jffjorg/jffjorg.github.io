And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The motion was filed late, with insufficient notice to the defendant, and lacked supporting evidence. The plaintiff, who is representing herself in the case, failed to provide a supporting declaration and authenticated documents to support her claims. The judge also noted that the plaintiff did not prove each element of the cause of action and show that there is no defense to the cause of action. As a result, the motion for summary judgment is denied without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff can re-file the motion if they can address the deficiencies noted by the judge.
