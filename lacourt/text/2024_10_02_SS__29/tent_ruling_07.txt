23STCV09093
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background 
 On April 25,
2023, Plaintiff Heidy Garcia (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant
LA Rentals alleging a negligence cause of action. Plaintiff has not filed a
proof of service. Defendant has not answered.
 
On three occasions in 2023, Plaintiff filed motions for
summary judgment.  Those motions were
denied because there had been no appearance by defendant.
 
On March 6, 2024, Commercial Property Management, Inc.
dba LA Rentals (“Defendant”) filed its answer. 
 
On September 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for
summary judgment. Plaintiff filed a supplement with documents to support her
motion on September 17. Defendant filed an opposition on September 18. No reply
has been filed.
 
Legal Standard 
 
““The
purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to
cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure
section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor
Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the
pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues;
the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is
any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge
v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development,
Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
 
As
to each cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for
summary judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of
proof by presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of
action ... cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the
cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851.)
 
A
plaintiff or cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary
adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to
show “that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved
each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the
cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff
or cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or
cross-defendant to show that a “triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
 
The
party opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not
simply “rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead
“set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact
exists.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a
triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce
substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th
151, 166.)
 
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”
(Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Discussion 
Plaintiff files a motion summary judgment against Defendant.  Plaintiff is not an attorney and is representing
herself in pro per, which of course is a difficult task under the best of
circumstances.  The basic procedural
rules for motions, including motions for summary judgment, however, apply to all
litigants, regardless of whether they are represented by counsel.
First, a motion for summary judgment must be served on the opposing
party at least 75 days before the hearing. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(2).)  Plaintiff’s motion was filed on September 5,
with additional evidence filed on September 17. 
The hearing date is October 2, 2024. 
That is not sufficient notice.
Second, a summary judgment motion must be heard at least 30 days
before trial, absent a court finding of good cause for a later hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(3).)  The hearing on Plaintiff’s motion is October
2, 2024, with a trial date set for October 22, 2024.  That is not a timely motion.
Third, a summary judgment motion must be supported by admissible
evidence.  Plaintiff, however, provides
no supporting declaration (stating under oath, for example, what Defendant did
or failed to do and how she was harmed by that action or inaction), and the
supporting documents that Plaintiff has gathered and submitted are not
authenticated.
Fourth, a party moving for summary judgment must submit a
separate statement “setting forth plainly and concisely all material facts that
the moving party contends are undisputed.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b).) 

Fifth, a plaintiff moving for summary judgment must, with admissible
evidence (set forth in the separate statement, and supported by appropriate points
and authorities) prove each element of the cause of action and show that there
is no defense to the cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).)  Plaintiff has not done so.
Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
Conclusion
 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s motion for summary
judgment.
Defendant is to provide notice.
