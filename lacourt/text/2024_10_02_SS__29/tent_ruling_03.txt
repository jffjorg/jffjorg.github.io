 Case Number:  22STCV28547    Hearing Date:   October 2, 2024    Dept:  29 Laurie v. Estate of Wade Hampton Link IV
22STCV28547
Motion to Consolidate
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied without prejudice. 
 
Background
 
Moving
parties seek to consolidate three cases pending in Los Angeles County Superior
Court.  All of the cases, the moving
parties assert, arise out of the same series of accidents on September 8, 2020,
on or near westbound Ventura Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. 
 
In
this case, the first filed action (Case No. 22STCV28547), Plaintiff John D.
Laurie (“Laurie”) filed a complaint on August 31, 2022, asserting causes of
action for negligence against Defendants Estate of Wade Hampton Link IV (the “Estate”),
Link Engineering Incorporated (“LEI”), and Does 1 through 20 (the “Laurie
Action”). 
 
On
July 10, 2024, the Estate filed its answer.
 
On
filing, the Laurie Action was assigned to Department 29 of the Spring Street
Courthouse.
 
In
the second filed action (Case No. 22STCV29023), Plaintiff Elahe Mokhtarzadeh
(“Mokhtarzadeh”) filed a complaint on September 6, 2022, against Wade Hampton
Link, LEO, and Does 1 through 50 (the “Mokhtarzadeh Action”)
 
On
February 14, 2023, LEI filed its answer. 
 
November
20, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name the Estate as Doe 1. 
 
On
April 25, 2024, Progressive Express Insurance Company (“Progressive”) filed an
answer in intervention.
 
On
filing, the Mokhtarzadeh Action was assigned to Department 29 of the Spring
Street Courthouse.
 
In
the third filed action (Case No. 23STLC05506), Geico General Insurance Company
(“GEICO”) filed a complaint on August 28, 2023, against LEI and Does 1 through
V (the “GEICO Action”).
 
On
filing, the GEICO Action was assigned to Department 26 of the Spring Street
Courthouse.
 
As
is relevant here, on July 3, 2024, Progressive gave notice in the Mokhtarzadeh
Action and the GEICO Action (but not the Laurie Action) that it was moving to
consolidate the Laurie Action, the Mokhtarzadeh Action, the GEICO Action, and a
fourth case pending in Ventura County Superior Court (Wilt v. Link Engineering).  The motion was set for hearing on July 15,
2024, in Department 43 in Ventura County Superior Court.  It is not completely clear to the Court what
happened at that hearing, but based on the subsequent proceedings here it appears
that Progressive’s motion to consolidate the four cases was denied.
 
On
August 28, 2024, Progressive filed a notice of related case, identifying the
Laurie Action, the Mokhtarzadeh Action, and the GEICO Action as related.  The Court deemed the cases related by Minute
Order dated September 16, 2024, and reassigned the GEICO Action to Department
29.
 
On
September 3, 2024, Progressive and the Estate filed this motion to consolidate the
Laurie Action, the Mokhtarzadeh Action, and the GEICO Action for all purposes.
 
Plaintiff
Laurie filed an opposition on September 17, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd.  (a).)
 
“The purpose of consolidation is to enhance trial court efficiency
by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence and the danger of inconsistent
adjudications.  (See Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon
Shield Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-979.)
There are two types of consolidation: a
complete consolidation for all purposes, and a more limited consolidation for
trial or certain other specific purposes (such as pre-trial discovery).  (Hamilton
v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147; Sanchez v. Super. Ct. (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1391, 1396; see also 3
Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (2024),
¶¶ 12:340-341.3.)  When cases are
consolidated for all purposes, “the two actions are merged into a single proceeding
under one case number and result in only one verdict or set of findings and one
judgment.”  (Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1147; see also Sanchez, supra, 203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1396.)  In a consolidation for limited purposes, “the
two actions remain otherwise separate.” 
(Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at
p. 1147; see also Sanchez,
supra, 203 Cal.App.3d at p.
1396.)  
“Consolidation
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1048 is permissive, and it is for the
trial court to determine whether the consolidation is for all purposes or for
trial only.” (Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1149.) 
The
trial court should not consolidate actions where prejudice would result to any
party.  (See State Farm Mutual Auto.
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d 428, 430.)
 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.350, establishes a number of procedural requirements for
a motion to consolidate:
 
“(a) Requirements of motion
(1)  A notice of
motion to consolidate must:
(A)  List all named
parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of
their respective attorneys of record;
(B)  Contain the
captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered
case shown first; and
(C)  Be filed in
each case sought to be consolidated.
 
(2)  The motion to
consolidate:
(A)  Is deemed a
single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case; 
(B)  Must be served
on all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases
sought to be consolidated; and
(C)  Must have a
proof of service filed as part of the motion.”
 
Discussion
 
Progressive
and the Estate seeks an order consolidating for all purposes the Laurie Action,
the Mokhtarzadeh Action, and the GEICO Action. 
Plaintiff Laurie opposes the motion.
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.350 sets
forth a number of strict procedural requirements for a motion to
consolidate.  Those requirements are not
satisfied here.  
Rule 3.350, subdivision (a)(1)(C) requires
that the notice of motion “must … [b]e filed in each case sought to be
consolidated.”  No notice of motion was
filed in the Mokhtarzadeh Action and the GEICO Action.  
Accordingly,
the Court must deny the motion to consolidate. 
The denial is based on a procedural defect and therefore is without
prejudice.
 
The Court does
not express any views on the merits of the consolidation motion or the
arguments made in Plaintiff Laurie’s opposition.
 
Finally,
the Court notes that Plaintiff Laurie also raises an issue with regard to
reclassification of the GEICO Action and the payment of a reclassification fee.  If moving parties file a new motion, and if the
motion is granted, consolidation will be contingent upon the reclassification
and payment of the required fee. 
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES
without prejudice the motion to consolidate for all purposes the Laurie
Action, the Mokhtarzadeh Action, and the GEICO Action.
 
Moving Party to give notice.
