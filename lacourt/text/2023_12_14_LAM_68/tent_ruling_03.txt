 Case Number:  23STCV01749    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  68 D&O TradeCo Inc. vs. Gredale LLC, 23STCV01749
Motion to Strike Defendant Gredale LLC’s Answer to Complaint
and Enter Default

Moving Party: Plaintiff D&O
TradeCo Inc.

Background
            Plaintiff
D&O TradeCo Inc. (Plaintiff) has filed this motion to strike Defendant
Gredale LLC’s Answer to Complaint and Enter Default because Defendant Gredale
LLC (Defendant) is no longer represented by counsel. On November 3, 2023, the
Court granted Defendant’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel. Defendant
is a corporation and cannot represent itself. The Court instructed Defendant in
its order that Defendant should immediately seek legal advice regarding legal
representation. Defendant had not retained new counsel as of the date of filing
of this motion on November 13, and as of December 11, Defendant has still not
retained new counsel. 
            Plaintiff
filed this motion pursuant to CCP §§ 435 and 436. No opposition has been filed
to the motion.
Analysis
            CCP § 435
allows a party to file a motion to strike to a whole pleading or any part
thereof. CCP § 436(b) allows a court to strike out all or any part of any
pleading that is not drawn in conformity with the laws of the state.
            California
law prohibits Defendant from representing itself in this action in propria
persona. (See Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21
Cal.3d 724, 729-730 (a company cannot participate in litigation unless it is
represented by a lawyer); Thomas G. Ferruzzo v. Superior Court (1980)
104 Cal.App.3d 501, 503 (“The rule is clear in this state that, with the sole
exception of small claims court, a corporation cannot act in propria persona in
a California state court.”).) California courts have stricken pleadings of
corporations that are not represented by counsel. (See Paradise v. Nowlin
(1948) 86 Cal.App.2d 897, 898.)
            Defendant
is no longer represented by counsel. It is appropriate, pursuant to CCP §
436(b) and case law, to strike Defendant’s answer. In striking Defendant’s
answer, default should be entered because Defendant no longer has a responsive
pleading filed to Plaintiff’s complaint.
            The Court
grants Plaintiff’s motion to strike Defendant’s answer and enter default.
Order
1.      Defendant’s
answer is ORDERED STRICKEN.
2.      Default
is entered against Defendant Gredale LLC.
