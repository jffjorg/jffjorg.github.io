And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion by defendant International Specialty Insurance Services, Inc. (ISI) to interplead funds with the court. The funds in question are $133,624.68, which consists of Certain Underwriters' net premium, the Howard Global commission, plus accrued interest. The funds were previously held by ISI, who is seeking to interplead them with the court because they have no interest or claim to the funds. The plaintiffs, Matthew Garza and Certain Underwriters, dispute ownership of the funds, with Garza arguing that the funds belong to him and Certain Underwriters arguing that they belong to them. The judge finds that CCP § 386 provides for the statutory right of interpleader, allowing a party that holds disputed funds to deposit them with the court when that party has no claim to the funds. The judge grants the motion and orders ISI to deposit the funds with the court, to be held until further order of the court.
