Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motions to deem five sets of requests for admissions admitted and requests for sanctions. The plaintiff had served the requests on the defendant, who responded with some objections. The parties had agreed to an extension of the deadline for filing motions to compel further responses, but the plaintiff did not file the motions. Instead, the plaintiff filed motions to deem the requests admitted, which is not the proper type of motion. The judge has denied the motions due to procedural defects and has reminded the parties to comply with discovery obligations in good faith.
