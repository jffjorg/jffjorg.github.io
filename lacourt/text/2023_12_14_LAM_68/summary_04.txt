Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the Seventh Cause of Action for Sexual Assault and Battery in a lawsuit between defendant SkyHop Global LLC and plaintiff Alexis Craney-Foster. The demurrer argues that the cause of action fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant and that the defendant cannot be held liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has 20 days to revise the complaint to state a valid cause of action. The court has also granted the defendant's motion to strike certain allegations from the complaint, which refer to events that occurred prior to August 21, 2021, and are no longer relevant to the lawsuit.
