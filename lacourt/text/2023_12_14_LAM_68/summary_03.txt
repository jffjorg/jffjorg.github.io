The judge has made a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer to the complaint and enter default. The defendant, Gredale LLC, is a corporation and cannot represent itself in court. Despite being advised to seek new counsel, the defendant has failed to do so and has not filed an opposition to the motion. The judge cites California law and case precedent to support the decision, including the rule that a corporation cannot participate in litigation without a lawyer. The judge orders the defendant's answer to be stricken and default to be entered against the defendant.
