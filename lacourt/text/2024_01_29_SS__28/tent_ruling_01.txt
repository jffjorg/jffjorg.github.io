  Case Number:  22STCV08569    Hearing Date:   January 29, 2024    Dept:  28 Having considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. BACKGROUND On March 9, 2022, Plaintiff Roxana Contreras (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Villalobos Market, Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 50 for negligence and premises liability. On November 8, 2022, Defendant filed an answer. On October 6, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel. On December 15, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set two, served on Plaintiff and for sanctions.  The motion was set for hearing on January 29, 2024.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. Trial is currently scheduled for April 8, 2024. PARTY’S REQUESTS Defendant requests that the Court deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set two, served on Plaintiff and award sanctions. LEGAL STANDARD Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: “If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: “(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. “(b) The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). “(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) DISCUSSION On August 25, 2023, Defendant Villalobos Market, Inc. (“Defendant”) served requests for admission, set two, on Plaintiff Roxana Contreras (“Plaintiff”). Responses were due September 24, 2023. Plaintiff did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time Defendant filed this motion. The Court grants the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 and deems admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission. Defendant requests monetary sanctions of $250.00.  However, Defendant has not provided a declaration supporting the amount of sanctions sought.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040 [notice of motion for sanction “shall be . . .  accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanctions sought”].) Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.050, subdivision (a), authorizes a $1,000 sanctions award (previously $250) when a party fails to respond in good faith to a document request or inspection demand or in other situations involving document requests.  Defendant does not identify a similar statute authorizing a specific amount of sanctions to be awarded against a party who fails to respond to requests for admission.   Although a sanctions award is mandatory when a party's failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitates a motion to compel, the Court cannot grant Defendant's request for sanctions without a declaration supporting, or a statute authorizing, the amount requested.  The Court denies the request. CONCLUSION The Court GRANTS Defendant Villalobos Market, Inc.’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set two, served on Plaintiff Roxana Contreras. The Court DENIES Defendant Villalobos Market, Inc.’s request for sanctions. Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. Moving party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
