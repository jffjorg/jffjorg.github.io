And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Defendant Villalobos Market, Inc. to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set two, served on Plaintiff Roxana Contreras. The motion was filed because Plaintiff failed to respond to the requests for admission, which were served on August 25, 2023. The Court granted the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, which states that a party who fails to serve a timely response to requests for admission waives their right to object to the requests and may be subject to sanctions. However, the Court denied Defendant's request for sanctions of $250.00 because Defendant did not provide a declaration supporting the amount of sanctions sought. The Court also noted that while Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.050 authorizes a $1,000 sanctions award in certain situations, Defendant did not identify a similar statute authorizing a specific amount of sanctions to be awarded against a party who fails to respond to requests for admission.
