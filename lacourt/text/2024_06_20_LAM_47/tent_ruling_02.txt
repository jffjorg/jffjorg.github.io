STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for breach of contract. Plaintiffs allege that
Defendant failed to pay for contracting and construction services for a work of
improvement on an apartment building. 
 
Defendant moves to deem the truth
of matters stated in requests for admissions propounded to Plaintiff Gerald
Yates as admitted, and for sanctions. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant’s Motion to Deem the
Truth of Matters Stated in Requests for Admissions as to Plaintiff Gerald Yates
is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Defendant moves to deem the truth
of matters stated in requests for admissions propounded to Plaintiff Gerald
Yates as admitted, and for sanctions. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
When a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to respond, the party
propounding the requests may move for an order that the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).)
“The court shall make this order [deem the requests admitted], unless it finds
that the party to whom the request for admissions have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with section 2033.220.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
served Requests for Admissions on Plaintiff on February 9, 2024. (Declaration
of Yasmine Novian ISO Mot. ¶ 2 Exh. 1.) On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff
requested, through former counsel Byron Mauss, an extension of time to respond
to March 26, 2024. (Id. ¶ 3.) That request was granted. (Id.)
However, to date, no responses have been provided. (Id. ¶ 8.) Defendant
is therefore entitled to an order deeming the truth of the matters stated in
those requests for admissions. 
 
Sanctions
 
            Defendant
also requests sanctions against “Defendant and its counsel.” (Notice of Motion
p.2:6.) Although the body of the moving papers indicate that this request was
intended for Plaintiff Yates, the Notice of Motion does not say so. Nor does it
identify any “counsel” against whom sanctions should be imposed.  An award of sanctions that has not been
properly requested in a notice of motion does not comply with the statutory
requirements and is a violation of the opposing party’s right to due process.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.040.) The Court therefore cannot award sanctions on
this record. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters Stated in Requests for
Admissions as to Plaintiff Gerald Yates is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant’s
request for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
