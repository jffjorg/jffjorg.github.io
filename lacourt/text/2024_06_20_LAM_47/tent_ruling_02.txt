·

STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for breach of contract. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants
breached a purchase agreement for a parcel of real property by unilaterally
cancelling escrow. 
 
Plaintiffs move for specific
performance of the purchase agreement. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
            
Plaintiffs move for specific
performance of the purchase agreement. 
 
Although Plaintiffs cite a raft of
statutes and cases concerning the standard for specific performance once
liability is established, none of those citations stand for the proposition
that the Court may compel specific performance of a contract, in general,
absent a finding of liability against the party whose performance is to be
compelled. In particular, although Plaintiffs’ reply papers claim that Anderson
v. Treat supports their argument, that opinion is totally unrelated to the
issues at hand and does not address specific performance of a contract in any
way. (See, generally, Anderson v. Treat (1924) 187 Cal. 95.) Moreover, while
the Court retains the power to order injunctive relief before liability is
determined, Plaintiffs have not noticed their request as a motion for
preliminary injunction (Code Civ. Proc. § 576) and have not complied with the
procedural requirements for such a motion (Cal. Rules of Court 3.1150.)
Further, specific performance as sought by Plaintiffs would
require a detrimental alteration of Defendant’s position and thus would
constitute a mandatory injunction. (See Daly v. San Bernardino Cnty. Bd. of
Supervisors (2021) 11 Cal.5th 1030, 1041.) Mandatory injunctions are
disfavored and generally only lie where the right to affirmative relief is
clearly established. (See, e.g., Teachers Ins. & Annuity Ass’n v.
Furlotti (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1493.) Plaintiffs’ demonstration of a
likelihood of success in the context of a Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens does
not meet that standard. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion for
Specific Performance is DENIED. 
 
Moving Parties to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
