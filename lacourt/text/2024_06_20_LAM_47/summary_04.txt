```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiffs' motion for specific performance, which seeks to enforce a purchase agreement. The judge finds that the motion is premature, as liability has not been established, and that compelling specific performance would require a detrimental alteration of the defendant's position. The judge notes that mandatory injunctions are disfavored and generally only granted where the right to affirmative relief is clearly established. The judge orders the moving parties to give notice of the denial of the motion.
