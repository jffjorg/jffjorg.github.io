The motion was granted despite the fact that the matter is not yet set for trial and there are no other hearings currently on calendar. The court found that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the low risk of prejudice to Plaintiff warranted the withdrawal. The court's ruling is conditioned on Moving Counsel giving notice to all parties of the ruling and filing proof of service of that notice with the court.
