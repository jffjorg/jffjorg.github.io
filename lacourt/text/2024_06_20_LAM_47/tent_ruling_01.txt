CASE
HISTORY:

10/23/19:
     Complaint filed.
03/25/20:
     First Amended Complaint filed.
08/12/20:
     Second Amended Complaint filed.
11/09/20:
     Third Amended Complaint filed.
12/08/23:
     Joint stipulation entered dismissing Defendant Statebridge Co., LLC entirely
     and dismissing all remaining claims except the third cause of action for
     declaratory relief against Defendant Wilmington. 

 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for fraud and
breach of contract stemming from an allegedly wrongful foreclosure on a parcel
of real property owned by Plaintiff. 
 
            Defendant
Wilmington Savings Fund Society and Plaintiff Ana Liza Filio bring
cross-motions for summary judgment pursuant to a joint stipulation. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. The Court finds that the 2018 Repayment
Agreement obligated Plaintiff to pay $10,000 on or before May 15, 2018, and to
pay the remaining balance of $23,738.92 on or before April 15, 2021 without any
particular repayment schedule. Consequently, Plaintiff did not breach the
Agreement in April 2019 or thereafter, and Statebridge Co., LLC’s refusal to
accept payment in July 2019 was improper. As a result, the Court finds that the
Repayment Agreement remains in effect, and Plaintiff owes only the outstanding
balance on the Repayment Agreement before this dispute arose, totaling $14,507.18.

 
DISCUSSION:
 
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment
 
            Defendant Wilmington
Savings Fund Society, FSB, d/b/a Christiana Trust as Trustee for PNPMS Trust I
moves for summary judgment pursuant to the December 8, 2023 Joint Stipulation. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The function of a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an
opposing party can show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and, if
not, to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment
if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from
the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” 
(Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.)  “The function of the pleadings in
a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the
function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any
triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge
v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-82.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (Code Civ Proc. § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes,
Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) The lack of opposition by a plaintiff is
not grounds to grant a motion for summary judgment if a defendant cannot meet
their initial burden of proof. (See Thatcher v. Lucy Stores, Inc. (2000)
79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1087.)
 
            Once the
defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that
a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action
or a defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
Procedural Objection to Motion
 
            At the
outset, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is
improper because Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of her rights and
obligations, even if that determination is adverse.  Plaintiff’s sole authority for that position
is Arroyo v. Regents of University of California, which states only that
general demurrers are disfavored for declaratory relief claims because a
plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of rights, even if those rights are
adverse. (Arroyo v. Regents of University of California (1975) 48
Cal.App.3d 793, 795-96.) This authority has no bearing on a motion for summary
judgment, especially where, as here, Defendant is not challenging Plaintiff’s
entitlement to a determination of her rights and obligations, but rather is
seeking an adverse determination of those rights and obligations. Plaintiff’s
assertion is therefore without merit. 
 
Plaintiff’s Evidentiary Objections
 
            Plaintiff
raises a series of evidentiary objections to Defendant’s supporting evidence.
The Court rules on these objections as follows:
 
1. Declaration of Kristina M. Pelletier
 
            Objection
No. 2: OVERRULED. The transcripts are authenticated via the declaration
describing the chain of custody of the underlying recordings, which are
themselves described in the December 2020 Declaration of Amber Night Costello
included in Defendant’s compendium of exhibits. Defendant’s responses to
interrogatories do not make this evidence irrelevant, as Defendant’s position
is that the agreement requires monthly payments on its face. This testimony is
not hearsay. 
 
            Objection
No. 3: OVERRULED. The transcripts are authenticated via the declaration
describing the chain of custody of the underlying recordings, which are
themselves described in the December 2020 Declaration of Amber Night Costello
included in Defendant’s compendium of exhibits. Defendant’s responses to
interrogatories do not make this evidence irrelevant, as Defendant’s position
is that the agreement requires monthly payments on its face.
 
2. Declaration of Amber Night Costello
 
            Objection
No. 4: OVERRULED. The statement is not hearsay, nor is it ambiguous nor an
improper conclusion: it is stipulated and undisputed that Plaintiff had not
made payments on the loan between January 1, 2009, and May 15, 2018. The
declarant is testifying as custodian of records, and personal knowledge is not
required. (Jazayeri v. Mao (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 301, 322, 324.) The Secondary
Evidence Rule is not applicable as the testimony is offered to authenticate the
transcripts, not to prove their contents. 
 
3. Declaration of Stefanie Jeffries
 
            Objection
No. 9: SUSTAINED under the secondary evidence rule with respect to the
contents of the letter. The document speaks for itself. OVERRULED with respect
to personal knowledge that the letter was sent and authenticity of the document,
as the declarant is testifying as custodian of records, and personal knowledge
is not required. (Jazayeri v. Mao (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 301, 322, 324.)
Also OVERRULED as to relevance with respect to whether the letter was sent:
this testimony is plainly relevant.
 
            Objection
No. 10: OVERRULED. This document is authenticated by the accompanying
declaration, is not a conclusion, legal or otherwise, and is relevant. The
document is not hearsay because it is not offered for the truth of its contents
but rather to establish the existence of its contents. 
 
            Objection
No. 11: SUSTAINED as an improper legal conclusion to the extent the
testimony is offered to establish that Plaintiff was in default and SUSTAINED
under the secondary evidence rule with respect to the contents of the May 7,
2019 notice. OVERRULED with respect to whether Statebridge received payments
between March 29, 2019 and July 8, 2019. The declarant is testifying as
custodian of records, and personal knowledge is not required. (Jazayeri v.
Mao (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 301, 322, 324.) The secondary evidence rule is
not applicable here, and this portion of the testimony is not a conclusion,
legal or otherwise. This testimony is also relevant on its face. Also OVERRULED
with respect to personal knowledge that the letter was sent and authenticity of
the document, as the declarant is testifying as custodian of records, and
personal knowledge is not required. (Jazayeri v. Mao (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 301, 322, 324.) Also OVERRULED as to relevance with respect to
whether the letter was sent: this testimony is facially relevant.
 
            Objection
No. 12: OVERRULED with respect to the date of the document. The date of the
document is not hearsay, is not a conclusion, and is facially relevant. The
secondary evidence rule is inapplicable, and lack of personal knowledge is not
a valid objection in this context. 
 
            As the
remainder of the evidence to which Plaintiff objects is not material to this
motion, the Court declines to rule on the balance of Plaintiff’s objections.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(q).) 
 
Defendant’s Evidentiary Objections
 
            Defendant
raises several evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Ana Liza Filio in
support of her opposition to the motion. The Court rules on these objections as
follows:
 
            Objection
Nos. 1-3: OVERRULED. Defendant does not demonstrate how these statements
contradict prior testimony by citation to the relevant evidence. 
 
            As the
remainder of the evidence to which Defendant objects is not material to this
motion, the Court declines to rule on the balance of Defendant’s objections.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(q).) 
 
Stipulated Undisputed Facts & Procedural Posture
 
            The parties
bring cross-motions for summary judgment pursuant to a Joint Stipulation
entered on December 8, 2023. That stipulation sets forth the undisputed factual
history of this case as follows: On or around June 5, 2006, Plaintiff Filio and
Bassiano Martinez purchased the property located at 4339 West 190th
Street, Torrance, CA 90504, APN 4084-024-078 as their primary residence for
$850,000. (Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Fact No. 1; Joint
Stipulation No.1(a)-(b).) This purchase was accomplished via a first, senior
mortgage of $679,920 and a second junior mortgage of $169,980, with the
remainder of the purchase price and closing costs paid by Plaintiff and
Martinez out-of-pocket. (SSUMF No. 1; Joint Stipulation No.1(c).) The junior
mortgage is secured by a Deed of Trust. (SSUMF No.1; Joint Stipulation
No.1(d).) The original owner on both loans was WMC Mortgage Corp. (SSUMF No.1,
Joint Stipulation No.1(e).) 
 
            Beginning
on January 1, 2009, Plaintiff stopped making payments on the junior mortgage,
and it is undisputed that no payments were made during the period through May
15, 2018. (Separate Statement of Disputed Fact No. 2.) Subsequently, Plaintiff
filed for Chapter 7 federal bankruptcy protection which was discharged on
October 14, 2011. (SSUMF No. 3.) Bassiano Martinez quitclaimed all his interest
in the property to Plaintiff on June 7, 2017, leaving Plaintiff the sole owner.
(SSUMF No. 4.) By April 2018, the servicer on the junior mortgage was
Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. (SSUMF No. 5.) On or about March 29, 2019, the
servicing of the junior mortgage was transferred to Statebridge Co., LLC. (SSDF
No. 10.) That same date, the junior mortgage was sold and the deed of trust
assigned to Defendant Wilmington, who remains the owner of the junior loan.
(SSUMF No. 11.) On or around May 15, 2018, Plaintiff and Shellpoint entered
into an agreement for repayment of the junior mortgage. (SSUMF No. 8.) Pursuant
to the stipulation, the parties agree that the sole claim to be resolved in
this case is the third cause of action for declaratory relief, and the sole
issue with respect to that claim is what amount, if any, is owed to Defendant
on the second, junior mortgage. (Joint Stipulation No. 6.) 
 
Obligations Under Repayment Agreement
 
            Defendant
argues that the 2018 Repayment Agreement set forth a schedule for repayment of
the junior loan at a discount, and Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the
payment plan voided the agreement, thereby causing Plaintiff to owe the full
balance of the Loan at $168,077.69. The undisputed terms of the Repayment
Agreement are, as relevant here:
 
1. Shellpoint is to
receive proceeds in an amount not less than $33,738.92 on or before 4/15/2021.
Proceeds must be remitted in certified funds and sent by overnight mail or by
wire. The amount is calculated as a minimum. In the event that the net proceeds
from the settlement exceed the minimum payoff amount, the excess proceeds must
be remitted to Shellpoint. Upon receipt of certified funds, the debt will be
considered to be fully satisfied for less than the amount due and no remaining
deficiency balance will be owed. 
 
2. 36 Payment(s) of
$659.41 includes Release fee of $36.00, with 1st installment of $10,000
on 5/15/2018 totaling $33,738.92 due by 4/15/2021. 
 
3. This agreement is
VOID if a payment is missed or if a payment is returned for insufficient funds
(NSF).
 
(TAC Exh. B [emphasis in original].) Defendant contends that
the Repayment Agreement obligated Plaintiff to comply with a strict monthly
payment schedule. Plaintiff, in opposition, argues that the Agreement imposed
no such schedule aside from the final April 15, 2021, due date. This is a
question of contract interpretation. 
 
The Court of Appeal for the Second District has described the “well
established” rules for interpreting a contract in the context of a summary
judgment motion, as follows:
 
“The interpretation of a contract is a
judicial function. [Citation.] In engaging in this function, the trial court
‘give[s] effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed’ at the
time the contract was executed. [Citation.] Ordinarily, the objective intent of
the contracting parties is a legal question determined solely by reference to
the contract's terms. [Citation.]” (Wolf v. Walt Disney Pictures &
Television (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1107, 1125-1126, 76 Cal.Rptr.3d 585
(Wolf).)
 
“The court generally may not consider
extrinsic evidence of any prior agreement or contemporaneous oral agreement to
vary or contradict the clear and unambiguous terms of a written, integrated
contract. [Citations.] Extrinsic evidence is admissible, however, to interpret
an agreement when a material term is ambiguous. [Citations.]” (Wolf, supra,
162 Cal.App.4th at p. 1126, 76 Cal.Rptr.3d 585; see also Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage & Rigging (1968) 69 Cal.2d 33,
39-40, 69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641 [if extrinsic evidence reveals that
apparently clear language in the contract is, in fact, “susceptible to more
than one reasonable interpretation,” then extrinsic evidence may be used to
determine the contracting parties’ objective intent].)
 
“The interpretation of a contract involves ‘a
two-step process: First the court provisionally receives (without actually
admitting) all credible evidence concerning the parties’ intentions to
determine “ambiguity,” i.e., whether the language is “reasonably susceptible”
to the interpretation urged by a party. 
If in light of the extrinsic evidence the court decides the language is
“reasonably susceptible” to the interpretation urged, the extrinsic evidence is
then admitted to aid in the second step – interpreting the contract.
[Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Wolf v. Superior Court (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th
1343, 1351, 8 Cal.Rptr.3d 649 (Wolf II); [citations].) 
 
“When there is no material conflict in the
extrinsic evidence, the trial court interprets the contract as a matter of law.
[Citations.] This is true even when conflicting inferences may be drawn from
the undisputed extrinsic evidence [citations] or that extrinsic evidence
renders the contract terms susceptible to more than one reasonable
interpretation. [Citations.] If, however, there is a conflict in the extrinsic
evidence, the factual conflict is to be resolved by the jury. [Citations.]” (Wolf,
supra, 162 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1126-1127, 76 Cal.Rptr.3d 585; see id. at p.
1134, 76 Cal.Rptr.3d 585 [“that extrinsic evidence may reveal an ambiguity
subjecting a contract to more than one reasonable interpretation does not mean
resolution of that ambiguity is necessarily a jury question. Absent a conflict
in the evidence, the interpretation of the contract remains a matter of law”].)
 
(Brown v.
Goldstein (2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 418, 432-33.)  
 
“When a dispute arises over the meaning of contract language, the first
question to be decided is whether the language is ‘reasonably susceptible’ to
the interpretation urged by the party. 
If it is not, the case is over. 
If the court decides the language is reasonably susceptible to the
interpretation urged, the court moves to the second question: what did the
parties intend the language to mean? ... Thus, where contract language is clear
and explicit and does not lead to absurd results, we ascertain intent from the
written terms and go no further. If the contract is
capable of more than one reasonable interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we
apply the standard rules of interpretation in order to give effect to the
mutual intention of the parties.  In sum,
courts must give a reasonable and commonsense interpretation of a contract
consistent with the parties' apparent intent.” 
(Department of Forestry & Fire Protection v. Lawrence Livermore
National Security, LLC (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 1060, 1066 [internal quotation
marks, ellipses, and citations omitted].)
 
            In a case where the party moving for
summary adjudication requests a ruling that adopts its contract interpretation
over that of the opposing party, the Court’s first inquiry is whether the
contract at issue is reasonably susceptible to the interpretations urged by the
opposing party – here, Plaintiff.  (Brown
v. Goldstein, supra, 34 Cal.App.5th at 434.) Plaintiff argues that the
Repayment Agreement did not require monthly payments, and, in fact, did not oblige
Plaintiff to comply with any schedule beyond repayment of the reduced balance
of $33,738.92 by April 15, 2021. As Plaintiff states, the Repayment Agreement
does not expressly provide for monthly payments. (TAC Exh. B.) That
said, the Agreement describes these payments as “installments” and states that
it is void if a payment is missed. (Id. Nos. 2-3.) However, the Court independently observes that although
the Agreement provides for 36 installments of $659.41 to account for the
remaining balance, not including the $36.00 release fee or the $10,000 initial
installment, the Agreement sets its due date as April 15, 2021, only 35
months from the May 15, 2018 date of execution, as stipulated by the parties.
(See SSUMF No. 8; TAC Exh. B. No. 2.) The Court therefore concludes that the
Repayment Agreement’s express terms are ambiguous and reasonably susceptible to
Plaintiff’s interpretation: while the terms of the Agreement describe a series
of installment payments, those same terms do not set forth any particular
schedule and directly contradict Defendant’s contention that monthly payments
were required, as the installments described in the Agreement could not satisfy
the full balance within the time allowed if made on a monthly basis. The Court
therefore turns to the extrinsic evidence presented by the parties to interpret
this contract. 
 
            Defendant argues
that the intention of the agreement was to establish a plan for Plaintiff to
make a $10,000 down payment, followed by monthly payments over the next three
years, in satisfaction of the obligation on the junior mortgage. In support of
this position, Defendant principally relies on transcripts of a recorded phone
call on May 2, 2018, between Plaintiff and Shellpoint’s representatives, in
which Plaintiff initially offered to settle the debt for $10,000. (SSUMF No. 6;
Declaration of Kristina M. Pelletier ISO Mot. Exh. D. p.5:21-6:7.) Shellpoint’s
representative rejected that offer and countered with an offer to accept
$10,000 as a down payment and allow Plaintiff to make 36 monthly payments for
the remaining reduced balance of $23,738.92. (Id. p.8:6-10:2.) Defendant
contends that the purpose of the written Repayment Agreement was to establish,
in writing, the repayment plan described in this phone call. Prior negotiations
and conversations may be relied upon to ascertain the true intention of the
parties to the contract. (City of Los Angeles v. Anchor Cas. Co. (1962)
204 Cal.App.2d 175, 183.) As Plaintiff argues in her opposition, Defendant does
not present any evidence of a deadline for each monthly payment That said,
Plaintiff’s own evidence, offered for other purposes in her opposition, shows
that she tendered four payments of $659.41 on April 15, 2019, May 15, 2019,
June 15, 2019, and July 15, 2019. (SSDF No. 12.) Thus, Plaintiff’s subsequent
course of performance suggests that she understood the agreement to require
monthly payments on the 15th of the month in the amount of $659.41. If
that were the case, however, it was not possible for Plaintiff to make 36
monthly payments of the specified amount and satisfy the settlement balance by
April 15, 2021 under the express terms of the agreement. 
 
            The Court
is thus left with four potential interpretations of the contract, none of which
give effect to all the express terms of the agreement and simultaneously
reflect prior negotiations nor subsequent performance. The first interpretation
is that the contract provides for 36 payments of $659.41 at no specified
deadline, plus $10,000 on May 15, 2018, with the full balance of $33,738.92 due
on April 15, 2021. This interpretation, advanced by Plaintiff, rests wholly on
the express terms of the agreement, but limits the reach of provision 3
(voiding the agreement) to missing the initial payment, failure to meet the
April 15, 2021 deadline, or making payments with insufficient funds. The second
interpretation, advanced by Defendant, is that the contract provides for
monthly payments on the 15th of each month, which gives effect to
the voiding provision for all payments and reflects prior negotiations and
subsequent performance, but invalidates the April 15, 2021, deadline. The remaining
interpretations either require that the agreement required 36 payments at
regular intervals of less than a month, or 35 monthly payments of an amount
greater than the specified $659.41. Neither of the latter interpretations are
advanced by either party, and both simultaneously contradict express terms and
some portion of the extrinsic evidence. Defendant, in reply, argues that
Plaintiff’s interpretation should be disfavored because it renders the
requirement for 36 payments and the provision voiding the agreement for missed
payments meaningless. While the voidness provision retains some effect as to
the initial payment, the final deadline, and payments with insufficient funds,
Defendant’s argument is otherwise correct. But no interpretation, not even the
interpretation Defendant offers, is entirely free of this flaw, and the Court
is only obligated to give effect to every part of a contract “if reasonably
practicable.” (Civ. Code § 1641.) In this case, doing so appears not merely
impracticable, but impossible. No matter which interpretation the Court
adopts, some ambiguity remains and, where an unresolved uncertainty remains,
the Court is obliged to construe the contract most strongly against the party
who caused that uncertainty. (Civ. Code § 1654.) In this instance, the drafting
party is no longer involved in the case, but Defendant asserts its contention
that the Repayment Agreement should be cancelled because Plaintiff did not
comply with the payment schedule as the successor-in-interest to Shellpoint, who
drafted the Agreement. The Court therefore must adopt the interpretation least
favorable to Defendant’s position, i.e., that there was no requirement that the
36 payments of $659.41 be made on any particular schedule besides the April 15,
2021, deadline for full payment. 
 
Compliance With Obligations Under Repayment Agreement
 
            Defendant contends
that Plaintiff breached the agreement by failing to make monthly payments
between March 29, 2019 and Statebridge’s cancellation of the agreement as of
June 21, 2019. (SSUMF Nos. 12, 14.) Defendant argues that this failure
triggered the voiding provision of the Agreement, causing Plaintiff to owe the
full balance of the junior loan. The Court does not and cannot construe the
contract as requiring monthly payments, and, for that reason alone, Defendant’s
argument fails. Even if the Court had adopted Defendant’s interpretation,
moreover, the evidence in the record demonstrates a triable issue of fact as to
whether Plaintiff failed to make timely payments on the agreement. 
 
            In
advancing its position, Defendant argues that Statebridge did not receive any
payments from Plaintiff between March 29, 2019 and July 8, 2019. (SSUMF No.
12.) According to Defendant, Statebridge sent a “Notice of Intent to
Accelerate” on May 7, 2019 informing Plaintiff that, according to Statebridge, the
underlying loan was in default and due. (SSUMF No. 13.) On June 21, 2019,
Statebridge sent Plaintiff a follow-up letter claiming that she had failed to
satisfy her obligations under the Repayment Agreement. (SSUMF No. 14.) In
opposition, Plaintiff states that she authorized four payments in the amount of
$659.41 on April 15, May 15, June 14, and July 15, 2019 with Shellpoint, before
the March 29, 2019 transfer of ownership and servicing. (SSDF No. 12.) Plaintiff
contends that she did not receive notice of the transfer of servicing to
Statebridge until June 2019. (SSDF No. 10.) Plaintiff contends that she did not
receive the Notice of Intent to Accelerate until early June 2019, and admits
that she received the letter claiming she had breached the Repayment Agreement
“shortly after” June 21, 2019. (SSDF Nos. 13-14.) Plaintiff argues that, based
on this evidence, she timely tendered monthly payments in the specified amount,
well in advance of their due dates, and the failure of Shellpoint, Statebridge,
and Defendant to deduct those amounts does not create a breach on Plaintiff’s
part. (See Civ. Code § 1512.) 
 
            In reply, Defendant
claims that Statebridge attempted to call Plaintiff on multiple occasions to
discuss the Loan and her payments, and that Plaintiff has no evidence that the
letters described were not sent. Neither contention is material: by Defendant’s
own admission, Statebridge was not able to contact Plaintiff by telephone.
Moreover, the sending of letters is not sufficient to defeat evidence that
Plaintiff did not receive those letters in time to cure her putative breach.
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff’s declaration in support of her opposition
contradicts her prior sworn testimony regarding whether she received notice of
the transfer from Statebridge, but that assertion is not supported by citation
to relevant evidence, although deposition testimony from Plaintiff on that
subject is attached as Exhibit 2 to the Reply. Even in that deposition, however,
Plaintiff categorically states that she did not recognize the transfer letter
shown to her and did not recall receiving it. (Defendant’s Reply Exh. 2.) Thus,
Plaintiff’s argument is consistent with her prior testimony, rather than
contradicting it. Similarly immaterial is Defendant’s citation to correspondence
from Plaintiff’s former counsel dated August 8, 2019, stating that she received
notice of the transfer on or about April 9, 2019. (See Defendant’s Reply Exh.
A.) This correspondence is not competent evidence because it does not establish
a foundation for the conclusion that Plaintiff received that notice on April 9,
nor does it establish how the declarant had this knowledge. Finally, to the
extent Defendant contends that Plaintiff concedes that she was aware of the
transfer before the putative June 15, 2019, payment deadline, the June 21
Notice of Breach in Defendant’s moving papers cites the April payment as the
point of breach. (See Jeffries Decl. Exh. G.) Thus, Defendant’s own evidence
suggests that the failure to make the June payment was of no consequence
because Plaintiff was already in breach.

evidence thus set forth demonstrates that, even if Plaintiff were obligated to
make monthly payments under the Repayment Agreement, there is a triable issue
of fact as to whether Plaintiff properly tendered those payments and whether
Defendant, its servicer, or the servicer of its predecessor in interest failed
to accept those payments when they were authorized. Defendant has thus failed
to establish that Plaintiff cannot prevail on the third cause of action for
declaratory relief and has not demonstrated that Plaintiff must pay the full
amount due on the loan. 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment
 
            Plaintiff
moves for summary judgment on the third cause of action for declaratory relief,
seeking a determination that the Repayment Agreement is in full force and
effect and the amount owed is $14,507.18, less any attorney’s fees and costs to
which Plaintiff might be entitled. 
 
Legal Standard for Summary Adjudication by Plaintiff
 
The function of a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an
opposing party can show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and, if
not, to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment
if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from
the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” 
(Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.)  “The function of the pleadings in
a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the
function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any
triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge
v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-82.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, a plaintiff moving for summary judgment satisfies the initial burden
to show that there is no defense to a claim by proving each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment. (Code Civ Proc. § 437c(p)(1).)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) The
lack of opposition is not grounds to grant a motion for summary judgment if a
defendant cannot meet their initial burden of proof. (See Thatcher v. Lucy
Stores, Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1087.)
 
            Once the
plaintiff has met that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that
a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action
or a defense thereto. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(1).) To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
 
Defendant’s Evidentiary Objections
 
            Defendant
raises several evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Ana Liza Filio in
support of her motion. The Court rules on these objections as follows:
 
            Objection
Nos. 1-3: OVERRULED. Defendant does not demonstrate how these statements
contradict prior testimony by citation to the relevant evidence. 
 
            As the
remainder of the evidence to which Defendant objects is not material to this
motion, the Court declines to rule on the balance of Defendant’s objections.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(q).) 
 
Plaintiff’s Evidentiary Objections
 
            Plaintiff
asserts the same evidentiary objections as those asserted with respect to
Defendant’s motion, except for Objections Nos. 25 through 27, which pertain to
evidence not in Defendant’s moving papers on that motion. The Court therefore
adopts its rulings -- or lack thereof -- on Objections Nos. 1 through 24 above as
if set forth fully herein. 
 
            With respect
to the Declaration of Kristina M. Pelletier in support of the opposition to
this motion, the Court rules as follows:
 
            Objection
No. 25: OVERRULED. Not hearsay, facially relevant, and does not lack for
authentication or personal knowledge. SUSTAINED with respect to testimony of
its contents under the secondary evidence rule. The document speaks for itself.
 
            Objection
No. 26: OVERRULED. Does not lack authentication. Subject to the opposing
party statement exception for hearsay. This exhibit is not offered to prove the
truth of the underlying letter’s contents but to establish its receipt. Facially
relevant, notwithstanding any deficiency in Mr. Weinberg’s knowledge of when
the letter was received, which is not an objection asserted here. 
 
            Objection
No. 27: OVERRULED. The testimony is facially relevant even though it
contradicts Defendant’s argument.  
 
Effect of Repayment Agreement
 
            Plaintiff
seeks a determination that the 2018 Repayment Agreement is in full force and
effect, based on the same arguments asserted in opposition to Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment. For the reasons stated above in connection with
Defendant’s motion, the Court concurs. The Court is obliged to construe the
Repayment Agreement as not requiring repayment according to any particularized
schedule, and, therefore, Statebridge was not entitled to declare the Repayment
Agreement void for failure to timely pay installments between March 29, 2019
and July 8, 2019. Moreover, Defendant’s evidence is substantively identical to the
evidence offered on its own motion and does not demonstrate, even under a
favorable construction as a party opposing summary judgment, that Plaintiff had
notice of the transfer in time to ensure payments were received for April of
2019 before Statebridge elected to cancel the Agreement. 
 
Balance Owed on Agreement
 
            Plaintiff
also seeks a determination that the balance owed on the agreement is $14,507.18.
The undisputed facts establish that Plaintiff sent and Shellpoint deposited a
total of $16,594.10. (Plaintiff’s Separate Statement of Undisputed Material
Facts Nos. 25-35; Defendant’s Separate Statement of Disputed Facts Nos. 25-35.)
The undisputed facts also establish that Plaintiff sent Statebridge a check for
$2,637.64 on July 3, 2019, which was deposited. (Id. No. 36.) Statebridge
sent Plaintiff a check for that same amount on November 15, 2019, purporting to
refund the July 3, 2019 payment, but Plaintiff did not deposit that check. (Id.
No. 37.) Applying this sum to the undisputed total deposited by Shellpoint, the
facts establish that Plaintiff paid a total of $19,231.74 on the Repayment
Agreement, leaving a balance, as Plaintiff contends, of $14,507.18. As
Defendant does not dispute Plaintiff’s calculation, the Court finds that
Plaintiff has demonstrated that the balance owed on the agreement is
$14,507.18. 
 
            As to
interest, Plaintiff contends that she does not owe interest on the Repayment
Agreement because she was not in breach as a matter of law. Defendant does not
contest this argument except to claim that Plaintiff was in breach of the
agreement. As the Court has found that Plaintiff did not breach the agreement,
Plaintiff has demonstrated that she is not obligated to pay any interest on the
balance. 
 
Defendant’s Affirmative Defenses
 
            Plaintiff
also seeks, in the alternative, summary adjudication of Defendant’s affirmative
defenses. As the parties agree that the sole issue remaining in the case is the
balance owed on the loan, the Court finds that this request is mooted by the
Joint Stipulation. 
 
Alternative Motion in Limine
 
            Plaintiff
also moves in the alternative for an in limine order that the Court’s
finding on these motions shall bind the parties at trial. This is a request for
summary judgment or summary adjudication, and no such order is required. 
 
Attorney’s Fees and Costs
 
            Plaintiff
also requests that the Court determine Plaintiff’s entitlement to attorney’s
fees and costs as part of this motion. Attorney’s fees and costs are not issues
subject to a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication under Code of
Civil Procedure section 437c. The Court therefore declines to rule on these
issues without prejudice to a separate, procedurally compliant motion for
attorney’s fees and costs.  
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. The Court finds that the 2018 Repayment
Agreement obligated Plaintiff to pay $10,000 on or before May 15, 2018, and to pay
the remaining balance of $23,738.92 on or before April 15, 2021 without any
particular repayment schedule. Consequently, Plaintiff did not breach the
Agreement in April of 2019 or thereafter, and Statebridge Co., LLC’s refusal to
accept payment in July 2019 was improper. As a result, the Court finds that the
Repayment Agreement remains in effect, and Plaintiff owes only the outstanding
balance on the Repayment Agreement before this dispute arose, totaling $14,507.18.

 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
