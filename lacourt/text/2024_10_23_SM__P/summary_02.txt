And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to strike punitive damages filed by individual defendants (Salvador, Smith, and Searcy-Moore) in a lawsuit filed by Murphy against Los Angeles School District, Salvador, Smith, and Searcy-Moore is GRANTED. The lawsuit alleges assault by a school behavioral aid and seeks damages for assault, battery, IIED, NIED, negligent supervision, false imprisonment, and negligence. The individual defendants argue that punitive damages are not recoverable against government officials acting within the scope of their employment, citing California law and court precedent. The judge has concluded that the plaintiff has failed to establish that punitive damages are appropriate against government officials acting in their official capacity. As a result, the judge need not reach the issue of whether any individual defendant acted with fraud, oppression, or malice.
