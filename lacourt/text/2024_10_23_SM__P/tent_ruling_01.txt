Yu v. Rari Capital Infrastructure,
LLC, Case no. 22SMCV01367
Hearing date October 23, 2024
Counsel’s
Motions to be Relieved as Counsel
Plaintiff
sues defendants Rari Capital Infrastructure, LLC, FEI Labs, Inc. and Jack
Longarzo for breach of contract, conversion, and violation of penal code §496.
Counsel for defendants Matthew J. Norris seeks to be relieved as counsel for
all three defendants, citing a breakdown of working relationships. See
Decls. Norris para. 2. Trial is set for 11/4/2024, 12 days after the hearing on
the motions. 
An
application to be relieved must be made on judicial counsel form MC-051 (Notice
of Motion and Motion) per Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a), MC-052
(Declaration) per CRC rule 3.1362(c), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) per CRC rule
3.1362(e).¿ The proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the
action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known. CRC rule
3.1362(e). Defendants’ counsel has met all obligations under Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1362 for each motion to be relieved.
There
are only 12 days between the court’s ruling on these motions and the start of
trial. There is a risk of prejudice against defendants. The court will
therefore consider a brief continuance for defendants to secure new counsel so
as to avoid prejudice. GRANTED.
