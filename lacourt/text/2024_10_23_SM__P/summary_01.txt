And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion by counsel for defendants Rari Capital Infrastructure, LLC, FEI Labs, Inc., and Jack Longarzo to be relieved as counsel. Counsel, Matthew J. Norris, has cited a breakdown in working relationships with the defendants. The court notes that counsel has met all obligations under Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362 for each motion to be relieved. However, the court is concerned that there is a risk of prejudice against the defendants given the short time frame between the court's ruling on the motions and the start of trial. As a result, the court will grant a brief continuance to allow the defendants to secure new counsel and avoid prejudice.
