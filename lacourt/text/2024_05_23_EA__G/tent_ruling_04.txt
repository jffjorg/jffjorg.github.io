Defendant General Motors
LLC’s Motion to Strike Punitive Damages from Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint is DENIED.
General Motors is ordered to answer the FAC in
ten (10) days.
BACKGROUND
This
is a lemon law action. In July 2021, Plaintiff Jaime Cervantes entered into a warranty contract with
Defendant General Motors LLC (General Motors) by purchasing a 2021 Chevrolet
Silverado. Subsequently, Cervantes alleges the vehicle began to manifest
serious defects with the transmission, electrical, and suspension system.
On October
17, 2023, Cervantes filed a complaint against General Motors and Does 1-10,
alleging (1) breach of express warranty in violation of the Song-Beverly Act,
(2) breach of implied warranty in violation of the Song-Beverly Act, (3)
violation of Section 1793.2, subdivision (b) of the Song-Beverly Act, and (4)
fraudulent concealment.
On November
30, 2023, Cervantes filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against same
Defendants alleging the same causes of action.
On December
27, 2023, General Motors filed the present demurrer and motion to strike. Prior
to filing on December 18, 2023, General Motors’s counsel met and conferred
telephonically with Cervantes’s counsel. (Valencia Decl., ¶ 2.)
A
hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike is set for May 23, 2024, along
with a case management conference.
ANALYSIS
General
Motors demurs to Cervantes’ fourth cause of action (­concealment). For the
following reasons, the Court OVERRULES General Motors’s demurrer.
Legal Standard
A
party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering
demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT
Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding,
the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
Discussion
General
Motors argues Cervantes’ fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment
fails because it is not pled with specificity and does not establish General
Motors had a duty to disclose. The court disagrees.
“[T]he
elements of a cause of action for fraud based on concealment are: ‘(1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.’” (Kaldenbach v. Mutual of
Omaha Life Ins. Co. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 850, quoting Roddenberry
v. Roddenberry (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 634, 665-666.)¿ The facts
constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to
every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the
pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996)
12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)
“A
duty to disclose facts arises only when the parties are in a relationship that
gives rise to the duty, such as ‘seller and buyer, employer and prospective
employee, doctor and patient, or parties entering into any kind of contractual
agreement.’” (Shin v. Kong (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 498, 509, quoting Wilkins
v. National Broadcasting Co. (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1066, 1082.) In this
case, the FAC alleges Cervantes purchased the vehicle from Chevrolet of
Glendora, a retail dealership authorized by General Motors (FAC, ¶ 4.) General
Motors argues the FAC fails to allege Cervantes purchased the subject vehicle
directly from General Motors. (Demurrer, p. 10:27-11:4.)
As
an initial matter, the court notes the FAC alleges Chevrolet of Glendora was
General Motors’ agent. (FAC, ¶ 4.) But even if this is insufficient to
establish a direct sales transaction between General Motors and Cervantes, the
FAC also alleges General Motors made express written warranties. (FAC, ¶ 9.) Express
warranties are contractual in nature. (See Hauter v. Zogarts (1975) 14
Cal.3d 104, 117.) Because General Motors does not address this issue or point
to any authority holding express warranties are insufficient to create a relationship
between the parties, the court finds General Motors’ argument fails.
General
Motors next contends the FAC failed to plead fraud with specificity because it
(1) did not identify which individual concealed material facts, (2) establish
that General Motors knew of the defects at time of Cervantes’ purchase, (3)
point to any interactions with General Motors before or during the purchase of Cervantes’
vehicle, and (4) allege General Motors intended to induce reliance with respect
to Cervantes’ specific vehicle. (Demurrer, p. 9:7-16.) But the specificity
requirement is relaxed “when the allegations indicate that ‘the defendant must
necessarily possess full information concerning the facts of the controversy’”
(Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153,
158, quoting Bradley v. Hartford Acc. & Indem. Co. (1973) 30
Cal.App.3d 818, 825) or if “the facts lie more in the knowledge of the opposite
party.” (Ibid, quoting Turner v. Milstein (1951) 103 Cal.App.2d
651, 658.)
In
this case, the FAC alleges that General Motors knew of the defects at issue
before Cervantes purchased the subject vehicle. (FAC, ¶ 140.) The FAC alleges General
Motors had exclusive knowledge of these defects and intentionally concealed
them. (FAC, ¶ 130-131, 135.) Last, the FAC alleges Defendant intentionally
concealed the transmission defects in vehicles like Cervantes’ so they could be
sold for the maximum price. (FAC, ¶ 139.) Thus, the FAC has alleged sufficient
facts to establish fraudulent concealment.
Accordingly,
General Motors’s demurrer to Cervantes’ fourth cause of action is OVERRULED. Furthermore, because General
Motors’s motion to strike the FAC’s prayer for punitive damages is based on the
grounds that the FAC has not adequately alleged fraud, it is DENIED for the same reasons
described above.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, General
Motors’ demurrer to Cervantes’
FAC is OVERRULED. Furthermore, General Motors’ motion to strike Cervantes’s prayer for punitive damages is DENIED.
General Motors is ordered to answer the FAC in
ten (10) days.
