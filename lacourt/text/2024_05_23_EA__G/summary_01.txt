And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court rules on the motion to quash the deposition subpoena for business records. The defendant/cross-complainant, William Wei Weng, and Miao Li Feng, move to quash the subpoena, arguing it violates the notice requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.3. The court denies the motion, finding that the subpoena does not request records of specific consumers and therefore is exempt from the notice requirements. The court also finds that the subpoena is necessary for the plaintiff, Mo Chen, to uncover the income generated by La Puente Adult Day Care Health Center after Weng failed to provide requested bank statements. The court awards Chen sanctions in the amount of $337.50, payable within thirty days of the issuance of the order.
