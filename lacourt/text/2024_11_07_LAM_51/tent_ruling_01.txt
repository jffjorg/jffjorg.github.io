LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Meet
and Confer
 
obligations
pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. (CCP) §430.41 and demonstrate that they so
satisfied their meet and confer obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant
to CCP §430.41(a)(2) & (3). Here, the meet and confer requirement was not
met per Cross-Defendants’ declaration. However, failure
to meet and confer is not a sufficient ground to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).)¿¿
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states
a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer
hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous
matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿¿ 
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court DENIES Cross-Defendants’
requests for judicial notice. “A party requesting judicial notice of
material under Evidence Code section 452 or 453 must provide the court and each
party with a copy of the material. If the material is part of a file in the
court in which the matter is being heard, the party must specify in writing the
part of the court file sought to be judicially noticed and make arrangements
with the clerk to have the file in the courtroom at the time of the hearing.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.115.) 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Demurrer
 
i.                   
Alter
Ego Allegations 
Cross-Defendants contend that 740 South Broadway
insufficiently alleged unity of interest and unjust result to support alter ego
liability. 740 South Broadway argues it has alleged the ultimate facts.
Cross-Defendants reply that 740 South Broadway possesses or has access to
records and information to support its alter ego claims and failed to do so.
 
To plead alter ego, there must be factual allegations that
would establish a unity of interest, such as commingling of funds and other
assets, the holding out of the entities as liable for the debts of the
principal, use of the same offices and employees, use of one another as a mere
shell or conduit for the affairs of the other, inadequate capitalization and
failure to adhere to corporate formalities. (Automotriz Del Golfo De California
SA de CV v. Resnicke (1957) 47 Cal.2d 792, 796; Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Sup. Ct (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 538.) A plaintiff must also allege an
unjust result if the corporation is treated as the sole actor. (Leek v. Cooper (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th
399, 415.) A plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts to plead alter ego and
survive demurrer. (Rutherford Holdings,
LLC v. Plaza Del Rey (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 236.) Additionally, “less
particularity . . . is required where the defendant may be assumed to possess
knowledge of the facts at least equal, if not superior, to that possessed by
the plaintiff.” (Id. at p. 236.) 
 
Upon reviewing the FACC, 740 South Broadway has sufficiently
alleged alter ego liability. Notably, 740 South Broadway alleges Chol
“dominated, influenced, and controlled” Tenant, “treated the Tenant’s assets,
and monies interchangeably with SHINE,” that there are no separate
personalities between the entities and Chol, Chol participated “to benefit
himself at the expense of the Tenant’s and SHINE’s creditors,” Shine is a “mere
shell and naked framework,” that Chol diverted funds, that Chol directed Tenant
and Shine not to pay 740 South Broadway, is concealing or delaying discovery of
assets to pay Tenant’s creditors, disregarded corporate formalities, and
considering separateness would constitute an injustice. (FACC ¶ 9.)
Cross-Defendants’ argument that 740 South Broadway needed to plead better facts
is not well taken.
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer on this
ground.
 
ii.                 
First
Cause of Action – Breach of Amended Lease
Cross-Defendants contend that 740 South Broadway’s claim for
breach of amended lease is barred by claim and issue preclusion based on prior
civil and eviction actions.[1]
740 South Broadway argues they carved out the damages already sought in the
Eviction Action for the Stipulated Debt, the other court did not retain or
maintain jurisdiction, and they seek new damages so this claim is not barred.
Cross-Defendants reply that the validity hinged on performance of specific
obligations that were not fulfilled as found by another court.
 
The doctrine of res judicata precludes the re-litigation of
certain matters which have been resolved in a prior proceeding under certain
circumstances.  (Brinton v. Bankers
Pension Services, Inc. (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 550, 556.)  “Res
judicata, or claim preclusion, prevents re-litigation of the same cause of
action in a second suit between the same parties or parties in privity with
them.” (Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co.
(2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 896.)  “Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion,
precludes re-litigation of issues argued and decided in prior
proceedings.”  (Ibid.) 
“Res judicata applies if (1) the decision in the prior proceeding is final and
on the merits; (2) the present proceeding is on the same cause of action as the
prior proceeding; and (3) the parties in the present proceeding or parties in
privity with them were parties to the prior proceeding.”  (Fed'n of Hillside & Canyon Associations
v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 126 Cal.App.4th 1180, 1202.)  “Full
faith and credit must be given to a final order or judgment of a federal court.
Such an order or judgment has the same effect in the courts of this state as it
would have in a federal court.” (Levy v.
Cohen (1977) 19 Cal.3d 165, 172-173.)  “A judgment is on the merits
for purposes of res judicata, ‘if the substance of the claim is tried and
determined…’ This may include a judgment of dismissal following a general
demurrer or a dismissal motion if the disposition was plainly reached ‘on the
ground of substance’.” (Association of
Irritated Residents v. Dept. of Conservation (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 1202,
1220.)  The reasoning for this doctrine is that the parties have already
had a fair opportunity to present and litigate their cases.  (Ibid. at 1219.)  However, if the
prior judgment was not on the merits, then res judicata does not apply and does
not bar the new action.  (Goddard v.
Security Title Ins. & Guar. Co. (1939) 14 Cal.2d 47, 52.)  “It is
established California law that a dismissal for want of prosecution is not on
the merits and therefore does not operate as res judicata to a subsequent
proceeding.”  (Mattern v. Carberry
(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 570, 572.) 
 
Upon reviewing the FACC and all papers filed with the
demurrer, the court disagrees that this claim is barred by res judicata. First,
740 South Broadway admits that there are two prior matters between these
parties concerning the Property. (FACC ¶ 17; see also Notice of Related Cases
field December 29, 2023.) 740 South Broadway attached a Settlement Agreement
noting the amount of rent due. (FACC, Exhibit E.) The Settlement Agreement
concerns the subject lease. (Ibid.) 740
South Broadway’s “Amended Lease” refers to amendments to the original lease.
(FACC ¶ 14.) Tenant was evicted on November 29, 2023. (FACC ¶ 22.) The court in
the other action amended the Judgment as recently as February 22, 2024. (FACC ¶
21.) As alleged, 740 South Broadway seeks holdover damages, i.e., the rents
owed from April 2022 until eviction in November 2023. (FACC ¶ 23.) Holdover
damages were not contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. 
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to the
first cause of action.
 
iii.               
Second
Cause of Action – Rent and Damages (Civil Code § 1951.2)
The same arguments and analysis apply to this cause of
action.
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to the
second cause of action.
 
iv.               
Fourth
Cause of Action – Community Property Obligation
Cross-Defendants contend that Mr. Chol signed the lease on
behalf of Tenant Chol Enterprises, Inc. and the personal guaranty in his
personal capacity. 740 South Broadway argues that this claim is proper under
Family Code § 910 to determine the character of the real property held in
trust. Cross-Defendants do not address this in reply.
 
Family Code § 910(a) states: “Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, the community estate is liable for a debt incurred by
either spouse before or during marriage, regardless of which spouse has the
management and control of the property and regardless of whether one or both
spouses are parties to the debt or to a judgment for the debt.”
 
As a threshold matter, the court addresses what this claim
is. The court is not bound by the captions or labels of
a cause of action in a pleading and the nature and character of a pleading is
to be determined from the facts alleged, not the name given by the pleader to
the cause of action.  Thus, regardless of whether the complaint gives the
causes of action a label imbued with personal property law meaning, it is the
facts behind the label which govern the nature and character of the primary
right sued upon.  (Ananda Church of
Self-Realization v. Massachusetts Bay Insurance (2002) 95 Cal. App. 4th
1273, 1281.)
 
“When a common count is used as an alternative way of
seeking the same recovery demanded in a specific cause of action, and is based
on the same facts, the common count is demurrable if the cause of action is
demurrable.”  (McBride v. Boughton
(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 394.) 
 
Here, 740 South Broadway “seeks an accounting . . . for all
community property assets” to the extent Erik Chol is liable for a debt.[2]
(FACC ¶¶ 51, 53.) There is a claim for breach of guaranty by Erik Chol that is
unchallenged. (FACC ¶¶ 42-49.) As such, there is a valid accounting claim.
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to the
fourth cause of action.
 
v.                 
Fifth
Cause of Action – Open Book Account
Cross-Defendants contend the second element is not plead. 740
South Broadway argues that they did not need to allege the existence of a book
because their claim for breach of lease is sufficient. Cross-Defendants do not
address this in reply.
 
“When a common count is used as an alternative way of
seeking the same recovery demanded in a specific cause of action, and is based
on the same facts, the common count is demurrable if the cause of action is
demurrable.”  (McBride v. Boughton
(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 379, 394.) 
 
Here, because 740 South Broadway’s breach of lease claim survives,
so does its claim for open book account.
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to the
fifth cause of action.
 
vi.               
Sixth
Cause of Action – Account Stated
For the same reasoning articulated in the fifth cause of
action, this claim fails.
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to the
sixth cause of action.
 
vii.             
Seventh
Cause of Action – Unjust Enrichment
Cross-Defendants contend this claim is barred by claim and
issue preclusion. Cross-Defendants also contend this claim is barred by
equitable estoppel due to 740 South Broadway’s bad acts in violation statutory
requirements of CCP § 715.010(b)(3) and wrongfully withholding their
possessions. 740 South Broadway argues that this is a factual dispute that is
not proper on demurrer. Cross-Defendants do not address this in reply.
 
For the same reasons articulated in
the first cause of action, this claim survives.
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to the
seventh cause of action.
 
viii.           
Eighth
Cause of Action – Violation of Civil Code § 3439.04(a)(1)
Cross-Defendants contend this claim lacks the requisite
specificity.[3]
740 South Broadway argues they sufficiently alleged this claim and is otherwise
a question of fact. Cross-Defendants reply that 740 South Broadway still failed
to allege fraudulent intent, lack of equivalent value, or insolvency.
 
“A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is
voidable as to a creditor, whether the creditor’s claim arose before or after
the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the
transfer or incurred the obligation” “with actual intent to hinder, delay, or
defraud any creditor of the debtor.” (Civ. Code § 3439.04(a)(1).) “[W]hether a
conveyance is made with fraudulent intent is a question of fact.” (Annod Corp. v. Hamilton & Samuels
(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1286, 1294.) 
 
Upon reviewing the FACC, 740 South Broadway sufficiently
alleged a fraudulent transfer. Notably, they allege that the Asset Purchase
Agreement was intended to hinder their ability to collect debt. (FACC ¶¶ 69,
71.) Whether this is true is not appropriate at the demurrer stage.
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to the
eighth cause of action.
 
ix.               
Ninth
Cause of Action – Fraudulent Transfer In Violation of Civil Code §
3439.04(a)(2)(A)
For the same reasons articulated in
the first cause of action, this claim survives.
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to the
ninth cause of action.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Demurrer
to the FACC is OVERRULED in its entirety. Cross-Defendant is to ANSWER only within
10 days of this order. 
Moving party is to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
