Cross-Defendants rely on requests for judicial notice that did not attach the
final rulings.

There may also be a standing issue for this demurrer since Cross-Defendants do
not represent Mrs. Chol.


[3]
Cross-Defendants’ reliance on Annod Corp.
v. Hamilton & Samuels (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1286 is misplaced because
that case was at summary judgment, not the demurrer stage.

LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Meet
and Confer
 
Prior to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required
to satisfy their meet and confer obligations
pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. (CCP) §430.41 and demonstrate that they so satisfied
their meet and confer obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant to CCP
§430.41(a)(2) & (3).¿The meet and confer requirement also applies to
motions to strike. (CCP § 435.5.) Here, the parties had an extensive phone
conversation to discuss the potential demurrer and motion to strike. (Wainer
Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.) Accordingly, this requirement is met.
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states
a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer
hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous
matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿¿ 
 
Motion
to Strike
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. (CCP § 436(a).) The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for moving
to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.
(Id.¿§¿437.)¿“When the defect which
justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave
to amend.” (Vaccaro v. Kaiman¿(1998)
63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768.)¿
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court grants 740 South
Broadway’s request for judicial notice. (Evid. Code § 452(d), (h); See Kalnoki v. First American Trustee Servicing
Solutions, LLC (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 23,37.) However, the court only takes
judicial notice of the foregoing documents only as to “the existence, content
and authenticity of public records and other specified documents”; it does not
take judicial notice of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those
documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022)
87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)¿¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Demurrer
 
i.                   
Alter
Ego Allegations 
740 South Broadway and Sarshar contend that Shine FX
insufficiently alleged alter ego liability against Sarshar because they did not
allege facts that an injustice would result if Sarshar was not held personally
liable. Shine FX argues it sufficiently alleged alter ego liability as to
Sarshar – particularly 740 South Broadway’s inferred insolvency establishing a
risk of injustice.  740 South Broadway
replies that the allegations of using security and guard dogs does not infer
insolvency.
 
To plead alter ego, there must be factual allegations that
would establish a unity of interest, such as commingling of funds and other
assets, the holding out of the entities as liable for the debts of the
principal, use of the same offices and employees, use of one another as a mere
shell or conduit for the affairs of the other, inadequate capitalization and
failure to adhere to corporate formalities. (Automotriz Del Golfo De California
SA de CV v. Resnicke (1957) 47 Cal.2d 792, 796; Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Sup. Ct (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 538.) A plaintiff must also allege an
unjust result if the corporation is treated as the sole actor. (Leek v. Cooper (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th
399, 415.) A plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts to plead alter ego and
survive demurrer. (Rutherford Holdings,
LLC v. Plaza Del Rey (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 236.) Additionally, “less
particularity . . . is required where the defendant may be assumed to possess
knowledge of the facts at least equal, if not superior, to that possessed by
the plaintiff.” (Id. at p. 236.) 
 
Here, Shine FX has insufficiently alleged facts supporting
alter ego liability by Sarshar. First, Shine FX conclusory lists the factors
for alter ego liability. (FACC ¶¶ 8-9.) Second, alleging Sarshar fills multiple
roles in 740 South Broadway and that they share a personal address is not
enough to find alter ego liability. (FACC ¶ 12.) Third, the court is not
persuaded by Shine FX’s argument that 740 South Broadway’s insolvency is implied by the facts alleged because
Shine FX argued that they, not Sarshar, “deployed a security guard with a dog”
to keep Shine FX (and others) away from their possessions. (FACC ¶ 25.) Finally,
there are insufficient allegations that Sarshar acted personally rather than on
behalf of 740 South Broadway. (See, e.g., FACC ¶¶ 35,  
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the
entire FACC as to Sarshar.[1]
 
ii.                 
First
Cause of Action - Trespass to Chattels
740 South Broadway contends that the FACC fails to allege
Shine FX is the owner when its privy, Plaintiff, has already claimed ownership.[2]
740 South Broadway also contends that Shine FX failed to allege property
damage. Shine FX argues it alleged Sarshar directly participated in the
wrongful conduct. Shine FX also argues that it sufficiently alleged
interference with its possessory interest in the property. 
 
The elements of a claim for trespass to personal property
are: (1) plaintiff owned, possessed, or had a right to property, (2)
defendant's intentional interference with plaintiff's use or possession, (3) no
consent by plaintiff, (4) harm, and (5) causation. (Intel Corp. v. Hamidi (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1342, 1350-1351.) A defendant
may temporarily dispossess plaintiff of the property, including by blocking
access to it. (Jamgotchian v. Slender (2009)
170 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1401.) To be actionable, defendant's interference must
have caused some injury to the property or to plaintiff's rights in the
property. (Intel Corp. supra, at p.
1350.) 
 
Here, Shine FX sufficiently alleged a claim for trespass to
chattels. First, Shine FX alleged they owned certain personal property. (FACC
¶¶ 23, 44.) The court is not persuaded by 740 South Broady’s privy argument
because it improperly seeks to determine a factual dispute. Additionally, Shine
FX alleges that it supplied property to Plaintiff from December 2021 to
November 2023 and subsequently purchased property from Plaintiff in January 12,
2023. (FACC ¶¶ 20, 21, 23.) Second, Shine FX alleged 740 South Broadway
intentionally interfered with Shine FX’s use and possession because they
“prevented [Shine FX] from retrieving their Corporation Belongings from the
Property, as the Landlord changed the lock and has deployed a security guard
with a dog” and that Shine FX has been unable to retrieve their belongings to
date. (FACC ¶¶ 25, 46.) Third, Shine FX did not consent. (FACC ¶ 47.) Fourth,
Shine FX alleges injury to their rights in the property because they cannot
maintain it, they cannot use it for their business, and some of it is missing
from the Property. (FACC ¶¶ 32, 34, 36, 37, 39, 41.) Finally, Shine FX alleged 740
South Broadway’s interference caused the harm. (FACC ¶¶ 45, 48.) 
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to the
First Cause of Action.
 
iii.               
Second
Cause of Action - Conversion
Fail to allege facts of wrongful conduct by Sarshar in his
individual capacity. No allegations that 740 South Broadway knew the property
was owned by Shine FX. Shine FX argues it sufficiently alleged 740 South
Broadway and Sarshar exercised dominion over their property inconsistent with
Shine FX’s rights. 
 
“Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the
property of another.  The elements of a
conversion are: (1) the plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of the
property at the time of the conversion; (2) the defendant’s conversion by a
wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3) damages. It is not
necessary that there be a manual taking of the property; it is only necessary
to show an assumption of control or ownership over the property, or that the
alleged converter has applied the property to his own use.”  (Farmers
Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 451-452; see also Prakashpalan v. Engstrom, Lipscomb and Lack
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1135; Plummer
v. Day/Eisenberg, LLP (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 38, 45 [complainants need only
allege entitlement to immediate possession and need not necessarily allege
ownership]; Salma v. Capon (2008) 161
Cal.App.4th 1275, 1295 [“conversion applies to personal property, not real
property.”];  Burlesci v. Petersen (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1062, 1066 [“action
rests neither in the knowledge nor the intent of the defendant.”]; Irving Nelkin & Co. v. South Beverly
Hills Wilshire Jewelry & Loan (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 692, 699 [“
'Conversion is a species of strict liability in which questions of good faith,
lack of knowledge and motive are ordinarily immaterial.' ”])
 
Here, Shine FX sufficiently plead a claim for conversion.
First, Shine FX alleged they owned certain personal property. (FACC ¶¶ 23, 52.)
Second, 740 South Broadway wrongfully blocked Shine FX from accessing their
property and dispossessed Shine FX of the property via auction and loss. (FACC
¶¶ 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 54, 56.) Finally, Shine FX alleged damages
from the loss. (FACC ¶ 57.)
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to the
Second Cause of Action.
 
iv.               
Third
Cause of Action - Replevin (Claim and Delivery)
740 South Broadway provides the same argument as for the
First and Second Causes of Action. Shine FX argues they sufficiently alleged a
claim to recover specific property.
 
“Replevin (claim and delivery) is an action at law for the
recovery of specific personal chattels, wrongfully taken and detained, or
wrongfully detained, with damages which the wrongful taking or detention has
occasioned.” (Fredericks v. Tracy
(1893) 98 Cal.658, 659-660.) The typical allegations of a cause of action
for claim and delivery are: (1) the plaintiff’s right to possession of tangible
property at the time of commencement of the action; (2) the defendant’s
wrongful possession; and (3) the value of the property. (5 Witkin, Cal.
Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Pleading, §692.) 
 
Here, Shine FX sufficiently plead a claim for replevin.
First, Shine FX alleged a right to possess certain Property because they own
it. (FACC ¶ 23.) Second, Shine FX alleged 740 South Broadway wrongfully possess
the property at the time this action commenced. (FACC ¶ 24.) Finally, Shine FX
alleged the property’s value. (FACC ¶ 23.)
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer to the
Third Cause of Action.
 
v.                  
Fourth
Cause of Action - Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations
740 South Broadway contends that Shine FX failed to allege a
valid and enforceable contract with a third party. Shine FX argues they
sufficiently plead this claim and 740 South Broadway improperly argues factual
merits.
 
“The elements which a plaintiff must plead to state the
cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations are (1)
a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party; (2)¿defendant’s knowledge
of this contract; (3) defendant’s intentional acts designed to induce a breach
or disruption of the contractual relationship; (4) actual breach or disruption
of the contractual relationship; and (5) resulting damage.” (Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Bear
Stearns & Co. (1990) 50¿Cal.3d 1118, 1126 (internal citations
omitted).) 
 
“Because interference with an existing contract receives
greater solicitude than does interference with prospective economic advantage,
it is not necessary that the defendant’s conduct be wrongful apart from the
interference with the contract itself.” (Quelimane
Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 55 (internal
citations omitted).)¿ 
 
Here, Shine FX insufficiently alleged a claim for
intentional interference with contractual relations. Notably, Shine FX did not
sufficiently allege a contract or 740 South Broadway’s knowledge of a contract.
For instance, Shine FX only alleges a contract with Plaintiff Chol Enterprises,
Inc. for the sale of the property. (FACC ¶¶ 23, 64.) However, reading the
entire FACC in context, Shine FX is really alleging that “numerous production
rental contracts with clients due to its equipment being inaccessible and
improperly held by” 740 South Broadway which in turn harmed Shine FX of “no
less than $481, 525.” (FACC ¶¶ 27, 28, 64, 65.) However, Shine FX not only
failed to allege the third party contracts with its clients, it also failed to
allege that 740 South Broadway knew about those contracts.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer to the
Fourth Cause of Action.
 
Motion to Strike
 
740 South Broadway and Sarshar move to strike the prayer for
relief, item f. requesting punitive damages because Shine FX failed to allege
facts supporting such relief. Shine FX argues they sufficiently alleged conduct
warranting punitive damages and that 740 South improperly attempts to resolve
factual disputes.
 
“In order to state a prima facie claim for punitive
damages, a complaint must set forth the elements as stated in the general
punitive damage statute, Civil Code section 3294.” (Turman v. Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191
Cal.App.4th 53, 63.) Civil Code section 3294 permits recovery of punitive
damages where, in an action for breach of obligation not arising from contract,
the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has
been guilty “of oppression, fraud, or malice . . . .” (Civ. Code § 3294(a).)
Malice is conduct “intended by the defendant to cause injury to plaintiff, or
despicable conduct that is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others.” (Civ. Code §
3294(c)(1).) “Oppression” means “despicable conduct that subjects a person to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”
(Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2).) “Fraud” is “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit,
or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on
the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal
rights or otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(3).) “The mere
allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an
award of punitive damages.” (Grieves v.
Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166.) “Not only must there by
circumstances of oppression, fraud, or malice, but facts must be alleged in the
pleading to support such a claim.” (Id.;
see G.D. Searle & Co. v. Superior
Court (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 22, 29.) 
 
In other words, “[t]he mere carelessness or ignorance of
the defendant does not justify the imposition of punitive damages . . . .
Punitive damages are proper only when the tortious conduct rises to levels of
extreme indifference to the plaintiff’s rights, a level which decent citizens
should not have to tolerate.” (Flyer’s
Body Shop Profit Sharing Plan v. Ticor Title Ins. Co. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
1149, 1154; see American Airlines, Inc.
v. Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1017, 1051
[“Punitive damages are appropriate if the defendant’s acts are reprehensible,
fraudulent or in blatant violation of law or policy.”].) 
 
Here, Shine FX insufficiently alleged facts warranting
punitive damages. The FACC generally alleges 740 South Broadway locked Shine FX
out of the Premises and blocked access to their property. While this is not
laudable conduct, it does not rise to the reprehensible conduct that warrants
punitive damages.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS the motion to strike as to
the request for punitive damages.
 
Leave to Amend
 
Leave to amend should be liberally granted if there is a
reasonable possibility an amendment could cure the defect. (County of Santa Clara v. Superior Court
(2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 1018, 1035.) The burden is on Plaintiff to establish that
the defect is reasonably capable of cure with leave to amend. (Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723,
742.) Here, Shine FX requested leave to amend. The defects identified above are
reasonably capable to cure. 
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Shine FX leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.Demurrer to the First, Second,
and Third Causes of Action is OVERRULED as to 740 South Broadway Associates,
LLC;
2.Demurrer to the Fourth Cause of
Action is SUSTAINED as to 740 South Broadway Associates, LLC with 14 days leave
to amend;
3.Demurrer to the entire FACC is
SUSTAINED as to Houman Sarshar with leave to amend;
4.Motion to Strike is GRANTED with
14 days leave to amend.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
