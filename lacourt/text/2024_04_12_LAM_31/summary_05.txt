And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses the plaintiff's fraud causes of action in response to the defendant's demurrer. The court examines the Vehicle Code section 11713.18 and determines that the term "certified" does not necessarily mean a used vehicle has never been in an accident. The plaintiff does not allege that the subject vehicle failed to pass the certification inspection or that CarMax Auto failed to provide a completed inspection report. The court concludes that the use of the term "certified" does not violate Vehicle Code section 11713.18 and does not support the plaintiff's allegations of fraud.
