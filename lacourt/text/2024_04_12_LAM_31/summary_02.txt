And here is the summary in English text:

The court has reviewed the case and issued a tentative ruling. Kia made a prompt offer to Hernandez, but the offer included improper deductions for service contracts and gap insurance. The court has sustained Kia's objection to the template release agreement presented by Hernandez. Kia argues that Hernandez waived her rights under the Song-Beverly Act, but the court finds that Kia did not plead waiver as an affirmative defense. The court also finds that service contracts and gap insurance are non-manufactured items and are properly subject to offset provisions. The court concludes that Hernandez has raised triable issues of material fact regarding whether Kia's offer provides full restitution.
