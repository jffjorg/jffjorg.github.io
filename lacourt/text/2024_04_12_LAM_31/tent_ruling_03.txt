This is a labor and employment action.  On February 27, 2023, Plaintiff, Jorge Avalos,
filed a Complaint against his former employer, Defendant, Wiring Connection,
Inc.  On April 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC), alleging causes of action for:
 
1.     
Failure to Pay Wages When Due (Cal.
Labor Code §§ 201, 218.5, 218.6, 226.2)
2.     
Failure to Pay Overtime Wages (Cal.
Labor Code §§218.6, 510, 1194)
3.     
Waiting Time Penalties (Cal. Labor
Code §§203, 210)
4.     
Discrimination in Violation of FEHA
(Gov. Code §12940, et seq.)
5.     
Harassment in Violation of FEHA
(Gov. Code §12940, et seq.)
6.     
Retaliation in Violation of FEHA
(Gov. Code §12940, et seq.)
7.

8.     
Violation of Unfair Competition Law
(Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200)
9.     
Retaliation in Violation of Labor
Code § 1102.5
 
On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion for Leave to File
Second Amended Complaint.  Plaintiff
seeks to expand upon the factual allegations set forth in the FAC, dismiss the
cause of action for Discrimination in Violation of FEHA, and add a cause of
action for Retaliation in Violation of Labor Code section 98.6.  The proposed Second Amended Complaint is attached
to the Declaration of Ani Aghaeian.
 
Given that Defendant has yet to appear in this action and
thus, has not filed opposition. Plaintiff’s Motion to File Second Amended
Complaint is GRANTED.  The Second Amended
Complaint is deemed filed on the date of this order.  Plaintiff is further directed to separately
file the amended pleading.
