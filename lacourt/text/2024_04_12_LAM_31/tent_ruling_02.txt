Plaintiff concedes the offer was prompt.


[2]
Plaintiff argues the phantom release agreement is illegal.  Plaintiff relies on a template release
agreement from another case in support of this argument.  The court has sustained Kia’s objection to
the template release agreement. Suffice it to say here, the terms of the
proposed release agreement are unknown.  


[3] Plaintiff also argues Kia’s “offer was not made
in compliance with the Song-Beverly Act for numerous reasons, including but not
limited to that Defendant made improper deductions such as deducting gap
insurance and service contracts – both of which were included in the vehicle’s
total sales price.”  (Complaint, ¶
20.)  While the court need not resolve
this issue, the weight of authority suggests service contract and gap insurance
are nonmanufactured items and are properly subject to offset provisions.  (See Carillo v. FCA USA, LLC (C.D.
Cal. 2021) 546 F.Supp.3d 995, 1002 [“Because the Song-Beverly Act excludes
restitution for “non-manufacturer items installed by a dealer or buyer,” this
optional charge must be excluded from the purchase price of the vehicle for
purposes of the restitution calculation. Cal. Civ. Code § 1793.2(d)(2)(B).”];
see also Canesco v. Ford Motor Co. (S.D. Cal. 2021) 570 F.Supp.3d 872,
893 [“The $,2,275.00 included as part of the purchase price for the “Optional
Service Contract” is not a proper item of damages “[b]ecause the Song-Beverly
Act excludes restitution for ‘non-manufacturer items installed by a dealer or
buyer.”]; Velazquez v. Ford Motor Co. (E.D. Cal., July 13, 2021, No.
1:21-cv-00258-DAD-EPG) 2021 WL 2948649, at *2-3 [deducting the amounts paid for
the identified service and gap contracts for purposes of calculating the amount
in controversy]; Rupay v. Vokswagen Group of Am. (C.D. Cal., Nov. 15,
2012, No. CV 12–4478–GW FFMX) 2012 WL 10634428, at *5 [“neither GAP insurance
nor a third party service contract are ‘manufacturer-installed items,” and they
are in fact ‘non-manufacturer items,’ as they are not manufactured by anyone,
as they are both service contracts”]; But see, Landa v. FCA US LLC
2021 WL 1565800, at *4 [“…Plaintiff
contends that Defendant's offer improperly deducted amounts she paid for an
extended service contract and GAP insurance. (Citation omitted.) The Court
agrees with Plaintiff.”].) 


[4] Citing
CACI No. 336 on Affirmative Defense –Waiver, Kia argues that Hernandez waived
her rights under the Song-Beverly Act when she ignored Kia’s offer.  The argument fails.  Kia did not plead waiver as an affirmative
defense.  Indeed, Kia still disputes all
liability under the Song-Beverly Acy and denies that any defect or
nonconformity was not caused by Kia. 
(Answer, ¶ 7.)  Additionally, the
Song-Beverly Act provides that its protections cannot be waived except as
delineated in the statute.  (See Civ. Code, § 1790.1.)


[5] Even if
Defendant’s evidence could be viewed as sufficient to shift the burden,
Plaintiff’s reference to the caveats and qualifications embedded in Kia’s offer
raises triable issues of material fact regarding whether Kia’s offer provides full
restitution.
