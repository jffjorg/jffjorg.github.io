The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff, Jorge Avalos, has filed a complaint against his former employer, Wiring Connection, Inc. On April 27, 2023, the plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC) alleging various causes of action, including failure to pay wages, overtime, and waiting time penalties, as well as discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. On March 22, 2024, the plaintiff filed a motion to file a second amended complaint, seeking to expand upon the factual allegations, dismiss the cause of action for discrimination in violation of FEHA, and add a cause of action for retaliation in violation of Labor Code section 98.6. Since the defendant has not appeared in the action, the plaintiff's motion has been granted, and the second amended complaint is deemed filed on the date of this order.
