RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant CarMax
Auto Superstores, Inc.
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On October 11,
2023, Plaintiff, Gisselle Maciel, filed a Complaint, against Defendants, CarMax
Auto Superstores, Inc. (“CarMax Auto”)[1]
and CarMax Business Services, LLC[2]
(collectively, “CarMax Defendants”), Safeco Insurance Company of America
(“Safeco”), and Does 1 through 75, alleging that she purchased a certified
pre-owned vehicle from CarMax Auto without knowing or being informed that the
vehicle had previously been in an accident. 
Plaintiff now brings causes of action for:[3]
 
1.     
Violation of the Consumers Legal
Remedies Act 
2.     
Intentional Misrepresentation 
3.     
Concealment
4.     
Negligent Misrepresentation 
5.     
Violation of Civil Code § 1795.51
6.     
Breach of Implied Warranty of
Merchantability
7.     
Violations of the Unfair Competition
law
8.     
Cause of Action under of Vehicle
Code § 11711
 
            On December
8, 2023, Defendants filed this Demurrer to the entire Complaint and
concurrently filed a Motion to Strike as to punitive damages and injunctive
relief allegations.  
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition.  Defendants replied. 
 
II.        DISCUSSION RE DEMURRER
 
A.   
Legal Standard
 
“The primary function of a pleading is to give the other
party notice so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect in a
pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect
substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th
203, 240.) “A¿demurrer¿tests the legal sufficiency of the factual
allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The Court looks to whether “the complaint
alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses a
complete defense.” (Id.) The Court does not “read passages from a
complaint in isolation; in reviewing a ruling on a demurrer, we read
the complaint ‘as a whole and its parts in their context.’ [Citation.]” (West
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.)
The Court “assume[s] the truth of the properly pleaded factual
allegations, facts that reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded
and matters of which judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris, supra,
56 Cal.4th p. 240.) “The court does not, however, assume the truth of
contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.]”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare
(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) 
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Where the complaint contains substantial factual allegations
sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a
demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given leave to
amend.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
135, 139, fn. 2.)  Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant to show the
Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)  
 
B.    
Application 
 
            Meet and Confer
 
            Defense counsel has satisfied the
meet and confer requirement. (Declaration of Adam C.  Zamost, ¶¶ 2-3.)     
            
            Plaintiff’s Allegations
 
            Plaintiff purchased the Subject
Vehicle on or around August 20, 2021.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 1, 9, 10, 14.)  CarMax Auto is a BuyHere-Pay-Here (“BHPH”)
Dealer as defined by Vehicle Code § 241. 
CarMax Auto failed to comply with its obligations as a BHPH dealer.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 11, 89, 90.)  CarMax Auto informed Plaintiff the Subject Vehicle
was sold as a certified pre-owned vehicle, and had not been involved in any
prior collisions.  (Complaint, ¶ 10.)  In addition, CarMax Auto provided Plaintiff
with a certification checklist which indicated all the items which had been
checked and passed CarMax’s certification standards.  After purchase, Plaintiff learned that the
Subject Vehicle was involved in an accident prior to her purchase.  (Complaint, ¶ 16.)       
 
Analysis
 
            Defendants demur to each cause of
action.  The court addresses each in
turn.
 
i.                   
Second,
Third, and Fourth Causes of Action for Intentional and Negligent
Misrepresentation and Concealment (the “Fraud Claims”)[4]
 
The Second, Third,
and Fourth Causes of Action are tort claims sounding in fraud.  “Fraud
must be pleaded with specificity rather than with ‘“‘general and conclusory
allegations.’”’ (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167,
184.) The specificity requirement means a plaintiff must allege facts showing
how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made,
and, in the case of a corporate defendant, the plaintiff must allege the names
of the persons who made the representations, their authority to speak on behalf
of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when the
representation was made. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631,
645; West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780,
793.)  
 
 “Causes of action for intentional and
negligent misrepresentation sound in fraud and, therefore, each element must be
pleaded with specificity. (Daniels v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc.
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1166.)  
 
To establish a
claim for deceit based on intentional misrepresentation, the plaintiff must
prove seven¿essential elements: (1) the defendant represented to the plaintiff
that an important fact was true; (2) that representation was false; (3) the
defendant knew that the representation was false when the defendant made it, or
the defendant made the representation recklessly and without regard for its
truth; (4) the defendant intended that the plaintiff rely on the
representation; (5) the plaintiff¿reasonably relied on the¿representation;¿(6)
the plaintiff was harmed; and (7) the plaintiff's reliance on the defendant's
representation was a substantial factor in causing that harm to the plaintiff.¿
(Manderville¿v. PCG & S Group, Inc.¿(2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1486,
1498; CACI No. 1900.)¿¿ 
 
The elements of
negligent misrepresentation are: “(1) the misrepresentation of a past or
existing material fact, (2) without reasonable ground for believing it to be
true, (3) with intent to induce another’s reliance on the fact misrepresented,
(4) justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation, and (5) resulting damage.”¿
(Apollo Capital Fund LLC v. Roth Capital Partners, LLC (2007) 158
Cal.App.4th 226, 243; CACI No. 1903.)¿
 
“[T]he elements of
an action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the defendant
must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have
been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must
have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud
the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would
not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact,
and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the
plaintiff must have sustained damage.” (Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc.
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.)  
 
Defendants argue
the Fraud Claims fail because they rest entirely on CarMax Auto’s use of the
term “certified” in advertising the Subject Vehicle.  If that were the only allegation, Plaintiff’s
Fraud Claims would fail.  However, it is not
the only fact alleged here.  The
Complaint alleges that CarMax Auto informed her that the Subject Vehicle had
not been in a prior accident. 
(Complaint, ¶¶ 10, 49.)  Defendants
attempt to explain away this allegation as lacking particularity.  Specifically, they argue that the Complaint
does not identify who made the misrepresentation, how it was made, or any facts
to show that Defendants had actual knowledge that the Vehicle was not free
of problems at the time of Plaintiff’s purchase.  
 
The court
disagrees.  The Complaint alleges that
she went to CarMax Auto on August 20, 2021. 
She purchased the Subject Vehicle based, in part, on representations
that the Vehicle was certified-preowned and had not been in any prior
collisions.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 10, 14.)  Further, CarMax Auto knew the representations
were false when it made them or made the representations and omissions of
material fact recklessly and without regard for their truth (Complaint, ¶ 51),
and intended that Plaintiff rely on that misrepresentation (Complaint, ¶¶ 53,
80).  CarMax Auto knew or reasonably
should have known the Subject Vehicle’s accident history was not known or
reasonably discoverable by Plaintiff, and that it was a fact material to the
transaction.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 62,
63.)  The court finds these allegations
are sufficiently particular to support the Fraud Claims.  This is especially so when a defendant must
necessarily possess full information concerning the facts of the controversy, or
when the facts lie more in the knowledge of the opposite party.   (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 158.)  In that
context, “the requirement of specificity is relaxed.”  (Id.) 
So too here where the identity of the person who made the representations
to Plaintiff is necessarily in CarMax Auto’s possession, or where that fact is at
least equally in Car Max Auto’s knowledge.
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the Second, Third, and Fourth Causes of Action is OVERRULED.
 
ii.                 
First
Cause of Action: Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act
 
The Consumers
Legal Remedies Act (the “CRLA”) “declares unlawful a variety of ‘unfair methods
of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices’ used in the sale or
lease of goods to a consumer.” (Bower v. AT&T Mobility, LLC (2011)
196 Cal.App.4th 1545, 1556.) Civil Code section 1770, subdivision (a)(1)-(27),
provides a list of methods, acts, or practices that are unlawful under the
CLRA. “An individual seeking to recover damages under the CLRA based on a
misrepresentation must prove, among other things, actual injury. ‘Relief under
the CLRA is specifically limited to those who suffer damage, making causation a
necessary element of proof.’ [Citation.] Accordingly, ‘plaintiffs in a CLRA
action [must] show not only that a defendant’s conduct was deceptive, but that
the deception caused them harm...’ [Citations.] [Citations.]” (Bower,
196 Cal.App.4th at p. 1556.)             
 
            Plaintiff alleges that CarMax Auto “violated
the CLRA by, at a minimum: (1) misrepresenting the condition of the Vehicle;
(2) representing the Vehicle had not been involved in an accident when it had;
(3) representing the Vehicle had been properly certified, when it had not; (4)
concealing the condition of the Vehicle; (5) violating Vehicle Code §
11713.18(a); (6) failing to comply with the requirements of Vehicle Code §
11950, (7) failing to comply with the requirements of Civil Code § 1795.51; (8)
concealing the reasonable market value of the Vehicle from Plaintiff; and (9)
concealing the requirements of Vehicle Code § 11950.”  (Complaint, ¶ 38.)  
 
Defendants argue
the CLRA claims fails because it is based on a misconstruction of the term
“certified” and Vehicle Code section 11713.18.[5]  (See Complaint, ¶¶ 18, 19.)  However, the CLRA claim is based on more than
the sale of the Subject Vehicle as certified. 
As discussed above, the court has found the Fraud Claims are adequately
pleaded based on the misrepresentation that the Subject Vehicle had not been in
any prior accidents.  Moreover, Defendants
do not address Vehicle Code section 11950 and whether a violation of that
statutory provision gives rise to a CLRA claim. 
(See also Section E, infra, discussing Vehicle Code section 11950.)  
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the First Cause of Action is OVERRULED.
 
iii.               
Fifth
Cause of Action: Violation of Civil Code § 1795.51    
 
Civil Code section
1795.51 prohibits a buy-here-pay here-dealer from selling or leasing a used
vehicle at retail price without giving the buyer or lessee a written warranty
that shall have a minimum duration of at least 30 days from the date of
delivery or when the odometer has registered 1,000 miles from what is shown on
the contract, whichever occurs first.  Section
1795.51 also set forth what terms must be included in the written
warranty.  A “buy-here-pay-here” dealer
is defined at Vehicle Code section 241.[6] 
 
Plaintiff alleges
that the CarMax Defendants violated Civil Code section 1795.51 because CarMax
Auto failed to comply with certain obligations of BHPH dealers.  Specifically, CarMax Auto did not disclose all
of the components required to be covered under the warranty for the Vehicle as
required by Civil Code section 1795.51(f) and failed to provide Plaintiff with
a copy of the warranty explaining the terms of the warranty.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 26, 27.)  
 
Defendants argue
the Fifth Cause of Action is unsupported by any factual allegations
establishing that CarMax Auto is a BHPH dealer.   The court disagrees.  The Complaint alleges CarMax Auto is a BHPH
dealer as defined by Vehicle Code section 241. 
(See Complaint, ¶ 11.)  This is
sufficient to survive demurrer.
 
Accordingly, the demurrer
to the Fifth Cause of Action is OVERRULED.
 
iv.               
Sixth
Cause of Action: Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability, Civil Code
§ 1794
 
Under the
Song-Beverly Act, every sale of a used car in California that includes an
express warranty also includes the seller’s implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, which are co-extensive
with the express warranty.  The threshold
requirement for a breach of merchantability claim involving an automobile is
that the vehicle is unusable. (American Suzuki Motor Corp. v. Superior Court
(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1295-96 (American Suzuki).) To support a
claim that a vehicle is unusable, a plaintiff must show that the vehicle was
not “substantially free of defect and able to provide safe, reliable
transportation.”  (Brand v. Hyundai
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1538, 1547.)  Moreover, an implied warranty of
merchantability does not promise a perfect or even problem-free vehicle – it
only assures the buyer that the car will at least function for its intended
purpose.  (American Suzuki, 37
Cal.App.4th at p. 1295, fn. 2.)  It “does
not ‘impose a general requirement that the goods precisely fulfill the
expectation of the buyer.  Instead, it
provides for a minimum level of quality.’”  (Id. pp. at 1295-1296 (internal
citations omitted); Mocek v. Alfa Leisure, Inc. (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th
402, 405-406 (breach of implied warranty “means the product did not possess
even the most basic degree of fitness for ordinary use.”).)
 
Defendants argue
the Sixth Cause of Action does not set forth any factual allegations that the
Subject Vehicle was defective, unusable, or unfit for ordinary use.  The court agrees.  The Complaint alleges in conclusory fashion
that the Subject Vehicle developed defects but does not allege what those
defects are.  The “summary of allegations”
section of the Complaint does not describe any problems with the Subject
Vehicle.  
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the Sixth Cause of Action is SUSTAINED.
 
v.                 
Seventh
Cause of Action: Violations of the Unfair Competition Law, Business &
Professions Code § 17200, et seq.
 
Plaintiff’s UCL
claim is based on the following allegations: “[CarMax Auto] violated the UCL
by, at a minimum: (1) misrepresenting the condition of the Vehicle; (2)
representing the Vehicle had not been involved in an accident when it had; (3)
representing the Vehicle had been properly certified, when it had not; (4)
concealing the condition of the Vehicle; (5) violating Vehicle Code §
11713.18(a); (6) failing to comply with the requirements of Vehicle Code §
11950, (7) failing to comply with the requirements of Civil Code § 1795.51; (8)
concealing the reasonable market value of the Vehicle from Plaintiff; (9)
concealing requirements of Vehicle Code § 11950; (10) violating the CLRA; (11)
violating the Song-Beverly Act; and (12) violating the Vehicle Code.”  (Complaint, ¶ 111.)  Plaintiff lost money and suffered injury in
fact as a result of CarMax Auto’s illegal conduct.  (Complaint, ¶ 112.)
 
 The UCL is
codified at Business and Professions Code, section 17200 et seq.  Section
17204 of the UCL provides that a private person “who has suffered injury in
fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition” may
bring a 17200 action.  (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17204.)  “To bring a
UCL claim, a plaintiff must show either an (1) unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent
business act or practice, or (2) unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading
advertising. [Citation.]  Because the UCL is written in the disjunctive,
it establishes three varieties of unfair competition—acts or practices which
are unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent.”  (Adhav v. Midway Rent A Car,
Inc. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 954, 970, citations and quotations
omitted.) 
 
“Unlawful” conduct
includes any business practice or act forbidden by local, state or federal
statutes or by regulations or case law.  (Munson v. Del Taco, Inc.
(2009) 46 Cal.4th 661, 676; see also Rose v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2013) 57 Cal.4th 390, 396.)  
 
The UCL’s “unfair”
prong also provides an independent basis for relief.  (Candelore v.
Tinder, Inc. (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 1138, 1155.)  A business practice
may be unfair in violation of the UCL even if the practice does not violate any
law.  (Olszewski v. Scripps Health (2003) 30 Cal.4th 798, 827,
citing Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999)
20 Cal.4th 163, 180.)  The test of whether a business practice is unfair
involves an examination of that practice’s impact on its alleged victim,
balanced against the reasons, justifications and motives of the alleged
wrongdoer.  In brief, the court must weigh the utility of the defendant’s
conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim.  An
‘unfair’ business practice occurs when the practice offends an established
public policy or when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive,
unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to customers.”  (Candelore,
19 Cal.App.5th at p. 1155, citations and quotations omitted.) 
 
Defendants argue
the Seventh Cause of Action fails because the allegations do not adequately allege
fraud or show that Defendants violated the CLRA or Song-Beverly Act.  However, the Complaint also alleges: 
 
As a BHPH dealer, Dealer was
required to comply with Vehicle Code § 11950. Vehicle Code § 11950(a) required
Dealer to post on the Vehicle a label indicating the reasonable market value
for the Vehicle as well as the other items listed in this code section. In
addition, Section 11950(b) required Dealer to provide Plaintiff with a document
disclosing the reasonable market value for the Vehicle.  
 
There was no label on the Vehicle
which disclosed the items required by Vehicle Code § 11950(a), nor did Dealer
provide Plaintiff with a document showing the reasonable market value for the
Vehicle. 
 
The cash price for the Vehicle was
$19,998.00. The reasonable market value of the Vehicle was $18,525.00. 
 
If it had been disclosed to
Plaintiff that the reasonable market value for the Vehicle was $18,525.00, she
would not have paid $19,998.00 for the Vehicle.
 
(Complaint, ¶¶
21-24.)
 
            Defendants do not address Vehicle
Code section 11950.
 
            Accordingly, the demurrer to the Seventh
Cause of Action is OVERRULED.
 
vi.               
Eighth Cause of Action: Cause of Action
under of Vehicle Code § 11711
 
The Eighth Cause of Action is asserted against Safeco
only.
 
Under Vehicle Code
section 11710, an auto dealer seeking a license to conduct business in the
state must procure and file with the Department of Motor Vehicles a surety bond
in the amount of $50,000, subject to a condition “that the [dealer] shall not
practice any fraud or make any fraudulent representation which will cause a
monetary loss” to a car buyer.  (Veh.
Code, § 11710, subds. (a)–(b).)  Section
11711 grants any person who suffers a loss from a dealer’s fraud a cause of
action against the dealer and the surety upon the dealer’s bond, in an amount
not to exceed the value of the vehicle sold.
 
A cause of action
under Vehicle Code section 11711 depends on fraudulent conduct.  Given that the court has concluded
Plaintiff’s Fraud Claims are sufficiently pled, the court further concludes
that the demurrer to the Eighth Cause of Action fails. 
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the Eighth Cause of Action is OVERRULED.
 
IV.       DISCUSSION RE
MOTION TO STRIKE
 
            A.  Legal Standard
 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a
pleading, may serve and file a motion to strike the whole pleading or any part
thereof.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1322(b).)¿ On a motion to strike, the court may: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or
any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of
California, a court rule, or an order of the court.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 436,
subds. (a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782.)¿¿¿ 
 
“The grounds for a motion to strike are limited to matters
appearing on the face of the challenged pleading or matters which must or may
be judicially noticed. (§ 437, subd. (a); Evid. Code, §§ 451, 452.).” (Garcia
v. Sterling (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 17, 20.)¿¿ 
 
            B. 
Application
 
            Defendants seek an order striking
the allegations of and requests for punitive damages and equitable/injunctive
relief from the Complaint.  The punitive
damages and injunctive relief allegations are set forth in connection to the
First, Second, Third, and Seventh Causes of Action.  
 
            Upon review of the Complaint, the
court finds punitive damages are not adequately pleaded.  “[T]he imposition of punitive damages upon a
corporation is based upon its own fault.  It is not imposed vicariously by
virtue of the fault of others.”  (City Products Corp. v. Globe
Indemnity Co. (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 31, 36.) “Corporations are legal
entities which do not have minds capable of recklessness, wickedness, or intent
to injure or deceive.  An award of punitive damages against a corporation
therefore must rest on the malice of the corporation’s employees.  But the
law does not impute every employee’s malice to the corporation.  Instead,
the punitive damages statute requires proof of malice among corporate leaders:
the officers, directors, or managing agents.” (Cruz v. Home Base (2000)
83 Cal.App.4th 160, 167 [cleaned up].)  Here,
Plaintiff seeks punitive damages against corporate defendants.  There are no facts to show that an officer,
director, or managing agent carried out any conduct with malice.  The Complaint is deficient in this regard.
 
            The court does not reach the same
conclusion as to injunctive relief.  Defendants
arguments appears to be that Plaintiff cannot seek injunctive relief on behalf
of others because this is not a class action. 
The CLRA, Song-Beverly Act, and UCL, however, all authorize equitable
and injunctive relief to consumers in their individual capacity.  (See Civ. Code, § 1780, subd. (a)(2) [“Any
consumer who suffers any damage as a result of the use or employment by any
person of a method, act, or practice declared to be unlawful by Section 1770
may bring an action against that person to recover or obtain… (2) An order
enjoining the methods, acts, or practices.”]; Civ. Code § 1794 [Any buyer of
consumer goods who is damaged by a failure to comply with any obligation under
this chapter or under an implied or express warranty or service contract may
bring an action for the recovery of damages and other legal and equitable
relief.”]; Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17203 [“Any person who engages, has
engaged, or proposes to engage in unfair competition may be enjoined in any
court of competent jurisdiction”].)  The
Complaint prays for relief as permitted under these statutes.  Defendants are not entitled to an order
striking the requests for equitable and injunctive relief. 
 
V.        CONCLUSION
            
The Demurrer to the Sixth Cause of Action is SUSTAINED.
 
The Demurrer to the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh,
and Eighth Causes of Action is OVERRULED.
 
The Motion to Strike is GRANTED as to punitive damages.
 
The Motion to Strike is DENIED as to equitable and
injunctive relief. 
 
Leave to amend is GRANTED. 
Plaintiff is ordered to serve and file her First Amended Complaint
within 30 days of this order. 
 
Defendants to give notice.
