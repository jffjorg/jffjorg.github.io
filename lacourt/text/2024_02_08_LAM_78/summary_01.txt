And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the motion for summary judgment filed by ADP, Inc., ADP Payroll Services, Inc., and Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (collectively, "ADP Defendants") in part, and denied it in part. The judge found that the ADP Defendants were not parties to the contract sued upon in the second and third causes of action for breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and therefore granted the motion for summary judgment as to those causes of action.

The judge also denied the ADP Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the issues of breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, finding that there were triable issues of fact regarding whether the ADP Defendants breached their contractual obligations.

The judge granted the ADP Defendants' motion for summary adjudication on the issue of punitive damages, finding that there was no evidence to support a finding of malice, oppression, or fraud under Civil Code ยง3294.

The judge denied the ADP Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the issue of causation, finding that there were triable issues of fact regarding whether the ADP Defendants' alleged conduct was a substantial factor in causing the damages.

Finally, the judge denied the ADP Defendants' motion for summary judgment based on the 2-year statute of limitations under CCP ยง339, finding that the claims were based on a written agreement and not an oral agreement.
