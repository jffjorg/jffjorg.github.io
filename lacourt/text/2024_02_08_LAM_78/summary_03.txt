Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a Tentative Ruling on the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production (RFPs) and Request for Monetary Sanctions. The motion is denied for failure to meet and confer and for failure to demonstrate good cause for production.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff failed to establish good cause for production of further responses to RFPs, as the separate statement merely attacks the merits of the objections asserted, without making an affirmative showing of good cause.

The Court also finds that the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion, as the meet and confer declaration fails to satisfy CCP §2016.040.

The Court grants the Defendant's Request for Sanctions in the amount of $2,940, as the Plaintiff's counsel failed to demonstrate a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.

The Court further finds that the Defendant's objections to RFP Nos. 12-15 and 26 are meritorious, as the RFPs are overbroad in time and scope. However, the Court finds that the Defendant's objections to RFP Nos. 17, 20, 21, and 28 are meritless, as they are boilerplate objections that could be addressed with a protective order.
