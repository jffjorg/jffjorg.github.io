Case No.: 22STCV15958 Hearing Date: February 8, 2024   [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANTS CARTERS INC.’S AND CARTERS RETAIL INC.’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTINO OF DOCUMENTS (SET ONE)Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendants Carters Inc. and Carters Retail Inc.’s Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents (Set One) and Request for Monetary Sanctions is DENIED for failure to meet and confer and for failure to demonstrate good cause for production.  Plaintiff's Counsel of Record is ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $2,940. Sanctions are payable within 20 days after the date of this order.Moving party to provide notice and to file proof of service of such notice within five court days after the date of this order.  FACTUAL BACKGROUNDPlaintiff was employed by Defendants from 2008 through their constructive termination of her on May 15, 2020.  (Complaint, ¶1.)  Plaintiff alleges she was discriminated against, harassed, retaliated against and wrongfully terminated based upon her gender, marital status, disability (obesity), perceived disability and association with others in violation of CFRA, FEH and its administrative provisions.  (Complaint, ¶1).On May 13, 2022, Plaintiff filed this complaint against Defendants Carters, Inc. Carters Retail Inc. and Lisa Quibilan.  Plaintiff alleges (1) breach of express written contract; (2) breach of implied contract; (3) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (4) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; (5) discrimination; (6) retaliation; (7) harassment; (8) violation of Labor Code §230.8; (9) violation of Labor Code §1102.5; (10) violation of Labor Code §1198.5; (11) fraudulent inducement; (12) IIED; (13) violation of B&PC 17200; and (14) violation of CLRA.  DISCUSSIONMOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO RFPs A.  Legal StandardCCP § 2031.310(a) On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete. (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with each of the following: (1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand. (2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. (3) In lieu of a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to the demand.… (h) Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.Where a party is seeking to compel further responses to requests for document production, the burden is on the moving party to show both relevance to the subject matter and specific facts justifying discovery. (CCP §2031.310(b)(1); Kirkland v. Supr. Ct. (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98 (“Once good cause was shown, the burden shifted to Kirkland to justify his objection”); Glenfed Develop. Corp. v. Supr. Ct. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.)  Once good cause is established by the moving party, the burden then shifts to the responding party to justify any objections made to document disclosure. (Hartbrodt v. Burke (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 168, 172-174.) B.  TimelinessDefense counsel agreed to extend Plaintiff’s time to file the instant Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFPs to November 17, 2023.  (Rand-Lewis Dec., Ex. D.)  Plaintiff’s Motion was filed on November 17, 2023. C.  Meet and ConferOn August 29, 2023, Defendants served their responses to the subject RFPs.  (Motion, Rand-Lewis Dec., ¶4.)  Plaintiff claims she met and conferred with Defendants regarding the responses and Defendants produced further responses on November 1, 2023.  (Id. at ¶¶13-14.)  Based on Defendants’ Exhibit 11, the November 1, 2023 Supplemental Responses did not provide supplemental responses to the RFPs at issue in the instant motion to compel furthers:  12-17, 20-21, 26 and 28.  (Vongchanglor Dec., Ex. 11.)  Plaintiff’s meet and confer declaration fails to satisfy CCP §2016.040.  “A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  Plaintiff does not provide details regarding what was discussed during the October 18, 2023 meet and confer by phone.  (Motion, Rand-Lewis Dec., ¶13.)  Defendants served Second Supplemental Responses to the RFPs on December 1, 2023.  (Vongchanglor Dec., ¶23.)  The Second Supplemental Responses to the RFPs did not provide additional responses to the RFPs at issue:  12-17, 20-21, 26 and 28.  Plaintiff fails to establish that she sufficiently met and conferred regarding the discovery responses at issue.  The motion is denied on this basis. Although the motion is not denied based on the failure to participate in an IDC, typically a motion to compel further will not be considered until an IDC is held.  D.  Plaintiff fails to establish good cause for productionPlaintiff argues she establishes good cause for production based on her separate statement.  However, Plaintiff’s separate statement merely attacks the merits of the objections asserted.  Plaintiff makes no affirmative showing of good cause, i.e. both relevance to the subject matter and specific facts justifying discovery. (CCP §2031.310(b)(1); Kirkland v. Supr. Ct. (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98 (“Once good cause was shown, the burden shifted to Kirkland to justify his objection”); Glenfed Develop. Corp. v. Supr. Ct. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.)  As the party moving for further responses to the RFPs, Plaintiff has the initial burden of establishing good cause.  Plaintiff fails to satisfy this burden.  Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses is denied for failure to establish good cause to order further responses.   E.  Defendants’ Objections on grounds of overbreadth to RFP Nos. 12-15 and 26 are meritoriousPlaintiff’s RFP Nos. 12-15, 15 and 26 are overbroad in time and scope.  Plaintiff must draft RFPs that are narrower and scope with more specific definitions of responsive documents.  Terms such as “substantially similar” (RFP No. 12), “complaints…relating to claims alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint” (RFP No. 13), “any actions, lawsuits or complaints made against you on the grounds alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint” (RFP No. 14) and “regarding the conduct alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint” (RFP No. 15) and “any and all writings…identified in any other discovery response” (RFP No. 26) are so vague and ambiguous that the RFPs are overbroad and production would be burdensome.  The time span of the requested records (10 years) is also overbroad.  These objections could have been resolved by a meet and confer effort, including an IDC with the Court.   F.  Defendants’ Objections to RFP Nos. 17, 20, 21 and 28 are meritless Defendants’ objections to RFP No. 17, 20, 21 and 28 are meritless.  RFP Nos. 17, 20, 21 and 28 ask Defendant to produce documents concerning (1) Plaintiff’s termination, (2) a census of employees, (3) communications “concerning Plaintiff’s employ” between responding party and any co-defendant and (4) Plaintiff’s complete personnel file.  The boilerplate objections are meritless.  Any objections based on third party privacy interests are not substantiated and could be addressed with a protective order.  Defendants' responses suggest that a further response might have been served to RFP No. 17 stating that no such documents pertaining to termination exist because Plaintiff was not terminated.  Defendants contend the entire personal file was produced with Defendants’ objections served on January 4, 2024 to Plaintiff’s Notice of Deposition of Defendant Quibilan. Defendants’ statement that the personnel file has already been produced could have been served as a formal, code-compliant further response.  These objections could likewise have been resolved after a proper IDC and meet and confer effort. C. SanctionsDefendants'  Request for Sanctions is granted. However, the amount requested is not reasonable. The Court awards sanctions in the amount of $2,940 (6 hours at $490 per hour).DATED:  February 8, 2024  ________________________________                                                                 Hon.
