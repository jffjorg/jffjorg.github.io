And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for an order directing the court clerk to file an application for renewal of judgment nunc pro tunc as of December 14, 2023. The plaintiff filed its application for renewal on December 14, 2023, but the court clerk rejected it due to a defect in the form used. The plaintiff resubmitted a corrected application, but the clerk again rejected it, citing the expiration of the 10-year deadline to renew the judgment. The judge finds that the failure to timely enter the application was the result of a clerical error and orders the clerk to enter the renewal of judgment on December 14, 2023.
