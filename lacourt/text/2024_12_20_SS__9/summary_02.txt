And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling sets forth the procedures and deadlines for the complex case involving Stephanie Garcia and Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center. The case has been designated as complex, and the judge intends to manage it effectively and promote effective decision-making by the Court. The parties have agreed to participate in private mediation on or before June 20, 2024, and to file a Joint Status Report Re: Mediation Efforts on or before July 11, 2025. The judge has also lifted the stay to permit Defendant to file and serve a Responsive Pleading by January 21, 2025.

The parties must also engage in phased discovery, with the stay automatically lifted once Defendant's answer is filed and served or, if applicable, after the Court rules on any pleading challenge. The parties must use a procedure to notify putative class members, as described in Belaire-West Landscape v Superior Court, and share the cost of the procedure equally.

The judge has also issued a Protective Order, and parties are alerted to use model protective orders found on the Los Angeles Superior Court website. Electronic service is not the same as electronic filing, and parties must use Case Anywhere as the e-service in this case.

The judge has set deadlines for filing a Class Certification Motion and a Notice of Settlement, and has reminded the parties to use Judicial Council forms and to file a trial plan with their brief. The parties are also ordered to file a Notice of Related Case for any potentially related cases, and to comply with California Rule of Court Rule 3.769 and 3.770 if settlement includes dismissal of class action claims.

The judge's ruling concludes with a reminder to the parties to download the signed order from the Court's website, to give formal notice to all other parties, and to file proof of service of such within five (5) days.
