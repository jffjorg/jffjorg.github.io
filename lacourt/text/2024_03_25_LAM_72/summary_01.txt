This is a tentative ruling for a default judgment hearing on March 25, 2024. The case is between Nussbaum APC (Plaintiff) and 1540 Bedford, LLC (Defendant). The Plaintiff is seeking a default judgment against the Defendant for breach of contract, account stated, services rendered, and quantum meruit. The Plaintiff is requesting a money judgment in the amount of $37,514.20, which includes damages, special damages, interest, and costs.
