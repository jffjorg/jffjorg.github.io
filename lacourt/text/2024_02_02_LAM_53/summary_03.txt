And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's ex parte application. The court grants the motion to deem the plaintiff a vexatious litigant, but only in part. The litigation is stayed, and the defendant does not have to respond to the plaintiff's claims until 10 days after the motion is denied or if granted, until 10 days after the required security is furnished and the defendant is given written notice. The court also orders that the plaintiff's request for default judgment is stricken because it was filed in violation of the stay.

The court emphasizes the importance of civility and professionalism in the litigation, and expects all parties and counsel to treat each other with respect and courtesy. The court also expects parties to comply with the stay and not file papers or conduct discovery until the stay is lifted.

The court is concerned about the tone and content of some of the plaintiff's communications and warns that future conduct may result in further orders to address the issue. The court orders the defendant to give notice of this order.
