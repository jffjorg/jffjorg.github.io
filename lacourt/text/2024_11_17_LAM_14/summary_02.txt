And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Gustavo Silvestre Boldrini, counsel for Abraham Isaias Montes Noriega, Bella Lizeth Montes, Cintia Dayan Noriega Chavez, Edgar Ivan Montes Hernandez, and Edgar Ivan Montes, has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. The court will grant the motion once Boldrini submits updated forms MC-053, which were previously incomplete. The orders granting the motion will be effective upon the filing of proof of service of the signed orders upon the clients. Boldrini's failure to include the affected plaintiffs' phone numbers on form MC-053 was noted, and he must file amended forms before the motion can be granted. The court found that Boldrini complied with the requirements of Rule 3.1362 and that relief is appropriate due to an irreparable breakdown in attorney-client communication and relationship.
