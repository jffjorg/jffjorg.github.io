**Case Summary**

**Case Number:** 22STCP02635
**Hearing Date:** February 13, 2024
**Dept:** 82

**Plaintiff:** Po Long Lew, D.O., et al.
**Respondent:** Michelle Baass, as Director of the California Department of Health Care Services

**Tentative Ruling:** The Department's suspension of Po Long Lew, D.O., and Wellcare Comprehensive Medical Group from participation in the Medi-Cal program is upheld.

**Facts:**

* Po Long Lew, D.O., a physician, and Wellcare Comprehensive Medical Group, a medical practice, were suspended from participating in the Medi-Cal program.
* Lew was convicted of aiding and abetting the unlicensed practice of medicine and surrendered his pharmacy license.
* Lew's surrender of his DEA Certification of Registration triggered an automatic suspension from Medi-Cal.
* The Department found that Lew continued to submit claims to Medi-Cal despite being suspended.
* Lew's suspension was based on his conviction and the Department's determination that he was a threat to the Medi-Cal program.

**Issues:**

* Whether the Department's suspension of Lew and Wellcare from Medi-Cal was arbitrary, capricious, or lacking in evidentiary support.
* Whether Lew's surrender of his pharmacy license and DEA Certification of Registration triggered an automatic suspension from Medi-Cal.

**Analysis:**

* The Department's suspension of Lew and Wellcare was upheld, as Lew's conviction and surrender of his pharmacy license and DEA Certification of Registration triggered automatic suspension.
* The Department's decision to deny Lew's request for reinstatement to Medi-Cal was also upheld, as Lew continued to submit claims to Medi-Cal despite being suspended and there was no evidence that he would not repeat the same behavior that led to the plea.
