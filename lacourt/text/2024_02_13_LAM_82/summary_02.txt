And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the provider, John Smith, is subject to suspension because he submitted claims for payment for services provided to a Medi-Cal beneficiary, despite being listed on the Suspended and Ineligible Provider List. The Judge is basing this decision on California Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC) § 14043.61(a), which states that a provider shall be subject to suspension if claims for payment are submitted by an individual or entity that is suspended, excluded, or otherwise ineligible for reimbursement from the Medi-Cal program. The Judge is also considering California Health and Safety Code (CHSC) § 14059, which defines the types of health care services that may be provided under the Medi-Cal program. The Judge intends to determine whether the provider is eligible for reimbursement and will make a final ruling after considering all relevant information.
