English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants Axos Bank's unopposed motion for the appointment of a receiver and for a preliminary injunction in the case of Axos Bank v. 7040 Van Nuys Partnership, LLC et al. The motion seeks the appointment of a receiver to operate the senior assisted living and memory care facility, collect rents, and market and sell the property, which is owned by 7040 Van Nuys Partnership, LLC. The loan was secured by a Deed of Trust and was defaulted by the borrower. The court finds that the appointment of a receiver is necessary to preserve the lender's collateral and to prevent the property from being dissipated. The court also grants the preliminary injunction, ordering the defendants to turn over the property and related items and restraining and enjoining the defendants from interfering with the duties of the receiver.
