Case:                           Axos Bank v. 7040
Van Nuys Partnership, LLC et al. (23STCV16300)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Axos Bank’s UNOPPOSED Motion for Appointment of Receiver
and for Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED. 
 
Pursuant to CCP § 564(b)(9)
and (b)(11), plaintiff Axos Bank (“Lender”) seeks the appointment of a receiver
with respect to real property improved with a senior assisted living and memory
care facility (“Property”). The Property is owned by defendant 7040 Van Nuys
Partnership, LLC (“Borrower”). The receiver would operate the Property and
collect rents, as well as market and sell the Property. 
 
Under CCP § 564(b),
a receiver may be appointed by the court in which an action is pending “where
necessary to preserve the property or rights of any party.” (CCP § 564(b)(9).)
Additionally, a court may appoint a receiver “[i]n an action by a secured
lender for specific performance of an assignment of rents provision in a deed
of trust, mortgage, or separate assignment document.” (CCP § 564(b)(11).)
 
On September 25, 2019, Lender and Borrower entered into a
Business Loan Agreement. (Constantine Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. 1 [“Loan Agreement”].)
On the same date, Borrower executed a Promissory Note in favor of Lender. (Constantine
Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. 2 [“Note”].) 
 
Under the Loan Agreement and Note, Lender loaned $25 million
to Borrower. (Loan Agreement at 5 [definition of “Loan”], § 2.1; Note § 1.10.) Payment
of the loan was guaranteed by defendants Jing Ning and Abraham Iny
(collectively, “Guarantors”). (Constantine Decl. ¶ 3(c) & Ex. 5.) The Loan
was secured by a Deed of Trust, which encumbered the Property. (Constantine
Decl. ¶ 3(a) & Ex. 3 at § 1.1(a) [“Deed of Trust”].) Lender perfected its
security interest by filing a UCC financing statement. (Constantine Decl. ¶
3(d) & Ex. 6.)
 
Borrower agreed to pay all payments due on the extended
maturity date of March 31, 2022. (Constantine Decl. ¶ 7; Loan Agreement §§
2.4(b), 5.2; Note §§ 1.6, 1.12, 3.7.1.) Borrower also agreed to pay taxes,
levies, and liens imposed on it and its properties. (Constantine Decl. ¶ 7;
Loan Agreement § 5.10; Deed of Trust § 4.11.) Borrower defaulted on the loan by
failing to satisfy these payment obligations. (Constantine Decl. ¶ 7; Loan
Agreement § 10.1(a); Note § 3.7.1; Deed of Trust § 6.1(a).) On April 29, 2022,
Lender provided notice of the default and opportunity to cure the default
within 15 days to Borrower and Guarantors. (Constantine Decl. ¶ 9 &
Ex. 7; Loan Agreement § 10.1(b); Note §§ 3.7.2, 3.15; Deed of Trust §§ 6.1(c), 7.4.)
Borrower failed to repay the loan. (Constantine Decl. ¶ 10.) As of
December 27, 2023, the unpaid balance of the loan is $34,014,837.58. (Ibid.)

 
The Deed of Trust provides for appointment of a receiver in
the event of default. (Deed of Trust §§ 2.3(b), 6.2(a), 6.2(b), 6.4 [Borrower “irrevocably
consents to” and “waives notice of any application” for receiver].) To collect rents
and profits from the Property, the receiver may “[e]nter into possession of the
Property,” take and possess books and records therein, and “assume control with
respect to, and to pay all expenses incurred in connection with, the
development, operation, maintenance, repair or restoration of the Property.” (Deed
of Trust §§ 1.1(k), 2.3(b); see also §§ 6.2(a) [providing that
receiver may “do any acts which it deems necessary or desirable to preserve the
value, marketability or rentability of the Property”], 6.4.) The receiver may
also sell the Property, upon which the powers of the receiver shall cease. (Deed
of Trust §§ 6.2(a), 6.4.) 
 
“[A]lthough a trust deed’s recital that upon default the
beneficiary shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver is not binding
upon the courts, such a recital nevertheless has some evidentiary weight.” (Barclays
Bank of California v. Superior Court (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 593, 602.)
“Ascribing to the recital such evidentiary weight, it reasonably follows that
it presents a prima facie, but rebuttable, evidentiary showing of the
beneficiary’s entitlement to appointment of a receiver.” (Ibid.) Here,
defendants have not filed any opposition, thereby failing to rebut Lender’s
entitlement to a receiver under the Deed of Trust.
 
A receiver should not be appointed unless absolutely
essential, because no other remedy will suffice. (City & County of San
Francisco v. Daley (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 734, 745.) This is so because the
appointment of a receiver is recognized as a drastic, time consuming, expensive,
and potentially unjust remedy to be used as a final resort. (See Weil
& Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial § 9:743 et seq.; see also
Alhambra-Shumway Mines v. Alhambra Gold Mine Corp. (1953) 116 Cal.App.2d
869, 873.) “The appointment of a receiver is a drastic remedy and is one which
should not be invoked unless there is an actual or threatened cessation or
diminution of the business.” (In re Jamison Steel Corp. (1958) 158
Cal.App.2d 27, 35.) 
 
Since the loan matured, Borrower has been operating the
Property at a loss, with an average monthly loss of $72,584 based on financial
statements available to Lender. (Constantine Decl. ¶ 13 & Ex. 9.) The
Property’s occupancy has been 43.2% based on available monthly occupancy
reporting. (Constantine Decl. ¶ 13 & Ex. 9.) Because Borrower and
Guarantors are operating the Property at a loss, with no indication that
occupancy and revenue may increase, Lender has made a sufficient showing that the
Property is in danger of dissipation, such that a receiver is necessary to
preserve Lender’s collateral. 
 
Lender nominates Thomas Seaman as the receiver. Seaman is
qualified to serve as receiver. (See Seaman Decl. ¶¶ 2-10 & Exh. A.)
Defendants have not opposed the nomination. 
 
Receiver must file an undertaking. (CCP § 567(b); Rule of
Court 3.1178.) Lender proposes a receiver undertaking of $10,000. (CCP § 567(b).)
That amount appears reasonable.
 
Lender also seeks a preliminary injunction ordering defendants
to turn over the Property and related items and restraining and enjoining
Borrower and Guarantors Jing Ning and Abraham Iny from interfering with the
duties of the Receiver. (Proposed Order at 4-5; Attachment 30 at §§ 30.24-30.26.)
The proposed injunctive relief is appropriate.
 
Lender must file an undertaking in support of the
preliminary injunction. (CCP § 529.) Lender proposes a $10,000 undertaking for
the preliminary injunction. That amount appears reasonable.
 
The motion is GRANTED. The Court will sign the proposed
order lodged on February 7, 2024.
