And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling denies a motion by McDonald's USA, LLC to seal certain documents related to its defense in a lawsuit brought by Weather Group, LLC and Entertainment Studios Networks, Inc. The lawsuit alleges that McDonald's made fraudulent promises to increase its spending with Black Owned Media. The judge finds that the documents in question, which relate to the billing rates of the law firm representing McDonald's, are not sufficient to overcome the public's right of access to court proceedings. The judge notes that the public has a constitutional right to observe and assess the performance of the judicial system, and that this right is based in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
