I.          Relieved
as Counsel       
A.               
Legal Standard 
The court may
order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after
judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and
after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.   
 An application to be relieved as counsel must
be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the
action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
Further, the
requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have
appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may
delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service
of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.  
 
 
B.        Discussion 
The Court finds that several requisite
factors have not been met.  The Motion
does not accompany: 1.) MC-052 Form (Declaration of Counsel); 2.) MC-053 Form
(Proposed Order); and 3.) proof of service of the Motion to the client and all
other parties who have appeared in the case. 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, Counsel Gary C. Eisenberg’s
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
            Moving Party is ordered to give
notice.
