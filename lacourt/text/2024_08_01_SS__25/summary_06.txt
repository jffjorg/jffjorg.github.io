And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Counsel Gary C. Eisenberg to be relieved as Counsel. The Court finds that the required forms (MC-052 and MC-053) and proof of service have not been submitted, and therefore denies the motion without prejudice. The Court notes that it has the discretion to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as Counsel, and that withdrawal may not be granted if it would prejudice the client. The Judge orders Counsel Gary C. Eisenberg to give notice of the denial of the motion.
