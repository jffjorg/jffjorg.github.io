```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Coro Community Management and Consulting, Inc in the case of Vogue Condominiums v. Coro Community Management and Consulting, Inc. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, which means that the plaintiff must file a new complaint that addresses the deficiencies in the original complaint. The court has also found that the fraud claim is insufficiently pled and lacks specificity, and has sustained the demurrer on that ground. The court has declined to strike the fraud claim, as the demurrer was sustained with leave to amend. The defendant's motion to strike is therefore moot. The court has ordered the plaintiff to file a first amended complaint within 20 days of the order.
