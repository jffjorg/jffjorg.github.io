And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant LKP's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is granted with leave to amend. The judge finds that the Plaintiffs' complaint is deficient as pled and does not survive Defendant LKP's motion. The judge also concludes that the Plaintiffs are collaterally estopped from bringing their sole claim for legal malpractice because the Court of Appeal affirmed the finding and conclusions of law made by the trial court in the Underlying Action. The judge grants the Plaintiffs 30 days leave to amend from this date.
