**Summary of Tentative Ruling**

- Case Number: 23STCV03131
- Hearing Date: September 19, 2023
- Judge: Holly J. Fujie

**Parties:**

- Plaintiff: Isign International, Inc.
- Defendants: Thien Pham, et al.

**Background:**

The case involves an employment relationship between the plaintiff and the moving defendant. In 2016, the moving defendant began working for the plaintiff as a director and Chief Technology Officer. In July 2021, the plaintiff and the moving defendant entered into an Employment Agreement that restricted the moving defendant's engagement in other business endeavors and the use of the plaintiff's confidential information.

**Dispute:**

The moving defendant is accused of breaching the Employment Agreement by pursuing separate business relationships with the plaintiff's former potential clients and sharing proprietary information. The plaintiff alleges causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and deceit, breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, conversion, misappropriation of trade secrets, violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, and declaratory relief.

**Moving Defendant's Demurrer:**

The moving defendant filed a demurrer to the first, second, third, fifth, and seventh causes of action, arguing that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.

**Court's Ruling:**

- The court overruled the demurrer to the first and second causes of action (breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing) as the complaint adequately alleges the legal effect of the Employment Agreement and the moving defendant's deviation from its limitations.
- The court overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action (fraud and deceit) as the complaint provides sufficient details about the specific conduct underlying the claim.
- The court overruled the demurrer to the fifth cause of action (constructive fraud) as the complaint sufficiently alleges the moving defendant's breach of fiduciary duty and intentional actions that contravened that duty.
- The court overruled the demurrer to the seventh cause of action (misappropriation of trade secrets) as the complaint sufficiently describes the subject matter of the trade secrets with enough particularity.
- The court found that the plaintiff complied with the pleading requirements for fraud-based claims and constructive fraud.
- The court overruled the demurrer in its entirety and ordered the moving party to file a responsive pleading within 20 days.

[2] The court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers.
[3] The moving defendant argues that the complaint fails to quote the Employment Agreement verbatim or incorporate a copy of the document.
