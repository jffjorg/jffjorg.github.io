AND CONSOLIDATED ACTIONS
 
MOVING PARTY: Brett G. Hampton (“Hampton”)
 
Hampton
seeks to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Keum Nam Chang (“Chang”) and GJY
Property Investment, LLC (“GJY”) (collectively, “Defendants”). The motions to
be relieved as counsel (collectively, the “Motions”) that Hampton filed on
August 17, 2023 are compliant with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
The Motions are unopposed.  Any
opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at least nine
court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure
section 1005, subdivision (b).[1]
 
 
DISCUSSION
The
court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the
client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
In
support of the Motions, Hampton declares there has been an irreconcilable
breakdown of the attorney-client relationship that prevents the representation
from being able to proceed.  The Court
finds this to be an adequate basis for withdrawal.  For this reason and because they are
unopposed, the Court GRANTS the Motions. 
(Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
As a business entity, GJY must be represented by
counsel.  (See Caressa Camille, Inc.
v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094,
1101.)  The Court schedules an OSC
regarding GJY’s representation on October 10, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. in this
department.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 


 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If
the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar. 
 
     Dated this 19th day of September 2023
