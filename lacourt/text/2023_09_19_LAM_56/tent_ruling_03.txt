  CASE NO.: 21STCV24488
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO COMPEL
  FURTHER RESPONSES
 
Date: 
  September 19, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56



 
MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff
 
            RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants Michael Theodore and Casa
Theodore, Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
This action arises out of a dispute over the
enforcement of a previously issued judgment. The currently operative fourth
amended complaint (the “4AC”) alleges: (1) statutory voidable transfers; and
(2) common law voidable transfers.  
 
            
 
On
March 10, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to
Requests for Production (“RFPs”), Set Five and denied Defendants’ motion for
protective order that argued that they should not be required to respond to the
same set of RFPs.   
 
On
April 5, 2023, Defendants filed a motion for relief from waiver of objections
to the RFPs addressed in the March 10, 2023 order.  Two days later, on April 7, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a motion to compel further responses to the RFPs that argued that the
objections asserted in Defendants’ responses were meritless.  The Court heard both of these motions on June
22, 2023 and issued a minute order granting Defendants relief from waiver of
objections.  Based on the finding that
Defendants were relieved of their waiver of the right to assert objections to
the RFPs, the Court determined that the Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
was moot and did not consider its arguments on the merits of Defendants’
asserted objections. 
 
On
July 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to the RFPs
(the “Motion”).  The instant Motion
concerns substantially the same RFPs as the April 7, 2023 filing.  
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
            Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections
are OVERRULED in their entirety.
 
 
 
 
 
DISCUSSION
Legal
Standard
Under
California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 2031.310, a motion to
compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents
may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2)
inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3)
unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(CCP § 2031.310, subd. (c).)  A
motion to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.  (See CCP § 2031.310 subd. (b)(1); Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216,
234-35.)  To establish good cause, a
discovery proponent must identify a disputed fact that is of consequence in the
action and explain how the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or
disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or
disprove the fact.  (Digital Music News LLC v. Superior Court (2014)
226 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.)  
 
If the
moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden
is on the objecting party to justify the objections.  (Kirkland
v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.)  The court shall limit the scope of discovery
if it determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery
clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.  (CCP §
2017.020, subd. (a).)  To support an
objection to a request for production of documents, the objecting party must
establish the validity of its objections with supporting facts in order to meet
its burden.  (Southern Pac. Co. v. Superior Court (1969) 3 Cal.App.3d 195,
198.)  
 
Meet and Confer
            As
a preliminary matter, the Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has
been satisfied. 
 
Timeliness 
Unless
notice of the motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to
the demand.  (CCP § 2031.310, subd. (c).)
 
            It
is undisputed that the instant Motion concerns discovery responses that
Defendants provided on March 22, 2023. 
Defendants argue that the Motion is not timely because it was filed more
than 45 days after they provided their responses.  Due to the procedural circumstances and
oscillating motion practice regarding discovery in this case, which most
recently culminated in the Court, on its own motion, removing Plaintiff’s April
7, 2023 motion to compel further from the calendar, the Court finds that the
instant Motion is not time-barred.  The Court’s
March 10, 2023 order directed Defendants to submit responses without objections
to the RFPs, and although Defendants subsequently sought relief from waiver of
objections, before the Court granted them that relief on June 22, 2023, their
responses were not compliant with a court order.[1]  The Court’s June 22, 2023 order determined
that Defendants were entitled to relief from a blanket waiver of objections
without a consideration of the legal merits of individual objections.  Plaintiff never withdrew his April 7, 2023
motion or otherwise conceded the arguments raised therein.  The Court will therefore consider the merits
of the instant Motion. 
 
Privacy/Privilege 
Tax returns
are privileged from disclosure.  (Strawn
v. Morris, Polich & Purdy, LLP (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1087, 1098.)  The purpose of the privilege is to encourage
voluntary filing of tax returns and truthful reporting of income, and thus to
facilitate tax collection.  (Id.)  The tax return privilege is not absolute and
will not be upheld when: (1) the circumstances indicate an intentional waiver
of the privilege; (2) the gravamen of the lawsuit is inconsistent with the
privilege; or (3) a public policy greater than that of the confidentiality of
tax returns is involved.  (Id.)  In situations where the third exception
applies, disclosure may be ordered when the party requesting disclosure
establishes: (1) the defendant has refused to produce relevant nonprivileged
financial records or has produced only meaningless and unreliable financial
information in response to punitive damage discovery; (2) the defendant has
engaged in a pattern of improperly obstructing efforts to obtain financial
records through means that do not implicate the privilege and it is reasonable
to assume this pattern of conduct will continue; and (3) less intrusive methods
to obtain the financial records have been unsuccessful.  (Li v. Yan (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 56,
67.)  Judgment debtor examinations serve
an important function in our judicial system that may serve as a predicate for
a court requiring the disclosure of tax records.  (See id. at 66-67.)
 
The Motion details
the ongoing discovery disputes regarding Defendants’ financial information that
sufficiently demonstrates that public policy concerns outweigh Defendants’
privacy interests in their financial records. 
Defendants attempt to distinguish the authority cited in the Motion by
noting that this is a separate action rather than an attempt to enforce the
judgment entered in a previous action, but their arguments do not address the
underlying policy concerns.  As a result,
Defendants’ arguments are not convincing, particularly since initiating a
separate action is a permissible alternative to enforce a judgment.  (See, e.g., Berger v. Varum (2019) 35
Cal.App.5th 1013, 1016-17.)  Furthermore,
Defendants have repeatedly evaded their discovery obligations, even when faced
with court orders requiring them to cooperate with Plaintiff’s requests.  
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion. 
Defendants are ordered to submit supplemental responses to the RFPs
detailed in the Separate Statement filed in support of the instant Motion
within 20 days of the date of this order. 

 
Monetary Sanctions
            In
connection with the Motion, Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount
of $4,061.  (Declaration of Lyle R. Mink (“Mink
Decl.”) ¶ 42.)  This amount represents:
(1) three hours preparing the moving papers at a rate of $500 per hour; (2) an
anticipated two hours preparing reply papers and three hours attending the
hearing; and (3) a filing fee in the amount of $61.65.  (Id.) 

 
The
Court exercises its discretion and awards Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the
reasonable amount of $1,561.65, which represents three hours preparing the
Motion at a rate of $500 per hour and $61.65 in filing fees.  (Moran v. Oso Valley Greenbelt Assn.
(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1029, 1034.) 
Defendants and counsel are jointly responsible for paying this amount
within 20 days of the date of this order. 

 
             Moving party is
ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the
motion will be placed off calendar.
