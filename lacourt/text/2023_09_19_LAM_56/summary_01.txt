And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions of Brett G. Hampton to be relieved as counsel for defendants Keum Nam Chang and GJY Property Investment, LLC. Hampton filed the motions on August 17, 2023, which are unopposed. The judge finds that Hampton's declaration of an irreconcilable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship is an adequate basis for withdrawal. The court also notes that GJY, as a business entity, must be represented by counsel. The judge schedules an Order to Show Cause regarding GJY's representation on October 10, 2023.
