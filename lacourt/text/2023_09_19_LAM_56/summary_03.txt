##  Tentative Ruling Summary: Case No. 21STCV24488

**Case Number:** 21STCV24488
**Hearing Date:** September 19, 2023
**Dept:** 56

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Kyle Madison
* **Defendants:** Michael Theodore and Casa Theodore, Inc.

**Subject:** Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production

**Background:**

This case revolves around enforcing a previous judgment. Plaintiff Kyle Madison claims Defendants Michael Theodore and Casa Theodore, Inc. made voidable transfers of assets.

**Key Points:**

* **Previous Orders:**  
    * On March 10, 2023, the Court ordered Defendants to respond to certain Requests for Production (RFPs) without objections.
    * On June 22, 2023, the Court granted Defendants relief from their waiver of objections to those same RFPs, making Plaintiff's previous motion to compel moot.
* **Current Motion:** Plaintiff filed a new Motion to Compel, arguing that Defendants' responses to the RFPs were insufficient. 
* **Timeliness:** The Court found the Motion timely despite exceeding the 45-day deadline for responding to RFPs, considering the previous motion practice and Defendants' evasive discovery tactics.

**Judge's Ruling:**

* **Overruled Evidentiary Objections:** The Court overruled Plaintiff's evidentiary objections to Defendants' responses.
* **Granted Motion to Compel:** The Court granted Plaintiff's Motion to Compel, ordering Defendants to provide supplemental responses to the RFPs within 20 days.
* **Monetary Sanctions:** The Court awarded Plaintiff monetary sanctions of $1,561.65 for Defendants' unnecessary resistance to discovery.

**Reasoning:**

The Court found that:

* Defendants repeatedly attempted to evade discovery obligations.
*  Public policy considerations, particularly the need to enforce judgments and uncover financial information, outweighed Defendants' privacy concerns regarding their tax returns.

**Next Steps:**

Defendants must provide supplemental responses to the RFPs within 20 days. They are also jointly responsible for paying the awarded monetary sanctions within the same timeframe.




**English Summary:**

The judge ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Kyle Madison, in his motion to compel further responses from the defendants, Michael Theodore and Casa Theodore, Inc.  

The judge found that the defendants had improperly resisted discovery requests, particularly regarding their financial information.  

The judge ordered the defendants to provide the requested documents within 20 days and also imposed monetary sanctions for their actions.
