And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment to add North Hollywood Hospice Inc. as an additional judgment debtor. The plaintiff had claimed that North Hollywood Hospice Inc. was the true owner of Sweet Touch Hospice, which had attempted to open a new account with the plaintiff and had presented evidence that Sweet Touch Hospice was a Fictitious Business Name for North Hollywood Hospice Inc. The judge found that North Hollywood Hospice Inc. was an alter ego of the original judgment debtor, Davit Hakobyan, and therefore jointly liable for the judgment amount. The judge also noted that it was unnecessary to address the plaintiff's arguments that North Hollywood Hospice Inc. was a successor judgment debtor or a joint enterprise of the judgment debtor. The motion is granted, and the plaintiff will be notified.
