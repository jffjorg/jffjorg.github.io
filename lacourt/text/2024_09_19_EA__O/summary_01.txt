And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings filed by National Distribution Centers, LLC (NDC) against plaintiff Joseph Granados. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit on behalf of all aggrieved employees, alleging violations of California Labor Code ยง 2698, et seq. (PAGA).

The court is inclined to deny the motion because the plaintiff does not have standing to bring a PAGA action since he is not seeking redress or remedy for individual claims. The court finds that the plaintiff's complaint does not allege individual claims, and therefore, the non-individual claims must be dismissed.

The court also finds that the case Balderas v. Fresh Start Harvesting, Inc. (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 533 does not support the plaintiff's argument that he need not allege individualized claims. The court concludes that the motion is pending and will be decided after further consideration.

The court notes that the motion to compel arbitration is not moot because the plaintiff does not seek redress or remedy for individual claims. Therefore, the court will strike the complaint sua sponte. The final ruling is subject to change after the parties have an opportunity to respond.
