[1] Defendant also
references Lira v. National Distribution Centers, LLC, et al., No.
5:21-cv-00672-JGB-KK, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 251955 at *212 (C.D. Cal. 2021) as
another case that upheld Defendant’s arbitration agreement. However, the case
appears irrelevant as it does not concern the threshold issue of PAGA standing.



[2] Individual PAGA
claims are those that the plaintiff personally experienced whereas
non-individual PAGA claims are those other employees experienced. (See
Reply p. 4, citing Diaz v. Macys West Stores, Inc. (9th Cir. 2024) 101
F.4th 697, 699, fn.1.) 
 


[3] Viking River left
intact the rule set forth in Iskanian v. CLS Transportation Los Angeles, LLC
(2014) 59 Cal.4th 348 against agreements that compel waiver of
non-individual claims. (Viking River, supra, 596 U.S. at p. 662.)  
 


[4] But if the
arbitrator determines that a plaintiff is not an aggrieved employee, then the
plaintiff can no longer prosecute his non-individual claims due to lack of
standing. (Reply p. 3, citing Adolpha, supra, 14 Cal.5th at pp.
1123-1124; see also Rocha v. U-Haul Co. of California (2023) 88
Cal.App.5th 65, 76-77.) 
 


[5] The statute uses the
conjunction “and” not “or” such that the plain language of the statute provides
that “PAGA was designed to authorize aggrieved
employees to pursue enforcement actions on behalf of themselves and their
current and former coworkers.” (Adolph, supra, 14 Cal.4th at p.
1125, emphasis added.)

[7] (See Estrada v.
Superior Court (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 915, 924 [“[D]ictum consists of
general observations of law which go beyond the facts and issues of the
case.”].) And dictum, unlike ratio decidendi
which “constitutes the basis of the decision and creates binding precedent,”
dictum “has no force as precedent.” (United Steelworkers of America v. Board
of Education (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 823, 834.) In further demonstration
that Plaintiff is relying upon dicta, the Balderas court cited to Johnson
v. Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc. (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 924 for
the proposition that “employee need not bring an individual claim against her
employer to have standing to pursue a PAGA claim; it is sufficient to allege
the employee suffered a Labor Code violation.” (Balderas, supra, 101
Cal.App.5th at p. 539.) But Johnson dealt with the specific question of
“whether an employee, whose individual claim is time-barred, may still
pursue a representative claim under PAGA.” (Johnson, supra, 66
Cal.App.5th at p. 929, emphasis added.) Here, the statute of limitations is not
at issue, and that issue carried a different analysis and considerations. That
issue aside, the Johnson court reversed the trial court’s ruling of
sustaining the demurrer to the plaintiff’s complaint by relying upon the
seminal case of Kim v. Reins International California, Inc. (2020) 99
Cal.4th 73. (Johnson, supra, 66 Cal.App.5th at p. 926 [“Relying on [Kim],
we reverse.”].) In Kim, the employer argued that because with the individual
claims were sent to arbitration, the dismissal of the employee’s individual
claims meant he was no longer an aggrieved employee with PAGA standing. (Kim,
supra, 99 Cal.4th at p. 82.) The state’s high court “rejected the
contention that a plaintiff loses standing by settling individual Labor
Code claims and accepting ‘compensation for his injury.’” (Id. at p.
929, emphasis added.) Effectively, though the Kim court “clarified that
PAGA standing does not depend on maintaining an individual Labor Code
claim” (id. at p. 930, emphasis added), a plaintiff, at the very list,
must still allege/assert relief for his own Labor Code claims.
