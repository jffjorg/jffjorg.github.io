And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the information presented and is issuing a tentative ruling on the threshold issue of PAGA standing. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff is seeking to bring non-individual PAGA claims, which are those experienced by other employees. The Judge also notes that the arbitration agreement compels waiver of non-individual claims, and that the arbitrator determines if a plaintiff is an aggrieved employee.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff is relying on dicta from previous cases, which is not sufficient to establish PAGA standing. The Judge cites the case of Kim v. Reins International California, Inc. (2020) 99 Cal.4th 73, which held that a plaintiff does not lose standing by settling individual Labor Code claims and accepting compensation for their injury. The Judge concludes that a plaintiff must still allege/assert relief for their own Labor Code claims to have PAGA standing.

The Judge tentatively rules that the Plaintiff's non-individual PAGA claims are not sufficient to establish PAGA standing, and that the case should be dismissed.
