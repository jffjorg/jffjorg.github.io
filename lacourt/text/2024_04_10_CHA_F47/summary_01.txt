And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants.

The court has overruled the demurrer as to the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th causes of action (breach of contract, declaratory relief, promissory estoppel, and violation of Business and Professions Code 17200), meaning that the plaintiff's claims in these areas can proceed. The court has ruled that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims. The court has also ruled that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a violation of Business and Professions Code 17200. The defendants' answer is due within 30 days.
