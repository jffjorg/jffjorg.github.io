SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of foreclosure proceedings against
property located at 9251 Notre Dame Avenue in Chatsworth, California (the
Property).  In or about July 2017,
Kenneth T. Perez (Borrower) took out a mortgage loan from Skyline Home Loans in
the amount of $501,215.00.  (First
Amended Complaint (FAC) ¶16).  In or
around August 2018, Borrower executed a Power of Attorney in favor of Plaintiff
Kyle A. Perez, Executor of the Estate of Kyle T. Perez (Plaintiff).  (Id. ¶17).  On 5/26/19, Borrower died.  (Id. ¶18).  By Last Will and Testament of Kenneth T.
Perez, Plaintiff was appointed executor of the Estate of Kenneth T. Perez.  Id. 
In or around December 2021, Plaintiff alleges that he received a loan
modification agreement (2021 Loan Modification Agreement) from Defendant
Loancare, LLC (Loancare) executed by Defendant Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC
(Lakeview) (collectively, Defendants) stating the first modification payment
would be due on 3/1/22 in the amount of $2,514.84 with an interest rate of
3.625%.  (Id. misnumbered ¶10 on
p.3:12-16 of the FAC).  Plaintiff alleges
that he signed and notarized the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement and returned it
to Loancare.  (Id. ¶19). 
 
Plaintiff alleges that on or around 1/21/22, he contacted
Loancare and spoke to supervisor, Lashea, who stated Loancare did not receive
the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement.  (Id.
¶20).  Plaintiff alleges that he re-sent
the executed 2021 Loan Modification Agreement to Loancare two more times.  (Id. ¶21).  In or around April 2022, Plaintiff alleges
that Loancare rejected the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement due to signatures
not matching.  (Id. ¶22).  On or around 4/15/22, Plaintiff re-sent the
2021 Loan Modification Agreement to Loancare with notarized signatures along
with two checks for March and April 2022. 
(Id. ¶¶23-24).
Plaintiff alleges that instead of applying the two
payments to the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement, Loancare applied them to the
original loan terms.  (Id. ¶25).  Plaintiff contacted Loancare to inquire why
the payments were not being applied to the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement and
requested that if the payments were not going to be applied to the 2021 Loan
Modification Agreement, that they be returned. 
(Id. ¶26).  Loancare
returned the payments to Plaintiff.  (Id.
¶27).  Between April 2022 and October
2022, Plaintiff alleges that he contacted Loancare regarding the status of the
executed 2021 Loan Modification Agreement. 
(Id. ¶28).  On or about
10/17/22, Defendant National Default Servicing Corporation (National Default),
on behalf of Loancare, recorded a Notice of Default (NOD) against the Property.  (Id. misnumbered ¶11 p.4:12-16 of FAC).  Thereafter, from November 2022 through
February 2023, Plaintiff alleges that he spoke to various Loancare agents
regarding the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement. 
(Id. ¶¶29-34).  
 
On or around 2/9/23, National Default, on behalf of
Loancare, recorded a Notice of Trustee’s Sale (NOS) against the Property
indicating that Loancare intends to sell the Property.  (Id. misnumbered ¶12 p.5:5-9 of FAC
and ¶35).  
 
On 4/26/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Loancare,
Lakeview and National Default for: (1)   Negligent Misrepresentation; (2) Intentional
Misrepresentation; (3) Declaratory Relief; (4)   Promissory Estoppel and (5) Violation of
Business & Professions Code 17200. 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve issues Defendants had
with the complaint, on 7/23/23, Loancare and Lakeview filed (served on 6/30/23)
a demurrer to the entire complaint on the ground that each cause of action failed
to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.  CCP 430.10(e). Plaintiff opposed the
demurrer.  Defendants filed and served a
late reply to the demurrer.  On 10/24/23,
this Court sustained the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend.  
 
On 11/27/23, Plaintiff filed the subject First Amended
Complaint (FAC) alleging causes of action for: (1) Negligent Misrepresentation,
(2) Intentional Misrepresentation, (3) Breach of Contract, (4) Declaratory
Relief, (5) Promissory Estoppel and (6) Violation of Business and Professions
Code 17200.  After meet and confer
efforts failed to resolve the issues Defendants  have with the First Amended Complaint, they
filed and served the instant demurrer to the entire First Amended
Complaint.  Plaintiff has opposed the
demurrer.  Although Defendants filed a
Case Management Statement on 4/2/24, as of 4/8/24 no reply (which was due on or
before 4/3/24 – CCP 1005(b)) to the opposition has been filed. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
3rd Cause of Action – Breach of Contract
 
In response to an order sustaining a demurrer with leave
to amend, a plaintiff may amend the complaint to add a new cause of action
where the new cause of action directly responds to the trial court’s reason for
sustaining the demurrer.  See Harris
(2010) 185 CA4th 1018, 1023 citing Patrick (2008) 167 CA4th 995,
1015.  
 
In ruling on the demurrer to the original complaint, this
Court noted that Plaintiff appeared to be attempting to allege a claim for
breach of contract.  (See 10/24/23
Minute Order,  p.4, p.5).  As such, the Court finds that amending the
complaint to include a breach of contract cause of action falls within the
order granting leave to amend.  
 
The elements of such a claim are: (1) the existence of a
contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance, (3) breach by defendant and (4) damage
resulting from the breach.  First Commercial
Mortgage Co. (2001) 89 CA4th 731, 745.
 
Defendants admit that the lender offered Plaintiff a loan
modification.  (Demurrer, p.8:8; See
also FAC ¶131).  Plaintiff has
alleged that he accepted the offer by signing and returning the agreement along
with two checks to Loancare in relation to the modification agreement.  (FAC misnumbered ¶10 on p.3 and ¶¶10, 19-24, 132-137).  The demurrer also seemingly admits Defendants’
receipt of the executed agreement but claims that it was rejected due to issues
with the paperwork and Plaintiff’s signature. 
(Demurrer, p.8:8-10).  The Court
finds that, at the pleading stage, Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to
establish the existence of a contract. 
Whether or not Defendants had proper bases to reject the executed
contract cannot be determined on demurrer. 
  
 
Plaintiff has also alleged sufficient facts to support
his performance under the loan modification agreement, Loancare’s breach, and
damages resulting therefrom.  (See
FAC ¶¶19-22, 130, 135-137, 144-148).    
 
1st Cause of Action – Negligent
Misrepresentation & 2nd Cause of Action – Intentional
Misrepresentation
 
The elements of a negligent misrepresentation cause
action are: (1) the defendant made a false representation as to a past or
existing material fact; (2) the defendant made the representation without
reasonable ground for believing it to be true; (3) in making the
representation, the defendant intended to deceive the plaintiff; (4) the
plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation; and (5) the plaintiff
suffered resulting damages.  Majd
(2015) 243 CA4th 1293, 1307.  The
elements of a fraud/intentional misrepresentation cause of action are: (1) a
material representation or deceit that is false; (2) knowledge of falsity; (3)
intent to defraud; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damages.  Philipson & Simon (2007) 154 CA4th
347, 363.      
 
Fraud-based claims must be pled with specific facts
showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made.  Lazar (1996) 12 C4th 631, 645.  When fraud is pled against a corporation, a
plaintiff must allege: (1) the names of the persons who made the allegedly
fraudulent statements or omissions, (2) their authority to speak, (3) to whom
they spoke, (4) what they said or wrote and (5) when it was said or
written.  Tarmann (1991) 2 CA4th
153, 157; Lazar, supra.
 
Plaintiff has  failed
to plead the alleged misrepresentations made by Loancare and/or Lakeview with
the requisite factual specificity. 
Plaintiff refers to conduct purportedly committed by “Defendants”
collectively.  (See FAC ¶¶61-63,
71-73, 107-110)  While Plaintiff includes
some first names of purported representatives of Loancare, Plaintiff has not
alleged sufficient facts to establish those individual’s authority to speak on
behalf of the entity Defendants, nor has Plaintiff clearly alleged that representations
made by the identified individuals were false. 

 
As noted in the ruling on the demurrer to the original
complaint, the negligent misrepresentation and intentional misrepresentation
causes of action appear to be veiled breach of contract claims.  Plaintiff has now had two opportunities to
plead his fraud-based claims and has failed to adequately do so.  Additionally, while Plaintiff requests leave
to amend, if the demurrer is sustained, Plaintiff fails to give any indication
as to how he can cure the defects in these claims as is his burden.  See Hedwall (2018) 22 CA5th
564, 580.     
 
4th Cause of Action – Declaratory Relief
 
The basis for declaratory relief is the existence of an actual,
present controversy over a proper subject. 
See City of Cotati (2002) 29 C4th 69, 79; CCP 1060; Jolley
(2013) 213 CA4th 872, 909.  The purpose
of such a claim is to provide a new form of relief where needed and not to give
a litigant a second cause of action for the determination of identical issues.  California Insurance Guarantee Association
(1991) 231 CA3d 1617, 1624.  Declaratory
relief operates prospectively to declare future rights not to redress past
wrongs.  See  Yang 2011 WL 902108, *5; Canova
(2007) 150 CA4th 1487, 1497 .
 
Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged an actual controversy
exists as to whether the executed Loan Modification Agreement was properly
rejected and/or whether Defendants must abide by same going forward.  Plaintiff may assert the declaratory relief claim
in the alternative to his breach of contract cause of action.  
 
5th Cause of Action – Promissory Estoppel
 
The elements of a promissory estoppel cause of action
are: (1) a clear and unambiguous promise by defendant, (2) plaintiff’s reasonable
and foreseeable reliance, (3) plaintiff’s substantial detriment or injury
caused by the reliance on the promise, and (4) damages measured by the extent
of the obligation assumed and not performed.  US Ecology, Inc. (2005) 129 CA4th 887,
901; Toscano (2004) 124 CA4th 685, 692; Garcia (2010) 183 CA4th
1031, 1037.  A plaintiff must also allege
facts showing defendants’ failure to fulfill the promise was a substantial
factor in causing the plaintiff’s damages.  US Ecology Inc., supra at 902–05.
 
Contrary to Defendants’ assertion, Plaintiff has
sufficiently alleged a clear and unambiguous promise based on the terms of the
Loan Modification Agreement.  Plaintiff
has also alleged sufficient facts to support the remaining elements of the
cause of action.  Plaintiff may properly
assert this claim in the alternative to the breach of contract cause of
action.  
 
6th Cause of Action – Violation of
California Business & Professions Code 17200
 
Business and Professions Code 17200, et seq., the Unfair
Competition Law, prohibits acts of unfair competition, including any unlawful,
unfair, fraudulent or deceptive business practice as well as “unfair,
deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising. 

 
Plaintiff has alleged that Defendants have violated the
unfair and fraudulent prongs of the Unfair Competition Law.  (FAC ¶¶166-172).
 
The demurrer focuses on the argument that that Plaintiff
cannot show a violation of a predicate law and merely concludes that Plaintiff
has failed to allege or establish unfair or fraudulent conduct.  (See Demurrer, p.13:7-8).  The Court finds that Plaintiff has alleged
sufficient facts to state a claim for violation of Business and Professions
Code based on the unfair prong of the statute. 

 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer as to the 1st and 2nd
causes of action for negligent misrepresentation and intentional
misrepresentation is sustained without leave to amend.  The demurrer as to the 3rd, 4th,
5th and 6th causes of action is overruled.  Answer is due within 30 days.
