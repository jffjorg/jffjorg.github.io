CASE NO.:                24SMCV01311
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses
HEARING DATE:   1/2/2025
 
Legal
Standard
 
 If a
party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for
a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown
in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on
the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response
of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.
App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Where there has been no timely
response to a CCP section 2031.010 inspection demand, the demanding party must
seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. Thus,
unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he
or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline
for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving
party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the
motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no
showing of "good cause" is required. 
 
Pursuant to CCP section
2033.280(b), a party may move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). “Failure to timely respond to RFA does not result in
automatic admissions. Rather, the propounder of the RFA must ‘move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction’ under §
2023.010 et seq.” (CCP, § 2033.280(b).) The court “shall” grant the motion to
deem RFA admitted, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP, § 2033.280(c).) 
  
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant Nastaran Khadavi moves for orders compelling initial
discovery responses from Plaintiff Roldofo Cardenas as to his first set of
discovery, including Form Interrogatories, Requests for Production of
Documents. Defendant also moves to deem matters admitted as to his first set of
Requests for Admissions. Defendant seeks to sanction Plaintiff in the amount of
$1,210.00 per motion.
Defendant has shown proper service of the instant discovery. On
August 27, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with his first sets of discovery,
including the subject RFAs, RPDs, and FROGs, via regular mail. (Kim Decls.,
Exs. B.) Plaintiff’s responses were due on or before October 1, 2024, but never
served a response to this discovery. On October 4, 2024, Defendant sent a meet
and confer letter to Plaintiff via U.S. Mail indicating that no responses had
been received and requesting responses without objection within 10 days. (Id.,
Exs. C.) Plaintiff ignored the letter and did not respond. To date, Plaintiff
has not responded. 
Accordingly, the motions are GRANTED. Mandatory
sanctions are imposed in the reduced total amount of $1,560.00,
inclusive of costs, against Plaintiff. Sanctions are to be paid to Defendant’s
counsel of record within 30 days.
