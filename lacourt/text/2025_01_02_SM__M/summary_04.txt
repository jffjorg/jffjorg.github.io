And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Counsel Hesam Yazdanpanah's motion to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff Syah Cole. The motion is granted due to an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, which has resulted in a loss of communication with the client. Counsel was unable to confirm the client's current address despite reasonable efforts, including mailing with return receipt, calling the client's telephone, and conducting database searches. The judge notes that the motion is granted, and the order is effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the order (MC-053 Form) on the client. Until then, counsel remains counsel of record.
