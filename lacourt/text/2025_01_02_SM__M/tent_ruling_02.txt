[1] Plaintiff’s
reliance on the rules set forth in DCM Partners v. Smith (1991) 228
Cal.App.3d 729, and Ghirardo v. Antonioli (1994) 8 Cal.4th 791, are
inapplicable. DCM Partners and Ghirado are distinguishable
because the original loans were indisputably exempt, and thus their
modifications were also exempt. Here there is no analogous exemption to the
original loan, which, as stated, may be usurious under the facts.
