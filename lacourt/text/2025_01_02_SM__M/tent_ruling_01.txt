MOTION:                  Motion
for Summary Judgment
HEARING DATE:   1/2/2025

 
Legal
Standard
 
A party may move for summary judgment in any action or
proceeding if it is contended the action has no merit or that there is no
defense to the action or proceeding. (CCP, § 437c(a).) “The purpose of the law
of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  
 
“A party may move for summary adjudication as to one or
more causes of action within an action, one or more affirmative defenses, one
or more claims for damages, or one or more issues of duty, if the party
contends that the cause of action has no merit, that there is no affirmative
defense to the cause of action, that there is no merit to an affirmative
defense as to any cause of action, that there is no merit to a claim for
damages, as specified in¿Section 3294 of the Civil Code, or that one or more defendants
either owed or did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or plaintiffs.”¿(CCP,¿§
437c(f)(1).)¿If a party seeks summary adjudication as an alternative to a
request for summary judgment, the request must be clearly made in the notice of
the motion. (Gonzales v. Superior Court¿(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1542,
1544.)¿ “[A] party may move for summary adjudication of a legal issue or a
claim for damages other than punitive damages that does not completely
dispose of a cause of action, affirmative defense, or issue of duty
pursuant to” subdivision (t). (CCP,¿§ 437c(t).)¿ 
 
To prevail, the evidence submitted must show there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.¿(CCP, §¿437c(c).)¿The motion cannot succeed unless
the evidence leaves no room for conflicting inferences as to material facts;
the court has no power to weigh one inference against another or against other
evidence. (Murillo v. Rite Stuff Food Inc. (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th
833, 841.) In determining whether the facts give rise to a triable issue of
material fact, “[a]ll doubts as to whether any material, triable, issues of
fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment…”
(Gold v. Weissman (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1195, 1198-99.) “In other
words, the facts alleged in the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment
and the reasonable inferences there from must be accepted as true.” (Jackson
v. County of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 179.) However, if
adjudication is otherwise proper the motion “may not be denied on grounds of
credibility,” except when¿a material fact is the witness’s¿state of mind and
“that fact is sought to be established solely by the [witness’s] affirmation
thereof.” (CCP, § 437c(e).)¿ 
 
Once the moving party has met their burden, the burden
shifts to the opposing party “to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP §
437c(p)(1).) “[T]here¿is no
obligation on the opposing party... to establish anything by affidavit unless
and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts establishing every
element... necessary to sustain a judgment in his favor.”¿(Consumer Cause,
Inc. v.¿SmileCare¿(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454, 468.)¿ 
¿ 
“The pleadings play a key role in a summary judgment
motion. The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to
delimit the scope of the issues and to¿frame¿the outer measure of materiality
in a summary judgment proceeding.” (Hutton v. Fidelity National Title Co.¿(2013)
213 Cal.App.4th 486, 493, quotations and citations omitted.) “Accordingly, the
burden of a defendant moving for summary judgment only requires that he or she
negate plaintiff's theories of liability¿as alleged in the complaint;
that is, a moving party need not refute liability on some theoretical
possibility not included in the pleadings.” (Ibid.)¿ 
 
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES
 
Defendant’s evidentiary objections are OVERRULED.
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff HAR-ECP LLC moves for
summary judgment on its complaint against Defendant Michael Rosenfeld. The
complaint alleges a single cause of action for breach of a written guarantee.
 
The general elements of a cause of
action for breach of contract include the existence of a contract, plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for non-performance, defendants’ breach, and resulting
damages to plaintiff. (CDF Firefighters v. Maldonado (2008) 158
Cal.App.4th 1226, 1239.) “A lender is entitled to judgment on a breach of
guaranty claim based upon undisputed
evidence that 1) there is a valid guaranty, 2) the borrower
has defaulted, and 3) the guarantor failed to perform under the guaranty.” (Gray1
CPB, LLC v. Kolokotronis (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 480, 486; see Civ. Code, §
2837 [the terms of a contract of suretyship are interpreted with the same rules
as other contracts].)
 
The Complaint alleges a series of
transactions and extensions regarding the subject guarantee. On August 28,
2012, Plaintiff made a $3,500,000 “capital contribution” to ECP Investors, LLC
("ECP"), by which Plaintiff acquired a membership interest in ECP
("Membership Interest"). (Compl., ¶ 6.) On March 25, 2014, Plaintiff
increased its capital contribution by $5,500,000, for a total contribution of
$9,000,000. (Id.) The terms of the Limited Liability Agreement of ECP
Investors, LLC required ECP to provide Plaintiff with both a return on its
Capital Contribution, and the return of its Capital Contribution, by virtue of
Plaintiff's Membership Interest ("Company Obligations"). (Id.) On
June 20, 2014, Plaintiff and ECP agreed to convert the Company Obligations into
a promissory note, an assignment of distribution rights and related documents,
and Plaintiff withdrew as a member of ECP without a return of its Capital
Contribution. (¶7.) On June 20, 2014, ECP executed and delivered to Plaintiff a
Promissory Note ("Note"), in the principal amount of $9,000,000 in
favor of Plaintiff as payee to evidence the conversion of the Capital
Contribution into a debt. (¶ 8.) 
 
Also on June 20, 2014, ECP, as
assignor, and Plaintiff, as assignee, entered into the Assignment of
Distribution Rights ("Assignment"). (Compl., ¶ 9.) ECP assigned its
right to receive distributions from Eastside Century Partners Century, LLC
("Eastside") until the principal amount of the Note plus other
specified amounts were paid. (Id.) Concurrent with the execution of the Note,
Rosenfeld executed and delivered the written Second Amended and Restated
Guaranty ("Guaranty"), where Rosenfeld unconditionally and absolutely
guaranteed to Plaintiff, among other things, the full payment and performance
of each and all of ECP's Payment Obligations. (¶ 10.) 
 
            The Complaint
alleges a series of extensions and modifications to the agreements. On May 1,
2019, ECP and Plaintiff executed a modification of the Note, agreeing to extend
the maturity date of the Note. (Compl., ¶¶ 11-12.) On July 1, 2019, ECP
executed and delivered an Estoppel Certificate ("Estoppel
Certificate"), and Plaintiff executed a "Lender Acknowledgement”. (¶
13.) ECP acknowledged that Plaintiff agreed that ECP could make monthly
interest payments under the Note, as amended, at the reduced rate of five
percent (5%) per annum, through June 30, 2020. (Id.) In the Estoppel
Certificate, ECP and Rosenfeld acknowledged that to the extent that ECP paid
the reduced monthly interest rate, the unpaid interest at the rate of eighteen
percent (18%) continued to accrue. (¶¶13-14.) 
 
On July 15, 2019, ECP, as assignor,
and Plaintiff, as assignee, entered into an Amended and Restated Assignment of
Distribution Rights ("Amended Assignment"), with Rosenfeld again
consenting in writing to the amendment. (Compl., ¶¶ 15-16.) On May 11, 2020,
Plaintiff and ECP entered into an Agreement to Extend Reduced Loan Payments.
Plaintiff and ECP agreed to extend the reduced interest payments provided for
in the Estoppel Certificate through December 31, 2020. (¶ 17.) Rosenfeld
consented in writing to the extension. (¶ 18.) 
 
On November 30, 2020, Plaintiff and
ECP entered into an Agreement to Second Extension of Reduced Loan Payments,
extending the reduced interest payments provided for in the Estoppel
Certificate through June 30, 2021. (Compl., ¶ 19.) Rosenfeld consented in
writing to the extension. (¶ 20.) On May 24, 2021, Plaintiff and ECP entered
into the Agreement to a Third Extension of Reduced Loan Payments by which
Plaintiff and ECP agreed to extend the period of reduced interest payments
provided for in the Estoppel Certificate through December 31, 2021. (¶ 21.)
Rosenfeld consented to this third extension. (¶ 22.)
 
On June 1, 2021, ECP executed and
delivered to Plaintiff an Agreement and Modification of Promissory Note
(Modification No. 2), agreeing to extend the maturity date of the Note to June
30, 2022. (¶ 23.) Rosenfeld consented to this extension of the maturity date. (Compl.,
¶ 24.) On December 15, 2021, Plaintiff and ECP entered into an Agreement to
Fourth Extension of Reduced Loan Payments by which Plaintiff and ECP agreed to
extend the period of reduced interest payments provided for in the Estoppel
Certificate through June 30, 2022. (¶ 25.) Rosenfeld consented to this
extension of the reduced interest payments. (¶ 26.) 
 
On May 10, 2022, Plaintiff and ECP
entered into an Agreement to Fifth Extension of Reduced Loan Payments by which
Plaintiff and ECP agreed to extend the period of reduced interest payments
provided for in the Estoppel Certificate through December 31, 2022. (¶ 27.)
Rosenfeld executed a consent in writing to the Agreement to Fifth Extension of
Reduced Loan Payments. (Compl., ¶ 28.) On May 10, 2022, ECP executed and
delivered to Plaintiff an Agreement and Modification of Promissory Note
(Modification No. 3), agreeing to extend the maturity date of the Note to
December 31, 2022. (¶ 29.) Rosenfeld consented in writing to Modification No.
3. (¶ 30.) 
 
On December 21, 2022, Plaintiff and
ECP entered into an Agreement to a Sixth Extension of Reduced Loan Payments,
extending the period of reduced interest payments provided for in the Estoppel
Certificate through June 30, 2023. (¶ 31.) Rosenfeld executed a consent in
writing to the Agreement to Sixth Extension of Reduced Loan Payments. (¶ 32.) On
December 21, 2022, ECP executed and delivered to Plaintiff an Agreement and
Modification of Promissory Note (Modification No. 4), agreeing to extend the
maturity date of the Note to June 30, 2023. (¶ 33.) Rosenfeld consented in
writing to Modification No. 4. (¶ 34.) 
 
Following these extensions, ECP and
Rosenfeld defaulted on the Note and Guarantee. In June 2023, ECP failed to make
the required monthly loan payment under the Note. (Compl., ¶ 35.) On July 3,
2023, Plaintiff provided a written Notice of Default to ECP. (Id.) Despite its
receipt of the Notice of Default, ECP failed and continues to fail to make the
payments required of it under the Note. (Id.) The Note matured on June 30,
2023. (¶ 36.) Despite the passage of the maturity date and its receipt of the
Notice of Default, ECP has failed to pay off the amounts due and owing,
including the unpaid principal, interest, fees, and costs. (Id.) Rosenfeld failed
to perform the Guaranteed Obligations, including failing to pay all unpaid
principal, interest, fees, and costs. (¶ 39.) Rosenfeld thus breached his
obligations under the Guaranty. (Id.)
 
In their motion, Plaintiff provides
evidence supporting the Complaint. On August 28, 2012, Plaintiff made a capital
contribution to ECP in the amount of $3,500,000, by which Plaintiff acquired a
membership interest in ECP. (UMF 3.) Plaintiff held a 50% interest in ECP as
the “Investor Member” and Rosenfeld held a 50% interest as the “Manager
Member.” (UMF 4.) Under the Limited Liability Company Agreement of ECP
Investors, Plaintiff had distribution rights defined as the “Investor Member
Priority Return” of “18% per annum, payable monthly” on its Investor Member
capital contribution of $3.5 million. (UMF 5.)  Rosenfeld was not entitled to Investor Member
Priority Return on the $100 he invested to retain a 50% interest in ECP. (UMF
6.) On March 25, 2014, Plaintiff increased its capital contribution by
$5,500,000 to a total of $9,000,000. (UMF 7.) Rosenfeld was supposed to make a
$3,195,000 capital contribution as the Manager Member. (UMF 8.) Rosenfeld would
still not be entitled to Priority Return, but this contribution increased his
Membership Percentage Interest from fifty to ninety percent. (UMF 9.) Plaintiff’s
Membership Percentage Interest was reduced to ten percent, but Plaintiff was
still entitled to the Priority Return. (UMF 10.) Rosenfeld guaranteed
Plaintiff’s Investor Member Priority Return for the $3.5 and $5.5 million
capital contributions to ECP. (UMF 11.) 
 
Plaintiff notes that the HAR-ECP
$9.0 million Capital Contribution is one of over twenty ventures in the past
fifteen years where Rosenfeld obtained funding for his development projects
from a HAR entity, the vast majority of which provided an 18% return on the
capital invested or loaned and were guaranteed by Rosenfeld. (UMF 12.) ECP
requested that Plaintiff convert its $9.0 million capital contribution to a
Promissory Note. (UMF 13.) Plaintiff contends that the conversion of the
investment was “economically neutral” since Plaintiff would still receive 18%
annually on its capital contribution, and Rosenfeld fully guaranteed the
investment principal and 18% return. (UMF 14, 27.) Plaintiff agreed to the
conversion and a two-year extension of the return of Plaintiff’s $9.0 million
investment. (UMF 15.) 
 
As of June 20, 2014, Plaintiff
withdrew as a member of ECP without the return of its Capital Contribution.
Plaintiff and ECP executed an agreement prepared by ECP’s counsel titled
“AGREEMENT FOR MEMBER TO WITHDRAW FROM ECP INVESTORS, LLC AND TO CONVERT MEMBERSHIP
INTEREST TO PROMISSORY NOTE”. (UMF 21.) Plaintiff’s interest in ECP was
converted into a Promissory Note (“Promissory Note”) and an assignment of
distribution rights (“Assignment”), both dated the Effective Date. (UMF 23.) Rosenfeld
executed a Second Amended and Restated Guaranty (“Guaranty”), guaranteeing full
payment and performance on the Promissory Note and Assignment. (UMF 24.) Under
the Promissory Note, ECP promised to pay Plaintiff $9,000,000, plus the
Preferred Return, as defined in the Assignment (at least $135,000.00
monthly). (UMF 25.) The Preferred Return was the amount to be distributed to
Plaintiff under the Assignment. (UMF 26.) 
 
The remaining undisputed material
facts relay the same facts as the Complaint: the parties entered into a series
of assignments, modifications and extensions regarding capital investments, the
Note and the Guarantee. (UMF 34-60.) As of June 2023, ECP owed $4,680,000 for
accrued but unpaid interest. (UMF 61, 69.) Since default, an additional
$2,160,000 of interest has accrued through September 30, 2024, and continues at
$4,438.36 per day since October 1, 2024. (Id.) ECP did not pay off these
amounts after its final monthly payment in June 2023. (UMF 62.) Eastside also
made no further distributions under the Assignment after its monthly June 2023
payment. (UMF 63.) ECP did not respond to the notice of default sent. (UMF
64-65.) Rosenfeld also did not respond to the Demand on Guaranty or made any
payments as obligated under the Guaranty. (UMF 66-68.) Plaintiff also claims
entitlement to attorneys’ fees and costs under the Guaranty. (UMF 70.)
 
Plaintiff makes a prima facie
showing for recovery on the Guarantee against Rosenfeld. Rosenfeld guaranteed
to pay the ECP Payment Obligations. The Guaranty required that Rosenfeld pay “the
full payment and performance of each and all of the ECP Payment Obligations pursuant
to the Note and the Assignment, and all modifications,
amendments, renewals and extensions of the Note and
Assignment… immediately on demand… in the event of any default of ECP (beyond
all applicable notice and/or cure periods) with respect to the Indebtedness or
any part thereof. (Second Amended and Restated Guaranty dated
June 20, 2014, p. 1-2.) The guarantee was material to the
overall transaction, as Plaintiff “would not have accepted the Note or
Assignment without the Guaranty” and that Rosenfeld was “required to execute
and deliver to [Plaintiff] this Guaranty” as a condition of [Plaintiff]
accepting the Note and Assignment. (UMF 39.) It is further undisputed that ECP
defaulted under the Note and Assignment by failing to pay the ECP Payment
Obligations, and that Rosenfeld failed to make payment on his Guarantee despite
a Notice of Default to ECP and a Demand on Guaranty to Rosenfeld. (UMF 64-67.)
 
Rosenfeld argues that the
transaction was usurious, because it attempts to charge above the maximum
interest rate limits set by Article XV, Section 1 of the California
Constitution and Civil Code §§ 1916 et seq. “[U]surious provisions of a loan
are void on the grounds of illegality or unlawfulness because they violate
express provisions of law.” (WRI Opportunity Loans II, LLC v. Cooper
(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 525, 542; see Epstein v. Frank (1981) 125 Cal.
App. 3d 111, 122-23 [“attempt to exact the usurious rate of interest renders
the interest provisions of a note void.... 
The usurious provisions, however, do not affect the right of the payee
to recover the principal amount of the note when due.”]; see also Jones v.
Wells Fargo Bank (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1527, 1535 [“‘[T]he usury law … is
riddled with so many exceptions that the law’s application itself seems to be
the exception rather than the rule.’”].) 
 
“The four essential elements of
usury include a loan or forbearance, interest exceeding the statutory maximum,
absolute repayability of loan and interest, and a lender with a ‘willful intent
to enter into a usurious transaction.’” (Creative Ventures, LLC v. Jim Ward
& Associates (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1430, 1449; see DCM Partners v.
Smith (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 729, 735 [“forbearance” within meaning of usury
law is “an agreement to extend the time for payment of the obligation due
either before or after the obligation's due date”].) “Without a loan or
forbearance, usury cannot exist.” (321 Henderson Receivables Origination LLC
v. Sioteco (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1059, 1076.) “A loan of money is a
contract by which one delivers a sum of money to another, and the latter agrees
to return at a future time a sum equivalent to that which he borrowed.” (Civ.
Code § 1912.)
 
“In usury cases the trier of fact
is vested with the power to resolve many issues attending and including the
ultimate question of whether a particular transaction is usurious.” (Stickel
v. Harris (1987) 196 Cal.App.3rd 575, 584.) For instance, whether a broker
"arranged" a nonusurious loan within the meaning of section 1916.1
was committed to the trier of fact. (Id.) On the question whether a
transaction constitutes a “loan” or “forbearance of money,” triers of fact must
look beyond the form of the transaction to ascertain its substance. (Ghirardo
v. Antonioli (1994) 8 Cal.4th 791, 798.) “In all such cases the issue is
whether or not the bargain of the parties, assessed in light of all the
circumstances and with a view to substance rather than form, has as its true
object the hire of money at an excessive rate of interest.” (Boerner v.
Colwell Co. (1978) 21 Cal.3d 37, 44.) 
 
In their opposition, Rosenfeld
presents evidence that the parties always intended the transactions as loans, albeit
thinly disguised by equity-like documentation. (Rosenfeld Decl. ¶¶ 5-6; Frye
Decl. ¶ 6 Exs. 18, 28.) The overall transaction in context could lead a
reasonable fact finder to conclude that the transactions had the ultimate true
object of hiring money at an 18% interest rate per annum. According to the
complaint and submitted evidence, Plaintiff delivered $9 million to ECP as a
supposed “contribution” which was subject to a fixed maturity date for the return
of the contribution plus monthly accruing interest. This fits neatly within
the above definitions of a loan for money. The record shows that the parties
entered numerous agreements by delaying the maturity date to pay back
the principal $9 million “contribution”—also fitting the definition of a
forbearance of a debt. The parties entered numerous agreements allowing for
reduced interest payments provided for in the Estoppel Certificate,
further evidencing an intent to take interest on a loan. Making all reasonable
inferences in favor of the non-moving Defendant, the UMFs and submitted
evidence demonstrates a dispute of fact as to whether the transaction
constituted a loan or forbearance. 
 
Plaintiff also challenges the
intent by citing its agent’s testimony and language within the Note disclaiming
any usury. However, the Note evinces an intent to take the usurious amount of
interest. This is willful intent for purposes of usury. (WRI Opportunity
Loans II, LLC v. Cooper (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 525, 533.) “ ‘[T]he intent
sufficient to support the judgment [of usury] does not require a conscious
attempt, with knowledge of the law, to evade it. The conscious and voluntary
taking of more than the legal rate of interest constitutes usury and the only
intent necessary on the part of the lender is to take the amount of interest
which he receives; if that amount is more than the law allows, the offense is
complete.’ ” (Id.) Simply put, there is no dispute that Plaintiff
charged (and collected) on the 18% interest rate.  
 
Plaintiff submits another factual
issue—that Defendant is estopped from maintaining a defense of usury. Estoppel
is a defense to a charge of usury. (Lakeview Meadows Ranch v. Bintliff
(1973) 36 Cal.App.3d 418, 424 [defense of estoppel applied to usury in an
action by a trustor under a deed of trust complaining that interest paid
pursuant to a modification agreement affecting the deed of trust was usurious,
where the evidence and allegations showed that the trustor's agent, a
California attorney, agreed to draft the agreement to provide for 9 percent
interest on the entire unpaid balance, that the trustor's agent knew that the
trustee wanted a legal and valid agreement and was under a duty to advise the
trustee if the agreement was considered to be usurious under California law,
and that the trustor's agent at no time suggested to the trustee that the
agreement was usurious].) Caselaw establishes that estoppel acts as a defense
where a borrower and lender are not in pari delicto in a usurious
transaction. (Teichner v. Klassman, (1966 2d Dist.) 240 Cal.App.2d 514,
523.) “ ‘[E]stoppel does not arise simply because the borrower knew of the
usurious nature of the transaction, took the initiative in seeking the loan,
and paid usurious interest without protest.’ ” (Id., quoting Janisse
v. Winston Inv. Co., (1957) 154 Cal. App. 2d 580, 587.) Indeed, the
equitable principles of estoppel generally require detrimental reliance and
ignorance of the true facts. (See Wells Fargo Bank v. Bank of America
(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 424, 437-38 [the defense of estoppel includes (1) the
party estopped must know the facts; (2) the party estopped must engage in
conduct intended to be acted upon by the party asserting estoppel; (3) the
party asserting estoppel must be ignorant of the true state of facts; and (4)
injury must result from reliance on the other's conduct].)[1] 
 
Here, a trier of fact could
reasonably infer from the record that Plaintiff was aware of the true facts of
the transaction, including the nature of the transaction as a loan of money for
a fixed interest rate. This is especially true considering the nature of the
transaction, as well as the parties express negotiations surrounding the
application of usury. As such, it would be reasonable to conclude on this
record that the parties were equally at-fault for the usurious interest. Thus,
there would be a dispute of fact as to the application of estoppel to the usury
defense. 
 
            Here, there
are multiple disputes of fact preventing the granting of Plaintiff’s summary
judgment motion. For instance, was the original agreement (the capital
contribution) a loan? Were the several extensions of the maturity date
forbearances? Did Plaintiff intend to charge a usurious interest rate? Was
Plaintiff ignorant of the true state of facts such that estoppel may apply to
the usury defense? These remaining questions of fact preclude summary judgment
on this action. Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
