  Case Number:  22STCV17335    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  39 Fred Hammonds v.
General Motors, LLC
Case No.
22STCV17335
Motion for Summary
Judgment
 
            The Court
grants Plaintiff’s counsel’s request for a stay of this case, pending the California
Supreme Court’s decision in Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 512 P.3d 654.  The California Supreme Court’s decision will
be dispositive; a stay would not pose undue delay; and a stay would operate in the
interests of judicial economy.  A stay
would not impose undue congestion on the Court’s calendar.  The Court has approximately 653 cases, and the
Court believes this case would only be the third case stayed pending a decision
in Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 512 P.3d 654.  Finally, the parties would not proceed to
trial on November 7, 2023, anyway.  The Court
has four other trials set on that date, each of which is older than the instant
case.  Therefore, the Court orders as
follows:
 
            1.         The Court advances and vacates all
dates.
 
            2.         The Court stays this case pending a
decision from the California Supreme Court in Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022)
512 P.3d 654.
 
            3.         The Court sets an Order to Show Cause why
the stay should not be lifted for March 25, 2023, at 8:30 a.m.  If the California Supreme Court issues a
decision sooner, the parties may file a stipulation and proposed order to lift the
stay and/or advance this OSC date. 
 
            4.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
