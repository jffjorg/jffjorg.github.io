And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to deny Weidong Zang's application for default judgment against Freevolt USA, Inc. without prejudice. The ruling is based on several defects in the application, including:

* The amount sought in court costs has changed from $500.00 to $555.00, exceeding the amount demanded in the complaint.
* The plaintiff's declaration lacks foundation and is not accompanied by any exhibits.
* The plaintiff seeks attorney's fees but has not provided a basis for the same.
* The application does not provide a full and complete default prove-up.

The Judge instructs the plaintiff to provide a full and complete default prove-up application and warns that the court will not entertain any piecemeal submissions. The case is set for an Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment on November 6, 2023.
