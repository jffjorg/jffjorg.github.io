And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The hearing on Counsel for Plaintiff Juvani Licea's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is continued to January 24, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. The court notes that no proof of service has been filed, despite counsel representing that the Client was mail-served with the motion. Counsel is requested to provide further authority permitting service in this fashion. The court has granted motions to be relieved as counsel in the past, provided there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. However, the court will not grant the motion until the service issues are resolved.
