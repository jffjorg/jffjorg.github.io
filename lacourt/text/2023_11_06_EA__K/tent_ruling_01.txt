  Case Number:  22PSCV01097    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2023    Dept:  K Plaintiff
Weidong Zang’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff Weidong Zang (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows:
On February 19, 2020, Plaintiff
and Defendant Freevolt USA, Inc. (“Defendant”) entered into a contract wherein
Defendant agreed to install a 25.5 KW solar photovoltaic system (85 solar
panels system) at Plaintiff’s property located at 14736 Valley Blvd., La
Puente, CA 91746 (“Project”) in exchange for payment. Defendant guaranteed to
complete the Project within 3 months, or would compensate Plaintiff's
electricity bills for any delays up to $2,000 per month. Plaintiff followed
Defendant’s directions and completed a loan application for $100,000 to cover
the expenses of the Project (“Loan”), and paid Defendant $2,000 as a deposit.
The loan was later approved, and Defendant received $90,000 from proceeds of
the loan (the remaining $10,000 of the loan proceeds was on hold for the reason
of incompletion of the Project). Plaintiff made payments for the Loan from
April of 2020-present. Defendant never started the Project after entering into
the contract.
On September 26, 2022, Plaintiff
filed a complaint, asserting a cause of action against Defendant and Does 1-25
for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
On January 30, 2023, Defendant’s
default was entered.
An Order to Show Cause Re: Default
Judgment is set for November 6, 2023.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Paragraph VII of the prayer in Plaintiff’s complaint
seeks “[c]ourt costs of $500.00.” Plaintiff, however, now seeks costs of
$555.00. In actions for money damages a default judgment is limited to the
amount demanded in the complaint. (See Greenup
v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 824.) The amount demanded in the complaint
is determined both from the prayer and from the damage allegations in the
complaint. (National Diversified
Services, Inc. v. Bernstein (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 410, 417-418).
2.                 
Plaintiff’s declaration is conclusory, lacks foundation
and is not accompanied by any exhibits whatsoever. Although Plaintiff’s
complaint filed September 26, 2022 (which attaches three exhibits, including a
FreeVolt Project Performance Guarantee dated March 24, 2020 with accompanying
Purchase and Installation Agreement, and an April 7, 2017 California Secretary
of State Articles of Incorporation of a General Stock Corporation for FreeVolt
USA, Inc. (Exh. A), a Newvision Credit Union Federal Disclosure Statement Note
and Security Agreement, Credit Application, an Annual Percentage Rate Reduction
Certificate No Direct Deposit, billing notices dated August 30, 2022 and April
29, 2020, Additional Disclosures and a Hold Harmless and Indemnification
Agreement (Exh. B), and a payment schedule titled “Solar Loan and Related
Expense 7/19/2022 (Exh. C)) was verified by counsel Peng Gao (“Gao”), said
verification does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure § 446 [i.e., “In all cases of a
verification of a pleading, the affidavit of the party shall state that the
same is true of his own knowledge, except as to the matters which are therein
stated on his or her information or belief, and as to those matters that he or
she believes it to be true; and where a pleading is verified, it shall be by
the affidavit of a party, unless the parties are absent from the county where
the attorney has his or her office, or from some cause unable to verify it, or
the facts are within the knowledge of his or her attorney or other person
verifying the same. When the pleading is verified by the attorney, or any
other person except one of the parties, he or she shall set forth in the
affidavit the reasons why it is not made by one of the parties. . . When
the verification is made by the attorney for the reason that the parties are
absent from the county where he or she has his or her office, or from some
other cause are unable to verify it, or when the verification is made on behalf
of a corporation or public agency by any officer thereof, the attorney's or
officer's affidavit shall state that he or she has read the pleading and that
he or she is informed and believes the matters therein to be true and on
that ground alleges that the matters stated therein are true. However, in
those cases the pleadings shall not otherwise be considered as an affidavit or
declaration establishing the facts therein alleged.” (Emphasis added).]
