And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the defendants' motion to tax costs is denied. The plaintiff is entitled to recover a total of $545.70 in costs from the defendants, jointly and severally. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff was seeking duplicative costs, but the judge finds that the two memoranda of costs reflect a single item to be paid jointly and severally. The defendants also failed to properly put the costs "at issue" in their motion to tax, and therefore the burden was not met to show that the costs were not reasonable or necessary.
