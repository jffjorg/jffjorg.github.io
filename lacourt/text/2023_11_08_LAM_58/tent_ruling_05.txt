conflict of laws inquiry must be made with respect to each issue in the case
....” (Washington Mutual Bank v. Superior Court (2001) 24 Cal.4th 906,
920 (Washington Mutual); accord, Kearney v. Salomon Smith Barney,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 95, 110 (Kearney) [“distinct state interests
... may underlie separate aspects of the issue in question”]; Smith v.
Cimmet (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1381, 1395 [the governmental interest
analysis must be performed separately “with regard to the particular issue in
question”]; Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Superior Court (1976) 61 Cal.App.3d
501, 518 [“Each choice of law issue requires separate consideration.”].) Here,
the operative pleading, the First Amended Complaint, alleges two causes of
action against Defendant Score-Mexico: (1.) negligence, and (2.) Negligent
Hiring, Supervision, and Retention. Defendant Score-Mexico and Plaintiff treat
these claims as substantively the same.
