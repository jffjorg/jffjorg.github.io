Case Name:                Rhee
v. Travelers Commercial Insurance Company   
Case No.:                    22STCV18275
Motion:                       Demurrer
and Motion to Strike
Moving Party:             Defendant Travelers Commercial Insurance Company

Opposing Party:          Unopposed

Tentative Ruling:      The
Demurrer to the Complaint is sustained in its entirety. Plaintiff shall have
leave to amend with respect to the first through fourth causes of action; with respect
to the fifth cause of action, leave to amend is limited to alleging the
injunctive relief as a remedy. The motion to strike is moot. 

             
            This case arises from an insurance
coverage dispute. The Complaint alleges that, on June 7, 2020, Plaintiff
Jonathan Rhee’s property was partially destroyed by a fire that started in the
garage of his residence located at 907 Larker Ave., Los Angeles, CA. At the
time of the fire, Plaintiff’s property was insured by Defendant Travelers
Commercial Insurance Company (Defendant). After the fire, Plaintiff was unable
to immediately locate the notarized deed showing ownership to the Property had
passed from Plaintiff’s mother to Plaintiff. As a result, Defendant has failed to
re-issue a check in Plaintiff’s name for a fire claim that was originally
issued to the estate of Plaintiff’s mother. On June 3, 2022, Plaintiff,
individual and as successor in interest to the estate of Changsil Rhee, filed a
Complaint for (1.) breach of contract, (2.) breach of covenant of good faith
and fair dealing, (3.) unfair business practices, (4.) declaratory relief, and
(5) injunctive relief.  
 
            On June 20, 2022, Defendant demurred
to the entire Complaint. Defendant also moved to strike the request for
punitive damages from the Complaint. No opposition was filed. 
 
            The Court sustains the demurrer in
its entirety with leave to amend. The motion to strike is moot. 
 
Demurrer
 
            A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency
of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose
of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The
court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . ..” ’
” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  
 
Analysis 
 
First Cause of Action: 
 
To prevail on a breach
of contract cause of action, a plaintiff must prove: (1) the existence of a
contract; (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3)
defendant's breach; and (4) resulting damages to plaintiff. (Careau &
Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371,
1388.)
 
            Here,
Plaintiff alleges Defendant provided an insurance policy that covered the
damage to his Property from a fire. However, the Complaint does not allege who
was a party to this insurance contract at issue; as such, it is unclear from
the allegation whether a contract exists between Plaintiff and Defendants. 
 
            Moreover,
although the terms of a contract need not be alleged verbatim or attached, a
plaintiff must “plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise
language.” (Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 394, 402.) Plaintiff has failed to plead the material terms of the
contract; thus, the precise basis for the breach is unclear where the terms of
the contract are not pled.
 
            The
demurrer to this cause of action is sustained.[1]
 
Second Cause of Action:
 
            Defendant
argues the second cause of action must fail for the same reasons as the first
cause of action.
 
            “The
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing rests upon the existence of
some specific contractual obligation.” (Racine & Laramie, Ltd. v.
Department of Parks & Recreation (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1026, 1031.) “The
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, implied by law in every contract,
exists merely to prevent one contracting party from unfairly frustrating the
other party's right to receive the benefits of the agreement actually made.
[Citation.]” (Guz v.. Bechtel National, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317,
349.)
 
Thus, in the absence of adequate allegations
of the existence of a contract between the parties and its terms, this claim
cannot withstand the demurrer. The demurrer is sustained. 
 
Third and Fourth Causes of Action:
 
The third cause of action for unfair
business practices pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 17200 and
the declaratory relief claims are entirely derivative of Plaintiff’s other
claims.
 
A claim for declaratory relief fails
when it is “ ‘ “wholly derivative” of other failed claims.’ ” (Smyth v.
Berman (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 183, 191-192 [quoting Ball v. FleetBoston
Financial Corp. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 794, 800].) Here, Plaintiff’s claim
for declaratory relief fails as dependent on and derivative of Plaintiff’s defective
contract claims. (Compl., ¶¶ 34-41.) 
 
With respect to the fourth cause of
action, the UCL does not proscribe specific activities, but in relevant part
broadly prohibits “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200.) “Because . . . section 17200 is
written in the disjunctive, it establishes three varieties of unfair
competition—acts or practices which are unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent. In
other words, a practice is prohibited as ‘unfair’ or ‘deceptive’ even if not
‘unlawful’ and vice versa.” (Aleksick v. 7-Eleven, Inc. (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 1176, 1184 [citing Cel–Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles
Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 180].)
            “[W]hen
the underlying legal claim fails, so too will a derivative UCL claim.” (AMN
Healthcare, Inc. v. Aya Healthcare Services, Inc. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th
923, 950.) Here, Plaintiff’s Section 17200 claim fails as dependent on and
derivative of Plaintiff’s defective contract claims. (Compl., ¶¶ 27-33.)
 
            The
demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action are sustained. 
 
Fifth Cause of Action:
 
Defendant argues the claim for injunctive relief under Section
17200 is a remedy, not a cause of action. This argument is correct.  
 
            It is well settled
that injunctive relief is an equitable remedy, not a cause of action. (Shell
Oil Co. v. Richter (1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 164, 168 [“Injunctive relief is a
remedy and not, in itself, a cause of action, and a cause of action must exist
before injunctive relief may be granted.”]; Venice Coalition to Preserve
Unique Community Character v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 42,
54 [“An injunction is a remedy, not a cause of action.”]; Wong v. Jing
(2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1354, 1360, fn. 2 [same; anti-SLAPP appeal].) 
 
Thus, the demurrer to this cause of
action is sustained.
 
Conclusion
 
            The demurrer is sustained in its entirety.
Plaintiff shall have leave to amend with respect to the first through fourth
causes of action; with respect to the fifth cause of action, leave to amend is
limited to alleging the injunctive relief as a remedy. An amended complaint
shall be filed and served by December 8, 2023.
