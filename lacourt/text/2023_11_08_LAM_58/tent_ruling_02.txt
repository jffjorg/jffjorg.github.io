Date:             November 8, 2023
Case
Name:                Maria Barajas
Quintero v. KIA Motor America, Inc.
Case
No.:                    19STCV13263 
Matter:                        Motion to Strike and/or
Tax Costs
Moving
Party:             Defendant KIA Motor
America, Inc.
Responding
Party:      Plaintiffs Maria Barajas
Quintero and Oscar Quintero

Tentative
Ruling:      The Motion to Tax Costs is granted
in part. 

 
The parties have settled this Song-Beverly matter pursuant
to a Code of Civil Procedure section 998 Offer to Compromise in the amount of
$109,000. The parties were, however, unable to reach an agreement as to the
amount of reasonable attorney fees or costs – thereby necessitating a motion
for attorney fees and this motion to tax costs. 
 
            By way of background to this
litigation, Plaintiffs purchased a new 2016 Kia Optima (Vehicle); the Vehicle
was manufactured and distributed by Kia Motors America, Inc. (Defendant), which
provided an express written warranty, and was serviced by KIA authorized repair
facilities. After experiencing numerous issues related to the Vehicle’s
suspension and engine, undergoing numerous repair attempts, and seeking a
vehicle buyback—Plaintiffs filed this action on April 17, 2019 against
Defendant KIA alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act and fraud.  
 
            On February 10, 2023, Defendant Kia
served a 998 Offer for $109,000.00, which was $5,293.07 less than Plaintiffs’
earlier November 7, 2022 998 offer. Plaintiff accepted Defendant KIA’s 998
offer on February 13, 2023. The Settlement included a full statutory “buyback”
of Plaintiffs’ defective vehicle, incidental and consequential damages and
civil penalties for the Vehicle. 
 
Plaintiff Maria Barajas Quintero and
Oscar Quintero (Plaintiffs) now argues that as the prevailing party, they
entitled to fees and costs under Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d). 
 
Plaintiffs moved for an order awarding attorneys’ fees under
the lodestar method in the amount of $212,453. They
also requested an enhancement of 1.5, in the amount of $106,226.50, and costs
of $30,916.14. The total requested was $349,595.64. The Court granted the
motion for attorneys’ fees in the reduced amount of $202,953. The Court
deferred a ruling on costs until the hearing on the motion to tax costs. 
 
On June 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum of costs
seeking costs in the amount of $30,916.14. Defendant Kia now moves to strike or tax Plaintiffs’ memorandum of costs.
Plaintiffs oppose the motion.
 
            The
motion to tax costs is granted in part. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            The “prevailing party” is entitled
to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1032, subd. (b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606.)
“Prevailing party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant
in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor
defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who
do not recover any relief against that defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032,
subd. (a)(4).)
 
            Recoverable costs “shall be
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(c)(2).) “If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges,
the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not
reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993)
19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) Verification of the memorandum of costs by the
prevailing party’s attorney establishes a prima facie showing that the claimed
costs are proper.¿(See Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258,
1267 [“There is no requirement that copies of bills, invoices, statements, or
any other such documents be attached to the memorandum.”].) Mere conclusory
assertions are insufficient to rebut a prima facie showing by the prevailing
party. (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256,
266.)  “On the other hand, if the items
are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on
the party claiming them as costs. [Citations.] Whether a cost item was reasonably
necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and
its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.” (Ladas, supra, 19
Cal.App.4th at p. 774.) 
 
Discussion
 
            Defendant
Kia moves for an order that Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Costs be
stricken, or the costs claimed should be taxed, in the sum of $20,958.99. 
 
Item No. 1 – Filling Fees: 
 
Defendant Kia moves to strike $250.35
in filing fees for unsuccessful and unnecessary motions. Defendant argues that the
costs for these motions – a Motion to compel further document productions by Kia;
a Motion to compel a further deposition of Kia’s person most knowledgeable; and
a Motion for reconsideration of the Court’s Order granting Kia’s Motion for
summary adjudication of Plaintiffs’ fraud causes of action and punitive damages
claim – did nothing to advance litigation.  
 
As a preliminary matter,
Section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(1) makes expressly allowable as costs filing and motion
fees. However, even as to costs otherwise allowable as a matter of right,
the trial court retains authority to determine whether the costs were
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and whether the amounts
are reasonable. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c); Perko's
Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244–245.) 
Nonetheless, proof
that a party was unsuccessful on a particular motion is not tantamount to a
demonstration that the costs incurred were not reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation. (Michell v. Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194,
1200.) 
 
In
response, Plaintiffs assert that both of Plaintiffs’ motions to compel were
ultimately granted at least in part, the motion for reconsideration was brought
in good faith.  
 
Based on
the foregoing, Defendant have failed to demonstrate that the costs were not
reasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation. Defendant does not
address these costs in reply. The request to strike these costs is denied. 


Item No 4 – Deposition Costs and
Item No. 5 – Service of Process Costs:
 
Defendant Kia moves to strike
$12,595.04 in deposition costs. Relatedly, Defendant also moves to strike
$525.78 in service of process costs of certain deposition subpoenas.
 
Defendant argues that, given the relevant
issues in a lemon law case – whether the problem afflicting the plaintiffs’
vehicle persisted after a reasonable number of attempts to correct it – there
was no reason to incur the cost of taking any depositions other than the
depositions of the Plaintiffs ($606.60 and $394.75), one deposition of Kia’s
person most knowledgeable ($857.35), a deposition of the person most
knowledgeable of Kia of Cerritos $483.25), and the deposition of Kia’s expert,
Vince Petrangelo ($300.00). Thus, the corresponding costs for service of
process for these deposition subpoenas in the amount of $525.78 was also
unreasonable and unnecessary. Aside from this general assertion, Defendant does
not make any particularized showing that the deposition costs (and the related
service costs) incurred were unnecessary or unreasonable. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs assert
that these depositions “were necessary to obtain relevant information about
Plaintiffs’ vehicle’s repair history, to authenticate and explain the records,
and to determine if these witnesses had independent recollection of facts
concerning the case.” (Opp. 8:27-9:1.) Plaintiffs also argue that dealership
personnel depositions are important because, generally, defendants never agree
“to the admissibility of the repair orders into evidence at trial so Plaintiffs
must be prepared to proffer the dealership personnel testimony at trial to lay
the requisite foundation to get the repair orders admitted into evidence.”
(Opp. 9:1-5.) 
 
Based on
the foregoing, Defendant have failed to demonstrate that the costs were not
reasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation. The request to strike these
costs is denied
 
Item No. 8b – Expert Costs: 
 
Defendant moves to strike
$6,483.74 for expert witness fees. Defendant argues that a plaintiff in a Lemon
Law case does not need to present expert testimony. (Oregel v. American
Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1102 fn. 8 [“It is
within the realm of common knowledge that a new car with an unremediable oil
leak does not conform to its warranty, and no expert testimony is necessary to
establish this proposition.”].)
 
Defendant’s argument is unpersuasive. Costs for reasonable expert
fees are properly awarded to the prevailing party under the Song Beverly Act. (Jensen
v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137-138; Civil
Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) Thus, Defendant’s conclusory argument that expert
witness fees are unnecessary in this type of litigation is insufficient to meet
Defendant’s burden on this motion. 
 
Defendant also argues that
Plaintiffs’ claim for $6,483.74 in expert fees, supposedly based on 30.15 hours
of unspecified services at unspecified, varying rates, is unreasonable,
unsubstantiated and excessive.  Further,
Kia contends, Plaintiffs have not provided any documentation to support the fee.

 
In opposition, Plaintiffs submit
the invoices of their expert, Thomas Lepper. (Devabose Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. B.) Plaintiffs
contend Lepper’s assistance was important in determining the subject vehicle’s
defects. Additionally, testimony about Plaintiffs’ vehicle, the existence of
defects, determining what Defendant knew about the defects inherent in the
subject vehicle, when Kia obtained this knowledge, and how Kia ultimately chose
to respond (or fail to respond) to it, were all pivotal to the claims advanced
by Plaintiffs and would have been testimony that Lepper was to provide.
 
Thus, the expert fees were
necessary to the litigation and the Court declines to strike the costs in their
entirety. However, some of the invoice entries reflected clerical, duplicative
or unnecessary tasks. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ expert costs will be reduced by
$1,100. 
 
Item No. 12 – Court Reporter Fees:
 
Defendant moves to strike $5,614.75
for court reporter fees. Defendant notes that under the Los Angeles Superior
Court fee schedule, court reporters receive $764.00 for proceedings over 4
hours; $382.00 for proceedings between 1 and 4 hours; and a per diem of $30.00
for proceedings under 1 hour. Notwithstanding this reasonable pay scale,
Plaintiffs’ claims court reporter fees in excess of this amount. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs’
counsel provides their internal spreadsheet delineating these court reporter costs
along with supporting invoices. (Devabose Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. A, E.) Plaintiffs
also represent that Defendant stipulated to the use of these court reporters,
undermining Defendant’s claim now that these services were unreasonable or
unnecessary. 
 
Defendant does not
address these costs in reply. The request to strike these costs is denied. 
 
Item No. 13 – Other:
 
Defendant moves to strike $1,104.08
for attorney services and messengers, appearance attorneys and travel. Defendant
argues these costs are not allowed under Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5. (Mot., 5:5-11 [citing Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)(3) [postage,
telephone and photocopying charges not allowable]; Ripley v. Pappadopoulos
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1616, 1627 [Federal Express expenses not allowed]; Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 132 [messenger fees not allowed]; Ladas
v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 775-76 [“Routine
expenses for local travel by attorneys or other firm employees are not reasonably
necessary to the conduct of litigation.”].)
 
Although costs for
courier or messenger fees are not specifically enumerated as allowable costs in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a), they are also not prohibited
by Section 1033.5, subdivision (b).  Thus,
messenger fees may be recoverable in a trial court’s discretion if reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5(c)(2). Further, in Jensen
v. BMW of North America, Inc.
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, the court explained: “Section 1794, subdivision (d),
permits the prevailing buyer to recover both ‘costs’ and ‘expenses.’” (Jensen
v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal. App. 4th at 137.) “[I]t is
clear the Legislature intended the word ‘expenses’ to cover items not included
in the detailed statutory definition of ‘costs’.” (Ibid. [emphasis added].) 
 
In Ladas v. California State Automobile Association,
a messenger fees award was upheld because sufficient evidence indicated they
“were related to trial preparation, and were incurred for such matters as
filing documents with the court, complying with appellants’ document demands,
and transporting exhibits to and from the courtroom.” (Ladas v. California
State Automobile Association (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 776.) These costs
appear reasonable and necessary to the litigation. 
 
Plaintiffs, in response, also submit a spreadsheet that show
the costs incurred for appearance-attorney costs. (Devabose Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. A.)
The Court notes that these costs are significantly lower than Plaintiffs’
counsel’s attorney fees, rendering them reasonable to litigation. 
 
Finally, with respect to travel costs, such costs are not
expressly prohibited by Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5. Nor are recoverable travel expenses limited
to deposition travel by attorneys who practice in the court's jurisdiction. (Thon
v. Thompson (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1546, 1548.) Nonetheless, having
raised the reasonableness of these costs, Plaintiffs did not satisfy their
burden of showing that the parking and travel costs not
identified as being within those two categories of costs related to local
travel and parking for depositions or non-local travel were “reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient ....”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(c)(2).) Thus, the motion to strike is granted as to these costs in the amount
of $119.45. 
 
Conclusion


The motion to tax costs is granted
in the total amount of $1,219.45 ($1,100 + $119.45). Plaintiffs also request
attorney fees in the amount of
$2,125.00 for opposing this motion. (Devabose Decl., ¶ 12.) The request for these
fees is granted.  
 
Defendant is ordered to pay to Plaintiff’s counsel, for
costs of suit the sum of $29,696.69    ($30,916.14
- $1,219.45), and for attorney fees for the motion the sum of $2,125, on or
before December 15, 2023.
