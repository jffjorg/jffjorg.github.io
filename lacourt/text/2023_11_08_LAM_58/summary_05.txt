And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling highlights the importance of a separate conflict of laws inquiry for each issue in the case. The ruling cites several California Supreme Court and Appellate Court cases that emphasize the need for a distinct analysis of state interests underlying each issue. The case involves a First Amended Complaint filed by a plaintiff against Score-Mexico, alleging two causes of action: negligence and Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention. The defendant and the plaintiff treat these claims as substantively the same. The judge's ruling suggests that a separate conflict of laws inquiry will be necessary to address each of these claims individually.
