And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has sustained the Demurrer filed by the Defendants, Victor Martinez & Associates, Inc., Victor Martinez, Mario Rivera Esparza, Stephanie Rivera Esparza, and Michael Esparza, without leave to amend. The Demurrer was filed against the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by the Plaintiff, Frank Cockrell. The Court finds that the SAC is unclear and uncertain, as it mixes Frank's own interests with those of others, lacks coherence, and contains conclusory allegations. The Court also finds that the SAC is ambiguous and uncertain, making it difficult for the Defendants to respond. The Plaintiff's response to the Demurrer did not address the deficiencies in the SAC and instead repeated the allegations. The Court has previously sustained a Demurrer with leave to amend and struck several plaintiffs from the Complaint. The Plaintiff has filed three amended Complaints, but the Court finds that the Complaint remains unclear and uncertain. The Court does not allow leave to amend and instead sustains the Demurrer without leave to amend.
