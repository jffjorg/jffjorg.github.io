And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled on two motions filed by the defendants, Scott Fishback and Antelope Valley Schools Transportation Agency. The first motion is to compel further responses to special interrogatories from the plaintiff, Ashley Cabrera, regarding her use of Accutane, a medication with known side effects. The Judge grants this motion, finding that the information is relevant to the case and necessary to evaluate the plaintiff's injury claims.

The second motion is to compel the plaintiff to complete a defense medical examination by Joshua Prager, M.D., M.S. The Judge grants this motion, finding that the examination is necessary to determine the plaintiff's medical history and prescription usage, which may be relevant to the case. However, the Judge orders that the examination be conducted with an attorney present and that the scope of the examination be determined at the hearing.

The Judge also grants the defendants' request for judicial notice of FDA warning labels and other related documents regarding Accutane. The Judge finds that the defendants have shown a compelling public interest in the information and that it is necessary to facilitate the ascertainment of truth in connection with the legal proceedings.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling is in favor of the defendants, requiring the plaintiff to provide further information and to undergo a medical examination.
