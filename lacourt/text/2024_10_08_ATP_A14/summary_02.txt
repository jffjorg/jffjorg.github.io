And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Motion to Quash filed by the defendants. The defendants had moved to quash the service of the summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over them. However, the court believes that the defendants have waived this argument because they did not bring it up at the time of filing their demurrer or motion to strike the complaint. The court also struck the defendants' document titled "Response to Application for Default Judgment" as a pleading because it was not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of the state. The court notes that the plaintiffs' default judgment was denied on July 5, 2024, and that the complaint does not include an amount for damages. The court also points out that the defendants' attempts to rectify this via the filing of statements of damages were unsuccessful because the statements were filed too late and were not used for the purposes contemplated by the relevant statutes.
