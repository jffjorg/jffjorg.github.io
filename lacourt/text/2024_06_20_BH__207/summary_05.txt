Significant Statements:
- "In summary, "[determining whether the complaint is sufficient as against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if on consideration of all the facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged." (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)"
- "In the event of the death of the patient while under the care of the doctor and the hospital, the spouse has a right to know the cause of death. Withholding information would in a sense amount to misrepresentation. See Stafford v. Shultz, 42 Cal.2d 767 [270 P.2d 1], for a full discussion of the requirement that a physician make full and fair disclosure of all facts which materially affect the patient's rights and interests, and of the fact that because of the relationship between the doctor and the patient the patient is entitled to rely on the doctor's assurances and that " 'facts which would ordinarily require investigation may not excite suspicion, and that the same degree of diligence is not required'" (Wohlgemuth v. Meyer, supra, 139 Cal.App.2d at p. 331.)

And here is a summary in English text:

The plaintiff, Galia Kesheshian, filed a complaint against the defendants, Ashkan Ghavami, Ashkan Ghavami, M.D., Inc., Plastic and Aesthetic Reconstructive Surgery, and Ghavami Plastic Surgery. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court rejected the demurrer, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleged breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The court also rejected the defendants' arguments that the plaintiff's allegations were conclusory and did not provide specific facts supporting each element of the causes of action.
