And here is the English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the motion filed by Counsel, Bruce D. Rudman, Esq., to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Mohamed Hadid, Treetop Development, LLC, and Tree Lane, LLC. The motion is unopposed. Counsel has filed the required forms, including the attorney declaration, which states that there has been an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship due to a breach of the attorney-client agreement and an inability to effectively interface and communicate with the client. The Court finds that the motion is procedurally and substantively proper. Therefore, the Court grants the motion and orders Counsel to serve the signed order on the clients and parties, and to file a proof of service within 10 days of the date of this Order.
