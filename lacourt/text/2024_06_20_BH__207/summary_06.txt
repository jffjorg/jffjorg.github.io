Here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is about a court hearing on a demurrer to a complaint filed by PS & RS LLC against Pico Youth and Family Center. The complaint is an unlawful detainer complaint, seeking to recover rent owed. The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the three-day notice to quit is legally deficient. The court notes that the hearing date was rescheduled without court approval, which is a violation of the court's standing orders. The court overrules the demurrer and orders the defendant to file and serve an answer to the complaint by July 5, 2024. The court finds that the notice is not legally uncertain and that the defendant was put on notice of the landlord's intention to repossess the premises.
