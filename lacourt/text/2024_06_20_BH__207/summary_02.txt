And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion filed by Bruce D. Rudman, Esq., counsel for Defendant Treetop Development, LLC, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was unopposed. The judge finds that the motion complies with the procedural requirements set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and the substantive requirements set forth in Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16. The judge concludes that the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, including the inability to effectively interface and communicate with the client, supports the motion for attorney withdrawal from representation. The judge orders that counsel must serve the signed order on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the action, and file a proof of service of such, within 10 days of the date of this Order.
