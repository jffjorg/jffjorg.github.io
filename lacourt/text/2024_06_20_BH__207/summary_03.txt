And here is the English summary:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling on a petition for confirmation of a Labor Commissioner’s award in favor of Petitioners Innovative Artists Broadcast Division, LLC and Innovative Artists Talent and Literacy Agency, Inc. against Respondent Andrea Tantaros. The petition seeks to confirm an award of $88,881.40 and an accounting. The Judge denied the petition because Petitioners did not demonstrate that Respondent was properly served with the petition, and also because the petition seeks an accounting which is not part of the current iteration of the award issued by the Labor Commissioner. The Judge offered an alternative solution, granting the petition if Petitioners forego the request for an accounting. The ruling was issued on June 20, 2024.
