This tentative ruling sets forth the court's thinking on the upcoming hearing date of March 12, 2024. The court notes that if the parties wish to retain jurisdiction to enforce their settlement, they must file a stipulation and proposed order signed by all parties, complying with Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, prior to dismissal. The court continues the order to show cause (OSC) re dismissal to May 2, 2024 at 8:30 am, with no further continuances allowed. If the parties have not filed the stipulation and proposed order by then, the plaintiff's counsel is ordered to appear and explain why it has not been filed. The plaintiff is required to give notice and file proof of service of this order.
