The tentative ruling of the Judge states that the Plaintiff's Counsel has failed to file proof of service of the Summons and Complaint for all defendants, including James Name, Real Sky Inc., Sam Woo Corp., Ki Ho Sung, and Byung Chul Choi. As a result, the Judge has ordered the Plaintiff's Counsel to appear at an OSC hearing on April 30, 2024, to explain why sanctions, including monetary sanctions of at least $500 and/or dismissal, should not be imposed for failure to file proof of service. The Judge has also ordered the Plaintiff's Counsel to file a declaration explaining the failure to file proofs of service and any efforts undertaken to attempt service of the summons and complaint on all named defendants. If proof of service is not filed by the next hearing, the Judge will consider dismissing the entire case.
