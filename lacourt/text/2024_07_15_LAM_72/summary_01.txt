```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge continues the plaintiff's request for default judgment, but requires additional evidence to support the damages claimed. The plaintiff must provide competent evidence of the damages owed, rather than simply stating the amount demanded in the complaint. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for "Misc." costs in the amount of $279.50, as it is not an item of costs made expressly allowable by statute. Additionally, the judge notes that the plaintiff's request for costs may include attorney's fees, which are not generally allowable as costs unless authorized by contract, statute, or law. The judge will likely require revisions to the proposed form of judgment.
