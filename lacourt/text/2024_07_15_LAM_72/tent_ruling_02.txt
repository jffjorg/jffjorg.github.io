 Hearing Date:  January 15, 2024
 Calendar Number:  4



 
 
 
 
Plaintiff TP I Investment, LLC (“Plaintiff”) seeks default
judgment against Defendant Freevolt USA, Inc. (“Defendant”) on Plaintiff’s
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).
 
Plaintiff proposes a judgment of $329,444.30, consisting of:
 
(1)  
damages in the amount of $292,077.10;
 
(2)  
interest in the amount of $36,797.20; and
 
(3) costs of suit in the amount of $570.00.
 
The Court CONTINUES the hearing on default judgment so that
Plaintiff can file a mandatory Form CIV-100 seeking default judgment as
required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800. Plaintiff need not re-file
the other papers in its default judgment packet unless it wishes to make
changes to them. The Court also notes that Plaintiff will have to adjust its
damages (and likely its interest as a result) because Plaintiff requests
damages in excess of the demand of the FAC for $250,000.00.
 
Background
 
            This
is a contract case. On April 26, 2021, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a
written agreement (the “Agreement”) for Defendant to install a solar panel
system at Plaintiff’s property. The solar panel was still not operational as of
November 3, 2023.
 
The Agreement provided that if the solar panel system was
not operating by September 25, 2021, Defendant would pay Phuc Thien Phan, the
Managing Member of Plaintiff, a sum of $30,000.00. (Phan Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. A at
p. 1.) In addition, Defendant would pay Mr. Phan’s electric bill for the meter
connected to solar for each month that the system was not operational from
September 25, 2021 until the system is fully operational with permission to
operate from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (“LADWP”). (Phan
Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. A at p. 1.)
 
            Defendant
has not made the foregoing payments.
 
            Plaintiff
filed this action on June 6, 2023.
 
Default was entered  against
Defendant on September 6, 2023. Plaintiff filed an application for default
judgment on November 15, 2023. On December 18, 2023, the Court continued the
hearing on default judgment because Phan, who is not a party, and not
Plaintiff, was the real party in interest.
 
On January 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Declaration of Phuc
Thien Phan indicating that Phan had assigned his rights to receive payments for
his electricity bill and to sue on the nonpayment thereof to Plaintiff.
However, Plaintiff had not amended the Complaint to allege the assignment. On
January 25, 2024, the Court denied the request for default judgment because
“one suing as an assignee must allege and prove the assignment to recover on
the assigned claim.” (Emerald Bay Community Assn. v. Golden Eagle Ins. Corp.
(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1078, 1091.)
 
Plaintiff filed the FAC on January 30, 2024. Plaintiff
served the FAC on March 13, 2024 and filed a proof of service on April 29,
2024. Default was entered against Defendant on the FAC on May 9, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7);
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the complaint
or cross-complaint.  (Molen v.
Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief. “[W]hen recovering damages in a default judgment, the
plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint.” (Kim v.
Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 286.)         
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff has not filed a mandatory Form CIV-100 seeking
default judgment as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.
Although Plaintiff filed a Form CIV-100 on May 9, 2024 seeking and obtaining
default, Plaintiff must also file a CIV-100 for the default judgment request.
The Court cannot grant default judgment in the absence of this form. 
 
The Court therefore continues the hearing on default
judgment so that Plaintiff can file a Form CIV-100 seeking a court judgment.
 
Moreover, the damages in the default judgment cannot exceed
the request for damages in the First Amended Complaint.  The First Amended Complaint seeks damages for
$250,000, not the $292,077.10 requested in the judgment.  The amount of damages, and the resulting
interest calculation, will need to be adjusted.
