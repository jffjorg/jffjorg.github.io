Plaintiff Bedford Law Group, APC (“Plaintiff”) seeks default
judgment against Defendant Alberto Sanchez (“Defendant”) on Plaintiff’s First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”).
 
Plaintiff requests:
 
(1) money judgment in the amount of $18,652.35, consisting
of:
 
(a) damages in the amount of $15,000.00;

 
(b) interest in the amount of $1,717.81;
and
 
(c) costs in the
amount of $1,934.54.
 
The Court CONTINUES Plaintiff’s request for default judgment.
Plaintiff must provide competent evidence of its damages. Plaintiff must remove
its request for “Misc.” costs in the amount of $279.50, which the Court DENIES.
 
Background
 
This is an action for the recovery of attorney’s fees.
 
Plaintiff is a law firm. On October 6, 2015, Defendant
executed a written fee agreement (the “Agreement”) pursuant to which Defendant
retained Plaintiff to represent Defendant in connection with Defendant’s claims
resulting from a 2015 motor vehicle incident. Pursuant to the Agreement,
Defendant agreed to pay attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses that Plaintiff
incurred on Defendant’s behalf in connection with the representation.
 
Plaintiff performed legal services for Defendant from
October 6, 2015 to November 30, 2016. On November 30, 2016, the Law Offices of
Guy Frank Candelaria substituted in as Defendant’s counsel for the
representation in question.
 
On December 12, 2019, Defendant settled his claims arising
from the motor vehicle incident. Defendant failed to pay Plaintiff's attorney’s
fees, costs, and expenses under the Agreement. Neither Defendant nor the Law
Officers of Guy Frank Candelaria have paid any of the amounts owed to
Plaintiff.
 
Plaintiff and Shawn B. Azizzadeh filed this case on October
23, 2020. The First Amended Complaint is now the operative complaint. Azzizadeh
was removed as a plaintiff as of the FAC. The FAC raises claims for (1) breach
of contract; (2) quantum meruit; and (3) accounting.
 
Default was entered against Defendant on December 18, 2023.
 
Plaintiff filed an application for default judgment on
February 1, 2024. The Court continued the request
because (1) Plaintiff did not provide competent evidence of its damages; (2)
Plaintiff sought interest that was not demanded in the complaint; and (3)
Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs included an item in the amount of $279.50 labeled
“Attorney Appearance” that should have been requested as attorney’s fees.

 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7));
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief requested
(Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
(California Rules of Court rule
3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (Molen
v. Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief.
             
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
            Pursuant
to the Court’s July 21, 2022 order, Plaintiff served Defendant by publication
in La Opinión on November 13, 20, and 27, 2023.
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
The Doe defendants were dismissed from the action on February
6, 2024, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request.
 
Non-Military Status
 
Vahan Gabrielyan avers to Defendant’s non-military status.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in the
Declaration of Vahan Gabrielyan. Plaintiff adequately pleads its causes of
action in FAC.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 580 prohibits the entry of
a default judgment in an amount in excess of that demanded in the complaint.”  (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 286.) Moreover, “a statement of damages cannot be relied
upon to establish a plaintiff's monetary damages, except in cases of personal
injury or wrongful death.” (Ibid.) “In all other cases, when recovering
damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages
specified in the complaint.” (Ibid.) 
Moreover, there is a need for admissible evidence supporting a prima
facie case for the damages or other relief requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362
 
            The
Court previously continued Plaintiff’s application for default judgment because
Plaintiff did not provide evidence proving the amount of damages owed.
Plaintiff must provide competent evidence proving up its damages. Plaintiff has
not cured this defect. 
 
Vahan Gabrielyan attaches the underlying fee agreement in
his declaration. (Gabrielyan Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. A.) Gabrielyan declares that
Defendant agreed to pay 33.3% any pre-complaint recovery and 40% of any
recovery once a complaint was filed in court or arbitration. (Gabrielyan Decl.
¶ 3.) Gabrielyan provides a copy of the letter by which Plaintiff was substituted
out as counsel for Defendant. (Gabrielyan Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. B.) Gabrielyan states
that Defendant breached the fee agreement by failing to pay Plaintiff’s
attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses under the fee agreement. (Gabrielyan Decl.
¶ 6.) 
 
Critically, however, Gabrielyan does not make a declaration
as to the actual amount that Defendant owes Plaintiff under the fee agreement.
Gabrielyan only states that the demand of the Complaint is $15,000.00.
(Gabrielyan Decl. ¶ 18.) The damages pled are not evidence of the damages owed
– a plaintiff must in fact show a prima facie case for the amount of damages
that the plaintiff is entitled to. (Johnson
v. Stanhiser, supra, 72 Cal.App.4th at pp. 361-362.) 
 
As the Court stated in its previous order, Plaintiff must
provide evidence supporting its damages.
 
 
Interest
 
Plaintiff does not seek interest.
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
When Plaintiff previously sought default judgment, it
requested $1,934.54 in costs, $279.50 of which was for an “Attorney
Appearance.” The Court continued the hearing on Plaintiff’s application because
attorney’s fees are not generally allowable as costs unless authorized by
contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)
 
Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs, signed by Vahan Gabrielyan,
states that Plaintiff expended $1,934.54 in costs, the same amount as in
Plaintiff’s previous request. $279.50 of this amount labelled as “Misc.” This
is not an item of costs made expressly allowable by statute. (Code Civ. Proc, §
1033.5, subd. (a).) The Court therefore has discretion to allow or deny it.
(Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4).) The Court exercises its discretion to
deny this cost. The Court further notes that there is a strong appearance that
Plaintiff has improperly sought to include its attorney’s fees in its request
for costs, and that this would form a sufficient alternate basis for the
Court’s denial of this item of costs.
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
            Plaintiff
has submitted a proposed form of judgment, but it will likely require revisions
for the reasons stated above.
 
 
Submission of the Written Agreement
 
            California
Rule of Court 3.1806 states that “unless otherwise ordered” judgment upon a
written obligation to pay money requires a clerk’s note across the face of the
writing that there has been a judgment. Here, Plaintiff has not submitted the
original documents. The Court does not discern any practical need for such a
clerk’s note on the written obligation in the current case and therefore orders
that it need not be included. If this causes any issues for any party or
non-party they are authorized to bring the matter to the Court’s
attention.
