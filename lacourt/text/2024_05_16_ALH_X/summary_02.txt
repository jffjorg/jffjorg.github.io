And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Zhiwei Chen's motion to vacate the Court's November 7, 2023 ruling, which granted Defendant Verizon Wireless Services, LLC's motion to compel arbitration. The Plaintiff alleges that Defendant used technical means to take control of his phone and forged his signature. The Plaintiff claims to have found new evidence in his account, but the Court finds that the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate reasonable diligence in presenting this new evidence. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff's motion is untimely, as he did not file the motion within the 10-day period allowed by law. The Court recognizes that the Plaintiff is representing himself in pro per, but holds him to the same standard as attorneys. The Plaintiff's motion to vacate is denied.
