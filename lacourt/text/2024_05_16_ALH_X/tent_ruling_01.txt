REQUESTED 
 
             Plaintiff moves for an order striking
or taxing Defendants’ Memorandum of Costs which was filed on February 22, 2024.

 
            Plaintiff also moves for reconsideration of the Court’s
January 25, 2024 order which granted Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             Plaintiff Florence M. Sanchez (“Plaintiff”)
filed a Complaint on November 9, 2021 against Defendants The Northeast
Community Clinic (“NCC”), Emma Blandina Trejo, M.D. (“Trejo”), and Sandra Chu
Damiani, M.D. (“Damiani”) (collectively “Defendants”) arising from alleged
medical negligence. 
 
            On November 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed
the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants alleging
causes of action for: (1) Medical Negligence; (2) Negligent Misrepresentation;
and (3) Risks of Nontreatment. 
 
            On January 19, 2023, after hearing
oral argument, the Court sustained the demurrer of Defendant NCC to the second
and third causes of action in the FAC without leave to amend. Also, on such
date, the Court also granted the motion to strike filed by Defendant NCC as to
the FAC without leave to amend. Also, on January 19, 2023, Defendant NCC filed
an Answer to the FAC. 
 
            On May 11, 2023, after hearing oral
argument, the Court sustained the demurrer of Defendant Trejo to the second and
third causes of action in the FAC and granted Defendant Trejo’s motion to
strike Plaintiff’s prayer for expert fees.  
            
            On May 19, 2023, pursuant to
stipulation between the parties, the Court entered an order striking the second
and third causes of action in the FAC as to Defendant Damiani with prejudice and
the Court struck a portion of Plaintiff’s Prayer no. two regarding expert costs
as to Defendant Damiani.  
 
            On May 23, 2023, Defendants Damiani
and Trejo filed respective Answers to the Complaint. 
 
            On December 19, 2023, Defendants
filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff opposed Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment, and Defendants filed a reply brief. 
 
            On January 25, 2024, after hearing
oral argument, the Court granted Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Also,
on January 25, 2024, Defendants filed and served Notice of Ruling as to the
motion for summary judgment. 
 
            On January 29, 2024, Judgment was
entered in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff. 
 
On February 2, 2024, Notice of Entry of
Judgment was served by the Clerk’s office on all parties. 
 
            On February 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed
and served a Motion for Reconsideration. 
 
            On February 22, 2024, Defendants
filed and served a Memorandum of Costs. 
 
            On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Motion to Strike and/or Tax the Memorandum of Costs, in which Plaintiff seeks
to strike costs for depositions and service of process. 
 
            On March 14, 2024, Defendants filed
an opposition to Plaintiff’s motion to strike. 
 
            On April 8, 2024, after hearing, the
Court tentatively denied Plaintiff’s motion to strike and/or tax costs.
(04/08/24 Minute Order.) However, given that Plaintiff filed a motion for
reconsideration, the Court continued the hearing on the motion to strike and/or
tax costs to May 16, 2024. (04/08/24 Minute Order.) 
 
            On May 3, 2024, Defendants filed an
opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration.
 
            The Court will address Plaintiff’s
motion for reconsideration and motion to strike and/or tax costs in this one
ruling. No reply briefs have been filed as to either of Plaintiff’s motions. 
 
            The Court will first address
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration and will then address Plaintiff’s motion
to strike and/or tax costs. 
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED. 
            
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Strike and/or Tax Costs is DENIED. 
 
 
MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION
 
Plaintiff moves for reconsideration of the Court’s January 25, 2024 order
granting Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff moves for
reconsideration on the grounds that different facts and circumstances exist, or
mistakes of facts exist that justify revoking the Court’s prior order granting
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. 
 
            Legal Standard 
 
            Code
Civ. Proc. § 1008(a) “requires that a motion for reconsideration be based on
new or different facts, circumstances, or law.” (New York Times Co. v.
Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.) “A party seeking
reconsideration must also provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to
produce the evidence at an earlier time.” (Ibid.) “A trial court’s
ruling on a motion for reconsideration is reviewed under the abuse of
discretion standard.”  (Ibid.,
citation omitted.) 
                        
California Code of Civil
Procedure, Section 1008(a) provides that “[w]hen an application for an order
has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or
granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order
may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of
the order . . . [may] make application to the same judge or court that made the
order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.”
“The party making the application shall state by affidavit what application was
made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and
what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be
shown.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd.
(a).) A trial court has discretion with respect to granting a motion for
reconsideration. (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court, supra,
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.)
                        
“The burden under section 1008
is comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of newly
discovered evidence: the information must be such that the moving party could
not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at the trial.” (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court, supra,
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-13, citation omitted.) A “party seeking
reconsideration must provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory
explanation for the failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time.” (Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2
Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342.) “If the trial court believes reconsideration is
warranted, it can amend, modify or revoke its previous order.” (Glade v. Glade (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th
1441, 1457, citation omitted.) In the context of motions for reconsideration,
there is “a strict requirement of diligence.” (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690.)   
 
            Application
 
            In
opposition to the motion for reconsideration, Defendants contend that the Court
cannot rule on the motion for reconsideration because judgment has already been
entered. The Court agrees. 
 
            “After a
trial court issues an order, whether interim or final, the losing party may ask
the court to reconsider its decision and enter a different order.” (Sole
Energy Co. v. Petrominerals Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 187, 192.)
However, “[a] trial court may not rule on a motion for reconsideration after
entry of judgment.” (Rancho Mirage Country Club Homeowners Assn. v.
Hazelbaker (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 252, 265.) A motion for reconsideration is
properly denied where it is filed after entry of judgment. (Ibid.) 
 
            Here, the
Court granted Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on January 25, 2024. Judgment
was entered on January 29, 2024. Plaintiff, however, did not file her motion
for reconsideration until February 5, 2024. The Court cannot rule on
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rancho Mirage Country
Club Homeowners Assn. v. Hazelbaker, supra, 2 Cal.App.5th 252, 265.
 
            The Court
also notes that in support of the motion for reconsideration, Plaintiff presents
declarations that were previously filed in opposition to Defendants’ motion for
summary judgment. (Welden Decl., ¶¶ 1-2.) The declaration of Plaintiff’s
counsel, William Welden, does not state what new or different facts, law, or
circumstances are claimed to be shown as required by CCP § 1008(a).  
 
Even if the instant motion were construed as a motion for a
new trial, Plaintiff’s motion would be procedurally deficient as Plaintiff did
not file a notice of intention to move for new trial with the Clerk or serve Defendants
with such notice of intention to move for new trial as required by CCP § 659(a).
Additionally, a motion for new trial at this point in time would be untimely as
Plaintiff was required to bring a motion for new trial at the earliest of “15
days of the date of mailing notice of entry of judgment by the clerk of the
court . . . [or] service upon him or her by any party of written notice of
entry of judgment, or within 180 days after the entry of judgment.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 659, subd. (a)(2).) 
 
The Clerk mailed notice of entry of judgment to all parties
on February 2, 2024. Thus, if Plaintiff sought a new trial, such motion would
have had to been filed within 15 days of February 2, 2024. 
 
            Conclusion
            
            Based on
the foregoing, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration.
 
 
MOTION TO STRIKE AND/OR TAX COSTS
 
            Plaintiff moves
for an order striking, or in the alternative taxing, Defendants’ memorandum of
costs. Plaintiff’s notice of motion provides that the basis for Plaintiff’s
motion “is that the line-item entries for deposition costs and service of
process costs are unreasonable and/or not reasonably necessary to conduct
litigation under CCP § 1033.5(c)(2) and (c)(3).” (Notice of Motion at p.1: 10-12.)
Plaintiff, however, only addresses Defendants’ deposition costs. In their
memorandum of costs, Defendants seek $12,838.36 for deposition costs. Plaintiff
argues that these costs should be taxed because Defendants failed to provide
documentary support for recovery of the costs and because the costs were not
reasonable or necessary.   
 
            Legal Standard 
 
            “Except as otherwise provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) “A prevailing
party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days
after the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment . . . .” (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700, subd. (a)(1).) “Any notice of motion to strike or
to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost
memorandum.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1).) 
 
“The
right to recover . . . costs is determined entirely by statute.” (Gorman v.
Tassajara Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 71.) “In ruling upon
a motion to tax costs, the trial court’s first determination is whether the
statute expressly allows the particular item and whether it appears proper on
its face.” (Ibid.) “If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show
the costs to be unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Ibid.) “Where costs are
not expressly allowed by the statute, the burden is on the party claiming the
costs to show that the charges were reasonable and necessary.”  (Ibid.) “Whether a cost item was
reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the
trial court.” (Ibid., internal quotations omitted.) California Code of
Civil Procedure, Section 1033.5(c)(4) gives a court discretion to allow or deny
a claimed cost where it is not explicitly allowed or prohibited by CCP §
1033.5.
 
“[T]he items on a verified cost bill are prima
facie evidence the costs, expenses and services listed were necessarily
incurred.” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “There is
no requirement that copies of bills, invoices, statements, or any other such
documents be attached to the memorandum.” (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.) “Only if the costs have been put at issue
must supporting documentation be submitted.” (Ibid.) “If the items appearing on a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State
Auto Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) “On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ibid.) “[T]he mere filing of a
motion to tax costs may be a proper objection to an item, the necessity of
which appears doubtful, or which does not appear to be proper on its face.” (Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, internal quotations omitted.)

 
            Application
 
            Here,
Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence to demonstrate that Defendants’
costs were not reasonably incurred. Defendants have met their initial burden by
submitting a memorandum of costs that appear to have proper charges. A party’s
“mere statements in the points and authorities accompanying its notice of
motion to strike [a] cost bill . . . are insufficient to rebut the prima facie
showing [that the costs were necessarily incurred].” (Jones v. Dumrichob,
supra, 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266.) Plaintiff, however, relies
solely on argument contained in her memorandum and has failed to submit any
evidence to support her claim that the costs are unnecessary or unreasonable. 
 
            Thus, the Court denies Plaintiff’s
motion to strike or tax costs. 
 
            Conclusion
            
            Based on
the foregoing, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to strike or tax costs. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED. 
            
            Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike and/or
Tax Costs is DENIED. 

 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
