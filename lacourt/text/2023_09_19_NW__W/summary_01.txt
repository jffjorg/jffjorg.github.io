## English Text Summary:

The judge has decided to OVERRULE the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's lawsuit. 

The defendant argued that the plaintiff's complaint was a "sham pleading" because it contained inconsistent allegations about whether the damaged car was intended to be an "additional" vehicle or a "replacement" vehicle under the insurance policy.  

The judge found that while the different wording could create some confusion, it wasn't clear enough at this stage to conclude that the plaintiff was intentionally misleading the court. The judge also noted that the sham pleading doctrine applies even to unverified complaints. 


The case will now proceed towards trial.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the second amended complaint (SAC) is overruled. The SAC alleges that the defendant, Progressive West Insurance Co., breached its contract with the plaintiff, Khachik Garabidian Jr., by denying his claim for damage to his Mercedes-Benz G55 vehicle after it was lit on fire while parked at a dealership. The defendant argued that the SAC fails to state a cause of action because it omits harmful allegations from the original complaint and attempts to avoid attacks raised in the demurrer.

The judge disagreed, finding that the SAC is not a sham pleading and that the plaintiff's allegations are not factually inconsistent. The judge noted that the plaintiff's allegations of the 30-day time limit for adding the vehicle to the policy are not inconsistent with the allegations of the original complaint, and that the changing of "additional auto" to "replacement auto" does not necessarily mean that the plaintiff intended to add the vehicle as an additional vehicle or replacement vehicle.

The judge also noted that the sham pleading doctrine applies to both verified and unverified complaints, and that the plaintiff's failure to verify the complaint does not preclude the application of the doctrine. Therefore, the judge overruled the defendant's demurrer to the SAC.
