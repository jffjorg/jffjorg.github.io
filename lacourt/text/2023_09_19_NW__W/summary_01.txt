And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by Progressive West Insurance Co. to the Second Amended Complaint is overruled. The court has determined that the Second Amended Complaint is not a sham pleading, despite the plaintiff's changing of the term "additional auto" to "replacement auto" in the complaint. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations are not inconsistent and that the changing of the term does not necessarily indicate a sham pleading. The court also notes that the sham pleading doctrine applies to both verified and unverified complaints. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled and the case will proceed.
