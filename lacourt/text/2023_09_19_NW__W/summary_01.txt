The court also notes that the sham pleading doctrine applies to both verified and unverified complaints. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled and the case will proceed.

## English Text Summary:

The judge has decided to OVERRULE the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's lawsuit. 

The defendant argued that the plaintiff's complaint was a "sham pleading" because it contained inconsistent allegations about whether the damaged car was intended to be an "additional" vehicle or a "replacement" vehicle under the insurance policy.  

The judge found that while the different wording could create some confusion, it wasn't clear enough at this stage to conclude that the plaintiff was intentionally misleading the court. The judge also noted that the sham pleading doctrine applies even to unverified complaints. 


The case will now proceed towards trial.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the second amended complaint (SAC) is overruled. The SAC alleges that the defendant, Progressive West Insurance Co., breached its contract with the plaintiff, Khachik Garabidian Jr., by denying his claim for damage to his Mercedes-Benz G55 vehicle after it was lit on fire while parked at a dealership. The defendant argued that the SAC fails to state a cause of action because it omits harmful allegations from the original complaint and attempts to avoid attacks raised in the demurrer.

The judge disagreed, finding that the SAC is not a sham pleading and that the plaintiff's allegations are not factually inconsistent. The judge noted that the plaintiff's allegations of the 30-day time limit for adding the vehicle to the policy are not inconsistent with the allegations of the original complaint, and that the changing of "additional auto" to "replacement auto" does not necessarily mean that the plaintiff intended to add the vehicle as an additional vehicle or replacement vehicle.

The judge also noted that the sham pleading doctrine applies to both verified and unverified complaints, and that the plaintiff's failure to verify the complaint does not preclude the application of the doctrine. Therefore, the judge overruled the defendant's demurrer to the SAC.

## Case Summary: Garabidian Jr. v. Progressive West Insurance Co. (Case No. 22VECV01434)

**Case Number:** 22VECV01434
**Plaintiff:** Khachik Garabidian Jr. 
**Defendant:** Progressive West Insurance Co.
**Hearing Date:** September 19, 2023
**Department:** W
**Tentative Ruling:** Demurrer OVERRULED

**Key Facts:**

* **Insurance Policy:** Plaintiff had an auto insurance policy (Policy No. 923764921) with Defendant.
* **Vehicle Damage:** Plaintiff purchased a Mercedes-Benz G55 (Vehicle) in May 2022. In June 2022, the Vehicle was damaged by fire while parked at a dealership.
* **Insurance Claim:** Plaintiff filed a claim with Defendant to cover the damage.
* **Denial of Claim:** Defendant denied the claim stating Plaintiff owned other vehicles insured by State Farm, and the policy did not cover additional vehicles insured elsewhere.
* **Lawsuit:** Plaintiff sued Defendant for breach of contract and bad faith.

**Disputes:**

* **Coverage:** Plaintiff argues he was entitled to coverage under the policy because he had 30 days to add the Vehicle, and it was within that timeframe. Defendant contends the policy does not cover additional vehicles insured elsewhere, regardless of the 30-day timeframe.

**Arguments:**

* **Defendant:** Argues Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC) contains inconsistent allegations compared to the original Complaint and First Amended Complaint. Plaintiff initially alleged the Vehicle was an "additional auto" but now claims it was meant to be a "replacement auto," which affects the applicability of the policy terms.
* **Plaintiff:** Maintains the SAC does not contain contradictory allegations and refutes Defendant's narrow interpretation of the terms "additional auto" and "replacement auto."

**Court's Ruling:**

* The court overruled Defendant's demurrer to the SAC. 
* The court found that Plaintiff's allegations, while evolving, are not inherently contradictory and do not constitute a sham pleading. 
* The court acknowledged the difference in meaning between "additional auto" and "replacement auto" but stated that further factual development is needed to determine the applicability of the policy terms.

**Next Steps:**

* The case will proceed to further proceedings, likely discovery and potentially a trial.

**Case Number:** 22VECV01434
**Hearing Date:** September 19, 2023
**Department:** W
**Parties:** Khachik Garabidian Jr. (Plaintiff) v. Progressive West Insurance Co. (Defendant)

**Background:**
- Plaintiff Khachik Garabidian Jr. held an auto insurance policy with Defendant Progressive West Insurance Company.
- Plaintiff purchased a Mercedes-Benz G55 and filed a claim for damage caused by a pedestrian.
- Defendant denied the claim, stating that Plaintiff owned other vehicles insured by State Farm Insurance.
- Plaintiff alleges he had 30 days to add the vehicle to the policy, while Defendant asserts the policy does not cover additional vehicles owned by the policyholder if they are insured by other companies.

**Dispute:**
- Defendant Progressive West Insurance Co. filed a demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint, arguing that Plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to support bad faith or breach of contract claims.

**Court's Tentative Ruling:**
- Defendant Progressive West Insurance Co.'s Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint is OVERRULED.
- The sham pleading doctrine does not apply in this case, as both verified and unverified complaints are subject to the doctrine.
- Plaintiff's change in allegations from "additional auto" to "replacement auto" does not conclusively demonstrate a sham pleading.
- The court cannot determine Plaintiff's initial intentions for adding the vehicle, as there is no mention of it in the complaint or evidence provided by Defendant.

**Significant Statements:**
- "Under the sham pleading doctrine, plaintiffs are precluded from amending complaints to omit harmful allegations, without explanation, from previous complaints to avoid attacks raised in demurrers or motions for summary judgment."
- "The policy against sham pleadings requires the pleader to explain satisfactorily any such omission."
