Dept. of Corporations v. SpeeDee Oil Change Systems, Inc.)
  - "The paramount concern [when resolving disqualification motions] must be to preserve public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar." (Ibid.)
  - "An action is derivative, that is, in the corporate right, ‘ “if the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the corporation, or to the whole body of its stock and property without any severance or distribution among individual holders, or it seeks to recover assets for the corporation or to prevent the dissipation of its assets.” ’” (Everest Investors 8 v. McNeil Partners)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied a motion by plaintiff Eduardo Luna to disqualify counsel, Shawn M. Olson and the Olson Law Firm, from representing defendants BJD Services, LLC, Dawn Kuykendall, Jerilyn Rivetti Kuykendall, Brian McWilliams, Rodney Owens, Villa Patrician Home Owner's Association, Inc., and Villa Patrician Home Owner's Association (sued as Doe defendant 1). The plaintiff claimed that the counsel was representing both parties in the same lawsuit, based on alleged derivative claims brought on behalf of Villa HOA. However, the court found that the Complaint does not allege facts sufficient to support derivative claims, and therefore, the pleadings and evidence do not show the existence of a conflict of interest based on concurrent representation that requires the disqualification of counsel.
