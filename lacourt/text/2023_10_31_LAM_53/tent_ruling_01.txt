MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff Ricardo Flores
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Defendants Pine Enterprise, LLC and Tony
Chang
Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure Section 128.7
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Ricardo Flores (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order awarding
sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against defendants Pine Enterprise, LLC,
and Tony Chang (“Defendants”) in the amount of $1,760 pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.7 on the ground that Defendants “intentionally delayed
filing their Motion for Summary Adjudication.” 
(Notice of Mot., p. 2:1-3.)  Specifically, Plaintiff appears to contend
that Defendants’ second motion for summary adjudication, which was heard by the
court and denied on October 12, 2023, was frivolous.  (Mot., p. 2:23-25.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure “[s]ection 128.7 applies
only in limited circumstances.  It ‘authorizes trial courts to impose
sanctions to check abuses in the filing of pleadings, petitions, written
notices of motion or similar papers.’  [Citation.]  Under that
authority, trial courts may issue sanctions, including monetary and terminating
sanctions, against a party for filing a complaint that is legally or factually
frivolous.”  (Kumar v. Ramsey (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 1110, 1120
[internal citation omitted].)  “A claim is factually frivolous if it is ‘ “not well grounded in fact” ’ and it is legally frivolous if
it is ‘ “not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the
extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.” [Citation.]’ 
[Citation.]  ‘In either case, to obtain sanctions, the moving party must
show the party’s conduct in asserting the claim was objectively
unreasonable.  [Citation.]  A claim is objectively unreasonable if
“any reasonable attorney would agree that [it] is totally and completely
without merit.”  [Citation.]’”  (McCluskey v. Henry (2020) 56
Cal.App.5th 1197, 1205 [internal citation omitted].)  Sanctions under this
section “may consist of, or include, directives of a nonmonetary nature . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿128.7, subd. (d).)   
The court
finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that Defendants’ second
motion for summary adjudication was either factually frivolous or legally
frivolous.  Although Plaintiff has argued
that “a reasonable attorney would agree” that the motion was without merit due
to (1) there having been no additional fact discovery following the court’s
denial of the first motion, and (2) various issues taken with the evidence
submitted by Defendants, Plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence or
argument showing that Defendants’ motion was not well grounded in fact or not
warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the modification or
extension of existing law.  (Kumar, supra, 71 Cal.App.5th at p. 1120.)  The court further finds that Plaintiff has
not presented sufficient evidence or argument showing that Defendants presented
their motion for an improper purpose, such as to harass Plaintiff or cause
unnecessary delay or a needless increase in the cost of litigation.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd.
(b)(1).) 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show
that Defendants’ second motion for summary adjudication was brought for an
improper purpose or was factually or legally frivolous and therefore denies
Plaintiff’s motion. 
The court denies Defendants’ request for an award of monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7,
subdivision (h), because (1) a request “for sanctions under this section shall
be made separately from other motions or requests[,]” and     (2) Defendants made their request for
sanctions under this subdivision against Plaintiff in their opposition papers
(i.e., not separate from other motions).[1]  (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd.
(c)(1).)  
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Ricardo
Flores’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.7. 
The court orders defendants Pine Enterprise, LLC and Tony Chang to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
