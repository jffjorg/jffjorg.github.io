DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Shai Harris, as successor trustee of the H. McClenon Trust
dated December 12, 2019 and as trustee of the ADH Harris Trust dated January
14, 2020 (“Plaintiffs”), filed the operative First Amended Complaint in this
action on January 3, 2023, against defendants Teresa Gorman Martinez and Ruben
Martinez, as trustees of the GM Defined Benefit Pension Plan, Asset Default
Management, Inc., Lil Wave Financial, Inc., Superior Loan Servicing, and
Funding Rush, Inc.  Plaintiffs allege one
cause of action for the administering of an unconscionable contract or clause
under U.C.C. section 2-302, alleging that Plaintiffs have been damaged by the
defendants’ “administration of an adhesion contract that is unconscionable, as
described in U.C.C. § 2-302.”  (FAC,
p. 1:24-25.) 
Defendants Lil Wave Financial, Inc., d/b/a Superior Loan Servicing
(erroneously sued separately as Lil Wave Financial, Inc. and Superior Loan
Servicing) and Funding Rush, Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”) move the court
for an order sustaining their demurrer to Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint.
The court sustains Defendants’ demurrer to the cause of action for the
administering of an unconscionable contract or clause under Uniform Commercial
Code section 2-302 because it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action since there is no affirmative cause of action for
unconscionability, which is a defense to the enforcement of a contract.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Jones
v. Wells Fargo Bank (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1527, 1539 [explaining that
there is no cause of action for unconscionability under California Civil Code
section 1670.5 because “that doctrine is only a defense to contract
enforcement”]; Hines v. US Bankcorp. (C.D. Cal. 2021) 2021 WL 3923248 at
*2 [“Though section 2-302 of the UCC has been codified in California, see
Cal. Civ. Code § 1670.5, ‘unconscionability “operates as a defense to the
enforcement of a contract of adhesion”” and the plaintiffs had not provided
authority showing that it is an affirmative cause of action].)  Plaintiffs have not filed opposition papers
with the court showing that (1) unconscionability is a valid cause of action,
or (2) the facts alleged in the First Amended Complaint are sufficient to
support any other legal theory.  
The
burden is on the plaintiff “to articulate how it could amend its pleading to
render it sufficient.”¿ (Palm Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn., Inc. v.
Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290.)¿ To satisfy that burden, a
plaintiff “must show in what manner he can amend his complaint and how that
amendment will change the legal effect of his pleading.”¿ (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)¿ The court finds that Plaintiffs have
not met their burden to show how they could amend their pleading to render it
sufficient and therefore sustains the demurrer without leave to amend. 
 
 
ORDER
The court sustains defendants Lil Wave Financial, Inc., d/b/a Superior
Loan Servicing (erroneously sued separately as Lil Wave Financial, Inc. and
Superior Loan Servicing) and Funding Rush, Inc.’s demurrer to plaintiffs Shai
Harris, as successor trustee of the H. McClenon Trust dated December 12, 2019
and as trustee of the ADH Harris Trust dated January 14, 2020’s First Amended
Complaint without leave to amend.
The court orders that defendants Lil Wave Financial, Inc., d/b/a
Superior Loan Servicing (erroneously sued separately as Lil Wave Financial,
Inc. and Superior Loan Servicing) and Funding Rush, Inc. are dismissed with prejudice
from this case.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 581, subd. (f)(1).) 
The court orders defendants Lil Wave Financial, Inc., d/b/a Superior
Loan Servicing (erroneously sued separately as Lil Wave Financial, Inc. and
Superior Loan Servicing) and Funding Rush, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 31, 2023
