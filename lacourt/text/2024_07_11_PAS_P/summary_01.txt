**Case Summary**

**Case Number:** 22AHCV01198
**Hearing Date:** July 11, 2024
**Department:** P
**Tentative Ruling:** Granting Defendant City of Pasadena's Motion for Summary Judgment

**Summary of Key Points:**

1. The case involves a single cause of action for a dangerous condition of public property under Government Code ยง 835, asserted by Plaintiff Franses Rodriguez against Defendant the City of Pasadena.
2. On November 15, 2021, Plaintiff was riding her e-scooter on Marengo Avenue in Pasadena when she encountered a 1.25-inch uneven section of the roadway, causing her to lose control and sustain injuries.
3. The Defendant argues that the alleged defect is trivial as a matter of law, citing the size of the defect and the lack of aggravating factors.
4. The Court finds that the 1.25-inch displacement is just above the threshold where the Court would hesitate to find it trivial, but the lack of aggravating factors, including no prior accidents or falls at the location, weigh in favor of finding the defect trivial.
5. The Court also finds that the Defendant did not have actual or constructive notice of the alleged defect, as there is no evidence of the public entity's actual knowledge of the existence of the condition or that the entity knew or should have known of its dangerous character.

**Key Legal Principles:**

1. The Trivial Defect Doctrine: A condition is not dangerous if it is of a minor, trivial, or insignificant nature in view of the surrounding circumstances.
2. Government Code ยง 835: A public entity is liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition of public property if the plaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury, that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition, and that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury incurred.
3. Actual Notice: A public entity must have actual knowledge of the existence of the condition and know or should have known of its dangerous character to establish liability.
4. Constructive Notice: A public entity may be deemed to have constructive notice of a dangerous condition if the condition was obvious and existed for a sufficient period of time to put the municipality on notice.

**Conclusion:**

The Court grants the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, finding that the alleged defect is trivial as a matter of law and that the Defendant did not have actual or constructive notice of the alleged defect.
