And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for attorney fees in the amount of $37,408.37 to the plaintiffs, Jane Doe AH and Jane Doe KC, in connection with the dismissal of the defendant's cross-complaint. The defendant, Maria Raquenel Portillo Jimenez, is ordered to pay the attorney fees within 30 days of the notice of this order. The court found that the plaintiffs' counsel provided reasonable hourly rates and that the amount of time spent on the anti-SLAPP motion was reasonable, given the complexity of the case. The court also noted that the defendant, who was self-represented, had ample opportunity to reconsider filing the cross-complaint and that the court's decision was based on the California anti-SLAPP statute and applicable case law.
