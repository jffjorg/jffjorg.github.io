ANALYSIS: 

 
On December 16, 2022,
Plaintiff Boren, Osher & Luftman, LLP (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for breach
of contract against Defendant Camilla Rose (“Defendant”). Defendant filed an
answer on March 23, 2023. On December 12 and 13, 2023, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s motions to compel responses to form and special interrogatories,
and request for production of documents, and awarded Plaintiff monetary
sanctions. (Minute Orders, 12/12/23 and 12/13/23) 
 
Plaintiff filed the
instant motion for issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions on January 11, 2024.
No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Where a party willfully
disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose terminating,
issue, evidence or monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds.
(d), (g); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) Here, Plaintiff requests issue and evidence sanctions
with respect to the discovery requests to which Defendant was required to
respond. The Court finds that notices of its rulings compelling Defendant’s
responses were served on December 13, 2023 and that the responses were to be
served within 20 days. (Notices of Ruling, 12/13/23.) Defendant has failed to
serve responses as ordered. (Motion, Osher Decl., ¶6.) Defendant was also
ordered to pay sanctions by December 26, 2022 and failed in that regard, as
well. (Ibid.) 
 
Therefore, the Court
finds Defendant’s non-compliance to be willful and subject to the requested
issue and evidence sanctions. Insofar as the form interrogatories sought to
obtain information regarding what alleged facts from the complaint Defendant
disputed, Plaintiff’s request to deem those alleged facts true is granted. The
facts deemed true and undisputed are, as follows:
 
1.     
Defendant entered into a written fee agreement with
Plaintiff, whereby Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff for legal services
requested by Defendant; 
2.     
Plaintiff provided legal services for the benefit of
and at the request of Defendant, for which it expected to be compensated
pursuant to the parties’ written fee agreement;
3.     
Defendant breached her obligations under the written
fee agreement with Plaintiff by failing to pay for all services that were
performed by Plaintiff; and 
4.     
Defendant was not excused from paying Plaintiff for the
services that it performed pursuant to the parties’ written fee agreement.
 
(See Motion, p. 5:2-9.)
Additionally, the Court imposes an evidence sanction prohibiting Defendant from
presenting evidence in support of their affirmative defenses. In light of
Defendant’s repeated failure to respond to properly served discovery, the court
finds that these sanctions are appropriate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2023.010 and 2023.030. Nor has Plaintiff filed any opposition to the
motions to compel, nor to the instant Motion, to explain their failure to
provide the required responses as ordered. The request for monetary sanctions
is granted in the amount of $1,354.20 based on two hours of attorney time
billed at $645.00 per hour, plus filing costs of $64.20. (Motion, Osher Decl.,
¶12.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Boren, Osher & Luftman, LLP’s
Motion for Issue and/or Evidentiary Sanctions, and for the Imposition of
Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. THE REQUEST FOR ISSUE AND EVIDENCE
SANCTIONS IS GRANTED AND MONETARY SANCTIONS ARE AWARDED IN THE AMOUNT OF
$1,354.20.
