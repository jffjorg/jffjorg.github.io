Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash service of summons and cross-complaint brought by the specially appearing cross-defendant, Wilson. The court found that the service of summons was improper because the address where the summons was purportedly served was not the dwelling, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address of the defendant. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the service was proper, but since the plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, the motion is granted.

The judge has also granted the motion to set aside entry of default brought by the specially appearing cross-defendant. The court found that the entry of default is void because the statement of damages was not served on the defendant. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the statement of damages was served, but since the plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, the motion is granted.

The judge's rulings are based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Civil Procedure Code. The court's decisions are intended to ensure that the service of process and the entry of default are proper and comply with the statutory requirements.
