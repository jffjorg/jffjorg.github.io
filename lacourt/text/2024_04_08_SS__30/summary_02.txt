And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Systems Source, Inc., has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff, Pedro Serrano-Trujillo, is unable to establish vicarious liability for the acts of Cadena, an employee of the defendant. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the incidental benefit exception to the going and coming rule applies, as the defendant furnished a vehicle to Cadena for job-related duties. The court finds that there are triable issues of material fact as to whether the incidental benefit exception applies, and therefore denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
