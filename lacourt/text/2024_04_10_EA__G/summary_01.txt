And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied plaintiff Jose R. Pilpa's motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Pilpa and defendant Ibrahim Ghanem. The settlement agreement, entered into on November 2, 2023, required Ghanem to pay Pilpa $20,000 by January 31, 2024. However, Pilpa failed to provide evidence in support of his claim that Ghanem did not timely make the required payment. The judge found that Pilpa's own declaration did not clearly state whether Pilpa received the required funds, and therefore, denied the motion without prejudice.
