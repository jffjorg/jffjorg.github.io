And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the County's motion to withdraw its answer in this case. The County argues that its answer was filed as a result of an attorney mistake and requests relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). However, the judge finds that the motion is untimely, as it was filed more than six months after the answer was filed. The judge notes that the filing of an answer is considered a "proceeding" under section 473, but due to the untimeliness of the motion, the County's request for relief is denied.
