```

And here is the summary in English text:

The judge is denying the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The plaintiff, Rickey Ball, failed to serve responses to the defendant's form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production despite a court order to do so. The court finds that the plaintiff's actions constitute a serious misuse of the discovery process, but notes that the defendants have not shown a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations that cannot be cured by lesser sanctions. The court also notes that a terminating sanction would create a "windfall" for the defendants, as no lesser sanctions have been previously pursued. Therefore, the motion is denied.
