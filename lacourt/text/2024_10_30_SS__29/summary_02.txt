  - "A plaintiff alleging injuries based on a dangerous condition must prove the defendant either: (1) created the dangerous condition, or (2) knew or should have known of the dangerous condition."
  - "Most Courts of Appeal hold that a defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the plaintiff fails to show that the dangerous condition existed for at least a sufficient time to be discovered by ordinary care and inspection."
  - "Whether a dangerous condition has existed long enough for a reasonably prudent person to have discovered it is a question of fact for the jury."
```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for summary judgment is denied, as there are triable issues as to whether the chair involved in the incident posed an unreasonable risk of foreseeable harm to guests of a certain size and therefore was a dangerous condition. The judge notes that the defendant's arguments go to the weight of the expert witness's testimony, not its admissibility, and that the court determines that the expert's opinion creates a triable issue of material fact as to whether the chairs in the casino were dangerous.
