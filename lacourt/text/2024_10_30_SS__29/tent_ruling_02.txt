22STCV27025
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment
 
Tentative Ruling
 
The
motion is denied.
The
Court also advises counsel that it has not reviewed Exhibit D, the video
presented to the Court as a CD. For security reasons, the Court will not insert
a externally sourced device into the Court’s computer system. If Exhibit D is
material, and if Defendant wishes to include Exhibit D in the record of the
evidence considered by the Court, the Court will discuss with counsel alternative
ways for the Court to view the video.
Background
On August 19, 2022, Cynthia Smith
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Flynt Management Group, LLC dba Larry
Flynt’s Lucky Lady Casino (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50, asserting cause
of action for general negligence and premises liability arising out of an
incident in which Plaintiff alleges that she fell and was injured while
attempting to sit in a chair with wheels on May 1, 2022.
On October 24, 2022, Defendant filed an
answer.
On April 3, 2024, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name Casino Furnishings, LLC as Doe 1.
On November 3, 2023, Defendant filed this
motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff filed her opposition on October 16,
2024. Defendant filed a reply on October 24, 2024.
Legal Standard
“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each
cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party
opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply
“rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Objections to Evidence
Each party objects to some of the
evidence submitted by the other.  Evidence
presented in support of, or in opposition to, a motion for summary judgment
must be admissible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (d); Perry v. Bakewell Hawthorne LLC (2017) 2 Cal.5th 536, 541-43.) The court
must “consider all of the
evidence set forth in the papers, except the evidence to which objections have
been made and sustained.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
Plaintiff asserts five objections to Defendant’s
evidence. The Court SUSTAINS Objection No. 5 to the unverified, rough
transcript of the deposition of Louis Granata. The remaining objections are
OVERRULED.
Defendant asserts fourteen objections to
Plaintiff’s evidence. The objections are OVERRULED. Of particular significance,
Objections Nos. 4 and 5 are overruled, as an expert is entitled to rely on
hearsay in formulating his opinion; the People v. Sanchez case addresses
what testimony the expert can provide regarding the bases for his opinion, not what
materials an expert can rely on in forming his opinion.
Discussion
Plaintiff was a guest and customer at Defendant’s
Lucky Lady Casino (“Casino”) at the time of the incident. (Defendant’s
Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [“DSUMF”], No. 1; Complaint, unnumbered pp.
3-4.) Plaintiff arrived at the Casino at approximately 4 pm on April 30, 2022.
(DSUMF, No. 2.) After midnight, at approximately 1 am on May 1, 2022, Plaintiff
alleges that she attempted to sit in a wheeled chair, the chair rolled away,
and Plaintiff fell to the ground, sustaining injuries. (DSUMF, Nos. 1-4.) 
Plaintiff asserts causes of action for negligence
and premises liability. The basic
elements of a cause of action for negligence and for premises liability are the
same: (1) the existence of a legal duty;
(2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages. (Brown
v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) The existence and scope of duty are legal questions
for the court.¿¿(Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 213; Annocki¿v.
Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 36.)
Those who own,
possess, or control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in
managing the property to avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm.
(Annocki, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 37.) If a dangerous condition exists, the
property owner is “under a duty to exercise ordinary care either to make the
condition reasonably safe for their [customers’] use or to give a warning
adequate to enable them to avoid the harm.” (Bridgman v. Safeway Stores,
Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446.) 
“It is well established in California that although
a store owner is not an insurer of the safety of its patrons, the owner does
owe them a duty to exercise reasonable care in keeping the premises reasonably
safe.” (Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1205.) “A store
owner exercises ordinary care by making reasonable inspections of the portions
of the premises open to customers.” (Moore v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 472, 476.) “The care required is commensurate with the
risks involved.” (Ibid.) “[A]s to business invitees, the owner
should conduct frequent inspections.” (Ortega, supra,
26 Cal.4th at p. 1207.)
“A
plaintiff alleging injuries based on a dangerous condition must prove the
defendant either: (1) created the dangerous condition, or (2) knew or should
have known of the dangerous condition.” (See Peralta v. Vons Companies, Inc.
(2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 1030, 1036.) “Because
the owner is not the insurer of the visitor’s personal safety …, the owner’s
actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition is [in many cases] a
key to establishing its liability.” (Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at
p. 1206.) “[W]here the plaintiff relies on the failure to correct a dangerous
condition to prove the owner’s negligence, the plaintiff has the burden of
showing that the owner had notice of the defect in sufficient time to correct
it.” (Ibid.) “Most Courts of Appeal hold that a defendant is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law if the plaintiff fails to show that the dangerous
condition existed for at least a sufficient time to be discovered by ordinary
care and inspection.” (Id. at p. 1207.) “Whether a dangerous condition
has existed long enough for a reasonably prudent person to have discovered it
is a question of fact for the jury.” (Ibid.) 
If
a dangerous condition exists, the property owner is “under a duty to exercise
ordinary care either to make the condition reasonably safe …. or to give a
warning adequate to enable them to avoid the harm.” (Bridgman v. Safeway
Stores, Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446; see also, e.g., Kinsman
v. Unocal Corp. (2005) 37 Cal.4th 659, 672-73.) In some cases, and subject
to certain exceptions, however, a dangerous condition may be so obvious that
the condition itself serves as a warning, and the landowner may have no further
duty to remedy or warn of the condition. (See Kinsman, supra, 37 Cal.4th
at p. 673; Montes v. YMCA of Glendale (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 1134, 1142; Christoff
v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 118, 126; Krongos
v. Pacific Gas Electric Co. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 387, 393.)
Here,
Defendant moves for summary judgment on one ground: that there was no dangerous
condition, or at most, a non-actionable trivial defect. 
To support
that the rolling chair was not a dangerous condition, Defendant provides the declaration
of Louis Granata and the deposition of Plaintiff. (Defendant also cites the
deposition of Louis Granata, as to which an objection has been sustained, and a
video of the incident which, as stated above, the Court has not been able to
view.) 
Louis Granata,
director of facilities for Defendant’s Casino states that he reviewed the
Casino’s records in relation to malfunctioning chairs and did not find any
reports of a chairs malfunctioning prior to Plaintiff’s incident. (Granata
Decl., ¶ 6.) Further, there are not records of other patrons of the Casino
sustaining injuries from the use of poker table chairs. (Id., ¶ 7.) 
Plaintiff states
that she has been to the Casino roughly 60 times prior to the incident and had
never experienced (Exh. B, Smith Deposition, 59:21-24, 62:9-16.) Plaintiff
further does not know what caused her to fall out of the chair or if there was
a problem with the flooring. (Id., 62:21-25, 63:1-8.) 
Defendant also
relies on several cases from Federal and other state courts that state that having
rolling chairs present is not, in itself, a dangerous condition. 
In opposition,
Plaintiff relies principally on the declaration of her expert witness, Enrique
Rivera, CXLT. Mr. Rivera states that he has reviewed a video of the incident and
in that video it appears that the chair at issue had twin hard plastic wheels.
(Rivera Decl., ¶ 9.) At least one company selling chairs, called Caster City,
states on its website that when chairs are used on a carpeted floor and the user
may weigh more than 200 pounds, three-inch wheels are recommended. (Ibid.) The
failure to provide chairs with such three-inch wheels, Mr. Rivera opines, created
a dangerous condition, as it is “foreseeable that patrons of all shapes, sizes,
and abilities would be on the Property and utilize the poker … chairs.” (Ibid.)

Defendant
criticizes Mr. Rivera’s testimony on a number of grounds, stating (among other
things) that there is no evidence that Defendant purchased the chair at issue
from Caster City and that statements on one website do not establish a standard
of care. But these arguments go to the weight of Mr. Rivera’s testimony, not
its admissibility. Even if the Court were to agree 100 percent with Defendant’s
criticism of the expert opinion testimony, it is not the role of the Court on summary
judgment to weigh evidence or predict likely results at trial. At trial,
Defendant may cross-examine Mr. Rivera vigorously on these points, and perhaps
Defendant will convince the trier of fact. But on summary judgment, the Court
determines that these opinions are admissible, and, viewing the evidence in the
light most favorable to Plaintiff, and drawing all reasonable inferences in her
favor, Mr. Rivera’s opinion creates a triable issue of material fact as to
whether the chairs in the Casino were dangerous. And that is the only issue on
which Defendant seeks summary judgment.
Finally, the
Court notes that Defendant argues in reply that there is no evidence in the
record that the assertedly dangerous condition caused or was a substantial
factor in causing Plaintiff’s injury, as there is no evidence that she (combined
with the backpack that she was carrying at the time of the incident) weighed
more than 200 pounds. But that is an argument about causation, not the
existence of a dangerous condition, and was not raised in the moving papers. A
party opposing a motion for summary judgment need not show that there are
triable issues as to elements of a cause of action not challenged in the moving
papers, and a party seeking summary judgment cannot raise entirely new arguments
in a reply brief.
In sum, the
Court finds, on this record, that there are triable issues as to whether the
chair involved in the incident posed an unreasonable risk of foreseeable harm to
guests of a certain size and therefore was a dangerous condition. The motion
for summary judgment is denied.
The Court need
not reach, and does not reach, the other arguments raised in Plaintiff’s
opposition.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES the motion for summary
judgment of Defendant Flynt
Management Group, LLC dba Larry Flynt’s Lucky Lady Casino.
