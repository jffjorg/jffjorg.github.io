23STCV02798
Motion to Withdraw Answer
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On February 8, 2023, Shaheriav Kham (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(“LACMTA”), Morlin Asset Management, LP (“Morlin”), and Does 1 through 20,
asserting a cause of action for premises liability arising out of an alleged
slip and fall at Union Station in Los Angeles on June 20, 2022.
 
On April 27, 2023, County of Los Angeles (“County”) filed
an answer stating that it was erroneously sued as LACMTA.
 
On August 30, 2023, Morlin filed an answer.
 
On June 7, 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name
ABM Industries, Inc. as Doe 1.
 
On July 12, 2024, ABM Industry Groups, LLC (erroneously
sued as ABM Industries, Inc.) (“ABM”) filed an answer.
 
On October 2, 2024, County filed this motion to withdraw
its answer. 
 
No opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b) provides for both discretionary and mandatory relief when
there has been a mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
As to discretionary
relief, the statute states: “The court may, upon any terms as may be just,
relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal,
order, or other proceeding taken against him through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”  (Code of Civil Procedure § 473, subd. (b).)
Where such an application for discretionary relief is made, the motion must be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or pleading proposed to be filed;
“otherwise the application shall not be granted.”  (Ibid.)  The application for relief must be made within
a reasonable time, and in no case exceeding six months after the judgment. (Ibid.)
The statute also provides
for mandatory relief from dismissal, default, or default judgment:
“whenever an application
for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in
proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to
his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or 22STCneglect … unless the court
finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” 

(Ibid.)
A request for
discretionary relief under section 473, subdivision (b), must be made (subject
to certain exceptions) “within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six
months.”  (Ibid.)  A request for mandatory relief must be made
within six months.  (Ibid.) 
Discussion
County requests its answer be withdrawn under Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), as the answer was filed as a
result of an attorney mistake.  (Bacio
Decl., ¶ 5.)  County is not a named
defendant but answered, as a result of a mistake, after it was served.  (Id., ¶¶ 3, 5.)  The accident at issue took place at Union
Station in Los Angeles, which County does not own, maintain, or operate Union
Station.  (Id., ¶ 5.)  
 
There is an extensive body of caselaw broadly
construing the term “proceeding” within the meaning of section 473 to include
“any step taken by a party in the progress of a civil action.” (Zellerino v.
Brown (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1097, 1105 [quoting Stonesifer v. Kilburn
(1892) 94 Cal. 33, 43]; see also Burns v. Superior Court (1903) 140 Cal.
1, 5-6; Gipe v. Superior Court (1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 617, 626; Marblehead
L. Co. v. Superior Court (1923) 60 Cal.App. 644, 655-56.)  The Court assumes, without deciding, that the
filing of an answer is a “proceeding” within the meaning of section 473. 
 
County’s motion, however, is untimely.  County’s answer was filed in April 2023, and
this motion was filed in October 2024, far beyond the six month maximum period
for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
Accordingly, County motion to withdraw its answer is denied.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES the motion of County of Los Angeles to
withdraw its answer.
 
Moving Party is to give notice.
