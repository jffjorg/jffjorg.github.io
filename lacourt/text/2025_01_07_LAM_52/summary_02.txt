And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike portions of the second amended complaint filed by Radcliff Fairman LLP against Jeffrey C. Mayes and Druven, PC.

The judge has granted the request for judicial notice of one exhibit, which is the docket of a federal action in the Central District of California and a "notice of change of attorney business or contact information" filed in that action.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the second amended complaint, finding that Radcliff Fairman LLP is a real party in interest. The judge has also granted the motion to strike certain portions of the second amended complaint, including the portion regarding the Humbled Hustle, Inc. case, which is false and irrelevant.

The judge has ordered the defendants to answer the second amended complaint within 15 days.
