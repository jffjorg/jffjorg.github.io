 Case Number:  24STCV16044    Hearing Date:   January 7, 2025    Dept:  52 Defendants Tyrod Taylor and 22594
Zaltana Street, LLC’s Motion to Strike First Amended Complaint
            Defendants
Tyrod Taylor and 22594 Zaltana Street, LLC move to strike plaintiff Andraya
Howard’s first amended complaint.  Defendants
do so on the basis that plaintiff did not file it within the time allowed by
the court’s order sustaining defendants’ demurrer with leave to amend.  Courts may strike “pleadings filed in violation of a deadline, court order, or requirement
of prior leave of court.”  (Ferraro v.
Camarlinghi (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 509, 528.)  
Striking the first
amended complaint would serve no purpose. 
Plaintiff missed the deadline by less than four hours.  It was due on October 30, 2024.  She submitted the first amended complaint at
3:42 a.m. on October 31.  Defendants do
not and cannot demonstrate any prejudice caused by this minimal delay.  The policy in favor of resolving disputes on
the merits supports liberally granting leave to amend complaints (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428), granting leave to correct errors (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120
Cal.App.4th 1141, 1149), and granting relief from mistake or excusable neglect
(Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8
Cal.4th 975, 980).  Granting this motion
would merely pave the way for additional unnecessary motions that would result
in allowing plaintiff to file this first amended complaint and requiring
defendants to answer it.  
Defendants’ motion
to strike is denied.  Defendants
shall answer the first amended complaint within 15 days.Plaintiff Andraya Howard’s Motion for
Consolidation and for Stay of Unlawful Detainer Action; Notice of Related Case
            Plaintiff
Andraya Howard moves to consolidate and stay an unlawful detainer action
against her titled 22594 Zaltana Street LLC v. Andraya
Michele Howard, case No. 24CHUD00828.  Plaintiff also filed a notice of related case
for the two cases.
Consolidation
and Stay
A
court may consolidate actions or stay an unlawful detainer action “[w]hen an
unlawful detainer proceeding and an unlimited action concerning title to the
property are simultaneously pending.”  (Martin-Bragg
v. Moore (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 367, 385 (Martin-Bragg).)  If the court “does neither and instead tries
the issue of title under the summary procedures that constrain unlawful
detainer proceedings, the parties’ right to a full trial of the issue of title
may be unfairly expedited and limited.  If
complex issues of title are tried in the unlawful detainer proceeding, the
proceeding loses its summary character; defects in the plaintiff’s title ‘are
neither properly raised in this summary proceeding for possession, nor are they
concluded by the judgment.’ ”  (Ibid.)
Plaintiff
does not show good cause to consolidate the actions or to stay the unlawful
detainer action.  In the cases she relies
on, the parties who possessed the property brought civil actions alleging they either
currently held title to the disputed property or that they should have retained
title because the opposing parties fraudulently acquired title from the
possessors.  In Martin-Bragg, the party
in possession of the property alleged he currently held equitable title to the
property while legal or paper “title to the property was held by” the opposing
party “as a security interest or in trust for the benefit of” the
occupant.  (Martin-Bragg, supra,
29 Cal.App.4th at p. 385.)   Similarly, in both Mehr v. Superior Court
(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 1044, 1046-1048 and Asuncion v. Superior Court
(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 141, 143-144, the occupants owned the property first and
alleged the new owners fraudulently acquired title from them.  The occupants thus each alleged the opposing
party’s title to the property was void or voidable, meaning the occupants
should have never lost their title to the property. 
In
contrast, plaintiff does not allege she ever held title to the subject property.  The gravamen of this case is that defendants allegedly
breached an obligation to sell the property to plaintiff.  Howard alleges defendants were required to
and should have transferred the property to her—but did not.  Plaintiff provides no authority for staying
an unlawful detainer action because the occupant brought a civil action seeking
to alter the status quo and gain title to the property for the first time.  The unlawful detainer action will not
adjudicate any issues of title to the property and will not result in an
improper summary proceeding that determines any issues raised in this action.  The policy concerns discussed in Martin-Bragg
do not apply and do not warrant consolidating the actions or staying the
unlawful detainer case.     
Notice
of Related Case
            Relating and reassigning cases is
discretionary.  California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300(h)(1) provides, “In a court in which cases are assigned to a
single judge or department, cases may be ordered related.”  In the unlawful detainer case, the primary
issue is possession of the premises.  (Harris
v. Bissell (1921) 54 Cal.App. 307, 313.) 
This civil action does not involve the issue of possession.  Any right plaintiff may have to possess the
property based on this civil action would only arise if she wins the case and obtains
the remedy of specific performance.  Ordering
the cases related would not increase efficiency and would undermine the summary
nature of the unlawful detainer proceeding.
Disposition
            Plaintiff Andraya
Howard’s motion to consolidate actions and stay the unlawful detainer action is
denied.  The court finds this case
is not related to 22594 Zaltana Street LLC v. Andraya Michele Howard,
case No. 24CHUD00828.
