ORDER DENYING APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION PRO HAC VICE BY BROOKE PAYTON 
 
[TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION PRO HAC VICE BY MICHAEL WILLEMIN 
 
       The complaint alleges claims for gender
and pregnancy discrimination and related tort claims arising from the alleged
discrimination. 
       The proofs of service for each application
are defective. Applicants "must file with the court a verified application
together with proof of service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 1013a of a copy of the application and of the notice of
hearing of the application on all parties who have appeared in the cause and on
the State Bar of California at its San Francisco office." (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 9.40 subd. (c)(1).)
       Plaintiff’s counsel declares his intent
to serve the State Bar, which does not comply with Rule 9.40, requiring timely notice
in compliance with Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b). (Omar Bengali Decl., ¶ 5.) The proof
of service for each application does not reflect that the State Bar was served
with the applications. The application fee, which may be set by the State Bar,
is no longer $50. (Cal.
Rules of Court, 9.40, subd. (e); CA
State Bar Rules, App. A.)
       Accordingly, both applications are
DENIED.
