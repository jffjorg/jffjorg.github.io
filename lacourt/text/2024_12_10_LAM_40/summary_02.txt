And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendants, Eastern Revenue, Inc. and Kyle Shanahan, under Code of Civil Procedure § 128.5. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants engaged in bad faith tactics, including the unauthorized practice of law by Mr. Hogan, who is not a licensed California attorney. However, the judge found that there was no evidence of subjective bad faith conduct and that Mr. Hogan intended to apply for admission pro hac vice. The judge also found that the defendants' failure to respond to the plaintiff's request for additional dates and times for the deposition of Defendant Eastern was not sanctionable conduct. The judge awarded the defendants $3,000 in fees incurred in opposing the motion, payable by the plaintiff within 30 days.
