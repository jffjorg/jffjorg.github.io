Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Nationwide Pallets, Inc.'s motion in part to quash service of summons, set aside default judgment, recall writ of execution, and dismiss action for failure to serve. The court finds that service of summons was not properly accomplished on Nationwide Pallets, Inc. and that the default judgment and writ of execution are void due to lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The court orders the writ of execution to be recalled and the funds obtained pursuant to the void writ to be returned. The court also denies Nationwide Pallets, Inc.'s request to dismiss the action for failure to serve.
