Summary:

This tentative ruling by the Judge addresses the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants Fraser Ross and Kitross Apparel Los Angeles, LLC (collectively, "Defendants") in a breach of contract case. The Defendants contend that the Operating Agreement and 2016 Memorandum are voidable due to illegal activities, specifically the unauthorized practice of law by Plaintiff Glenn Feldman. The Judge finds that the Operating Agreement is not, on its face, illegal and that the Defendants have not met their burden in establishing the illegality of the agreement. The Judge also finds that the 2016 Memorandum is unclear and does not specify that the general counsel and advice is specific to the on-going California litigation. The Judge denies the Defendants' motion for summary judgment and grants summary adjudication of the Ninth Cause of Action for conversion.
