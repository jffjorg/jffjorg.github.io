And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff, Mirikian, is suing Chipotle for personal injuries resulting from a door coming off its hinges and pulling him to the ground. The plaintiff claims physical, mental, and emotional injuries, including a deep scar on his leg, severe headaches, and other medical problems. The defense is seeking to investigate whether there are alternative causes for the plaintiff's medical conditions, and has asked questions at deposition to that end. The judge finds that the questions asked were reasonable, but that the plaintiff's objections were improper and should be overruled. The judge is inclined to grant the defense's motion to compel the plaintiff to answer relevant questions, and will hear argument on the matter at the upcoming hearing on September 24, 2024.
