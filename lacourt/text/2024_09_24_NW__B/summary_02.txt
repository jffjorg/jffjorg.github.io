And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel discovery from the plaintiff, Mirikian, in a personal injury lawsuit against Chipotle. The plaintiff claims he suffered injuries, including a deep scar, severe headaches, and other medical problems, when a door at a Chipotle restaurant came off its hinges and pulled him to the ground. The judge believes the defense has a right to investigate whether there are other reasons for the plaintiff's current medical conditions that were not caused by the incident. The judge has allowed the defense to ask the plaintiff questions about his health and mental conditions, and has overruled the plaintiff's objections. The judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel seems to misunderstand the law, and is requiring the plaintiff to answer relevant questions to allow the defense to investigate issues related to its defense.
