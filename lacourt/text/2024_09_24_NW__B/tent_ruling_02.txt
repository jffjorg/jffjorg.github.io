 Case Number:  22VECV00647    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  B 22STCV12586 Mirikian v ChipotleThis is an action for personal injuries resulting from a claim that a door to a restaurant came off of its hinges and pulled plaintiff to the ground, with a deep scar on his leg, severe headaches and other medical problems due to the “violent pulling of his body by a very heavy door that feel on the ground.”  [Complaint.]  In other words, plaintiff claims injuries to multiple parts of his body. Plaintiff has put his medical conditions into issue as he claims physical, mental and emotional conditions, and traumatic brain injuries.  Because of the very wide scope of the injuries claimed -- physical and mental -- defense is entitled to investigate whether there are other reasons for plaintiff’s current conditions which were not caused by this incident.  Therefore, the questions asked of him at deposition were very reasonable.  The objections, however, were improper and should be overruled, and plaintiff directed to answer questions concerning his health and mental conditions.  Plaintiff’s counsel appears to misunderstand the law; it is not whether the medical conditions “are unrelated” (plaintiff’s position) but whether the defense has a right to prove that the other medical conditions “are related.”  By refusing to answer relevant, non-privileged questions, plaintiff is barring the defense from investigation of issues related to its defense.  These questions also relate to life expectancy which is definitely related to future non-economic damages.  Furthermore, some questions relate to injuries he may have suffered to the same parts of his body in a subsequent fall, also absolutely discoverable.  Finally, the question of whether the chiropractor was selected by has attorney is not privileged.In light of the upcoming trial date, the court would be inclined to grant the motion in the first instance and will hear argument.
