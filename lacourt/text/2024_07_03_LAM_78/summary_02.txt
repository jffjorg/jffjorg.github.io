The Judge, Hon. Jill Feeney, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of JOSE HERNANDEZ vs. STRUCTURAL CONCRETE GROUP, INC., et al. The case involves allegations of disability discrimination, hostile work environment, and battery by the Defendant's supervisor, Ismael Gutierrez, against Plaintiff Jose Hernandez. The Plaintiff filed motions to compel the Defendant's responses to written discovery, including Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production. The Defendant filed oppositions to the motions.

The Judge denied the Plaintiff's motions to compel the Defendant's responses, finding that the Defendant has served verified responses to protect its interests. However, the Judge found that the Defendant's repeated failures to serve timely discovery responses constitute discovery abuse and granted the Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $2,180. The sanctions are payable within 15 days after the date of the order.
