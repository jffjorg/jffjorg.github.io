Case No.:  19STCV09195 Hearing Date:  July 3, 2024   [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:   MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT FILED BY DEFENDANTS/CROSS-COMPLAINANTS FARHAD AND ELHAM YAGHOUBI The motion to enforce settlement filed by Farhad and Elham Yaghoubi is GRANTEDThe request for attorney’s fees is DENIED.Moving parties must file a proposed judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement within five court days after the date of this order.Moving party to give notice.FACTUAL BACKGROUND   This is an action for breach of contract, fraud, rescission, and conversion. Plaintiff Brian Neman alleges that in April 2017, he entered into a written agreement with Defendants Farhad and Elham Yaghoubi to buy a commercial building for $1,000,000. (FAC ¶9.) Although Plaintiff delivered $1,000,000, Defendants failed to deliver the property by the promised date and refused to return the funds according to the agreement. (FAC ¶¶10-14.) On June 6, 2024, the Yaghoubis filed this motion to enforce settlement. The motion is not opposed.DISCUSSIONThe Yaghoubis move to enforce settlement against Cross-Defendants Alfonso Guerrero, Albert Arana, and VIP ENT. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, “if parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”  “Section 664.6 was enacted to provide a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without the need for a new lawsuit.”  (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.)    To be enforceable under Code Civ Proc., section 664.6, any written settlement agreement outside of court must be signed by the parties and their counsel. Although the Court may adjudicate disputes over the terms of the settlement agreement, the Court may not modify terms from what was agreed to by the parties. (Machado v. Myers (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 779, 797.)Here, the Yaghoubis and Cross-Defendants executed a settlement agreement on March 27, 2024. (Motion, Exh. 1.) The Yaghoubis agreed to accept, and Cross-Defendants agreed to pay, $125,000, some paid by insurance, in exchange for a mutual release of claims. (Motion, pdf pp.10-11.) Arana, Alfonso, Guerrero, and VIP ENT, Inc. agreed to pay $50,000 within 10 days and $25,000 within 30 days of execution of the settlement agreement for a total of $75,000. (Id.) Cross-Defendants thereafter failed to make the first payment and instead offered to make $5,000 monthly payments. (Kohrs Decl., ¶3; Motion, Exh. 2.) The settlement agreement provided that the Court would retain jurisdiction over this action and that a settling party could move to enforce settlement under Code Civ. Proc., section 664.6. (Motion, pdf p.12.) Here, the Court has jurisdiction to grant a motion under Code Civ. Proc., section 664.6. Additionally, Cross-Defendants are in breach of their settlement agreement with the Yaghoubis because they failed to make payment according to the agreement. Cross-Defendants did not oppose this motion and thus fail to dispute that they are in breach of the settlement agreement. Therefore, the motion to enforce settlement filed by the Yaghoubis is granted.The Yaghoubis also move for attorney’s fees, arguing that the agreement only stated that each party would handle their own attorney’s fees up through the execution of the agreement. The Yaghoubis argue that they should be entitled to collect attorney’s fees because they were the prevailing party and attorney’s fees are authorized by the underlying contract. (Motion, pdf p. 5.) However this request falls outside the scope of Code Civ. Proc., section 664.6. The settlement agreement does not state that any party seeking to enforce the agreement would be entitled to attorney’s fees. Although the contract underlying this action authorizes attorney’s fees, section 664.6 only empowers the Court to enter judgment according to the terms of the settlement. Because there is nothing in the settlement agreement authorizing fees for a party seeking to enforce the agreement, the Yaghoubis’ request for attorney’s fees is denied. DATED: July 3, 2024 ________________________Hon.
