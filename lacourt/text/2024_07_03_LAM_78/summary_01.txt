And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to enforce settlement filed by Farhad and Elham Yaghoubi against Cross-Defendants Alfonso Guerrero, Albert Arana, and VIP ENT. The settlement agreement was executed on March 27, 2024, and provided for Cross-Defendants to pay $75,000 in two installments. However, Cross-Defendants failed to make the first payment and instead offered to make $5,000 monthly payments. The judge has jurisdiction to grant the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 and finds that Cross-Defendants are in breach of their settlement agreement.

The judge has denied the Yaghoubis' request for attorney's fees, as the settlement agreement does not authorize fees for a party seeking to enforce the agreement. The judge has ordered the moving parties to file a proposed judgment within five court days after the date of this order and to give notice.

The underlying facts of the case include a breach of contract, fraud, rescission, and conversion by the defendants, who failed to deliver a commercial building and refused to return the funds paid by the plaintiff.
