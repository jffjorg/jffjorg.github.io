Plaintiff Jose Hernandez alleges that he was an employee of Defendant Structural Concrete Group, Inc. working under his supervisor, Defendant Ismael Gutierrez. Gutierrez engaged in unwelcome touching and striking of employees. When Plaintiff asked Gutierrez to stop this behavior, Gutierrez began striking Plaintiff’s head and private areas. Plaintiff took time off from work due to stress and was terminated on the date he was supposed to return to work.PROCEDURAL HISTORY On March 17, 2023, Plaintiff Jose Hernandez filed his Complaint against Defendants Structural Concrete Group, Inc. (SCG) and Ismael Gutierrez.On March 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed these motions to compel SCG’s responses to Form Interrogatories (FROGs) (General and Employment Law) and Requests for Production (RPDs), set one. On June 20, 2024, SCG filed oppositions.On June 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.DISCUSSION Plaintiff’s counsel testifies that he propounded the first set of written discovery on SCG on August 31, 2023. (Osorio Decl., ¶3.) Responses were due by October 3, 2023. (Id., ¶4.) On October 2, 2023, SCG’s counsel requested an extension to November 3, 2023 which Plaintiff’s counsel granted. (Id., ¶5.) SCG requested a second extension on October 31, 2023 which Plaintiff denied. (Id., ¶6.) As of the date this motion was filed, SCG has not served RFA responses. (Id., ¶7.) At the last status conference in this case, SCG’s counsel represented that the reason SCG has not responded to the discovery requests was because SCG has not been communicating with its counsel. (Id., ¶8.)In opposition, SCG’s counsel testifies that his office began losing contact with SCG around September 11, 2023. (Soleimanpour Decl., ¶7.) SCG’s counsel contacted SCG’s principal about the missing responses and received no response. (Id., ¶8.) After receiving no response to phone calls and emails, SCG’s counsel requested an extension from Plaintiff to November 3, 2023. (Id., ¶¶9-10.) SCG’s counsel successfully contacted SCG on October 9, 2023. (Id., ¶11.) However, SCG failed to provide the information its counsel requested. (Id., ¶¶11-12.) On November 6, 2023, SCG’s counsel contacted SCG again and represented he would withdraw as counsel due to lack of communication. (Id., ¶14.) SCG and its counsel elected to attempt to continue the attorney-client relationship. (Id.) However, SCG again failed to provide the information necessary to complete the discovery responses. (Id., ¶¶15-16.) On March 7, 2024, SCG’s counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel.  (Id., ¶18.) After receiving Plaintiff’s motions to compel discovery, SCG’s counsel attempted to meet with SCG again and SCG failed to appear for a scheduled videoconference. (Id., ¶21.) SCG’s counsel attempted unsuccessfully to contact SCG throughout April and May 2024. (Id., ¶¶22-26.) After accidentally missing the hearing for Plaintiff’s motion to deem requests for admissions admitted, SCG’s counsel served discovery responses to protect SCG’s interests. (Id., ¶¶26-27.) SCG’s counsel then hired a private investigator to contact SCG to obtain verifications so that counsel could serve supplemental responses on June 18, 2024. (Id., ¶29.)Because SCG served verified responses before the hearing on this matter, Plaintiff’s motions to compel SCG’s responses are denied. Although Plaintiff argues that the responses are not code compliant, such issues will have to be pursued through  motions to compel further.SCG’s repeated failures to serve timely discovery responses constitute discovery abuse. The Court will award a reduced amount of $2,180 in sanctions for five hours of attorney time at a rate of $400 per hour and filing fees for three motions against SCG.DATED: July 3, 2024____________________________ Hon.
