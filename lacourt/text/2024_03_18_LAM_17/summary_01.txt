And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Southern Motion's omnibus motion to compel further responses to its Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories. Southern Motion is sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $5,600, payable within 20 days of entry of this order. This is in addition to the previous sanction of $2,800. The Judge finds that Southern Motion's motion is misleading and that its conduct amounts to an abuse of the discovery process. The Judge notes that Southern Motion's responses included both objections and substantive responses, and that the motion strongly appears to be an act of gamesmanship rather than a good faith effort to engage in discovery.
