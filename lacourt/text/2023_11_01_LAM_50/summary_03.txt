Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a cross-complaint filed by J&I Consulting, Inc. against Central Metal, Inc. and Jong Uk Byun. The cross-complaint alleges that Central Metal, Inc. and Jong Uk Byun breached a consulting agreement and failed to pay a consulting fee. The Court has sustained the demurrer, finding that J&I Consulting, Inc. lacks standing to bring the claims because it is not a licensed real estate broker or salesperson. The Court has ordered J&I Consulting, Inc. to file an amended cross-complaint, if any, within 20 days of the date of the order, and has ordered Central Metal, Inc. to file a proposed judgment of dismissal within 30 days of the date of the order if no amended cross-complaint is filed.
