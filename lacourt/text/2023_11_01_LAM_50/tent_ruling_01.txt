TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
MOTIONS TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL (3)



 
James
Orland, Esq. of the Orland Law Group (“Counsel”) moves
to be relieved as counsel of record for Defendants GJ United Group, Inc., Jesus Gallegos,
and Guillermo Rojas. 
The Court finds that Counsel has complied
with the relevant procedural requirements (CRC 3.1362) and has provided
sufficient reason for withdrawal. Accordingly, the motions to be relieved as
counsel will be granted.¿
The Court notes that after
the instant motions were filed, the Court issued a minute order on September 27, 2023
indicating, inter alia, that “[p]ursuant to written stipulation, the
Final Status Conference scheduled for 10/20/2023 is continued to 02/23/2024 at
10:00 AM in Department 50 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. Pursuant to written
stipulation, the Jury Trial scheduled for 11/08/2023 is continued to 03/06/2024
at 09:30 AM in Department 50 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. Pursuant to written
stipulation, the Non-Appearance Case Review RE: Lodging of Trial Readiness and
Exhibit Binders scheduled for 10/13/2023 is continued to 02/16/2024 at 04:00 PM
in Department 50 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.” Thus, the proposed orders for the
instant motions list the incorrect dates for the Non-Appearance Case Review,
the Final Status Conference, and the Jury Trial. 
In
addition, after the instant motions to be relieved as counsel were filed, a
motion for sanctions was filed and noticed for hearing on May 9, 2024. Thus,
the proposed orders for the instant motions do not list such hearing. The Court notes
that “[t]he proposed order relieving counsel…must specify all hearing dates
scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (e).) 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court orders Counsel to file and serve revised proposed orders
within five days of this order.  
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this
order.
