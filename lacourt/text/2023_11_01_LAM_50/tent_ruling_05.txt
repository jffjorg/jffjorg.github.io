TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF
  DOCUMENTS, SET ONE



 
Plaintiff
Zachary Fuqua (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order to strike Defendant Jaguar Land
Rover North America, LLC’s objections and compel further responses to
Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Request Nos. 5, 6,
10, 11, 13, 14, 17, and 19 through 37. 
Plaintiff’s motion will be
continued to a new date as set forth below. NO HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON NOVEMBER 1, 2023.  
Pursuant to the
Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court
orders the parties in this case to participate in an Informal Discovery
Conference (“IDC”). (Note:¿The Court’s policy regarding IDCs appears in the
Courtroom Information available in Dept. 50 and on the Court’s website.)¿Lead
or other designated counsel for the parties with full authority are ordered to
participate in person in an IDC. After consulting with opposing counsel
regarding available dates, Plaintiff must make
a prompt reservation for the IDC using the Court’s online reservation system. Plaintiff
must file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC form in the
department seven days prior to the IDC, and the responding parties may file the
same form in the department setting forth a response three days prior to the
IDC.¿    
 
Once Plaintiff has
confirmed an IDC date, Plaintiff must use the
Court’s online reservation system to continue the motion to a post-IDC
discovery hearing date. The parties are ordered to have with them whatever
materials are needed to make the IDC session productive and successful. Prior
to the IDC date, lead or other designated counsel for the parties, with full
authority, are to meet and confer, in person or via telephone
in a further attempt to resolve as many of the issues as possible before
the IDC. (See CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).) If the parties resolve
their discovery disputes before the IDC date, Plaintiff is ordered to take both the IDC and the motion off calendar
as soon as possible.¿ 
Plaintiff
is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
