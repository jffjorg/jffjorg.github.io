 Case Number:  23STCV12420    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  26 The Request for Entry
of Default Judgment submitted on 11/16/24 is denied without prejudice for the
following reasons:
 
Plaintiff has failed
to submit sufficient evidence to support the amount of emotional distress
damages ($200,000) that Plaintiff seeks. 
If Plaintiff has any additional evidence pertaining to the amount of
emotional distress damages that Plaintiff seeks, Plaintiff may submit it
together with a new default judgment package.
 
Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s
fees is not calculated in accordance with LASC Rule 3.214.  Nor is Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s
fees supported by a declaration explaining why a greater amount should be
awarded, including an itemized statement of the services rendered or to be
rendered. Plaintiff must either: (1) submit a new request for default judgment (CIV-100)
and new proposed judgment (JUD-100) with an amount of attorney’s fees
calculated in accordance with LASC Rule 3.214 or (2) submit evidence and
briefing justifying a greater amount of attorney’s fees than the calculation
pursuant to LASC Rule 3.214.
 
Plaintiff should submit a new default
judgment correcting these defects within three weeks.  The OSC re entry of default judgment is
continued to February 26, 2024 at 8:30 am.
 
Court Clerk to give notice.
