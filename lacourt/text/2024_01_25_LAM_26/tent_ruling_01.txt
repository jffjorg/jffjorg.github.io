Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate why the

Design, Inc. jointly and severally and a second, separate judgment for $942,047.85
against Defendants Lion Den, LLC and Constantina Frial jointly and severally.
 
If Plaintiff proceeds with the latter option,
the Court requests that Plaintiff email an electronic Word version of the
proposed judgments to Department 26.  Plaintiff
should cc all other parties in this action who have appeared on the email to
avoid any ex parte communication.
 
Plaintiff should submit a new default
judgment correcting these defects within three weeks.  The OSC re entry of default judgment is
continued to February 27, 2024 at 8:30 am.
