And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a request for entry of default judgment, denying the request without prejudice. The reasons for the denial are that the plaintiff failed to submit sufficient evidence to support the amount of emotional distress damages claimed ($200,000) and that the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees is not calculated in accordance with LASC Rule 3.214. The plaintiff is given three weeks to submit a new default judgment package with corrected calculations and supporting evidence. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to February 26, 2024 at 8:30 am.
