 Case Number:  23STCV16506    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  26 23STCV16506 (Garcia) Default Judgment Rjxn 1.25.24
Partial Review
 
The Request for Entry
of Default Judgment submitted on 12/12/24 is denied without prejudice for the
following reasons:
 
On January 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint.  
 
By operation of law, Plaintiff's
filing of an amended complaint has reopened all previously entered defaults
(based on a prior complaint).
 
Plaintiff must serve the amended
complaint and amended summons on all named Defendants (via personal service,
substitute service, notice + acknowledgment, or publication etc.).  
Service of the amended complaint and amended summons by mail on defendants who
have never appeared in this action is insufficient.
 
If Defendant fails to timely file a
responsive pleading following proper service of the amended complaint and
amended summons, Plaintiff may seek Defendant’s default on the amended
complaint.
 
The Court hereby sets an OSC re proof
of service of the amended summons and first amended complaint for February 27,
2024 at 8:30 am.
Court Clerk to give notice.
