And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling continues the hearing on Plaintiff Barry Rosen's motion for entry of default judgment and to appoint a receiver to February 1, 2024. This is because Defendant Clark Drive Homeowners Association's motion to set aside default is also set for hearing on the same date. The Judge is seeking additional information from both parties, including whether Plaintiff's Counsel was aware that Defendant was represented by counsel before seeking entry of default, and whether Plaintiff's Counsel ever advised opposing counsel of their impending request for entry of default. The Judge is relying on previous court cases (Shapell Socal Rental Properties, LLC v. Chico's FAS, Inc. and Lasalle v. Vogel) to guide their decision.
