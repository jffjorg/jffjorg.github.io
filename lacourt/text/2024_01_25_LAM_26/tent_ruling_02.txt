 Case Number:  23STCV07034    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  26 Section
8 of the CIV-100 Form is incomplete.  Though
Counsel has signed the declaration, no selection indicating whether Defendant
is a nonmilitary status has been completed. 
Default judgment cannot be entered against a service member in the
military service of the United States. 
Accordingly, until the section 8 of the CIV-100 is fully completed,
default judgment cannot be entered.
 
Accordingly,
prior to the commencement of the OSC hearing on January 25, 2024, Plaintiff is
to file a corrected CIV-100.  Otherwise,
the OSC will have to be continued to a later date.
