 Case Number:  23STLC01807    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  26             On March
17, 2023, Plaintiff Barry Rosen (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action to
involuntarily dissolve Defendant Clark Drive Homeowners Association
(“Defendant”).  On May 4, 2023, default
was entered against Defendant.  
            On July
7, 2023, Defendant concurrently filed motions to set aside the default and a
demurrer to the complaint.  On August 2,
2023, Defendant’s motion to set aside the default and demurrer were taken off
calendar in the limited civil department because the action was reclassified as
an unlimited civil case and transferred for reassignment to an Independent
Calendar Court.  (Minute Order
8/2/23.)   On August 8, 2023, the instant
action was reassigned to the current department. 
            On
August 29, 2023, Defendant re-filed its motion to set aside the default set to
be heard February 1, 2024.  Approximately
four months later -- on January 5, 2024 -- Plaintiff filed the instant motion
for entry of default judgment and to appoint a receiver set to be heard January
25, 2024.  
            Given
that Defendant’s motion to set aside default is set for hearing on February 1,
2024, the Court hereby continues the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion for entry of
default judgment and to appoint a receiver to the same hearing date of February
1, 2024.
            The
Court requests that each party file supplemental evidence explaining: (1) whether
Plaintiff’s Counsel was aware that Defendant was represented by counsel before
Plaintiff sought entry of default on May 4, 2023, and (2) whether prior to
seeking entry of default Plaintiff’s Counsel ever advised opposing counsel of his
impending request for entry of default.  (Shapell

198, 213; Lasalle v. Vogel (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 127, 137.)
            The
Court’s Judicial Assistant shall give notice to all parties.
