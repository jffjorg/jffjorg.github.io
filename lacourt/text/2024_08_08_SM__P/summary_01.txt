And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of American Express National Bank v. Sealey, Case No. 21SMCV01587. American Express moves to vacate the dismissal of the action and enter judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 (CCP 664.6) for non-payment of the settlement agreement. The parties had reached a conditional settlement, which was dismissed by the court under CCP 664.6 after the parties reached an agreement. American Express now seeks to enforce the settlement agreement and enter judgment against Sealey, who has defaulted on the required payments. The court finds that the settlement agreement is valid and binding, and that the parties have agreed to be bound by the terms of the agreement. The court also finds that it has jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement because the parties filed a stipulation, which includes CCP 664.6 language, and is signed by both parties. The court grants American Express's motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment under the stipulation.
