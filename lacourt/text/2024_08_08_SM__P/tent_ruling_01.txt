American Express
National Bank v. Sealey, Case No. 21SMCV01587
Hearing date:
August 8, 2024 
American Express’s
Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment Pursuant to CCP 664.6 (UNOPPOSED)
 
Plaintiff American Express National Bank sued defendant
Sealey for failure to pay credit card debt. The court dismissed the action,
under CCP 664.6, after the parties reached a conditional settlement. American
Express moves to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment pursuant to CCP 664.6
for non-payment of the settlement agreement. No opposition has been filed. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 states: “If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement
of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” Code Civ. Proc. §664.6(a)
[emphasis added]. For purposes of the statute, “a writing is signed by a party
if it is signed by any of the following [among other individuals]: (1) ¶ The
party. (2) ¶ An attorney who represents the party.” Code Civ. Proc. §664.6(b)
[emphasis added]. 
“On a motion to enforce, the court must determine
whether the settlement agreement is valid and binding. [Citation.] The court
assesses whether the material terms of the settlement were reasonably
well-defined and certain, and whether the parties expressly acknowledged that
they understood and agreed to be bound by those terms. [In re Marriage of
Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 911.]” Estate of Jones
(2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 948, 952. 
The court may interpret the terms and conditions of a
settlement, Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566, but the
court may not create material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding
what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed upon. Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810.
The court has jurisdiction
because the parties filed a stipulation, which includes §664.6 language, and is
signed by both parties. Exhibit A ¶4. The stipulation allows ex parte enforcement
upon default. Id. ¶2. American Express’s attorney provides a declaration
stating Sealey defaulted by failing to make required payments. Keith decl. ¶10.
Considering this evidence, entry of judgment under the stipulation is
appropriate. GRANTED.
