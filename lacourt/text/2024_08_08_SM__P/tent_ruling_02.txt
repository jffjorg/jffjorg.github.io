Yu v. Rari Capital
Infrastructure, et al. Case No. 22SMCV01367 
Hearing date:
August 1, 2024 continued to August 8, 2024
Defendants’ Motion
for Summary Judgment and/or Summary Adjudication
 
Yu alleges damages
stemming from defendants’ wrongful misappropriation and theft of his
cryptocurrency tokens by interfering with the 24-month vesting schedule for the
plaintiff's allocation of 70,000 Rari Governance Tokens (RGT) from Rari
Capital, Inc. despite it being a specified term in an allocation letter. 
 
The court ruled in part on the motion for summary
judgment on 6/7/24 and continued the hearing on Yu’s conversion and Penal Code
§496c claims involving Fei and allowed the parties to submit additional briefs
on those two matters. See 6/7/24 Minute Order. The court has reviewed the
additional briefings and has determined that the tentative decision remains
unchanged based on the presented evidence.
Yu’s supplemental brief contends there are triable
issues in both conversion and theft under Penal Code 496(c), arguing that 1)
Fei had the motive to take Yu’s governance tokens because Santoro testified he
was frustrated with Yu’s abstention vote and pushed Longarzo to claw back Yu’s
tokens to punish him; 2) Fei effectively took possession of Yu’s RGTs because
they reside in a digital lockbox that Fei controls; and 3) a jury can infer the
existence of additional communications that could further implicate Fei Labs. 
Yu claims that his vote to abstain and expressed reservations
about the merger frustrated Santoro, citing Santoro’s deposition. Supp. Abbott
Decl., Ex. 1 at 102:3-15. When put in context, Santoro testified he did not
recall being frustrated by the vote to abstain but might have been. This does
not support a finding of criminal intent because Santoro’s subjective feelings
or failure to recall them does not sufficiently prove his intent to deprive Yu
of his property. Diego v. City of Los Angeles (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 338,
356. The conversations between Santoro and Longarzo additionally do not support
the intention argument because it is also speculative as to Santoro’s state of
mind. 
Next, Yu argues that Longarzo, acting on behalf of Fei
Labs, transferred Yu’s tokens to the Peg Exchanger contract, which Fei Labs
wrote and controls. Abbott Decl., Ex. 1 at 134:5-10, 144:19-22; Supp. Garrie
Decl., ¶¶ 7-10. Fei wrote and deployed the peg exchange contract and still
controls the contract, since nothing indicates that control has been
transferred from Fei since its creation. Abbott Decl., Ex. 1 at 142:11-25; Ex.
2 at 106:2-17; Supp. Garrie Decl., ¶ 11. This is not persuasive as it
misrepresents the record. Santoro testified the peg exchanger contract was
self-executing and required no middleman to control the tokens. Abbott Decl.,
Ex. 2 at 107:22-108:2. This does not deviate from the court’s previous order
finding that Fei did not take any action to affect any of Yu’s property apart
from writing the contract. 
The court adopts this addendum to the prior tentative ruling
as to conversion and 496(c). GRANTED.
The court continued the hearing to consider the
objections to the supplemental declaration of Joseph Santoro. While the court
did not rely on the declaration in making its determination, the court
nonetheless overrules the objections, as the statements made are not legal
determinations.
