Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and has made some tentative rulings. The Regents of the University of California have demurred to the first three causes of action, arguing immunity as a matter of law and failure to plead sufficient facts. The judge disagrees with the Regents' argument that the arrest was without privilege and finds that the complaint pleads enough facts at the pleadings stage.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the cause of action for false imprisonment, finding that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge also sustains the demurrer to the cause of action for violation of the Bane Act, finding that the complaint fails to allege excessive force on the part of the defendants or false arrest and thus fails to allege that the defendants interfered with the plaintiff's constitutional or statutory rights by threatening or committing violent acts.

The judge gives the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The case is set for hearing on August 8, 2024.
