Here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the evidence presented to the court before the hearing date. The case involves a lemon law action filed by Gail Chelebian against General Motors, LLC, regarding a 2017 Chevrolet Bolt purchased with defects. The court granted in part the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production, and the defendant filed an opposition. The court is inclined to order General Motors to provide a duplicate copy of its actual verified written response, plus the Bates-numbered documents produced, to determine compliance. The court is frustrated by the lack of transparency and clarity in the parties' submissions, making it difficult for the court to make an independent determination of compliance. The judge is seeking a clearer presentation of the evidence to resolve the dispute.
