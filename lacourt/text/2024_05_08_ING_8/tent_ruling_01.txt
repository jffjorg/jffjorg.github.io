GRANTED, and sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff and his counsel in the
amount of $3,082.
 
                                                (3)
Defendant’s motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories is
GRANTED as to Interrogatories No. 1, 2, 12, 15–17, 19, 22, 24,
25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36–40, 43, 45, 46, 49, 51, 52, 55, 57, 58, 61–64,
67, and 69, and DENIED as to the others. Partial sanctions are awarded in the amount
of $2,082 given the partial success and partial lack of success of the motion
as detailed below.
 
                                                (4)
Defendant’s motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories is
GRANTED as to Interrogatories No. 9.1 and 17.1, and DENIED as to

I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ ¿¿¿ 
1.      
Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿ This is an action for partition. The Second Amended
Complaint alleges that the current owners of real property located on 129th
Street in Hawthorne are the Plaintiff trustee of the Jan Agarwala Separate
Property Trust, and two other trusts. (SAC ¶ 27.) A dispute has arisen between
Plaintiff and Defendants regarding the management and sale of the property, and
Plaintiff seeks partition by sale. (SAC ¶¶ 32–34.) 
 
Cross-Complainants Pronita Ann Agarwala,
Sabina Agarwala Miro, Stephen Miro and Sabina Miro seek an order quieting title
to the property, seeking a declaration that the Agarwala defendants have no
individual interest in the property at issue. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 15.) 
2.      
¿¿Procedural  
The Complaint was filed on January
5, 2024, and the cross-complaint was filed on April 20, 2023.  Plaintiff filed the present motion to compel
on February 2024. Defendants filed an opposition on March 28, 2024. Plaintiff
filed a reply on April 2, 2024.
 
Defendant Darlene Agarwala filed
the present motions to compel further on January 26, 2024. Plaintiff filed
oppositions on March 7, 2024. Defendant filed replies on March 13, 2024.
 
On April 11, 2024, this Court
directed the parties to meet and confer regarding the special interrogatories
and requests for production (at issue in a motion not set currently set for
hearing) and directed the filing of a truncated separate statement of the
special interrogatories remaining at issue by May 2, 2024. That separate
statement was filed on May 3, 2024.
 
II. ANALYSIS¿¿ ¿¿ 
 
A.    MOTIONS TO COMPEL
1.              
Legal Standard ¿¿ 
A propounding party may demand a responding party to produce documents
that are in their possession, custody or control. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by propounding
interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the production
demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the ability to
comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210.) The
responding party must respond to the interrogatories by answering or objecting.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the responding party fails to serve
timely responses, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses to the production demand and interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300.) 
A party who fails to serve a
timely response to interrogatories or a demand for inspection waives any
objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) 
Likewise, “[a]ny party may obtain discovery . . . by a written
request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness of specified
documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact,
or application of law to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter
that is in controversy between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.) If a party fails to serve a timely
response to requests for admissions, “[t]he requesting party may move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 subd. (b).)
A party who fails to timely
respond to requests for admission waives all objections to the requests. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
2.              
Discussion   
¿ Plaintiff Paul Herrera (Plaintiff) seeks to compel
responses to the following discovery from the following parties:
·      
Form Interrogatories, Set Three, from Defendant
Darlene Agarwala;
·      
Special Interrogatories, Set Three, and Requests
for Production, Set Two, from Defendant Pronita Agarwala;
·      
Special Interrogatories, Set Three, and Requests
for Production, Set Two, from Defendant Sabina Agarwala Miro;
·      
Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests
for Production, Set Two, from Defendant Stephen Miro;
·      
Gregory Mollner.
(Motion at pp. 2–3.)
Plaintiff also seeks an order deeming matters admitted against Defendant
Darlene Agarwala. (Motion at p. 3.) 
All of the above discovery
was served upon Defendants on November 16, 2023, with responses due on February
23, 2024, pursuant to extensions agreed to by the parties.. (Amboss Decl.
¶¶ 2–7.) However, no responses were timely served. (Amboss Decl. ¶ 8.)
Defendants in opposition
argue that the motion is procedurally improper, as it is filed by Paul Herrera,
rather than Catherine Herrera, the party who served the discovery. (Motion at
pp. 2–3.) Defendants also argue that the motion impermissibly combines ten
separate sets of discovery responses against four defendants into one motion.
(Motion at pp. 3–4.) Defendants finally argue that the motion is moot, as all
defendants other than Gregory Mollner (who is deceased) have served responses.
(Opposition at p. 4; Stein Decl. ¶ 6.) 
The Court disagrees with Defendants’ procedural objections, but agrees
that the motion to compel initial responses is moot given the tardy responses
served before the hearing on this motion. 

There is no procedural
defect with the present motion. Paul Herrera may bring the motion to compel,
even though Catherine Herrera served the discovery, because, as stated in the
Second Amended Complaint filed on January 5, 2024, Catherine Herrera has
resigned as trustee of the plaintiff trust, and Paul Herrera has assumed the
duties of a successor trustee. (SAC ¶¶ 2–3.) As this is an action prosecuted by
the trustee of a particular trust, Paul Herrera may seek responses to discovery
propounded by his predecessor.
There is also no material
defect in the combining of discovery responses and defendants in this single
motion. While a party could potentially use such a practice to evade
restrictions on a court’s calendar and seek resolution of multiple complex
issues in a single omnibus discovery motion, that is not what occurred here. As
noted in the motion, all discovery at issue here was served on November 16,
2023, and the main issue is simply whether responses were served by the date
agreed. To separate these motions into ten separate filings would increase
the burden on the Court and parties, not reduce it.
However, Plaintiff does not
contest that responses have been provided since the motion was filed. Although
Plaintiff argues that the requests for admission should nonetheless be deemed
admitted, this is specifically prohibited by statute, since an order deeming
admissions shall be made unless responses are served “before the hearing on the
motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (b).) Accordingly, the motion to
deem the RFAs admitted is MOOTED since belated responses have been served
before the hearing.  As the Court advised
the parties on May 7 during the ex parte hearing to advance a motion to set
aside deemed admissions, there is no need to combine the hearings on the Motion
to Deem RFAs admitted with the now-mooted motion for relief from deemed
admissions.  The fact that counsel could
not resolve that issue without Court involvement, even after the Court gave its
view of how it would be resolving the Plaintiff’s motion, is troubling for the
future of this case.
This leaves only the
question of sanctions. The prevailing party on a motion to compel is generally
entitled to monetary sanctions, unless the court “finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290,
2031.300.) Sanctions are also mandatory against a party whose failure to serve
responses to requests for admission makes the motion necessary. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).) The Court is aware of the general rule
that “If a party fails to serve a timely response, and the propounding
party moves for and obtains a court order compelling a response, the trial
court must impose a monetary sanction against the delinquent party unless that
party acted with ‘substantial justification’ or the sanction would otherwise be
unjust.”  (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 404.)  Here, the Court finds the highly
unusual circumstances that would make the imposition of monetary sanctions
unjust.  
 
Plaintiff seeks $1,500 in
sanctions against Defendants and their counsel. (Motion at p. 15.) But in the
declaration supporting the motion, Plaintiff seeks $4,075.00 in sanctions,
representing ten hours of attorney work at $400 per hour, plus $75 in filing
fees. (Fleck Decl. ¶ 16.)
No sanctions are warranted
here. The likely cause of the delay in serving responses was as stated in
Defendant’s opposition: the grave illness of Defendant Gregory Mollner, leading
to his death in January 2024, the illness and death of Defendant Stephen Miro’s
father in the same month, and Defense counsel’s contracting of COVID during
that month, and the illness and hospitalization of counsel’s mother in February
2024. (Agarwala Decl. ¶¶ 2–4; Stein Decl. ¶¶ 5–6.) Circumstances would make the
imposition of sanctions here unjust.  The
sanctions aspect of the motion is therefore DENIED.
B.    DEFENDANTS’
MOTIONS TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
1.     Legal
Standard
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to
the action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010(a).) If a
propounding party is not satisfied with the response served by a responding
party, the former may move the court to compel further interrogatory
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  The propounding party must demonstrate that the
responses were incomplete, inadequate or evasive, or that the responding party
asserted objections that are either without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a)(1)–(3); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403.)
A motion to compel further
responses to requests for admissions may be made on the grounds that an answer
is incomplete or evasive, or an objection is without merit. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.290, subd. (a)(1)–(2).)
2.     Discussion
Defendant Darlene Agarwala
filed motions on January 26, 2024, seeking further responses from Plaintiff
Paul Herrera to Form Interrogatories No. 9.1, 15.1, 17.1, 50.3, and 50.5;
Special Interrogatories No. 1–19, 21, 22, 24, 25, and 27–69; and Requests for
Admission No. 19, 20, and 60–63. 
On April 11, 2024, this Court,
per a stipulation of the parties, continued the hearing on these motions to May
8, 2024, and directed that the parties meet and confer regarding the discovery
at issue. The Court directed that a separate statement was to be filed containing
the Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production that remain at issue.
Such a statement addressed to the special interrogatories was filed on May 3,
2024, indicating that Special Interrogatories No. 1–8, 11–19, 21, 22, 24, 25,
27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36–40, 43, 45, 46, 49, 51, 52, 55, 57, 58, 61–64, 67,
and 69 remain at issue. 
a.     Requests
for Admission
The requests for admission
will be addressed first, as this is the simplest discovery dispute of those
presented. Responses to requests for admission must “[a]dmit so much of the
matter involved in the request as is true,” and “[d]eny so much of the matter
involved in the request is untrue.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.220, subd. (b)(1),
(2).)
A further response is
required as to Requests No. 19 and 20. These requests sought admissions that
the amount of capital contributions stated on an escrow closing statement
reflected “the capital contribution” of Jan Agarwala to the acquisition of a
given property, to which Plaintiff responded with admissions that it reflected
“a capital contribution” by Jan Agarwala, and a denial “that this number
reflects the entirety of Jan Agarwala’s contribution.” (Separate Statement at
pp. 3–4.) These responses are evasive, however, as they seek an admission or
denial concerning the amount of “the capital contribution of Jan Agarwala
toward the acquisition of the . . . property,” and Plaintiff’s response is
equivocal, admitting only that the amounts identified reflect “a capital
contribution,” and implying that other “contribution[s]” were made, without
stating whether these contributions were capital contributions toward the
acquisition of the property or some other type of contribution besides a
capital contribution. 
Plaintiff in opposition
contends that its response is proper because “Responding Party does not yet
have all the answers.” (Opposition at p. 5.) But he also contends in his
separate statement that it is his “understanding and belief that Jan
Agarwala  . . . contributed more than is
reflected  in the closing statement,” again
without specifying whether this “contribution” was a capital contribution to
the acquisition of the property. (Separate Statement at p. 5.) A further verified
admission or denial is required.
Requests No. 60–63 seek
admissions that, prior to Jan Agarwala’s death, Catherine Herrera obtained
documents related to the purchase, maintenance, income and expenses of the 12th
Street Property, and further obtained documents related to the Oak Property.
(Separate Statement at pp. 4­–6.) Plaintiff initially responded with
objections, then provided a supplemental response to each request stating,
“Unable to admit or deny.” (Ibid.) 
This was insufficient. There
is a means for a party responding to admissions to indicate when they lack
information: a responding party may “[s]pecify so much of the matter involved
in the request as to the truth of which the responding party lacks sufficient
information or knowledge.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.220, subd. (b)(3).) When the
party does so, they must “state in the answer that a reasonable inquiry
concerning the matter in the particular request has been made, and that the
information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable that party to
admit the matter. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.220, subd. (c).) If Plaintiff truly
lacks sufficient knowledge to answer, he did not avail himself of this mode of
response. Thus further verified responses are required on all requests for
admission at issue.
b.     Form
Interrogatories
The form interrogatories at
issue seek facts, witnesses, and evidence supporting Plaintiff’s claims for
damages (No. 9.1); Plaintiff’s denials of allegations and affirmatives defenses
(No. 15.1); and Plaintiff’s responses to requests for admission that were not
unqualified admissions (No. 17.1). Interrogatories No. 50.3 and 50.5 asked
Plaintiff to identify and explain each agreement alleged in the agreement is
unenforceable, or for which performance was excused. 
Plaintiff responded to
Interrogatory No. 9.1 by stating he could not provide an amount of damages
because he does not possess a full accounting for the properties. (Separate
Statement at p. 2.) Plaintiff responded to Form Interrogatory No. 15.1, with
respect to denials of facts alleged in the cross-complaint, that it “lacks
sufficient information to admit or deny what Cross-Complainants are informed
and believe.” (Separate Statement at pp. 7–15.) Plaintiff responded to Form
Interrogatory No. 17.1 with factual summaries justifying its denials, and
identified no documents, instead stating “all relevant documents have been
produced or will be produced pursuant to First Set of Inspection Demands.”
(Separate Statement at pp. 15–24.) Plaintiff responded to Interrogatories No.
50.3 and 50.5 by objecting that they called for a legal conclusion, denying
that performance under any agreement had been excused, and stating that the
statute of limitations for any breach of the oral agreement had expired.
(Separate Statement at pp. 25–26.)
Further responses are
required as to Interrogatory No. 9.1. Although Plaintiff contends he lacks a
full accounting for the properties, he must provide what information is currently
in his possession: “If only partial answers can be supplied, the answers should
reveal all information then available to the party. If a person cannot furnish
details, he should set forth the efforts made to secure the information.” (Deyo
v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 782.)
No further response is
required as to Interrogatory No. 15.1, however, because Plaintiff asserts,
without rebuttal in reply, that the paragraphs at issue formed no part of the
parties’ prior meet and confer efforts. (Amboss Decl. ¶ 10.)   The Discovery Act allow for supplemental
interrogatories later in the case, so the Court’s denial of the motion as to the
15.1 series is without prejudice to a later supplemental interrogatory.  
Further responses are
required as to Interrogatory No. 17.1, specifically relating to the generally
framed and unhelpful document identifications offered by Plaintiff, which
identify no documents, and which merely promise that responsive documents have
been (or will be) produced at some point. This is insufficient.
No further responses are
required as to Interrogatories No. 50.3 and 50.5, to which Plaintiff provided a
substantive response that Defendant does not challenge. (Separate Statement at
p. 26.) Plaintiff only objects to the “legal conclusion” objection that frames
the response. (Ibid.)  The Court
overrules that objection, so the substantive response shall stand. 
The motion is therefore
GRANTED as to Interrogatories No. 9.1 and 17.1, and DENIED as to
Interrogatories No. 15.1, 50.3, and 50.5 except as noted above.
c.      Special
Interrogatories
For the special
interrogatories, the court may first address Interrogatories No. 19, 22, 25,
28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, and 67. These
interrogatories are similar. Although they relate to different allegations,
they each called upon Plaintiff to identify witnesses with knowledge of
responsive facts, to which Plaintiff responded by offering a list of names.
Defendant here contends that the call of the interrogatory was to “identify”
individuals, with the term “identify” defined as providing the name and all
known contact information, such as addresses, phone numbers, and email
addresses. However, Plaintiff contends that four of the people identified are
Defendants themselves, and that the other persons identified are already known
to Defendant, who was a party to all transactions identified. (Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement at pp. 26–27.) 
No further response need be
provided as to contact information for people who are parties to this action,
as such information is already in Defendant’s possession. However, Plaintiff’s
statements concerning Defendant’s preexisting knowledge of other individuals
named in the responses are unsupported. Accordingly, Defendant must provide
responsive contact information for non-party individuals identified in its response,
as is available through a reasonable inquiry. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220,
subd. (c).) 
The motion is therefore
GRANTED as to Special Interrogatories No. 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43,
46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, and 67.
Special Interrogatories No.
1 and 2 asked how much money Jan Agarwala contributed to the purchase of the
property, to which Plaintiff responded by stating that she contributed
$154,241.55 “toward the acquisition cost of the 129th Street
Property. . . plus an additional $130,000.” (Separate Statement at pp. 4–5.)
These responses, however, are not clear as to whether the “additional” $130,000
was part of the acquisition, or is attributable to some other sum or claimed contribution
of value. Thus a further response is required, and the motion is GRANTED as to
Special Interrogatory No. 1 and 2.
Interrogatories No. 3–8
asked Plaintiff to state monetary contributions by Jan Agarwala toward
specified sums, to which he initially responded by reference to broad
categories of production already provided, then amended the response to state
only that, after a reasonable inquiry, “I do not have sufficient information to
answer this question.” (Separate Statement at pp. 5–8.) This answer is
sufficient under Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.220, and no further response is
required.
Interrogatories No. 11–16
asked how much money Jan Agarwala contributed to various costs, to which
Plaintiff responded either with a statement that he lacked the documentation
that would contain responsive information, or else by pointing to his general document
production. (Separate Statement at pp. 8–11.)
No further response is
necessary as to Interrogatory No. 11, 13, and 14, as Plaintiff has responded
that the answer depends upon documentation that is not within its possession,
and identifying the documents needed to make the response. However, a further
response is necessary as to Interrogatories No. 12, 15, and 16, as Plaintiff’s
statement that answers may be found in his general document production is
overly broad and unhelpful to the propounding party. As the Second District
ruled decades ago, “it is not proper to answer by stating, “See my deposition”,
“See my pleading”, or “See the financial statement”. Indeed, if a question does
require the responding party to make reference to a pleading or document, the
pleading or document should be identified and summarized so the answer is fully
responsive to the question.”  (Deyo v.
Kilbourne, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at pp. 783–784.)  
Thus the motion is GRANTED
as to Interrogatories No. 12, 15, and 16. 
Interrogatories No. 17 and
69 asked Plaintiff to state the items and basis by which he seeks costs under
Code of Civil Procedure § 874.010, and to itemize all costs heretofore
incurred. (Separate Statement at p. 12.) Defendant responded that costs would
be determined at the close of the action and had not yet been fully incurred. (Ibid.)
A further response is required, as the costs awardable under Code of Civil
Procedure § 874.010 include more than litigation costs, but those incurred by
any party determined by the court to have been “incurred or paid for the common
benefit.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 874.010, subd. (e).) Although the court will
presumably determine the amount and 
apportionment of these costs at the appointed time, the same is true for
virtually all factual matters submitted to the court, which are generally
proper matters for discovery. Defendant may inquire into the costs incurred
under this statute, and the motion is GRANTED as to Interrogatories No. 17 and
69.
Interrogatories No. 18, 21,
24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 45, 48, 51, 57, and 63 are similar to one another, in
that they asked Plaintiff to state “in complete detail” the facts supporting a
given allegation or denial thereof. For two of these interrogatories —
Interrogatories No. 18 and 21 —Plaintiff responded with a permissible reference
to a document as provided in Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.230, stating that
certain trust documents contained the facts relied upon. (Separate Statement at
pp. 12–14.)
However, further responses
are warranted for the other interrogatories. Interrogatory No. 24 sought facts
justifying the contention that Jan Agarwala contributed to 48% of a given
property’s acquisition costs, to which Plaintiff responded by reference to the
dollar amount that Jan Agarwala contributed, rather than the percentage of the
acquisition cost. (Separate Statement at p. 15.) Interrogatories No. 27, 30,
and 33 sought information concerning Defendant’s challenge to apportionments
contained in a 2019 grant deed, to which Plaintiff responded only by reference
to the grant deed itself, without citation to facts justifying any statements
in the grant deed. (Separate Statement at pp. 16–19.) When asked for facts and
documents to support the contention that Jan Agarwala does not owe $25,000 in
Interrogatories No. 36 and 38, Plaintiff responded only by stating that he was
“unaware” of facts or documents to support the allegation. (Separate Statement
at pp. 20–21.) And with respect to Interrogatories No. 39, 45, 51, 57, and 63,
which asked Plaintiff to state the facts supporting the contention that a given
Defendant owned a personal interest in the property, Plaintiff responded by
stating that each party “has an interest” in the property “in [their] capacity as
trustee.” (Separate Statement at pp. 21–29.) These responses neither deny the
premise of the interrogatory nor offer responsive information.
Accordingly, the motion is
GRANTED as to Special Interrogatories No. 1, 2, 12, 15–17, 19,, 22, 24, 25, 27,
28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36–40, 43, 45, 46, 49, 51, 52, 55, 57, 58, 61–64, 67, and
69. The motion is otherwise DENIED. 
d.     Sanctions
The Discovery Act statute
provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon a party who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to interrogatories or
requests for production of documents, absent substantial justification
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h).)
Defendant seeks $7,785.36 in
connection with the form interrogatories motion, representing 14 hours of
attorney work at $550 per hour, plus $85.36 in filing expenses; $5,032.80 in
connection with the special interrogatories motion, representing nine hours of
attorney work at the same rate, plus an additional $82.80 in filing expenses;
and $4,482.80 in connection with the requests for admissions motion,
representing eight hours of attorney work at the same rate, plus an additional
$82.80 filing fee. (Stein Decl. ¶ 5.) Defendant thus seeks a total of
$17,300.96 in connection with these motions. The amount requested is unreasonable
and excessive.  
Sanctions are appropriate
here for the motion to compel further requests for admissions, as Plaintiff may
obtain further responses to all requests at issue, and the defects could have
been mitigated by modest changes to the responses. The Court awards $3,082 in
monetary sanctions for the RFA motion.  However,
as Defendant has only obtained partial relief with respect to the other
