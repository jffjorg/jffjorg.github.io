And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to set aside the default entries against the City of Pasadena and the Pasadena Police Department. The defendants argue that the defaults are void because they attempted to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel and obtained an automatic extension of time to respond to the complaint. The plaintiff disregarded this declaration and sought an entry of default against the defendants despite the automatic extension. The judge finds that the default entries are void and grants the motion to set aside the defaults.
