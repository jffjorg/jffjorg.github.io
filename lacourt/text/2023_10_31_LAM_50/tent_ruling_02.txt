TENTATIVE RULING RE:  
MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
Michael Juarez-Munoz,
Esq. of Downtown LA Law Group (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff Thadduas
Sistrunk. 
The Court
notes that while Counsel has provided sufficient reason for withdrawal, Counsel has again
failed to file a proof of service with the motion. Pursuant to California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1362,
subdivision (d), “[t]he notice
of motion and motion, the declaration, and the proposed order must be served on
the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case. The notice
may be by personal service, electronic service, or mail.” 
Based on the foregoing,
the Court denies the motion without prejudice. Counsel is ordered to give
notice of this order.
