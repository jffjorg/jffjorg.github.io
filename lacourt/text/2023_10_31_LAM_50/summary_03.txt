Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the petition of California Automobile Insurance Company (Petitioner) to appoint an umpire and compel appraisal in a dispute over the valuation of a loss suffered by Daniel Reisbord (Respondent). The dispute arises from a claim made by Respondent for a loss of a trailer due to a tree fall, and the parties disagree on the value of the loss. Petitioner has initiated appraisal proceedings, but the parties have failed to agree on the selection of an umpire. The judge finds that Petitioner has not adequately demonstrated the grounds for the issuance of the requested order and denies the petition without prejudice. The judge orders Petitioner to provide notice of this ruling.
