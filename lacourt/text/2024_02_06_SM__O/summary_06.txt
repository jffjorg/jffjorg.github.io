Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Ryan McCutchan's motion to quash service of process for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court finds that McCutchan did not purposefully avail himself of the benefits and protections of California law, and therefore is not subject to personal jurisdiction in California.

The court also finds that Celious has not met the burden to demonstrate purposeful availment or specific jurisdiction over McCutchan. Celious's claims of tortious interference and breach of contract are not related to McCutchan's contacts with California, and McCutchan did not have any personal business dealings with Celious.

The court notes that McCutchan is a resident of Texas, worked as project manager in Texas for NuStats, and did not have any authority to contract with any party on behalf of NuStats. The court finds it would be unreasonable for McCutchan to be forced to personally defend Celious's claims in California.
