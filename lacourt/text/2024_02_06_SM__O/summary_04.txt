And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Devorise Dixon's motion to deem the Request for Admissions (RFA) set one admitted. Dixon propounded the RFA's to Brandon Scott Gear on June 27, 2023, and Gear submitted responses on September 4, 2023, setting forth objections to the RFA's. However, Dixon failed to bring a motion to compel further responses within 45 days of the service of the verified response, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290. Therefore, Dixon cannot bring a motion to deem the RFA's admitted under section 2033.280.
