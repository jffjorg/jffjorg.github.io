And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion to compel further responses to the plaintiff's request for production (RFPs). The defendants' objections to the RFPs are overruled, and they are ordered to serve supplemental responses without objection. The plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the special interrogatories (SROGs) is continued to a later date, and the parties are ordered to meet and confer in person to resolve the issues. The court also notes that the parties have not made a good faith effort to meet and confer regarding the SROGs, and sanctions may be addressed concurrently with the continued hearing.
