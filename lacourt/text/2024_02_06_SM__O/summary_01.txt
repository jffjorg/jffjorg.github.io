Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside and vacate the prior order of dismissal and for entry of judgment. As a result, judgment is entered against the defendant, Holly A. Williamson, in the amount of $33,514.83. This amount is calculated by subtracting the total payments made by Williamson ($3,401.36) from the original judgment amount of $36,398.35, plus court costs of $1,036.50. The court notes that Williamson defaulted on a settlement agreement dated 4-4-19, which required her to make monthly payments of $300 until the judgment was paid in full. The last payment was received on 4-2-21, and Williamson has not made any payments since then.
