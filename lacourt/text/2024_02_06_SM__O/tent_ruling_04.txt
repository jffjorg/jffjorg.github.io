SCOTT GEAR
2-10-24
22SMCV02208 Dixon Motion to Deem RFA's Admitted
 
Plaintiff
Devorise Dixon's Motion for an Order to Deem Request for Admissions (Set One)
Admitted is DENIED. Plaintiff Devorise Dixon ("Dixon") propounded
RFA's onto Defendant Brandon Scott Gear ("Gear") on 6-27-23. (Percy
Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) Gear submitted responses to RFA's on 9-4-23 setting forth
objections to the RFAs (McIntrye Decl., ¶¶ 19, 20, Ex. D; see CCP § 2033.210,
subd., (b).) Dixon did not bring a motion to compel further responses under CCP
§ 2033.290 within 45 days of the service of the verified response, thus Dixon
cannot bring a motion to deem RFA's admitted under CCP § 2033.280.
