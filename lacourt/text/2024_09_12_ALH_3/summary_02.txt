Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge William A. Crowfoot regarding an application for default judgment and writ of possession in a case between Ally Bank (Plaintiff) and Marine Nersisyan, Devine Motorworkz Corp., and Grigor Cholakyan (Defendants). The case arises from Nersisyan's default on a retail installment sales contract for a 2013 Mercedes-Benz G Class (Subject Vehicle). The Plaintiff seeks a default judgment against the defendants for $73,766.17, the amount owed under the contract, and $47,972, the market value of the Subject Vehicle. The Court notes that the proposed judgment is confusing and requires revision, and continues the hearing to allow the Plaintiff to file an amended proposed judgment. The Court also notes that a writ of possession will become unnecessary once the Plaintiff proves up its damages for a default judgment, but if the Plaintiff still wishes to pursue a writ, a proposed order must be submitted within 5 court days.
