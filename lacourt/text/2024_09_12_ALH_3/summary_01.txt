And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a motion by Plaintiff Luz Mercado to compel Defendant Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP Technology Services, Inc.) to serve further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Three. The motion is based on the fact that Defendant has not provided substantive responses to the 49 special interrogatories, despite being ordered to do so by the court. The judge has denied Defendant's argument that Plaintiff failed to meet and confer before filing the motion, and has also rejected Defendant's contention that its previous responses were sufficient. The judge has ordered Defendant to file a copy of its supplemental responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Three) no later than 10 court days before the hearing, which has been continued to October 1, 2024.
