And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the hearing on Pomona Unified School District's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings will be continued to July 19, 2024. The judge has also denied the district's Motion to Stay the Trial and/or Proceedings. The judge has granted Pomona Unified School District's Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) as to Exhibits C, F, and G, and denied same as to Exhibits A, B, D, and E. The judge has also denied the district's motion to stay the trial and/or proceedings, stating that an open-ended stay is not warranted. The judge notes that there are pending appeals in the California Court of Appeal regarding the constitutionality of California Assembly Bill 218, which is the basis for the plaintiff's lawsuit. The judge believes that the parties do not need a stay of the trial and/or proceedings pending the outcome of these appeals.
