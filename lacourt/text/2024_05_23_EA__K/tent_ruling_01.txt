A Case Management
Conference is set for May 23, 2024.
1.         Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
Legal Standard
The rules governing demurrers are
generally applicable to a motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999; Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (d) [“The
grounds for motion. . . shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or
from any matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice. Where
the motion is based on a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. .
., the matter shall be specified in the notice of motion, or in the supporting
points and authorities, except as the court may otherwise permit”].)
A motion by a plaintiff may only be
made on the grounds “that the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a
cause or causes of action against the defendant and the answer does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
438, subd. (c)(1)(A).) A motion by a defendant may only be made on the grounds
that (1) “[t]he court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action
alleged in the complaint” or (2) “[t]he complaint does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
438, subd. (c).)
Although a nonstatutory motion “may be
made at any time either prior to the trial or at the trial itself” (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th
644, 650 [quotation marks and citation omitted]), a statutory motion cannot be
made after entry of a pretrial conference order or 30 days before the initial
trial date, whichever is later, unless the court otherwise permits. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 438, subd. (e).)
Discussion
PUSD moves the court, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure § 438, for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff’s
complaint.
The court continues the hearing on the
instant motion to July 19, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.
2. Motion to Stay
PUSD moves the court
for an order granting a stay of the trial and/or proceedings of this matter
pending resolution of the Court of Appeals’ decisions in two pending matters (i.e.,
West Contra Costa U.S.D. v. Superior Court, Case No. A16934 and Roe
#2 v. Superior Court, Case No. B334707) regarding the constitutionality of
California Assembly Bill 218 (“AB 218”), which enacted the version of Code of
Civil Procedure § 340.1 that Plaintiff has brought this lawsuit under.
Request for
Judicial Notice
The court rules grants
PUSD’s Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) as to Exhibits C, F and G and denies
same as to Exhibits A, B, D and E.
Merits
“The power to stay
proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the
disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for
itself, for counsel, and for litigants.” (OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho (8 Cal.5th
111, 141 [quotations and citation omitted].) However, “convenience of the
courts is best served when motions to stay proceedings are discouraged. . .
California courts are guided by the strong principle that any elapsed time
other than that reasonable required for pleadings and discovery is unacceptable
and should be eliminated.” (Alpha Media Resort Investment Cases (2019)
39 Cal.App.5th 1121, 1132 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)
The court does not believe that an open-ended stay is
warranted. A petition for writ of mandate was filed December 18, 2023 in the First
District Court of Appeal, in West Contra Costa Unified School District v.
The Superior Court of Contra Costa County (Case No. A169314). (RJN, Exh.
C.) RJN Exhibit C reflects the register of actions up through April 16, 2024
only. A review of the Court of Appeal’s online docket as of May 21, 2024, 9:21
a.m. reflects that there is a June 3, 2024 deadline for the parties to file any
answer to amicus briefs. No date has been set for oral argument.
A petition for writ of mandate was filed January 25, 2024 in
the Second District Court of Appeal, in Roe #2 v. Superior Court (Case
No. B334707) (RJN, Exh. F); however, Plaintiff correctly notes that the court
has only requested that the parties submit “informal” letters or briefing on
the issue. (Id.) A reply “letter” was filed May 17, 2024. (Id.) Upon
review of the informal letters, the court may decline to accept review.
Further, in the event the court accepts review, the parties would need to
submit formal briefing and conduct oral argument. The court also notes that the
underlying proceedings in that case are not even stayed, as evidenced by an
application for stay of superior court proceedings filed May 17, 2024 in Case
No. B334707. The motion is
denied.
