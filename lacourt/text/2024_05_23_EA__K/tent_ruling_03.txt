Oaktree Business Park, LLC’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff Oaktree Business Park, LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Plaintiff owns the real property located at 437 South Cataract Avenue,
Suite #3 in San Dimas (“subject property”). On February 22, 2011, Plaintiff, as
landlord, and Sanjesh Sharma (‘Sharma”), as tenant, entered into a three-year
lease agreement for the subject property (“Lease”). The parties subsequently
executed four Amendments to the Lease; Amendment No. 3 added New Ventures, Inc.
(“NVI”) as a tenant. Amendment No. 4 extended the Lease term through and
including December 31, 2025 and increased the base monthly rent was increased
to $3,683.00 for the January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023 time frame and
to $3,867.00 for the January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 time frame.

A Case Management Conference is set for May 23, 2024.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff has failed to provide the court with a brief
summary of the case, as per 
California Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule 3.1800, subdivision
(a)(1).
2.                 
Plaintiff’s Request for Court Judgment (Judicial
Council Form CIV-100) identifies the following as “judgment to be entered”
(i.e., Paragraph 2): $39,932.88 as the “[d]emand of complaint,” plus $7,733.50
in general damages, $1,039.235 in interest, $555.00 in costs and $1,819.99 in
attorney’s fees. The $7,733.50 in general damages is comprised of $1,933.50 in
unpaid rent for the February 1-15, 2024 time frame, plus $5,800.00 for repairs
to the premises. (See Griffin Wright Decl., ¶ 4). Plaintiff does not appear to
request damages for repair in its complaint, however. 
3.                 
It does not appear that Plaintiff has addressed the
disposition of the $5,854.05 security deposit identified in Paragraph 51 of the
lease. 
4.                 
Plaintiff has failed to specify the “other” in
Paragraph 6(a)(5) of the proposed judgment.
