Beatris Valenzuela v. California Unemployment
Insurance Appeals Board 
23STCP03744

 
Tentative decision on petition for writ of mandate: denied



 
Petitioner Beatris Valenzuela (“Valenzuela”) seeks a writ of
mandate compelling Respondent California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board
(“CUIAB”) to set aside its decision of March 14, 2014.  
The court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,
and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A.    Statement of the Case
1.     
The Petition
Petitoner Valenzuela commenced this proceeding on October
11, 2023.  As the Petition is not
entirely clear, the court will set forth the pertinent facts from CUIAB”s
opposition.  
This case involves two periods when Valenzuela received
unemployment benefits: the first period was 26 weeks in 2021 and the second
period was 15 weeks in 2022.  An
administrative hearing was held on May 2, 2023, and the administrative law
judge (“ALJ”) released a series of decisions that were mailed on May 5, 2023.
 
2021 Benefits
Petitioner filed a claim for unemployment insurance benefits
effective June 20, 2021, with a weekly benefit amount of $385.  For 26 weeks in 2021, Valenzuela received
unemployment benefits while working and not reporting her wages.  When the Employment Development Department (“EDD”)
issued Notices of Determination about the overpayment of benefits, Valenzuela
appealed.
At the administrative hearing, Valenzuela did not dispute
that she worked or the amount of her earnings during those 26 weeks but claimed
that she misunderstood the claim forms and believed the income information
pertained to income in addition to her current work.  The ALJ found that Valenzuela was ineligible
for full benefits for 14 of those 26 weeks and was ineligible for any benefits
for 12 of those weeks.  The ALJ affirmed
EDD’s determinations.  The ALJ found Valenzuela
was liable for the overpayment of $7,367 as a result of her failure to report. 
 
2022 Benefits
Valenzuela filed another claim for unemployment insurance
benefits effective June 19, 2022, with a weekly benefit amount of $365.  For 15 weeks in 2022, Valenzuela received
unemployment benefits while working and not reporting her wages.  Valenzuela did not dispute that she worked or
the amount of her earnings.  When EDD
issued Notices of Determination about the overpayment of benefits, Valenzuela
appealed.  
The ALJ affirmed EDD’s determination and found Valenzuela
ineligible for benefits under Unemployment Insurance Code section 1252.  The ALJ found Valenzuela was liable for the
overpayment of $4,380 as a result of her failure to report. 
 
CUIAB Appeal
Valenzuela appealed the ALJ’s decisions relating to
ineligibility and overpayment.  The CUIAB
affirmed the ALJ’s decisions, finding no material errors in the findings of
fact or application of law. 
 
2. Course of Proceedings
At an April 9, 2024 trial setting conference, the court
explained the administrative mandamus trial process to Valenzuela, set trial
for August 15, 2024, and a briefing schedule as follows: Valenzuela was ordered
to file and serve her opening brief by May 16, 2024, CUIAB was ordered to file and
serve its opposition by June 20, 2024, and Valenzuela was ordered to file and
serve her reply by July 30, 2025.
On April l8, 2024 CUIAB answered the Petition.
 
B. Analysis
No
opening brief is on file.  CUIAB filed an
opposition on June 27, 2024.
Petitioner
Valenzuela has the burden of proof.  An
opening brief is required in every mandamus case.  CRC 3.1113(d); LASC 3.231(i).  When a petitioner challenges an
administrative decision as unsupported by substantial evidence in light of the
record as a whole, it is the petitioner’s burden to demonstrate that the
administrative record does not contain sufficient evidence to support the
agency’s decision.  State Water
Resources Control Board Cases, (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 674, 749.  She is obligated to lay out the evidence
favorable to the other side and show why it is lacking. The "[f]ailure to
do so is fatal" to any substantial evidence challenge and "is deemed
a concession that the evidence supports the findings."  Defend the Bay v. City of Irvine, (2004)
11928 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1266.  
The petition for writ of mandate is denied.  The court will sign a dismissal with
prejudice as a judgment under CCP 581(d).
