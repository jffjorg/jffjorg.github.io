[1] In
violation of the Presiding Judge’s General Order Re: Mandatory Electronic
Filing, Iskarous failed to lodge a courtesy copy of her opposition and Health
Net failed to lodge a courtesy copy if the reply.   Both counsel
are admonished that the court will not consider a document in a future law and
motion matter in this case if a courtesy copy has not been lodged.


[2]
The other external processes have been satisfied.  Health Net stipulated that the meet and
confer requirement should be considered as fulfilled (Pet., ¶78) and mediation
is only voluntary.  


[3]
ISkarous argues that a separate reason for waiver lies in Health Net’s bad
faith by hand-picking charts for review, refusing to give Iskarous her
contractually mandated exit interview, refusing to allow her to know the basis
of their findings or reconcile her scores in a meaningful manner, showing up to
her practice for a site review when she was not there, refusing to correct
obvious errors, knowingly reporting invalid failing scores to other MCPs, and delaying
tactics.  These arguments are merits
issues which do not bear on any bad faith with respect to the arbitration
agreement.
