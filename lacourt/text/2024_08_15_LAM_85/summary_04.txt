Roles:

* Parties: Ragaa Z. Iskarous and Health Net of California, Inc.

Significant Statements:
* "Health Net's conduct has severely prejudiced Iskarous. If arbitration was always the answer, then she has been subjected to almost a year of needless and damaging delay in which she has continued to lose contracts and income based on Health Net's reporting of its erroneous findings and invalid failing scores to all other MCPs."
* "The parties' ad hoc procedure was just such an internal appeal. Unlike a meet-and-confer, mediation, or arbitration, Health Net remained the decision-maker for this ad hoc procedure. That ad hoc procedure may have waived any other available internal appeal, but it has no bearing on what Health Net calls 'external dispute resolution'."
* "Health Net did not waive its right to arbitrate."
