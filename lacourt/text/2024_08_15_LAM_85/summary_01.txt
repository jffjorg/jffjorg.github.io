And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for writ of mandate filed by Beatris Valenzuela against the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (CUIAB). Valenzuela seeks to compel CUIAB to set aside its decision of March 14, 2014, which found her ineligible for unemployment benefits and liable for overpayment. The case involves two periods when Valenzuela received unemployment benefits: 26 weeks in 2021 and 15 weeks in 2022. The Judge notes that Valenzuela has failed to provide an opening brief, which is required in every mandamus case, and that the petition is therefore denied. The Judge will sign a dismissal with prejudice as a judgment under CCP 581(d).
