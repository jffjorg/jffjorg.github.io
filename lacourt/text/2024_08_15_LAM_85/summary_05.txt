And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a case between Iskarous and Health Net. The judge notes that both parties failed to lodge courtesy copies of their documents, in violation of the Presiding Judge's General Order. The judge admonishes both parties that any future documents not lodged with a courtesy copy will not be considered. The judge also notes that the meet and confer requirement has been satisfied, and that mediation is voluntary. Iskarous argues that Health Net has acted in bad faith, but the judge finds that these arguments are related to merits issues and do not bear on any bad faith with respect to the arbitration agreement. The judge will consider the documents that have been lodged and will issue a final ruling at a later date.
