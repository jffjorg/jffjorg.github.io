Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint and the motion to strike. The demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action for fraud is overruled, as the complaint sufficiently alleges the elements of fraud. The demurrer to the fifth cause of action for defamation is sustained, as the complaint fails to allege the defamatory statements and to whom they were made. The motion to strike is denied, as the complaint alleges entitlement to punitive damages.
