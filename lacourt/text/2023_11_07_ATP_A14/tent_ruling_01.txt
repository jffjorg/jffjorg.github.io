  Case Number:  21AVCV00425    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2023    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a personal injury action.
Plaintiff Western General Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on or
about July 05, 2019, Defendants Fabiola Sant Maria (“Fabiola”)[1]
and Marcela Santa Maria (“Marcela”) negligently and carelessly drove,
maintained, owned, managed, entrusted and operated their vehicle so as to cause
it to collide the vehicle driven by Plaintiff’s insured individuals, Juan Ramos
Preciado and Marisela S Preciado, at or about the intersection E. Palmdale
Avenue and 30th Street East in Palmdale, California 93550. Plaintiff further
alleges damages in the following amounts: (1) $4,339.68 in property damage, and
$30,000.00 in damages to Juan Ramos Preciado and Marisela S Preciado’s persons.

 
On May 25, 2021, Plaintiff filed
its Complaint for Property Damages and Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury. 
 
On July 21, 2021, Fabiola filed
her Answer to the Complaint.
 
On January 04, 2022, Marcela was
placed in default. 
 
On June 09, 2022, the Court held
a hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions (“RFAs”)
Admitted as to Fabiola. The Court granted the motion. 
 
On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff
amended the fictitious name of Doe 1 to Michael Bacelis.
 
On May 10, 2023, Plaintiff
amended the incorrect name of Michael Bacelis to Michael Angelo Bacelis, Jr.
(“Bacelis, Jr.”). 
On June 05, 2023, Bacelis, Jr.
filed his Answer to the Complaint.
 
On September 11, 2023, Plaintiff
filed this Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions Served Upon Michael Angelo
Bacelis, Jr. Admitted (“Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted”). 
 
No Opposition has been filed. “All
papers opposing a motion so noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy
served on each party at least nine court days. . .before the hearing.” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 1005(b).) “Section 1013, which extends the time within which
a right may be exercised or an act may be done, does not apply to a notice of
motion, papers opposing a motion, or reply papers governed by this section.”
(Ibid.) The hearing is set for November 07, 2023. Accordingly, an Opposition
was due by October 25, 2023. Should an Opposition be filed, it is now untimely.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Deeming Admissions Admitted – Where
there has been no timely response to a request for admission under Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the
truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as
for a monetary sanction. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).) Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 2033.280(c) states, in relevant part: “The Court shall make this order,
unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)

Discussion
 
Application – Plaintiff
presents that it served Bacelis, Jr. with its RFAs, Set One, on June 26, 2023. (See
Motion, Decl. Joseph M. Pleasant ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Plaintiff further presents that,
to date, no responses have been served. (Motion, Decl. Joseph M. Pleasant ¶ 2.)
Plaintiff argues that all matters specified in Plaintiff’s RFAs, Set One,
should be deemed admitted under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280 as Bacelis, Jr.
has failed to respond. Plaintiff argues, alternatively, should Bacelis, Jr.
serve a response that is in compliance with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§2033.210-2033.250,
sanctions should still be imposed under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280.
 
Bacelis, Jr. does not oppose this
motion. A failure to oppose a motion may be construed as a concession on the
merits. (See D.I. Chadbourne, Inc. v. Superior Court (1964) 60 Cal.2d
723, 728, fn. 4 [where nonmoving party fails to oppose a ground for a motion
“it is assumed that [nonmoving party] concedes” that ground].)
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem RFAs admitted.

Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions against Bacelis, Jr. in the amount of $660.00 [2 hrs @ $300.00/hr +
$60.00 filing fee] for this motion.
 
“The court shall make this order,
unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both,
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
this motion.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).) 
 
The Court imposes a sanction of
$250.00 pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280.

Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Western General
Insurance Company’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions Served Upon Michael
Angelo Bacelis, Jr. Admitted is GRANTED.
 
The Court imposes a sanction of $250.00 pursuant to
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280.
