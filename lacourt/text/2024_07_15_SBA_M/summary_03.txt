And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Torrance Memorial Medical Center. The demurrer was filed on the grounds that Merlita Q. Licaros, the plaintiff, does not have the legal capacity to sue. However, the court has found that the demurrer is without merit and has ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The court has ordered the defendant to file and serve an answer within 10 days and to give notice of this ruling. The court also notes that if the defendant's argument is correct, the parties may wish to consider a stipulation to allow the filing of a first amended complaint that identifies the correct plaintiff.
