Pamela Hutchins,
et al.’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings    
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING

Pamela Hutchins, et al.’s Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings is denied, in part, and granted with 20 days leave to amend, in part.

 
Background 
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on January 12, 2023, and
the Second Amended Complaint on October 16, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the
following facts. Plaintiff – law firm - represented Pamela Hutchins in another
case – Case No. BC682521. Plaintiff was substituted as counsel. Hutchins signed
a contract with Plaintiff but she and her subsequent attorney in the underlying
action failed to pay Plaintiff’s attorney lien. Plaintiff alleges the following
causes of action: 1. Breach of Contract; 2. Conversion; 3. Constructive Trust;
4. Common Count; 5. Unjust Enrichment.  
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendants filed a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 439. (Decl., Kenneth R. Agu, ¶¶ 6-8.)
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendants’ request for judicial notice is granted
pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(d).
 
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings 
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings has the same
function as a general demurrer but is made after the time for demurrer has
expired.  Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (f).  Except as provided by
statute, the rules governing demurrers apply.  Civic Partners Stockton,
LLC v. Youssefi (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1005, 1012.  “Judgment on the
pleadings is proper when the complaint does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action against the defendant.”  Rolfe v. Cal.
Transp. Comm’n (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 239, 242; see also Code Civ. Proc., §
438, subd. (c)(3)(B)(ii).  “Like a demurrer, the grounds for the motion
[for judgment on the pleadings] must appear on the face of the challenged
pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take judicial
notice.”  Civic Partners Stockton, LLC, supra, 218
Cal.App.4th at p. 1013.  In ruling on a motion for judgment on the
pleadings, “[a]ll allegations in the complaint and matters upon which judicial
notice may be taken are assumed to be true.”  Rippon v. Bowen
(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1313.
 
Defendants move for judgment on the pleadings. The
Court notes that Defendants did not specify, in the notice of motion, the cause
or causes of action to which the motion is directed. Defendants do, however, state the following: “This
motion is premised on the simple fact that Plaintiff failed to establish the
existence, amount, and enforceability of his lien in an independent action
against his client.” (Notice of Motion, page 2, lines 3-5.)
 
First Cause of Action for Breach of Contract
 
The motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied.
Plaintiff states facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
“The elements of a cause of action for breach of
contract are: (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to
plaintiff.” Coles v. Glaser (2016) 2
Cal.App.5th 384, 391(internal quotations omitted). “[T]he complaint must
indicate on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by
conduct. [...] If the action is based on an alleged breach of a written
contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a
copy of the written instrument must be attached and incorporated by reference.”
Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452,
458–59. Plaintiffs must either: (a) set forth the terms of the contract
verbatim, (b) attach a copy of the contract and incorporate it by reference, or
(c) plead its legal effect.  McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006)
142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489. 
 
Plaintiff has alleged the existence of a written
contract and attached the contract. Plaintiff alleges facts to meet the
elements of the cause of action including Plaintiff’s performance, Defendant’s
breach, and resulting damages. (SAC, ¶¶ 9-25; Ex. 1.) Defendants argue that the
contract is not valid or enforceable. Whether the contract is valid or not, and
specifically as to the “date of incident” to which the contract is directed,
are factual issues that cannot be adjudicated with a motion for judgment on the
pleadings.
 
The motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the
first cause of action is denied.
 
Second Cause of Action for Conversion
Fourth Cause of Action for Common Count
Fifth Cause of Action for Unjust Enrichment
 
The motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the
second, fourth, and fifth causes of action is denied. Plaintiff states facts
sufficient to state the causes of action.
 
Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over
the property of another. The elements of a conversion claim are: (1) the
plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of the property; (2) the
defendant's conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and
(3) damages....” Hodges v. County of Placer (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 537,
551. Money cannot be the subject of a cause of action for conversion unless
there is a specific, identifiable sum involved. PCO, Inc. v. Christensen,
Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil & Shapiro, LLP (2007) 150
Cal.App.4th 384, 395.
 
“California has long permitted the pleading of common
counts despite their divergence from the norms of code pleading.” Jogani v.
Superior Court (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 901, 906. “A common count may be used
where the only thing that remains to be done is the payment of money.” Oliver
v. Campbell (1954) 43 Cal.2d 298, 305.
 
Unjust Enrichment is not a cause of action.  See, Hill v. Roll Int'l Corp. (2011)
195 Cal.App.4th 1295, 1307.  The Court
may, however, recognize a cause of action based on quasi-contract to obtain the
remedy of restitution.  See, McKell v.
Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1490.  "The elements of an unjust enrichment
claim are the receipt of a benefit and [the] unjust retention of the benefit at
the expense of another."  Peterson
v. Cellco Partnership (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1583, 1593-94. 
 
Plaintiff has sufficiently stated facts to meet the
elements of the cause of action, and, as to the fifth cause of action, the
Court recognizes the cause of action as one based on quasi-contract. Defendants
have not actually argued that Plaintiff failed to state the elements of the
cause of action, but instead relies on the same arguments noted above
contending that Plaintiff failed to establish a basis for a lien because
Plaintiff cannot show an enforceable contract. As noted above, that would be a
factual issue, and, regardless, the second and fifth causes of action are not
specifically based on the existence of a contract.
 
Third Cause of Action for Constructive Trust
 
The motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted
with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Constructive Trust is a remedy and not a cause of
action. “Glue–Fold's complaint had a fourth cause of action seeking imposition
of a constructive trust and an accounting. The former is not an independent
cause of action but merely a type of remedy for some categories of underlying
wrong.” Glue-Fold, Inc. v. Slautterback Corp. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th
1018, 1023.
 
Leave to amend is provided to allow Plaintiff to omit
this remedy as a specific cause of action but instead Plaintiff may allege the
allegations of constructive trust and set forth the remedy of a constructive
trust in the prayer for relief. 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
