  Defendants’ Request for Admissions, Set Three to Plaintiff Michelle Leonard
  Admitted, and Motion for Monetary Sanctions Against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
  Counsel Kevin Gerry, Jointly and Severally, in the Amount of $1,915 Pursuant
  to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2023.010, 2023.030, and 2023.280(c) [Res ID #
  0341]; and
Defendants Brian
  E. Claypool and Claypool Law Firm’s Motion for Summary Judgment [Res ID #
  3174].



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Michelle
Leonard (Plaintiff Leonard) sues Defendants Brian E. Claypool (Brian Claypool),
The Claypool Law Firm (Claypool Law), and Does 1 to 20 pursuant to a May 3,
2023, First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging claims of (1) Legal Malpractice
and (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty.
The claims arise from
allegations that, during their legal representation of Michelle Leonard for
injuries sustained during the Route 91 Harvest Festival concert shooting in Las
Vegas, Nevada (the underlying action or the class action case),
Brian Claypool and Claypool Law (the Claypool Defendants), as well as Does 1 to
20, engaged in conduct amounting to legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary
duty. This conduct included: (1) the Claypool Defendants’ failure to submit key
medical records for Michelle Leonard’s injuries in relation the Route 91
shooting and class action case in Nevada; (2) the Claypool Defendants’ failure
to file documentation from the federal government regarding Michelle Leonard’s
total disability as a result of her injuries in relation the Route 91 shooting
and class action case in Nevada; (3) the Claypool Defendants providing erroneous
tax information regarding Michelle Leonard’s personal injury claims; and (4)
the Claypool Defendants’ omission of the aforementioned misconduct through
failure and refusal to communicate with Michelle Leonard to keep her apprised
of the significant developments in the class action case or respond to Michelle
Leonard’s documents requests, including giving Michelle Leonard a copy of her
retainer agreement upon execution.
B. Motion for
Summary Judgment
On February 26, 2024,
the Claypool Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment of the FAC’s two
causes of action. The motion was set for hearing on May 9, 2024.
On March 12, 2024, the
Court granted a separate motion for issue and evidence sanctions filed by the
Claypool Defendants against Plaintiff Leonard.
On March 19, 2024, the
Claypool Defendants filed an ex parte application to refile their motion for
summary judgment, as updated to incorporate the Court’s March 12th order and
its effects as part as the evidentiary bases for relief. The ex parte application
also requested that the Court continue the trial date in this action—initially
set for June 11, 2024, by the Court on May 7, 2023—by 90 days, with the
continued date to be considered the new “initial” trial date in this action.
On March 21, 2024, the
Court granted the ex parte application, continued the hearing on to-be-refiled
motion for summary judgment to June 10, 2024, and continued trial to August 6,
2024.
That same day, the
Claypool Defendants via email served a notice of the March 21st ruling on
Plaintiff’s counsel, Kevin Gerry and Frank Hartman of The Law Offices of Kevin
Gerry. The notice notes that the March 21st ruling granting the March 19, 2024,
ex parte application made the August 6, 2024, trial date the new “initial trial
date for all purposes.”
On March 22, 2024, the
Claypool Defendants refiled their motion for summary judgment. The motion was
served via email on Plaintiff’s counsel.
On May 28, 2024, the
Claypool Defendants filed a notice of non-opposition, which notes that Plaintiff
Leonard failed to timely oppose the Claypool Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment.
No opposition appears
in the record, timely or otherwise.
The Claypool
Defendants’ motion is now before the Court.
C.
Motion to Deem the Truth of Facts Specified in Requests for Admission
Admitted and Motion for Monetary Sanctions
On March 15, 2024, the
Claypool Defendants served their third set of requests for admissions on
Plaintiff Leonard (RFAs, Set Three). The RFAs were served on Plaintiff’s
counsel via email.
On May 3, 2024, based
on non-response, the Claypool Defendants filed a motion to deem admitted the
truth of all facts specified in their RFAs, Set Three, and further requested
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Leonard and counsel Kevin Gerry. RFAs, Set
Three, contain four admission requests, which are numbered Nos. 31-34. The
motion was set for hearing on July 17, 2024, and was served on Plaintiff’s
counsel via email.
On May 7, 2024, the
Claypool Defendants filed an ex parte application to advance the hearing on the
motion to deem the truth of all facts specified in RFAs, Set Three. The
Claypool Defendants argued that admission as to the four RFAs in RFAs, Set
Three, to which Plaintiff Leonard failed to serve a timely response, are
dispositive of the issues raised in the Claypool Defendants refiled motion for
summary judgment, specifically as relates to issue surrounding EF-6—a designation
in the One October Protocol for an award to compensate a person for disability
in connection to the person’s ability to generate income.
On May 9, 2024, the
Court granted the ex parte application and signed an order that advanced the
hearing on the RFAs motion to June 10, 2024.
No opposition, reply,
or notice of non-opposition appears in the record.
The Claypool
Defendants’ motion is now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Deem the Truth of Facts Specified in
Requests for Admission Admitted and Motion for Monetary Sanctions
A. Motion to Deem the Truth of Facts
Specified in Requests for Admission Admitted: GRANTED.
1. Legal Standard
The
discovering party can make a motion to deem as admitted any unanswered requests
for admission or any requests answered in a late or unverified response. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd. (a)
[RFA responses must be signed by responding party under oath]; see Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 (Appleton) [unsworn
response to RFAs is treated like no response].) These requests are not
automatically deemed admitted; the discovery party must make the motion. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
To
establish this ground, a movant must show:
(1)
Proper service (see Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.070);
(2)
Expiration of the deadline for the initial response 30 days after service or on
date agreed to by parties (see Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subds. (a), (b));
and
(3)
That (a) the responding party served no response (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (b)), (b) the propounding party served a late response (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b)); or (3) the responding party served an unsworn response
(see Appleton, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at p. 636 [unsworn response
to RFAs is treated like no response]).
A
court must deny a motion to compel initial discovery where the discovery sought
is outside the scope of discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of
discovery].) The scope of discovery is intended to be very broad. (See Emerson
Elec. Co. v. Superior Court (19970 16 Cal.4th 1101, 1108; Puerto v.
Superior Court (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1249.) Because of this broad
scope, discovery statues are interpreted liberally in favor of discovery. (See Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541; Gonzalez v. Superior Court
(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.)
2. RFA’s at Issue
RFAs,
Set Three, No. 31: Admit that YOU (“YOU” and “YOUR” refer to plaintiff MICHELLE
LEONARD and/or her agents, attorneys, representatives, and any other
individuals who have acted on her behalf) were only entitled to receive points
under EF-7 in the class action settlement of Clark County District Court case
no. A-18-7697520C.
RFAs,
Set Three, No. 32: Admit that YOU were not entitled to receive points under
EF-6 in the class action settlement of Clark County District Court case no.
A-18-7697520C.
RFAs,
Set Three, No. 33: Admit that the class action settlement protocol in Clark
County District Court case no. A-18-17697520C did not allow YOU to receive
points under both EF-6 and EF-7.
RFAs,
Set Three, No. 34: Admit that YOU would not have received more than 19.33575
points under EF-6 even if YOU qualified for EF-6.
(RFAs
Mot., Yee Decl., Ex. A, p. 2.)
3. Court’s Determination
The
Court finds in favor of the Claypool Defendants.
The
Court initially notes that this motion is properly being heard no fewer than 15
days prior to the now-initial trial date of August 6, 2024, as ordered by the
Court on March 21, 2024. Moreover, RFAs, Set Three, were served no fewer than
30 days prior to the now-initial trial date of August 6, 2024.
Moving
to the merits, the Claypool Defendants have shown evidence that:
(1)
The Claypool Defendants served RFAs, Set Three, on Plaintiff’s counsel on March
15, 2024 (RFAs Mot., Yee Decl., Ex. A);
(2)
The deadline to respond has expired, i.e., 30 calendar days from the date of
service, landing on Sunday, April 14, 2024, and thus pushed to Monday, April
15, 2024, plus two court days for service, pushing the final date for response
to Wednesday, April 17, 2024 (RFAs Mot., Yee Decl., ¶ 7 [no responses as of May
3, 2024] & Proof of Service [service on March 15, 2024]); and
(3)
A failure to respond by Plaintiff Leonard. (RFAs Mot., Yee Decl., ¶ 7 [no
responses as of May 3, 2024].)
The
Court also notes that the admission requests are directly relevant to this
action insofar as the malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty claims are
premised on the Claypool Defendants’ alleged failure to submit Plaintiff
Leonard’s medical records and federal disability documentation in the One October
protocol, allegedly resulting in a lower award in the underlying action.
(Compare RFAs Mot., Yee Decl., Ex. A, p. 2, RFAs, Set Three, Nos. 31-34, with
5/3/23 FAC, ¶¶ 9-9.C.)
Based
on these grounds, the Court GRANTS the Claypool Defendants’ motion.
B. Motion for Sanctions: GRANTED
in part.
1. Legal
Standard
The Court must award sanctions when
a party’s response is untimely, and the discovering party makes a motion to
deem the requests admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see Stover
v. Bruntz (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 19, 31-32; see e.g., Appleton, supra,
206 Cal.App.3d at pp. 635-636 [sanctions are mandatory].)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
2. Court’s
Determination
The Court GRANTS sanctions, in
part, in the amount of $1,120, as against Plaintiff Leonard and counsel Kevin
Gerry, jointly and severally.
The failure to respond to admission
requests is a ground for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ., §§ 2023.010, subd.
(d), 2023.030, subd. (a), 2033.280, subd. (b).)
Here, despite valid service on counsel
via email, Plaintiff Leonard has failed to respond to an authorized method of
discovery in RFAs, Set Three. (RFAs Mot., Yee Decl., ¶ 7 [no responses as of
May 3, 2024] & Proof of Service [service on March 15, 2024] & Service
List [service on Plaintiff’s counsel].)
Sanctions are equally merited
against Plaintiff and counsel for non-response based on service on counsel and
non-response thereafter from Plaintiff Leonard.
Last, sanctions are appropriate in
the amount of $1,120, not $1,915. The $1,915 request was based on two hours
preparing this motion, five expected hours to review any opposition, draft a
reply, and attend the hearing on the motion, and a $60 filing fee for the RFAs
motion. (RFAs Mot., Yee Decl., ¶ 11.) However, there was no opposition and thus
no review and no reply. Thus, the Court finds that the proper award should be
comprised of a reasonable fee rate of $265 per hour (as requested), two hours
reasonably spent on the RFAs motion (as requested), two hours to prepare and
attend this hearing (i.e., four hours rather than the total of seven requested
since there was no need to review an opposition or prepare a reply), and a $60
filing fee, totaling $1,120.
 
III. Motion for Summary Judgment: DENIED.
A. Request for Judicial Notice
Per the Claypool Defendants’
request, the Court takes judicial notice of the Nevada court order for the global
settlement resulting from the Route 91 Harvest Festival concert shooting, and a
copy of the One October Settlement Fund: Claims Protocol and Allocation
Methodology (consistent with prior rulings, hereafter the One October Protocol)
approved by the Nevada court to explain who was eligible for a share in the
global settlement funds and the allocation methodology for any given claim. (Refiled
MSJ, RJN, Exs. A-B; see Evid. Code, §§ 452, subds. (d), (h), 453, subds.
(a)-(b).)
B. Legal Standard
A motion for summary judgment shall
be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as
to any material fact for trial or that the moving party is entitled to a
judgment as a matter of law. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
The moving party bears the initial
burden of production to make prima facie showing no triable material fact
issues. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 (Aguilar).)
This burden on summary judgment or adjudication “is more properly one of
persuasion rather than proof, since he must persuade the court that there is no
material fact for a reasonable trier of fact to find, and not to prove any such
fact to the satisfaction of the court itself as though it were sitting as the
trier of fact.” (Id. at p. 850, fn. 11.)
If the moving party meets this
burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to make a rebuttal prima facie
showing that a triable issue of material fact exists. (Id. at p. 849.)
“[I]n ruling on motions for summary
judgment courts are to ‘“liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.”’ [Citations].” (Cheal v. El Camino Hospital (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 736, 760.)
B. Court’s Determination
The Court finds in favor of
Plaintiff Leonard.
A defendant moving for summary
judgment has the burden “to identify and respond to all
theories of liability reflected in the complaint, ‘even if not separately
pleaded.’ [Citation.] … While a plaintiff … need sustain its burden of proof
only on one of the theories in order to prevail at trial, a defendant who seeks
a summary judgment must define all of the theories alleged in the complaint and
challenge each factually.’” (Lopez v. Superior Court (1996) 45
Cal.App.4th 705, 714 (Lopez); see Johnson v. Chui (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 775, 778 [“[A] defendant is entitled to summary judgment only when
all theories of liability have been negated”]; Farley v. El Tejon Unified
School Dist. (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 371, 379 [“[T]o prevail on its motion
for summary judgment, [the defendant] had the burden of negating every
alternative theory of liability presented by the pleadings”].)
Where a motion for summary judgment
does “‘not negate theories of [the defendant’s] liability, the trial court
should’” rule “‘[the defendant] failed to carry [its] initial burden and stop[]
there.’” (Hedayati v. Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club
(2021) 67 Cal.App.5th 833, 846; see Hawkins v. Wilton (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 936, 945.) 
The FAC presents what the Court has
previously summarized as four factual paths to damages: 
(1) The Claypool
Defendants’ failure to submit key medical records for Michelle Leonard’s
injuries in relation the Route 91 shooting and class action case in Nevada
(FAC, ¶¶ 9, 9.A.);
(2) The Claypool
Defendants’ failure to file documentation from the federal government regarding
Michelle Leonard’s total disability as a result of her injuries in relation the
Route 91 shooting and class action case in Nevada (FAC, ¶¶ 9, 9.B.);
(3) The Claypool
Defendants providing erroneous tax information regarding Michelle Leonard’s
personal injury claims (FAC, ¶¶ 9, 9.C.); and
(4) The Claypool
Defendants’ omission of the aforementioned misconduct through failure and
refusal to communicate with Michelle Leonard to keep her apprised of the
significant developments in the class action case or respond to Michelle
Leonard’s documents requests, including giving Michelle Leonard a copy of her
retainer agreement upon execution (FAC, ¶ 10-10.C.).
The Claypool Defendants’
motion for summary judgment addresses paths (1) and (2) and path (4) insofar as
it is derivative of paths (1) and (2). This is because the motion for summary
judgment relies on arguments for the most part relying on whether Plaintiff
Leonard could have recovered a greater award in the underlying action,
necessarily relating to the alleged failure to submit documents in that action
regarding Plaintiff Leonard’s disability. (See, e.g., Refiled MSJ, pp. 6-9
[focusing majority of the ‘arguments’ section of the points and authorities on
arguments relating to recovery under the protocol applied in the underlying
action; no mention of tax advice].)
However, path (3) for
damages—erroneous tax advice—and path (4) as derivative of path (3) do not appear
in the Claypool Defendants’ points and authorities and separate statement,
which fail to mention “tax advice” altogether. (Cf. FAC, ¶ 9.C. [erroneous tax
advice as basis for liability].) This omission cannot be overlooked.
As recently as April
15, 2024, in relation to a motion to reclassify, the Court ordered the parties
to brief arguments for damages arising from erroneous tax advice, resulting in
the Court’s May 1, 2024, ruling. (5/1/24 Ruling, pp. 5-6.) At that time,
Plaintiff Leonard was not able to make an evidentiary showing of such damages
in relation to the motion to reclassify. (Ibid.) However, here, the
initial burden on summary judgment is on the moving party or parties, which are
the Claypool Defendants. (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p.
850.) That burden includes disproving “all theories of liability reflected in
the complaint.” (Lopez, supra, 45 Cal.App.4th at p. 714.) If path
(3) for damages is not addressed in the motion for summary judgment, then all
theories of liability in the FAC have not been addressed, and the Court cannot grant
summary judgment. Even if the Court has previously heard arguments in relation
to other motions that may bear upon path (3) for damages, those arguments were
not raised in the motion for summary judgment.
The sole panacea argument advanced
by the Claypool Defendants—added at the end of the points and authorities in a cursory
argument—is that a plaintiff cannot recover general damages in a legal malpractice
action absent a loss of a liberty right for the client, citing Camenisch v.
Superior Court (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1689, 1694 (Camenisch) in
support. (Refiled MSJ, p. 9.) Otherwise stated, the Claypool Defendants argue
that because there are no damages at issue here, both pleaded counts fail.
However, a review of the cited
portion of Camenisch does not support this proposition. The Claypool
Defendants, without much elaboration, argue that Camenisch’s holding
involved general damages, whereas Camenisch at p. 1694, as cited, merely
discussed cases that addressed whether emotional distress damages could be
recovered in legal malpractice cases. Moreover, the only portion of Camenisch
at p. 1694, as cited, that discusses a liberty interest is Camenisch’s
reference to Holliday v. Jones (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 102 (Holliday),
which, as discussed in Camenisch, addressed the propriety of emotional
distress damages due to attorney negligence. However, Camenisch’s reference
to Holliday did not quote any rule holding that a property interest must
always be at issue in relation to legal malpractice damages. To the extent that
the Claypool Defendants cite Camenisch for a different purpose, the
Court invites further clarification at oral argument.
The Claypool Defendants’ motion is
thus DENIED.
