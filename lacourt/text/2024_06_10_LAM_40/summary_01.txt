And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the Claypool Defendants' motion to deem the truth of facts specified in their Requests for Admission admitted. The court finds that the Plaintiff, Michelle Leonard, failed to respond to the Requests for Admission, leading to a motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,120 against the Plaintiff and her counsel, Kevin Gerry. The court also denies the Claypool Defendants' motion for summary judgment, as they failed to address all theories of liability in the complaint.

The court notes that the Plaintiff's counsel failed to respond to the Requests for Admission, leading to a motion for monetary sanctions. The court orders the Plaintiff's counsel to remit payment of $1,120 to the Defendants within 30 days of this ruling.

The court also notes that the Defendants' motion for summary judgment was denied due to their failure to address all theories of liability in the complaint. The court invites further clarification at oral argument to address the Defendants' reliance on Camenisch v. Superior Court (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1689, 1694, which the court finds does not support the Defendants' argument.
