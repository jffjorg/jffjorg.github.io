I. Background
A. Motion to Quash
Around August 15, 2023,
Defendant/Cross-Complainant 1351 Orizaba Avenue, LLC (1351 Orizaba) served a
business records subpoena on Preferred Bank seeking production of (1) financial
documents filed by Cross-Defendant Hooman Nissani with Preferred Bank and (2) various
types of financial, corporate, or payment documents for Ridge Property LLC, SJS
Long Beach LLC, 737 N La Brea LLC, 3170 Cherry Avenue Property LLC, 3399 Willow
Sr LLC (Willow), Cielo S. Holdings LLC (Cielo), Culver City Prop LLC (Culver
City Prop), Kip Prop LLC, Lennox Car Wash Properties LLC (Lennox Car Wash), Playa
Vista Real Estate II LLC (Playa Vista), Redondo Prop LLC, and Slauson Gas
Station LLC, i.e., the 12 LLC’s subject to this Court’s January 25, 2022,
charging order.
On September 11, 2023, Hooman
Nissani filed a motion to quash the August 15th subpoena or for a protective
order against that subpoena.
On October 6, 2023, the
Court continued the hearing on Hooman Nissani’s motion from January 5, 2024, to
January 31, 2024.
On November 13, 2023,
1351 Orizaba filed an opposition to Hooman Nissani’s motion.
On January 22, 2024,
Hooman Nissani rescheduled the hearing on his motion to May 6, 2024.
No reply appears in the
record.
On May 6, 2024, Hooman
Nissani’s motion came before the Court, at which time the Court continued the
hearing on Cross-Defendant Nissani’s motion to June 10, 2024.
Hooman Nissani’s motion
is now again before the Court.
B. Motions to Be
Relieved as Counsel
On May 2, 2024, counsel
for HTL and Hooman Nissani filed motions to be relieved of representation as
counsel for these parties.
The record fails to
reflect an opposition from HTL or Hooman Nissani or a reply or notice of
non-opposition from counsel.
Counsel’s motions are
now before the Court.
C.
Proposed Orders for Modification of Receivership Order and Unsealing
of Charging Order Proceedings
On May 20, 2024, the Court held a
hearing for an ex parte application heard as a noticed motion and filed by non-parties
Willow and Cielo, i.e., two of the companies subject to
the court charging and receivership orders. Willow and Cielo sought an order
modifying the receivership order to maintain business as to going matters—paying
mortgages, avoiding default, seizing no further assets, operating companies in
good faith, not distributing seized assets—as well as unsealing the charging
order proceedings in relation to Willow and Cielo.
The Court granted the ex parte
application and ordered Willow and Cielo to submit a further stipulation and
proposed order regarding the two sets of relief.
On May 31, 2024, Willow and Cielo
filed proposed orders for the two sets of relief.
The proposed orders are unsigned as
of the time of this hearing, as they were lodged when the court was dark. No
objections to the proposed orders have been filed.
 
II. Motion to Quash Subpoena or for Protective Order: Motion
to Quash is DENIED in part and GRANTED in part; Motion for Protective Order is
DENIED.
A.
Legal Standard
1. Quash Subpoena
A
motion to quash a deposition subpoena or deposition notice is used to strike,
modify, or impose conditions on a subpoena or notice that is procedurally or
substantively defective. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1987.1, subd. (a), 2025.410,
subd. (c); see, e.g., Catholic Mut. Relief Soc’y v. Superior Court
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 358, 365 [motion based on ground that subpoenas sought
information outside scope of discovery]; John B. v. Superior Court
(2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1186 [motion based in part on ground that subpoenas
violated right of privacy]; McClatchy Newspapers v. Superior Court
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 386, 391 [motion based on ground that subpoenas were
unreasonable and oppressive]; Far W. S&L Assn. v. McLaughlin (1988)
201 Cal.App.3d 67, 71 [motion based on ground that subpoena was not properly
served]; City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th
883, 888 [procedural remedy for a defective subpoena is generally a motion to
quash under § 1987.1].) 
Such
a motion may be made by:
(1)
Any party to the action (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (b)(1)); 
(2)
The subpoenaed witness (e.g., a custodian of another person’s personal records)
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (b)(2); Monarch Healthcare v. Superior
Court (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1287-1288); or
(3)
A person (party or nonparty) whose consumer, governmental, or employment
information or records have been subpoenaed (see Code Civ. Proc., § 1985.3,
subd. (g) [party consumer], 1985.4 [state or local-agency employee or any other
natural person], 1985.6, subd. (f)(1) [employee], 1987.1, subd. (b)(3)
[consumer], 1987.1, subd. (b)(4) [employee]; see also Code Civ. Proc., §§
1985.3, subd. (g), ¶ 2, 1985.6, subd. (f)(2) [nonparty consumer can make
written objections instead of motion to quash]).
A
motion to quash may be based on various grounds, including that:
The
subpoena contains error or irregularities in the deposition notice (see Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subds. (a), (c));
The
subpoena seeks information that is not relevant to the issues in the case (see,
e.g., Catholic Mut. Relief Soc’y v. Superior Court, supra, 42
Cal.4th at p. 365 [motion to quash deposition subpoena because documents were
outside the scope of discovery]; cf. Cadiz Land Co. v. Rail Cycle, L.P.
(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 74, 122-123 [motion to quash deposition notice because
deposition would not lead to admissible evidence]);
The
disclosure of the records sought will violate the consumer’s constitutional
right to privacy (see Cal. Const., art. I, § 1; see, e.g., Fett v. Medical
Bd. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 211, 213 [petitions to quash to nonparties’
doctor because of privacy rights]; Manela v. Superior Court (2009) 117
Cal.App.4th 1139, 1150-1151 [motion to quash a subpoena to party’s doctor
because of privacy rights]); and
The
disclosure of records will violate a privilege of the consumer, the witness, or
a person with whom the witness has a relationship that requires the witness to
assert the privilege on the person’s behalf. (See, e.g., Monarch Healthcare
v. Superior Court, supra, 78 Cal.App.4th at p. 1290 [objections to
subpoena for business records based on trade-secret privilege]).
2. Protective Order
A
motion for a protective order is used to ask the court to modify, prohibit, or
limit discovery procedures to protect a party from an excessive or unnecessary
burden, expense, or intrusion. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2017.020, subd. (a)
[burden, expense, or intrusiveness of the discovery clearly outweighs the
likelihood that information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence], 2019.030, subds. (a)(1)-(2), (b) [discovery obtainable from other
source, cumulative or duplicative, or discovery method is unduly burdensome or
expensive]; see also Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1987.1, subd. (a) [same or similar
standards for subpoenas], 2025.420 [same or similar standards for depositions],
2025.460, subd. (a) [same or similar standards for depositions], 2025.470 [same
or similar standards for depositions], 2030.090 [same or similar standards for
interrogatories], 2031.060 [same or similar standards for demands to produce],
2032.510, subds. (d), (e) [same or similar standards for medical examinations],
2033.080 [same or similar standards for admission requests], 2034.250 [same or
similar standards for expert-witness discovery], 2034.420 [same or similar
standards for expert-witness discovery]; see, e.g., Liberty Mut. Ins. v.
Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1285 [defendant sought
protective order to prohibit apex deposition on grounds of annoyance and
embarrassment]; Stony Brook I Homeowners Ass’n v. Superior Court (2000)
84 Cal.App.4th 691, 693 [defendant made motion for protective order to prevent
plaintiff’s inquiry into how much defense work defense’s expert had performed
in personal-injury actions].)
Good
cause must normally be shown to prevail on a motion for protective order. (See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.420, subd. (b) [oral deposition] 2028.070 [written
deposition], 2030.290, subd. (b) [interrogatories], 2031.060, subd. (b)
[demands to produce], 2033.080, subd. (b) [admission requests], 2034.250, subd.
(b) [expert-witness discovery].)
B.
Analysis

1. Scope of
Subpoena
Cross-Defendant Hooman Nissani includes
a copy of the challenged deposition subpoena as Exhibit A to the Duncan
McCreary declaration attached to the moving papers. A review of that deposition
subpoena shows that it requests the production of (1) financial documents
filed by Hooman Nissani with Preferred Bank and (2) various types of financial,
corporate, and payment documents for all twelve of the charging order LLCs (see
1/25/24 Orders), necessarily including the nine receivership LLCs (see 3/11/24
Order).
2. Receivership
Order
On March 11, 2024, the Court signed
an order appointing Invenz, Inc. as receiver for nine of the twelve
charging order LLCs, including Willow and Cielo.
The receivership order permits the
receiver to “take immediate possession of, and use, all bank and financial
accounts of the LLCs, wherever located, and require that such banks and financial
institutions immediately turn over control of all such bank and financial
accounts to the Receiver, and receive possession of any money on deposit in
said accounts, and endorse and sign checks payable to or by the LLCs,” and
“institute ancillary proceedings in this State or other States as is necessary
to obtain control of the Receivership Property.” (3/11/24 Order, p. 3., ¶¶ e-f.)
The Court also ordered Hooman
Nissani and his agents to turn over to Invenz “all bank and financial accounts
which hold any Receivership Property” and “all keys, leases, books, records,
books of account, ledgers, operating statements, login credentials, safe
combinations, software source code, control and passwords to website(s) and/or
web domains, budgets, and all other Receivership Property records relating to
the Receivership Property, wherever located, and in whatever mode maintained,
including information contained on computers and any and all software relating
thereto as well as all banking records, statements and cancelled checks.”
(3/11/24 Order, p. 4, ¶ b.)
3. Oral
Argument and Subsequent Filings [Repeat]
On May 20, 2024, the Court held a
hearing for an ex parte application heard as a noticed motion and filed by
non-parties Willow and Cielo, i.e., two of the companies subject to
the court charging and receivership orders. Willow and Cielo sought an order
modifying the receivership order to maintain business as to going
matters—paying mortgages, avoiding default, seizing no further assets,
operating companies in good faith, and not distributing seized assets—as well
as unsealing the charging order proceedings in relation to Willow and Cielo.
The Court granted the ex parte
application and ordered Willow and Cielo to submit a further stipulation and
proposed order regarding the two sets of relief.
On May 31, 2024, Willow and Cielo
filed proposed orders for the two sets of relief, which remain unsigned as of
the time of this hearing.
4. Court’s
Determination
a. Motion
to Quash Subpoena at Attach. 3, Category Nos. 2-17, 30-33, 42-48
Pursuant to the receivership order
and subject to the receivership modification proposed order pending before the
Court, Invenz is currently empowered to obtain documents from Preferred
Bank in relation to (1) Ridge Property LLC, (2) SJS Long Beach LLC, (3) 737 N
La Brea LLC, (4) 3170 Cherry Avenue Property LLC, (5) Kip Prop LLC, (6) Redondo
Prop LLC, and (7) Slauson Gas Station LLC. 
(3/11/24 Signed Order; 5/31/24 Proposed Orders.)
In this sense, the
purpose of 1351 Orizaba’s August 15, 2023, subpoena has been satisfied by the
March 11, 2024, order. Invenz’s receivership over these LLCs permits the
parties, including Plaintiff, to receive access to information on the financial
condition of these LLCs and distributions from these LLCs to Hooman Nissani.
Hooman Nissani’s motion
is thus determined to be DENIED as moot as to Categories 2-17, 30-33, and 42-48
listed in Attachment 3 of the subpoena at issue. (Mot., McCreary Decl., Ex. A,
SUBP-010, Attach. 3.)
b. Motion to
Quash Subpoena at Attach. 3, Category Nos. 26-29, 34-41
Relief is GRANTED IN
PART and DENIED IN PART as to Category Nos. 26-29 and 34-41, with relief
limited to modifications of the requests to limit their scope.
Category Nos. 26-29 and
34-41 involve LLCs that are part of the January 25, 2022, charging orders, but
not part of the March 11, 2024, receivership order: (1) Culver City Prop, (2) Lennox
Car Wash, and (3) Playa Vista. (Compare 1/25/22 Orders re: Culver City Prop,
Lennox Car Wash, and Playa Vista, with 3/11/24 Signed Order.)
Judgment was first
entered in this action on May 6, 2020, and was then amended on May 4, 2021, and
again amended on January 2, 2024. Judgment has not been satisfied in any way,
however. Discovery as to these three LLC’s and connections to Hooman Nissani is
highly relevant to the post-judgment collection efforts raised by the subpoena
at issue here.
To the extent that
privacy and confidentiality issues are raised by Hooman Nissani, the Court
notes that the risks of divulging third-party or non-relevant information in
this case can be mitigated through specific orders. However, as to Hooman
Nissani’s own privacy and his privacy in documents that may show his interest
in Culver City Prop, Lennox Car Wash, and Playa Vista, that information is
directly at issue in post-judgment collection efforts, overcoming his right to
privacy where discovery is required for a fair resolution of the proceedings,
including judgment and collection efforts.
The Court thus grants
relief in part by modifying the requests to permit redactions of third-party
identifying information, such as names, addresses (physical or electronic),
titles, or other information from which the persons or entities can be
reasonably identified. The Court makes this determination based on a balancing
of the relevance and need for the discovery on one hand and Hooman Nissani’s,
the LLCs’, and third parties’ privacy interests on the other. (See Ameri-Med
Corp. v. Worker’s Comp. Appeals Bd. (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1286-1287 (Ameri-Med)
[corporation has no standing to assert a constitutional right to privacy but
has a general right to privacy that depends on the circumstances, including the
strength of the nexus between the artificial entity and human beings and the
context in which the controversy arises]; Boler v. Superior Court
(1987) 201 Cal.App.3d 467, 472, fn. 1 [party did not waive third parties’
sexual privacy rights by not timely objecting to discovery demand because third
parties were not notified and given opportunity to object, i.e., cannot waive
third parties’ privacy rights].)
c. Motion to
Quash Subpoena at Attach. 3, Category Nos. 18-25
Relief is GRANTED as to
Category Nos. 18-25.
The proposed order relating to the
receiver completely suspends the receivership order over Willow and Cielo
pending the August 23, 2024, hearing on a motion to vacate the charging orders.
The reasoning two subsections ago is therefore not applicable here.
However, there are doubts as to the
relationship between Willow and Hooman Nissani and between Cielo and Nissani.
Those doubts are to be resolved at the August 23rd hearing, with an arrest of
the status quo pursuant to a stipulation in the meantime. (See 5/31/24 Proposed
Orders.) If the January 25, 2022, charging orders related to Willow and Cielo
are not appropriate, then the discovery at issue is irrelevant.
With the parties proposing to
arrest the status quo, the Court determines that the result that best balances
the parties’ needs is to GRANT Hooman Nissani’s motion as to Category Nos.
18-25, without prejudice, with the August 23rd hearing set to resolve disputes
as to Willow and Cielo’s connection to this case.
d. Motion to
Quash Subpoena at Attach. 3, Category No. 1
The Court finds relief is DENIED as
moot as to Category No. 1 insofar as it relates to (1) Ridge Property LLC,
(2) SJS Long Beach LLC, (3) 737 N La Brea LLC, (4) 3170 Cherry Avenue Property
LLC, (5) Kip Prop LLC, (6) Redondo Prop LLC, and (7) Slauson Gas Station LLC.
The Court GRANTS relief in part as
to Category No. 1 insofar as it relates to (1) Culver City Prop, (2)
Lennox Car Wash, and (3) Playa Vista, as modified above.
The Court GRANTS relief as to
Category No. 1 insofar as it relates to Willow and Cielo.
The Court otherwise
DENIES relief for Category No. 1 based on overbreadth and/or vagueness.
Briefly, Category No. 1, insofar as it relates to companies other than the
charging order LLCs, is vague and may include records for companies that
conceivably have nothing to do with post-judgment collection efforts, e.g.,
documents from times preceding the controversies between the parties, unrelated
to the charging order LLCs.
e. Alternative
Motion for Protective Order
The Court DENIES the alternative
request for a protective order as moot based on the Court’s rulings on the
motion to quash, which include modifications responding to privacy and
confidentiality concerns.
 
III. Motions to Be Relieved as Counsel: GRANTED.
A. Legal Standard
“The question of granting or
denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as counsel ([without client
consent pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section] 284, subd. (2)) is one
which lies within the sound discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind
whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”
(People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations
omitted].)
For an attorney to be relieved as
counsel, the attorney must comply with the requirements of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subdivisions (a) and (c) to (e). These subdivisions require
that an attorney file and show proof of service of (1) a notice and motion to
be relived as counsel on Judicial Council form MC-051, (2) a declaration in
support of the motion to be relived as counsel on Judicial Council form MC-052,
and (3) a proposed order in support of the motion to be relieved as counsel on
Judicial Council form MC-053.
The court should consider whether
the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the
client’s interests.” (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904,
915.) Moreover, the motion should also be denied if it will cause undue delay
in the proceeding or cause injustice. (Mandell v. Superior Court (1977)
67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)
B. Court’s Determination
First, on May 2, 2024, counsel
complied with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Within 16 court days of
hearing, plus additional days to respond based on manner of service, counsel for
HTL and Hooman Nissani filed proofs of service reflecting service of all three
applicable forms on the parties that have appeared in this case. And a review
of the three Judicial Council forms for HTL and Hooman Nissani shows that the
forms are complete and properly filled out. (See 5/2/24 Judicial Council forms
MC-051, MC-052, MC-053 & Proof of Service.)
Second, there is a valid reason for
withdrawal: “I [Christopher S. Reeder] am the managing partner of Reeder
McCreary, LLP. I have had no involvement with this case. Late in the evening on
March 5, 2024, I became aware that a conversation occurred on March 5, 2024[,]
between Hooman Michael Nissani and Duncan J. McCreary of Reeder McCreary, LLP
which resulted in a serious conflict of interest between Mr. Nissani and Mr.
McCreary. On March 6, 2024, after consulting with our outside ethics counsel,
it was concluded that the conflict is so serious that no additional legal
services can ethically be performed by either Mr. McCreary or Reeder McCreary,
LLP for Hooman Michael Nissani and any of his related entities. [¶] It is
respectfully submitted that Mr. McCreary and Reeder McCreary, LLP must
ethically cease all representation of Hooman Michael Nissani and any of his
related entities immediately due to the serious nature of the conflict. [¶] If
the court requires, Mr. McCreary can make an in-camera disclosure regarding the
substance of the conversation. [¶] As such, it is respectfully requested that
Reeder McCreary, LLP be relieved as counsel immediately” (5/2/24 MC-052 from C.
Reeder at § 2 & Attach. 2.)
Third, there appears to be no undue
prejudice or delay at work here. These are post-trial proceedings in which the
prevailing party is seeking to collect on the awarded judgment, no trial prejudice
can exist for HTL and Hooman Nissani in relieving their counsel of
representation. Neither has Orizaba filed an opposition, which could have
addressed questions such as self-representation by HTL. And there are no
arguments before the Court relating to delay.
However, the Court will have to
address the issue of who will represent HTL, because a corporation or LLC cannot
represent itself.
Counsel’s motions are thus GRANTED.
 
IV. Conclusion
A. Motion to Quash
Cross-Defendant Hooman Nissani’s
Motion to Quash Civil Subpoena for Documents from Preferred Bank or, in the
Alternative, Motion for Protective Order [Res ID # 5759] is DENIED in part and

DENIED.
Hooman Nissani shall file a proposed
order in conformity with this ruling.
B. Motions to Be
Relieved as Counsel
