ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On December 18, 2020, Plaintiff Chuck
Peters (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, filed a Complaint against Defendant Equinox
Fitness Century City, Incorporated (“Defendant”) alleging 32 causes of action:
Theft; Deceit; Breach of Contract (Oral); Conduct Unbecoming of a Government
Licensed Health and Fitness Club; Breach of Contract (Written); Failure to
Accommodate; Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process; Discrimination on
the Basis of Race, Religion, Disability; Failure to Prevent Discrimination and
Retaliation; Intent; Inducing Breach of Contract; Intentional Interference with
Contractual Relations; Conspiracy; Physical Pain, Mental Suffering, and
Emotional Distress; Punitive Damages; Fraud; Malice; Oppression; Despicable
Conduct; Abuse of Process; Breach of Implied covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing; Retaliation; Wrongful Termination of Written Agreement; Specific
Performance; Injunctive Relief; Negligence/Liability from Dangerous Conditions
on Private Property; Unlawful Conversion; Violation of Civil Rights Under 42 U.S.C.
Section 1983 and Violation of Fifth Amendment; Violation of Civil Rights Under 42
U.S.C. Section 1983 and Violation of Fifth Amendment “Private Taking of
Property”; Denial of Equal Protection as Applied to All Causes of Action;
Declaratory Relief; and Unlawful Invasion of Privacy. (Compl., pp. 1-2.) 
 
The case was initially assigned in
Northwest District, Van Nuys Courthouse East, Department.  
 
On July 26, 2023, Default Judgment was
entered for Plaintiff and against defendant Equinox Fitness Century City,
Incorporated in the amount of $3,150.
 
On July 17, 2024, Defendant filed a
Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment. On October 4, 2024, the Court
granted Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside Default and Default judgment. Defendant
was granted 60-days to file a responsive pleading. (Minute Order, 10.4.2024.) 
 
On October 4, 2024, pursuant to the
stipulation of the parties, the case was ordered reclassified as civil limited
jurisdiction case. The case was referred to Department 1 for assignment. (Minute Order, 10.4.2024.) 
 
On October 9, 2024, the matter was
reassigned at the direction of the Supervising Judge to Department 25 at the
Spring Street Courthouse for all further proceedings. Trial Setting Conference
was scheduled for November 15, 2024. (Minute Order, 10.9.2024.) 
 
On November 15, 2024, on the Court’s
own motion, the Trial Setting Conference scheduled for 11/15/2024 was continued
to 12/16/2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Department 25 at Spring Street Courthouse. The
Court set an Order to Show Cause Re: Why Sanctions of up to $260 should not be
imposed based on Plaintiff’s failure to appear on 11/15/2024, which is
scheduled for 12/16/2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Department 25 at Spring Street
Courthouse. 
 
On December 4, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint (“Demurrer”) as to every cause of
action. Defendant also filed the instant Motion to Strike (the “Motion”) as to
portions of Plaintiff’s Complaint.
 
No Opposition was filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
“As a general matter, in a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone,
and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes
the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.)
The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it
stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
A general demurrer may be
brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) if
insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted or under
section 430.10, subdivision (a), where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject
of the cause of action alleged in the pleading. All other grounds listed in
Section 430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision (f), are special
demurrers. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).) 
Where a demurrer is
sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015)
244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
III.             
Discussion

 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or
by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer
for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days
before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41,
subd. (a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a
declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(3).) 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a). (Buddingh, Jr. Decl.) According to the declaration,
Defendant’s counsel sent a letter to Plaintiff, which invited Plaintiff to meet
and confer with Defendant regarding the instant matter. (Buddingh, Jr. Decl., ¶
2, Exh. A.) Additionally, the correspondence also included a copy of a letter
from 2017 regarding a similar claim filed by Plaintiff against Defendant, and
the written correspondence was served by FedEx to the address listed for
Plaintiff in the Complaint. (Buddingh, Jr. Decl., ¶ 2.) Defendant states
Plaintiff has not responded to the written correspondence, and Defendant has
been unable to telephone Plaintiff “as the caption of the Complaint fails to
list a contact telephone number for Plaintiff in violation of California Rule
of Court 2.111(1).” (Buddingh, Jr. Decl., ¶ 2.)
 
While the Court may not overrule a
demurrer for failure to adequately meet and confer (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a)(4), the Court may not let the requirement go wholly ignored. Accordingly,
the parties are ordered to exchange telephone numbers and commence meet and
confer via telephonic conference in the next five (5) days. The demurring party
will initiate the call, and the call must discuss each cause of action. Ten
(10) days later, a second meet and confer will take place between the parties. Thereafter,
the demurring party is ordered to file and serve a declaration detailing the
meet and confer efforts made, the discussions that transpired during meet and
confer, and the responses given for each argument discussed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.41.)
 
IV.             
Jurisdictional
Issues
 
Pursuant to the stipulation of the
parties on October 4, 2024, the case was reassigned as limited jurisdiction and
assigned to Department 25 at Spring Street Courthouse.
