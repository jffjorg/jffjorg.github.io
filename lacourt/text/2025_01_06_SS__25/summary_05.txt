Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The defendants, Mengtong Zhang and Charming Bunny, argue that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over them due to improper service of the summons and complaint. The plaintiff, Rita Rodriguez, failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that service was done in compliance with statutory requirements. The judge notes that the plaintiff's proof of service was not attested to by a registered process server and that the plaintiff did not provide any evidence or argument to prove service was done in compliance with statutory requirements. Therefore, the court finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate service of the summons and complaint on the defendants. The motion is granted, and the court orders the moving party to give notice.
