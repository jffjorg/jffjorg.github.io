ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On August 29, 2024, Rita Rodriguez
(“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, initiated this action against Defendants
Charming Bunny (“Charming Bunny”) and Mengtong Zhang (“Zhang”) (“Defendants”),
alleging causes of action for “Stalking, Harassment, Forced Abortion, and
Wrongful Termination.” (Compl., p. 1.)
 
On September 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed
proof of service by mail of the Summons and Complaint and accompanying
documents on Charming Bunny. (9/3/24 Proof of Service, ¶¶ 4, 5, 6, Attachment
to Proof of Service.) 
 
On October 16, 2024, Specially
Appearing Defendants filed the instant Motion to Quash Service of Summons and
Complaint (the “Motion”) and Demurrer to the Complaint (“Demurrer”). 
 
On November 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
Opposition (titled “Response”) to the Motion and Demurrer. 
 
On December 26, 2024, Defendants filed
a Reply. 
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes
the Motion is not timely. A motion to quash must be made by the last day for a
party to file a responsive pleading, or within any further time the court
allows for good cause. (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a).) Service being
effectuated by September 3, 2024, the last day for Defendants to respond to the
Complaint was October 3, 2024. However, given the defects in service of the
Summons and Complaint, the Court finds good cause exists and exercises its
discretion to address the untimely Motion on the merits. (Code Civ. Proc., §
418.10, subd. (a).)
 
Additionally, Defendants state that a
separate Request for Judicial Notice and “certified copies of the files” in
another action are filed with the Demurrer. (Motion, p. 4); however, no such
documents are attached to the Demurrer or the Motion. The Court cannot rule on
a request and documents that are not before it.
 
III.             
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
A.    Motion to Quash Service of Summons and
Complaint
 
Defendants move to quash service of
process on the grounds that “[w]hen multiple actions concerning the same
controversy are pending between the same parties in more than one case in
California Superior Court, the first court to assume jurisdiction has
‘exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the subject matter and all parties
involved until such time as all necessarily related matters have been resolved.’
” (Motion, p. 9, no citation included in Motion.) Defendants contend that since
there is another case between the parties (Case No. 24STCV21003, Rodriguez
v. Romero, et al.) regarding the same subject matter and where improper
service was first effected, the instant action should be abated and the
Complaint dismissed. (Motion, pp. 9-10, citing People ex rel. Garamendi v.
American Autoplan, Inc. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 769-772; Consumer
Advocacy Group, Inc. v. ExxonMobil Corp. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 675, 682.)  
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff states the
following: “Plaintiff hereby requests the dismissal and complete opposition of
this Motion to Quash of the Summons and the complaint on the grounds: The Court
lacks jurisdiction over the Plaintiff. Code Civ. Proc. Section 418.10(a)(1).”[1] (Motion,
p. 2.) While stated in relation to the Demurrer, Plaintiff further contends
that she “properly served the actual lawsuit. Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure 684.210-684220,” and “[Plaintiff] herself was not properly served the
motion to quash.”[2] 
 
In Reply, Defendants reiterate many of
the same arguments in the Motion as well as further dispute the veracity of
Plaintiff’s factual allegations. (Reply, pp. 1, 3-4.) Defendants also state
that, contrary to Plaintiff’s claim otherwise, the Notice of Motion was
properly served on Plaintiff. (Reply, p. 2.)
 
“A defendant, on or before
the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the
court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one
or more of the following purposes: To quash service of summons on the ground of
lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
418.10, subd. (a)(1), emphasis added.) 
 
 “When a defendant challenges the court’s
personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden
is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter
alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.’ ” (Summers v. McClanahan
(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413; see also Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210
Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160.) However, a proof of service containing a declaration
from a registered process server invokes a rebuttable presumption affecting the
burden of producing evidence of the facts stated in the return. (Cal. Evid.
Code, § 647; see¿American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara¿(2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 383, 390.) 
 
Here, Defendants move to quash service
of the Summons and Complaint on the grounds that the instant court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over the Defendants. As
Plaintiff’s proof of service was not attested to by a registered process
server, the burden of proving service in conformity with the statutory
requirements falls to Plaintiff. (Summers, supra, 140 Cal.App.4th
at p. 413.)
 
While Plaintiff opposes the Motion in
its entirety, Plaintiff does not provide any evidence or argument to prove
service was done in compliance with statutory requirements. As to Plaintiff’s contention
that Defendants’ improper service of the Motion renders Plaintiffs’ service of
the Summons and Complaint proper, service of Defendants’ Motion does not impact
the determination of whether Plaintiff properly served the Summons and
Complaint on Defendants. 
 
Additionally, the Court notes Plaintiff’s
proof of service was filed on form POS-040, which states: “Do not use this
form to show service of a summons and complaint or for electronic service”
(emphasis added), and Plaintiff served the Summons and Complaint by mail only.
 
Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiff
has failed to meet her burden of demonstrating service of the Summons and
Complaint on Defendants was in conformance with statutory requirements.
 
Thus, Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED.
 
IV.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
Specially Appearing
Defendants’ Mengtong Zhang and Charming Bunny’s Motion to Quash Service of
Summons and Complaint is GRANTED.
 
Based on the Court’s
Ruling on the Motion to Quash the Demurrer is MOOT.
 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice.
