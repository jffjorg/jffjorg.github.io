ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On March 19, 2024,
Plaintiff Mary Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”)
filed an action against Defendant Valeria De La Luz Ramos (“Defendant”) and
Does 1-10 alleging a single cause of action for Breach of Contract. (Compl., pp.
1, 2.) 
 
On
June 17, 2024, Defendant concurrently filed a Demurrer to the Complaint (the
“Demurrer”) and Answer. No opposition was filed to the Demurrer.
 
On
July 17, 2024, the Court held a hearing on the Demurrer and determined the
Complaint failed to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for
Breach of Contract. (7/17/24 Order.) Accordingly, the Court sustained the
Demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. (7/17/24 Order.) Plaintiff, Mary
Rodriguez, self-represented appeared at the hearing. Valeria De La Luz Ramos,
self-represented appeared at the hearing. Judicial Assistant was ordered to
give notice. Certificate of Mailing indicates both parties were served with
Minute Order (Hearing on Defendant’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint). 
 
On
September 25, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Dismiss the Action
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2) (the
“Motion”). 
 
To date, no Opposition to
the Motion has been filed. 
 
On November 5, 2024, the
Court continued the hearing on the Motion from November 18, 2024 to January 6,
2025 due to the Court’s unavailability and calendar congestion. (11/5/24
Order.)
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section 581,
subdivision (f)(2) provides that upon motion of any party, the Court may
dismiss the Complaint when a defendant’s demurrer is sustained with leave to
amend and the plaintiff fails to amend the pleading within the time allowed by
the court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 581, subd. (f)(2).) 
 
Here, more than 20 days has passed
since the ruling sustaining the Demurrer to the Complaint with leave to amend, and
Plaintiff has not filed an Amended Complaint. As Plaintiff has neither filed an
Amended Complaint nor an Opposition to the instant Motion to date, Defendant’s
request to dismiss the Complaint is granted with prejudice.  “The failure to amend … is an admission that
plaintiff has state the case as strongly as he can and there are no facts that
could be alleged to cure the defect.” (Cano v. Glover (2006) 143
Cal.App.4th 326, 329-330.) 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion is
GRANTED.
 
III.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant Valeria De La Luz Ramos’s Motion to Dismiss
is GRANTED. Plaintiff Mary Rodriguez’s Complaint is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
 
The Non-Jury Trial scheduled for 09/16/2025 is advanced
to this date and hereby taken off calendar/vacated.
 
Judicial Assistant is directed
to give notice.
