ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On March 5, 2024, Plaintiff Cassandra
Watkins (“Plaintiff”), proceeding pro se, filed the instant action against Defendant
Danielle Lee (“Defendant”) alleging “Wrong Eviction & Injury” and seeking
relief of $35,000. (Compl., p. 1.)
 
On April 25, 2024, Defendant filed an
Answer.
 
On September 16, 2024, the Court
granted Defendant’s unopposed Motions to Compel Discovery – namely, Plaintiff’s
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production, Set
One. (9/16/24 Order) – and ordered Plaintiff to provide responses within 30
days. The Court also ordered sanctions against Plaintiff in the sum of $460.00
payable to Defendant by October 16, 2024. (9/16/24 Order.) 
 
On September 17, 2024, the Notice of
Ruling regarding Defendant’s Motions to Compel Discovery was served by mail and
electronic service on Plaintiff. (Motion, 9/17/24 Proof of Service.) 
 
On October 22, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant “Motion for Terminating Sanctions for Failure to Comply with
Discovery Order; and for Monetary Sanctions” against Plaintiff (the “Motion”). 
 
No Opposition has been filed.
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
Plaintiff was served by mail and
electronic service on September 17, 2024 with the Notice of Ruling from
September 16, 2024 and on October 22, 2024 with the Motion and Proposed Order.
Defendant served Plaintiff at the following address: “2934 ½ Normandie Ave.,
Los Angeles, CA 90007.” While this address is substantially similar to the
address that Plaintiff listed on the Complaint, the Court notes there is a
discrepancy between the two addresses – namely, the address used by the
Defendant does not contain the “South” demarcation present in the address
listed on the Complaint. Indeed, the Complaint states Plaintiff’s address is: “2934
½ S. Normandie Ave., LA CA 90007” (emphasis added). (Compl., p. 1.)
 
Since Plaintiff is proceeding pro se
and may not be served solely by electronic service absent express consent,
Defendant must file proof of service of the Motion, Proposed Order, and Notices
of Ruling to Plaintiff’s listed mailing address.
 
III.
