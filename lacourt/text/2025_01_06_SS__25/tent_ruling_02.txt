ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On September 30, 2022, Plaintiff California
Access Scaffold, LLC (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against “Defendant Donald
Jay Sanders aka Donald J Sanders aka Donald Sanders dba Sanders Construction
Company adba Sanders Construction Co. adba Sanders Construction” (“Sanders”), Lida
Real Estate Investment LLC aka Lida Real Estate Investments LLC (“Lida Real
Estate”), and Lida International Building System (“Lida International”)
(“Defendants”) and Does 1-10, alleging causes of action to Foreclose Lien and
of Open Book Account, Account Stated, Reasonable Value, Breach of Contract, and
Statutory Labor and Materials Bond. (Compl., p. 1.) 
 
On November 7, 2022, Lida Real Estate
and Lida International filed an Answer.
 
On December 1, 2022, Plaintiff filed
proof of substitute service of the Summons and Complaint and accompanying
papers on Sanders on November 14, 2022. (12/1/22 Proof of Service, ¶¶ 2-5.)
 
On January 3, 2023, default was
entered against Sanders. (1/3/23 Request for Entry of Default.) 
 
Plaintiff did not file proof of
service as to notice of the entry of default. 
 
On July 18, 2024, default judgment was
entered against Sanders in the amount of $17,233.56. (7/18/24 Request for Entry
of Default Judgment.) 
 
On September 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed
proof of service by mail on Sanders of the notice of entry of default judgment.
(9/11/24 Notice of Entry of Judgment.) 
 
On November 20, 2024, Sanders filed
the instant Notice of Motion and Motion to Set Aside Default and Default
Judgment (the “Motion”). 
 
No Opposition was filed.
 
On December 20, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel filed a declaration stating the parties entered into a settlement
agreement on December 16, 2024. (Aposhian Decl., ¶ 5.) The settlement agreement
included “a clause where the payment plan was contingent on [Sanders]
withdrawing his motion to set aside the default”; however, Plaintiff’s counsel
received an email from Sanders on December 18, 2024 that Sanders was admitted
to the hospital. (Aposhian Decl., ¶¶ 6, 7, Exh. 1.) To accommodate the
situation, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Sanders, who is proceeding pro per, a
PDF version of the agreement to sign electronically, which he did, and now a
fully executed settlement agreement exists. (Aposhian Decl., ¶¶ 8-9, Exh. 2.)
Plaintiff’s counsel now requests the Court withdraw Sanders’s Motion in
accordance with the settlement agreement or continue the instant hearing date
to February 5, 2025, which is the date of the hearing for Sanders’s Motion to
Quash. (Aposhian Decl., ¶ 11.)
 
While Plaintiff’s counsel’s
declaration is well-taken, the Court will not take Sanders’s Motion off
calendar. However, the Court will CONTINUE the Motion due to the circumstances
described in Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration as well as to allow Sanders to decide
how to proceed with the Motion should Sanders wish to proceed with
participating in the litigation.
