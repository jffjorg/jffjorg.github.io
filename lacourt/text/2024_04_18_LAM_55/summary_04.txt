This is a tentative ruling by the Court regarding Defendant Virginia F. Valdez's Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment. The Plaintiff, TOWNS END DEVELOPMENT, INC., filed a Complaint against the Defendant, alleging that the Plaintiff entered into a written contract to purchase an apartment building from the Defendant, who later decided not to sell. The Defendant filed a motion to set aside the default judgment, arguing that she was not personally served with the summons and complaint. The Court finds that the Defendant has sufficiently established that she did not receive actual notice of the case, and therefore grants the motion. The default entered on 1/19/23 and default judgments filed on 3/19/24 and 4/8/24 are vacated and set aside. The Defendant may serve and file a proposed answer within 10 days.
