 Case Number:  22STCV37218    Hearing Date:   April 18, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Defendant Virginia F. Valdez’s Motion to Set Aside Default and Default
Judgment.
BACKGROUND
In this case, TOWNS END DEVELOPMENT,
INC. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against VIRGINIA VALDEZ (“Defendant”), alleging
that Plaintiff entered into a written contract to purchase an apartment
building from Defendant who later decided not to sell. 
On 3/12/24, the Court denied Defendant’s motion to set
aside the default entered on 1/19/23 because the motion was untimely under Code
of Civil Procedure Section 473(b). The Court entered the default judgment
against Defendant on 3/19/24. The Court then denied Defendant’s ex parte
application to set the default judgment and entry of default. Defendant now
brings a noticed motion to set aside the default judgment and entry of default
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 473(d) and 473.5, as well as the
Court’s inherent authority. Plaintiff opposes the motion.  
After Defendant filed this motion, the Court entered
an amended default judgment on 4/8/24. The only difference between the initial
default judgment entered on 3/19/24 and the amended default judgment entered on
4/8/24 is that the amended judgment has the correct case number on the caption
page. The Court treats this motion as attacking the amended default judgment and
therefore will take off calendar Defendant’s motion to set aside the amended
judgment, filed on 4/12/24 and currently set for hearing on 5/6/24. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Under Code of Civil Procedure
Section 473(d), a default judgment entered against a defendant who was not
served in the manner prescribed by statute is void and must be set aside. Calvert
v. Al Binali (2018) 29 Cal. App. 5th 954, 961-62. Code of Civil Procedure
Section 473.5 authorizes a court to set aside default and default judgment if the
court finds that the service has not given defendant actual notice in time to
defend the action and the defendant’s lack of actual notice was not cause by
the defendant’s avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. Code
Civ. Proc., §473.5; Anastos v. Lee (2004) 118 Cal. App. 4th 1314, 1319
(judge properly denied defendant’s motion in absence of affidavit or
declaration that defendants’ lack of actual notice was not cause by their
inexcusable neglect or avoidance of service). 
ANALYSIS
Evidentiary Rulings
The Court sustains all evidentiary objections filed
with the opposition, but notes that other evidence survives for consideration.
            Renewed
Motion
The parties did not brief renewed motions, but the
Court addresses it as being directly related to Plaintiff’s argument that this
motion is a disguised reconsideration motion.
A renewed motion may be filed more than 10 days after
the original motion was denied, where based upon new law or facts. UAS
Management, Inc. v. Mater Misericordiae Hosp. (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 357,
367-368. “Whether the ‘new’ facts alleged on a motion for renewal are
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 1008, subdivision (b), is a
question confided to the sound discretion of the trial court, with the exercise
of which we will not interfere absent an obvious showing of abuse.” Graham
v. Hansen (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 965, 971. 
Here, after Defendant filed her initial motion to set
aside, the Court entered the default judgment. The subsequent filing of the
default judgment is a new fact that justifies hearing the second motion brought
beyond the deadline for reconsideration.
Thus, the Court will address the merits.
            Lack
of Notice
The Court entered default against Defendant based on
the proof of service filed on 12/7/22, which stated that a registered process
server personally served Defendant at her home. Defendant seeks relief under
Sections 473(d) and 473.5, arguing that she was not personally served as
reflected in the proof of service, and thus the default judgment is void. 
Where service
is carried out by a registered process server, Evidence Code § 647 applies to
eliminate the necessity of calling the process server as a witness as trial. Palm Property Investments, LLC v. Yadegar
(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1427.) The proof of service in this circumstance
establishes a presumption, affecting the burden of producing evidence of the
facts stated in the return. Id. at
1428. “The effect of a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence
is to require the trier of fact to assume the existence of the presumed fact
unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a finding of its
nonexistence. . .” Id. The opposing
party may produce evidence to overcome the presumption. Id. 
Defendant has adequately rebutted the presumption that
service was effectuated as stated in the proof of service. Defendant explains
she was not personally served. (Valdez Decl., ¶ 4.) Defendant details at length
why it would have been physically impossible for the process server to
personally serve her with the summons and complaint, given gating around the
residence, and Defendant’s being physically unable and unwilling to answer the
door. (See Mot., pp. 10-11 and declarations and exhibits cited therein.) These
facts rebut the presumption that Defendant was personally served. As such,
Plaintiff must present additional evidence to support a finding that Defendant
was properly served. But Plaintiff offers no facts regarding service at all. Given
the weighty evidence filed with the motion, and the absence of any disputing
proof with the opposition, the Court concludes that Defendant has sufficiently
established that she did not receive actual notice of this case and relief is
warranted under Section 473(d) and 473.5.  Further, the Court finds that moving counsel’s
reportedly inconsistent statement in the prior motion, is not binding here
under several cases. See, e.g., Kitty-Anne Music Co. v. Swan (2003) 112
Cal. App. 4th 30, 35 (“party’s inconsistent position must arise from
intentional wrongdoing or an attempt to obtain an unfair advantage.”)
CONCLUSION
The motion is granted. The Court vacates and sets
aside default entered on 1/19/23 and default judgments filed 3/19/24 and 4/8/24.
Defendant may serve and file the proposed answer
within 10 days.
