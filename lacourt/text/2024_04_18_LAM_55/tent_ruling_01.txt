BACKGROUND
The Court entered a Default Judgment in this action

$62,679.74.
ERIK DIAZ (Plaintiff) requests an order, pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure sections 708.510 through 708.560, directing that JOSE
BARRAGAN (Defendant), and third-party obligors, assign to Plaintiff as a judgment
creditor, Defendant’s rights to payment due from real estate sales commissions,
salary, bonuses, payments, and/or distributions, to fully satisfy the judgment
including interest and costs.
LEGAL STANDARD
Courts have broad discretion in determining whether to
order an assignment, and in fixing the amount to be assigned, pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure Section 708.510. Courts may consider all relevant factors,
including but not limited to:
• The reasonable economic
needs of a natural person judgment debtor and those supported partly or wholly
by the debtor;
• Payments the judgment
debtor is required to make or that are deducted in satisfaction of other
judgments and wage assignments;
• The amount remaining
due on the money judgment; and
• The amount remaining to
be received on the right to payment. [CCP § 708.510(c)]
The judgment debtor may claim that all or part of a
right to payment is exempt from enforcement of a money judgment. CCP §
708.550(a).
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff has properly filed a noticed motion under
Section 708.510 seeking an assignment order for the unsatisfied judgment amount
(including post-judgment interest, fees, costs, and less credits) of $62,679.74.
Defendant has not filed an opposition or claim of exemption for the Court to
analyze. 
CONCLUSION
The Court grants the unopposed motion and will sign
Plaintiff’s proposed order.
