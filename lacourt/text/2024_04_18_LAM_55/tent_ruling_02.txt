 Case Number:  22STCV04300    Hearing Date:   April 18, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Motion to be Relieved as Attorney of Record.
 
BACKGROUND
LOU KERNER (Plaintiff) filed a Second Amended
Complaint, alleging that SRAX, INC. and BIG TOKEN, INC. (Defendants) breached a
written agreement to employ Plaintiff as CEO, by terminating his employment
based upon pretexts of self-dealing and conflicts of interest, and refusing to
pay monetary severance pay and to deliver stock options. The causes of action
are: 1) Breach of Employment Agreement; 2) Wrongful Termination; and 3) Inducing
Breach of Contract.
Counsel JACKSON LEWIS P.C. moves to be relieved as counsel
of record for Defendants, declaring: “Professional Considerations require
termination of representation. See ABA Opinion 476.”
LEGAL STANDARD
“The determination whether to grant or deny an
attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.” Lempert v. Sup. Ct.
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173. 
Additionally, ABA Formal Opinion 476 (12/19/2016) is
entitled, “Confidentiality Issues when Moving to Withdraw for Nonpayment of
Fees in Civil Litigation.”
ANALYSIS
Here, the form notice, declaration, proposed order,
and proof of service sufficiently comply with the requirements for a motion to
be relieved as counsel. See
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
Further, moving counsel’s declaration shows a cognizable
ground for withdrawal: Client breaches an agreement or obligation to the member
as to expenses or fees. Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16; Lempert v. Sup. Ct.
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.
Finally, no opposing document has been filed showing
any prejudice to the client. See Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16(d). 
CONCLUSION
Therefore, the motion is granted, and the Court will
sign the proposed order submitted by counsel. The Court will also set an OSC re
Defendants obtaining new counsel at the hearing.
