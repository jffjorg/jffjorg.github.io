Here is the summary in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for admission, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories, as well as compliance with requests for production. The Plaintiff, Young Men's Christian Association of Metropolitan Los Angeles, brought this case against 6600 Selma Ave., LLC, Jayesh Kumar, and Madhuben Kumar for breach of lease and guaranty after the Defendants stopped paying rent. The Plaintiff filed a combined motion to compel, and the parties held an IDC meeting on 3/27/24, where counsel for the Defendants agreed to supplement their deficient initial responses. However, the Defendants' revised responses and document production served on 4/11/24 are still deemed inadequate. The Court grants the motion to compel, ordering the Defendants to serve separate further, verified written responses and document production by 5/1/2024.
