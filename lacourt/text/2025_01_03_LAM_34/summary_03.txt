Summary:

The court grants Plaintiff Finn Weaver's motion to vacate the order submitting the action to arbitration. The motion is based on the argument that Defendants failed to pay the arbitration fees in a timely manner, which constitutes a material breach of the arbitration agreement. The court relies on California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97, which requires the drafting party to pay the arbitration fees within 30 days. The court finds that Defendants' failure to pay the fees by the due date constitutes a material breach of the arbitration agreement and waives their right to arbitrate. The court also rejects Defendants' argument that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) preempts California's arbitration laws, finding that the parties explicitly adopted California Code of Civil Procedure in the arbitration agreement.
