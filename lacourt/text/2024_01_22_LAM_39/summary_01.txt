And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, but with certain conditions. The motion is granted because the additional causes of action do not expand the scope of the case and do not necessitate additional discovery. The parties' settlement discussions and the delay in filing the motion are also good cause for the grant of the motion. The judge notes that the trial date is less than four months away, but this provides sufficient time to prepare for a trial that will include the additional causes of action. The judge orders that Plaintiff will propound no further written discovery in the case and will stipulate to a trial continuance if requested by Defendant's counsel.
