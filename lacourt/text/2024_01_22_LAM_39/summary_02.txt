And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a demurrer to the second, third, and fourth causes of action in the cross-complaint filed by the defendant. The demurrer challenges the legal sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint. The court has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for unjust enrichment, as unjust enrichment is a remedy, not a cause of action.

Regarding the second cause of action for fraud, the court has sustained the demurrer because the defendant failed to allege specific factual circumstances beyond a breach of contract. The court has granted leave to amend the second and fourth causes of action, but denied leave to amend the third cause of action.

The court has also denied the defendant's claims for financial elder abuse, as the defendant failed to allege specific facts regarding the elder abuse. The court has ordered the defendant to file an amended cross-complaint within thirty days.

The court has also set a case management conference and trial dates, and has instructed the parties to file joint trial documents and identify their witnesses and documents by June 26, 2024.
