And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Martina A. Silas's motion to compel Dr. Hamid Djalilian and Dr. Alicia Traktman to comply with subpoenas. The motion was filed after Dr. Djalilian and Dr. Traktman failed to comply with the subpoenas, which demanded production of documents related to the medical examination of Plaintiff.

The judge has denied Plaintiff's request to hold Dr. Djalilian and Dr. Traktman in contempt and impose a fine of $500 each. The judge has also denied Plaintiff's request to compel Dr. Djalilian to comply with the subpoena, citing Dr. Djalilian's expert designation and the parties' agreement to make him available for deposition.

However, the judge has granted Plaintiff's motion to compel Dr. Traktman to comply with the subpoena, finding that Dr. Traktman is not exempt from the subpoena and that she is not entitled to expert witness fees. The judge has ordered Dr. Traktman to appear for a deposition and produce the demanded documents within 30 days.

The judge has also rejected Plaintiff's argument that the objection to the deposition notice/subpoena was insufficient and has denied Plaintiff's request for an order holding Dr. Djalilian and Dr. Traktman in contempt and directing them to each pay $500.
