[1]Plaintiff’s
reliance on Hotels Nevada v. L.A. pacific
Center (2006)144 Cal.App.4th 754. 758, is misplaced. In that matter, it was
error to accept Plaintiff’s pleadings as evidence
to deny Defendant’s motion for arbitration.



[2]
While failure to recall is sufficient to challenge an electronic signature’s
authenticity (Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 158, 165; Espejo v. Southern
California Permanente Medical Group (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1060.),
Moving Defendant provided credible evidence that Plaintiff was the only person
able to access his login credentials to complete the Agreement training and did
so. (Williams Decl. ¶¶ 5, 6, 10, 13, 17, Exhibit 2.) 


[3]
The court declines to develop Plaintiff’s lack of consideration argument. (See,
e.g., Cruise v. Kroger Co. (2015) 233
Cal.App.4th 390, 398 [noting mutuality of obligation to arbitrate
enforceable.]) Here, the Agreement binds both Plaintiff and Moving Defendant to
arbitrate their disputes. (Bailey Decl. Exhibit 1.) 


[4]
The court is not persuaded by this argument because of Plaintiff’s
contradictory declaration. Specifically, Plaintiff claims he did not recall
taking the training for the Agreement or agreeing to arbitrate with Moving
Defendant. (Huard Decl. ¶ 2.) Then Plaintiff claims he “was pressured into
clicking through to the end of the acknowledgment of the arbitration module
without even reading the policy.” (Huard Decl. ¶ 4.) This alone is suspect. Additionally,
Plaintiff does not claim that his manager stood over him to ensure he would
click through the training as quickly as possible, rather that “managers would
pressure us to take training modules as quickly as possible before they
became overdue.” (Huard Decl. ¶ 2.) (emphasis added.) This indicates
concern with employees’ timely completion of training for all issues, not just
the Agreement, and does not indicate Plaintiff completed the training with his
manager looming over his shoulder. (OTO, L.L.C. v.
Kho (2019) 8 Cal.5th 111, 126-27.)
