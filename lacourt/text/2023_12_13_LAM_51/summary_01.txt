And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's motion to strike costs is GRANTED. The court declines to award costs to the Defendant because the Plaintiff's claims were not frivolous. The court did not make a determination at trial that the matter was frivolous or brought in bad faith, and the Plaintiff's inability to prove all of his claims does not mean his lawsuit was entirely baseless. The court cites relevant California statutes and case law, including Williams v. Chino Valley Independent Fire Dist. and Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
