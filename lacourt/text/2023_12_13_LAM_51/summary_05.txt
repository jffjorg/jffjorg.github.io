And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made several key findings in this tentative ruling. Firstly, the judge rejects the plaintiff's reliance on Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Center, where the court held that it was error to accept pleadings as evidence to deny a motion for arbitration. Secondly, the judge finds that the defendant has provided credible evidence that the plaintiff was the only person able to access his login credentials to complete the Agreement training and did so. Thirdly, the judge declines to develop the plaintiff's lack of consideration argument, noting that the Agreement binds both parties to arbitrate their disputes. Finally, the judge is not persuaded by the plaintiff's argument that he was pressured into completing the training, citing the plaintiff's contradictory declaration and lack of evidence that his manager stood over him to ensure he completed the training.
