STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On April 19, 2023, Plaintiffs Lawrence Molbury and Rebecca
Molbury (Plaintiffs) filed a Complaint against Defendants Michael Sinkov,
Robert Babish, and SM Management LLC (Defendants) with four causes of action
for: (1) Harassment; (2) Extortion; (3) Negligence; and (4) Discrimination
against the Disabled.
 
On August 17, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Related
Case to Case No. 23STCV09241, Lawrence
Molbury, et al. v. Dominique Cojone, et al. and Case No. 23STCV11717 Lawnrence Molbury, et al. v. Jake Ellwood
Mallot et al., which the court granted.
 
On September 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC) against the same Defendants with twelve causes of action for:
(1) Harassment and Extortion; (2) Negligence; (3) Discrimination Against the
Disabled; (4) Retaliatory Actions; (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress; (6) Breach of Contract; (7) Invasion of Privacy; (8) Violation of
Fair Housing Act; (9) Violation of Tenant Protection Ordinances; (10) Fraud or
Misrepresentation; (11) Abuse of Process or Malicious Prosecution; and (12)
Unlawful Business Practices.
On October 20, 2023, an Order to Show Cause re: Court’s Own
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and Case Management Conference came on for
hearing. The court ordered the April 19, 2023 Complaint stricken. Plaintiffs
were provided 30 days leave to file an amended Complaint.
 
On November 15, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended
Complaint (SAC) against the same Defendants with seven causes of action for:
(1) Harassment; (2) Retaliation; (3) Discrimination Against the Disabled; (4)
Breach of Contract; (5) Violation of the Fair Housing act; (6)
Intentional/Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress; and (7) Deceitful
Business Practices.
 
According to the SAC, Plaintiffs have resided at 427 S.
Manhattan Place, Apt. 204, Los Angeles, California 90020 (the Property) since
April 2021. Plaintiffs currently reside on a month-to-month basis. Plaintiffs
claim various bad acts by Defendants including, intentionally removing safety
devices on garage doors, repeatedly threatening eviction during the COVID-19
moratorium, failing to accommodate disabilities, escalating harassment, and
failing to maintain the Property safely. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the
status quo pending final resolution upon a trial. (See¿Scaringe¿v.¿J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc.¿(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536.)
The status quo has been defined to mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested
status which preceded the pending controversy. (14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v.¿VRT¿Corp.¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th
1396. 1402.) Preliminary injunctive relief requires the use of competent
evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds for relief.
(See, e.g.,¿ReadyLink¿Healthcare v. Cotton¿(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1016;¿Ancora-Citronelle Corp. v. Green¿(1974)
41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.) Injunctive relief may be granted based on a verified
complaint only if it contains sufficient evidentiary, not ultimate, facts. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 527(a).) For this reason, a pleading alone rarely suffices.
(Weil & Brown, California Procedure Before Trial, 9:579, 9(ll)-21 (The Rutter Group
2007).) The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as moving party. (O’Connell v. Superior Court¿(2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481.) A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the
absence of an adequate damages remedy at law. (Code Civ. Proc. § 526(4);¿Thayer Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler
Motors¿(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 307.) 
 
The trial court considers two factors in determining
whether to issue a preliminary injunction: (1) the likelihood the plaintiff
will prevail on the merits of its case at trial, and (2) the interim harm the
plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied as compared to the
harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary
injunction. (Code Civ. Proc. § 526(a);¿Husain
v. McDonald’s Corp.¿(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 860, 866-67.) The balancing of
harm between the parties “involves consideration of such things as the
inadequacy of other remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity
of preserving the status quo.” (Husain,
supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at 867.)¿Thus, a preliminary injunction may not issue
without some showing of potential entitlement to such relief.¿ (Doe v. Wilson¿(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296,
304.) The decision to grant a preliminary injunction generally lies within the
sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent
an abuse of discretion. (Thornton v.
Carlson¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.)¿¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiffs contend they have been subject to ongoing
harassment, stalking, and inappropriate behavior by the Defendants. 
 
An injunction may not be granted except upon a sufficient
factual showing, by someone having knowledge, made under oath or by declaration
under penalty of perjury.  (Fleishman
v. Superior Court (2002) 102 Cal. App. 4th 350, 356.)
 
Code of Civ. Proc. §527.6(b)(3), which permits a temporary
restraining order to issue when the moving party is being harassed by the other
party, where “‘Harassment’ is unlawful violence, a credible threat of violence,
or a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person that
seriously alarms, annoys, or harasses the person, and that serves no legitimate
purpose. The course of conduct must be that which would cause a reasonable
person to suffer substantial emotional distress, and must actually cause substantial emotional
distress to the petitioner.”
 
Here, Plaintiffs have not provided factual evidence
supporting their motion and they have not provided the authority upon which
they seek an injunction.
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion for
preliminary injunction. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
Counsel for Defendants is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
