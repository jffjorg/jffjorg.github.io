The complaint
alleges that the Plaintiff worked for the Defendants since 2008. In 2019, the
Plaintiff sustained injuries while driving and notified the Defendants about
the accident and later physical therapy. Later I n 2019, Plaintiff completed
the adoption of his child and took leave to bond with the child, which was
scheduled to last until March 2020. Prior to this return date, the Defendant
contacted the Plaintiff to return sooner. The return date was later rescheduled
until August 2020, based on the Plaintiff’s back pain. However, Defendants
informed the Plaintiff had voluntarily resigned by not returning and later
stated that the Plaintiff was terminated on August 17, 2020, due to failure to
provide ADA form, which the Plaintiff could not obtain until August 24,
2020.

LEGAL STANDARD: 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 1032(b) provides
that civil defendants are entitled as a matter of right to recover their costs
[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute.” (Williams v. Chino Valley Independent Fire Dist. (2015) 61 Cal.4th
97, 104.) “Government Code section 12965(b) is an express exception to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1032(b) and the former, rather than the latter,
therefore governs costs awards in FEHA cases.” (Id. at p. 105.) “Costs that would be awarded as a matter of right
to the prevailing party under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032(b) are
instead awarded in the discretion of the trial court under Government Code
section 12965(b).” (Ibid.) In
allowing the discretionary award of attorneys’ fees and costs, the Legislature
“sought to encourage persons injured by discrimination to seek judicial
relief.” (Id. at p. 112.)
“By making a cost award discretionary rather than
mandatory, Government Code section 12965(b) expressly excepts FEHA actions from
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032(b)’s mandate for a cost award to the
prevailing party.” (Id. at p. 105.)
“A prevailing defendant, however, should not be awarded fees and costs unless
the court finds the action was objectively without foundation when brought, or
the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.” (Id. at p. 115.) A prevailing party
includes “a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered.” (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 1032(a)(4).) A court should not conclude “that, because a plaintiff did not
ultimately prevail, his [or her] action must have been unreasonable or without
foundation.” (Christiansburg Garment Co.
v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (1978) 434 U.S. 412, 422.) A
meritless case is one that was “groundless or without foundation, rather than
simply that the plaintiff has ultimately lost his [or her] case.” (Id. at p. 421.)
ANALYSIS: 
 
Evidentiary
Objections
 
This court is unaware of any legal
authority which requires a court to rule on evidentiary objections on a motion,
except as to a motion for summary motion/adjudication [CCP § 437c (q)] or
a special motion to strike (CCP § 425.16 (b)(2); see also, Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019)
6 Cal.5th 931, 947-949.) As such, this Court
respectfully declines to rule on any of these objections.
 
Costs on FEHA Causes
of Action
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant is not entitled to costs
at all because his claim was not frivolous. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
medical condition and requested reasonable accommodations does not give rise to
an actionable claim of disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, or
failure to engage in the interactive process. Defendant additionally argues
that Plaintiff’s dismissal of his CFRA claim and failure to raise other causes
of action in his motion to strike indicate they were objectively unfounded. Plaintiff
replies that Defendant’s evidence supporting its defense does not make
Plaintiff’s case frivolous and that all of his claims are intwined with his
FEHA claims. 
 
Here, the court declines to award costs to Defendant.[2]
First, the court did not make a determination at trial that this matter was
frivolous or brought in bad faith. Second, that Plaintiff did not ultimately
prevail does not mean his claim was frivolous. (See, e.g., Terris v. County of Santa Barbara (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 551, 559
[“The inability to prove an FEHA element is not equivalent to filing an
entirely baseless lawsuit.”]) 
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to
strike costs.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
to Strike Costs is GRANTED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
