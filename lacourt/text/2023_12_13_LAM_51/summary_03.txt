Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Upinder S. Kalra, has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The Plaintiffs, Lawrence Molbury and Rebecca Molbury, claim they have been subject to ongoing harassment, stalking, and inappropriate behavior by the Defendants, Robert Babish, Michael Sinkov, Jake Ellwood Mallot, Dominique Cornejo, and Katja Seib. However, the judge finds that the Plaintiffs have not provided sufficient factual evidence to support their motion and have not cited any authority to support their request for an injunction. The judge notes that the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending final resolution upon a trial, and that the court must consider two factors in determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction: the likelihood the plaintiff will prevail on the merits of its case at trial, and the interim harm the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied as compared to the harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction. Based on the lack of evidence and authority provided by the Plaintiffs, the judge denies their motion for a preliminary injunction.
