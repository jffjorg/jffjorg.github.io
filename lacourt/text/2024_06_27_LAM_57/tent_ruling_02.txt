 Case Number:  23STCV29078    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is denying Plaintiff Tonja Eakes's motion for an order deeming admitted the matters in the requests for admissions she propounded on Defendant Delia Juuldam.  The Court is so ruling because, prior to today's hearing on the motion, Juuldam served Eakes with responses to the requests for admissions that comply with the Code of Civil Procedure.  The Court is, however, awarding Eakes $1,800 for the attorney's fees and costs she incurred in connection with the motion as a sanction against Juuldam.  Sanctions are mandatory against a party who fails to respond timely to requests for admissions, even if that party eventually provides Code-compliant responses prior to the hearing  on the motion of the propounding party to have the matters in the requests for admissions deemed admitted.
