Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to deem admitted the matters in the requests for admissions she sent to the defendant. The defendant had failed to respond timely to the requests for admissions, but eventually provided responses that comply with the Code of Civil Procedure. Despite this, the court is still awarding the plaintiff $1,800 in attorney's fees and costs as a sanction against the defendant for their failure to respond timely. The court finds that sanctions are mandatory in such cases, even if the defendant eventually provides compliant responses.
