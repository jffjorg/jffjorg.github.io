Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel deposition and terminating sanctions filed by the defendants. The Court finds that the plaintiff was properly served with notice of the deposition and failed to appear. Therefore, the Court denies the motion to compel deposition. The Court also denies the motion for terminating sanctions because there is no evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, and lesser sanctions have not been pursued. The Court notes that a terminating sanction would create a "windfall" for the defendants and would not be justified. The denial of the terminating sanctions is without prejudice to the defendants seeking other sanctions or seeking a terminating sanction at a later stage of the proceedings.
