And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motions to compel the depositions of the three plaintiffs (Olivia Mizrahi, Golda Mizrahi, and Yaron Mizrahi) without prejudice. The defendants had noticed the depositions and served objections, but the deponents did not object or appear. The judge found that the defendants failed to show that they contacted the deponents to inquire about their nonappearance, which is required in a motion to compel. The judge also denied the defendants' motion to continue the trial, as there was no good cause for a continuance. The case has been ongoing for over two years, and the judge found that the defendants could have completed their discovery with the assistance of the court if necessary. The judge ordered the defendants to give notice of the ruling.
