```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for trial preference filed by Plaintiffs Ellis Drewery and John Drewery. The motion was filed under Code of Civil Procedure section 36(a), which allows a party over 70 years old to request a preference for trial setting if they have a substantial interest in the action and their health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing their interest in the litigation. The judge found that both Plaintiffs meet the test for a trial preference due to their age and declining health, and therefore granted the motion. The trial date has been advanced to November 22, 2024, and all discovery and motion deadlines have been reset based on the new trial date.
