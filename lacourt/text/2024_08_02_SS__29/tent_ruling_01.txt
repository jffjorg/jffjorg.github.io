  Case Number:  21STCV19502    Hearing Date:   August 2, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Consolidate Cases filed by Defendants
Young’s Food Services, Inc. and Jose Manuel Santiago-Garcia.
 
 
Background
 
These
cases arise out of a vehicle accident on December 12, 2019 on Nordhoff Street
in Los Angeles, California. 
 
In
this matter (Case No. 21STCV19502, the “Donat Action”), on May 24, 2021, William
Donat (“Donat”) filed the complaint asserting causes of action for general negligence
and motor vehicle negligence against Defendants Jose Santiago, Young’s Food
Services, Inc., B&R Group Logistics Holding LLC, and Does 1 to 50. On
August 13, 2021, Young’s Food Services, Inc. and Jose
Manuel Santiago-Garcia (erroneously sued as Jose Santiago) (collectively
“Defendants”) filed their answer in the Donat matter.
 
In
the related matter (Case No. 21STCV42882, the “Old Republic Action”), on November
19, 2021, Old Republic General Insurance Corporation (“Old Republic”) filed a
complaint against Jose Manuel Santiago-Garcia and Does
1 through 25 for subrogation. On May 8, 2023, Old Republic filed the First
Amended Complaint adding Young’s Food Service, Inc as a defendant.
 
On
January 26, 2024, the Court determined that the two actions are related. Both
cases are now assigned to Department 29 in the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
On July 2, 2024, Defendants filed this motion to
consolidate the cases. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
“When actions involving a common question of law or fact are
pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all
the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated
and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid
unnecessary costs or delay.”  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1048, subd. (a).)  
The purpose of consolidation is to enhance trial court efficiency
by avoiding unnecessary duplication of evidence and the danger of inconsistent
adjudications.  (See Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon
Shield Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-979.)  The
trial court should not consolidate actions where prejudice would result any
party, e.g., when consolidation would cause a litigant to need to adopt
adverse litigations positions in a single trial.  (See State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v.
Super. Ct. (1956) 47 Cal.2d 428, 430.)
There are two types of consolidation: a
complete consolidation for all purposes, and a more limited consolidation for
trial or certain other specific purposes (such as pre-trial discovery).  (Hamilton
v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147; Sanchez v. Super. Ct. (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1391, 1396; see also 3
Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial
(2023), ¶¶ 12:340-341.3.)  When cases are
consolidated for all purposes, “the two actions are merged into a single
proceeding under one case number and result in only one verdict or set of
findings and one judgment.”  (Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1147; see also Sanchez, supra, 203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1396.)  In a consolidation for limited purposes, “the
two actions remain otherwise separate.” 
(Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at
p. 1147; see also Sanchez,
supra, 203 Cal.App.3d at p.
1396.)  
“Consolidation
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1048 is permissive, and it is for the
trial court to determine whether the consolidation is for all purposes or for
trial only.” (Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1149.) 
There are a number of special procedural
requirements for a motion to consolidate. 
Such a motion must (among other things): “(A) List all named parties in
each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of their
respective attorneys of record; (B) Contain the captions of all the cases
sought to be consolidated; with the lowest numbered case shown first; and (C) Be
filed in each case sought to be consolidated.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350, subd. (a)(1).)  The motion must be “served on all attorneys
of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases sought to be
consolidated.”  (Id., subd.
(a)(2)(B).)  And before the motion is
heard, the cases must all be related and in the same department.  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3,
subd. (g)(1).)
 
Discussion
 
Defendants
request that these two related cases, the Donat Action (Case No. 21STCV19502)
and the Old Republic Action (Case No. 21STCV42882) be consolidated for all
purposes.  No opposition has been filed.
 
The
Court has reviewed the moving papers and finds that all substantive and
procedural requirements are satisfied. 
Consolidation of these two actions will promote judicial efficiency, and
no party asserts that they would suffer any unfair prejudice as a result.  Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS the motion to
consolidate for all purposes Case No. 21STCV19502 and Case No. 21STCV42882. 
Case No. 21STCV19502 is designated as the lead case, and all future
filings must be made under that case number.
