And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for trial preference filed by the plaintiffs, Ellis Drewery and John Drewery. The plaintiffs are seeking an order for a preferential trial setting due to their age and declining health. The court finds that both plaintiffs meet the test for a trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (a), which requires that the party be over 70 years old and have a substantial interest in the action as a whole, and that the health of the party be such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party's interest in the litigation. As a result, the court has advanced the trial date from February 7, 2025, to November 22, 2024, and has reset all deadlines based on the new trial date.
