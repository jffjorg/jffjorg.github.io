Background
On September
30, 2022, Ventura Cruz Dominguez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Ryan
Andrew Alamrio Orquiza, Arline J. Almario Orquiza, and Rogelio R. Orquiza
(collectively “Defendants”) for motor vehicle negligence and negligence per se arising
from an accident occurring on October 7, 2020.
On February
7, 2024, Defendants filed an answer.
On June 26, 2024, Defendants filed one
singular motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production. Plaintiff filed an opposition on
July 24; Defendants filed a reply on July 29.
 
Legal Standard


A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On February 7, 2024, Defendants served
Plaintiff with written discovery. (Gluski Decl., ¶ 4.) No responses have been
received. (Id., ¶ 8.)
Plaintiff’s counsel states that counsel has
been unable to communicate with Plaintiff. (Opposition, 2:24.) Plaintiff
further argues that the filing of one motion for three items of written
discovery is improper. (Id., 2:13-14.) 
The Court finds that notice and service on
Plaintiff’s counsel was proper and is sufficient.  Plaintiff has not responded.  That is all Defendants must show.  The motion to compel Plaintiff to respond to
the form interrogatories, the special interrogatories, and the request for
production is GRANTED.
Plaintiff is correct that Defendants have
improperly combined what should have been three motions into one.  Combining discovery motions
allows the moving party to avoid paying the requisite filing fees. Filing fees
are jurisdictional and it is mandatory for court clerks to demand and receive
them. (See Duran v. St. Luke’s Hospital (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 457,
460.) Thus, Defendants are ordered to pay two additional filing fees ($120).
This ruling is conditioned
upon Defendants payment of $120 to the Court. 

Defendants’ request for sanctions is granted in
part.  Given the straightforward nature
of this motion, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $610, based on two
hours of attorney time multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $220
per hour, plus two hours of time by counsel’s legal intern at a rate of $85 per
hours.  (Gluski Decl., ¶¶ 10-14.)
Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff.  No sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff’s
counsel.  The Court finds that under the
circumstances, sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel would not be just.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied.
Conclusion
The Court ORDERS Defendants to pay $120 to the Court in unpaid
filing fees within 10 days of the hearing, as Defendants should have filed
three separate motions, not one omnibus motion. 
The Court FURTHER ORDERS Defendants to file and serve proof of payment within
14 days of the hearing.
Conditioned on the payment of the $120 set forth above, the Court
GRANTS the Motion to Compel Plaintiff Ventura Cruz Dominguez to Respond
to Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests
for Production (Set One). 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve code compliant, written,
verified responses, without objection, to Defendants’ Form Interrogatories (Set
One) within 30 days after the later of (a) notice of this ruling and (b) notice
that Defendants have made the payment of $120 required by this ruling.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve code compliant, written,
verified responses, without objection, to Defendants’ Special Interrogatories
(Set One) within 30 days after the later of (a) notice of this ruling and (b) notice
that Defendants have made the payment of $120 required by this ruling.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to serve code compliant, written,
verified responses, without objection, to Defendants’ Requests for Production
(Set One) within 30 days after the later of (a) notice of this ruling and (b) notice
that Defendants have made the payment of $120 required by this ruling.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay sanctions of $610 to
Defendants within 30 days after the later of (a) notice of this ruling and (b) notice
that Defendants have made the payment of $120 required by this ruling. 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
