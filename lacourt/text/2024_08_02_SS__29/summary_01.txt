And here is the English-text summary:

This is the Judge's tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate two cases, Case No. 21STCV19502 (the "Donat Action") and Case No. 21STCV42882 (the "Old Republic Action"), both related to a vehicle accident on December 12, 2019, on Nordhoff Street in Los Angeles, California. The Donat Action involves causes of action for general negligence and motor vehicle negligence against Young's Food Services, Inc. and Jose Manuel Santiago-Garcia, while the Old Republic Action involves subrogation against Jose Manuel Santiago-Garcia and others. The motion to consolidate was filed by Young's Food Services, Inc. and Jose Manuel Santiago-Garcia, and no opposition was filed. The Court finds that all substantive and procedural requirements are satisfied, and consolidation will promote judicial efficiency without causing unfair prejudice to any party. The motion is therefore GRANTED, and the two cases will be consolidated for all purposes under Case No. 21STCV19502, with all future filings made under that case number.
