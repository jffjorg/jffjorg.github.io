English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Webcor LP RCCIP II's motion to continue trial, but only in part. The trial date is continued to early June 2025. The Judge denies Webcor's request to specially set the hearing for the motion for summary judgment to August 9, 2024, as it does not provide proper notice to the opposing parties. The Judge grants the request to continue trial for good cause shown. The motion for summary judgment is timely, and thus, Webcor has the right for the motion to be heard.
