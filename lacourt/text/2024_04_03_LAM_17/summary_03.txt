Here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Jon R. Takasugi regarding a motion to strike filed by Defendants Camille Montenegro, Pina Realty, Inc., and Noe Pina. The motion sought to strike the request for punitive damages from the Second Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Debbie Mejicanos, Heli Santamaria, Jordy Santamaria, Allan Quintalla, Derick Quintalla, and Gessel Rosales. The Court denied the motion, finding that the Complaint alleges sufficient facts to support a request for punitive damages. The Court held that the Complaint's allegations of a landlord's failure to repair, despite repeated notifications by the tenant, constitute sufficient evidence of malice to support a request for punitive damages.
