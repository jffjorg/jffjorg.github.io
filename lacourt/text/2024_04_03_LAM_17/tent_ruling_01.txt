 Case
  No.:   22STCV35638
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: April 3, 2024




 
 
Plaintiff’s motions are MOOT. Sanctions
in the amount of $3,400.00 are imposed on Kenneth Childs and counsel for
failing to sufficiently meet and confer and for causing unnecessary delay in
the discovery process.
 
On November
9, 2022, Plaintiff Iris Au (Plaintiff) filed suit against Enzo Zelocchi
(Zelocchi), Kenneth Childs (Childs), and David Do (Do) (collectively
“Defendants”) alleging: (1) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
(IIED); (2) Attempted Extortion; (3) Aiding and Abetting Attempted Extortion;
(4) False Light; and (5) Defamation Per Se. 
 
            On November 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed motions to compel
further discovery responses from Childs (hereinafter “Defendant”).  Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant to provide
additional responses to Requests for Admissions (Set One), Requests for
Production (Set One), Form Interrogatories (Set One), and Special
Interrogatories (Set One).  Plaintiff
requests $3,615.00 in sanctions for each motion.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“Unless otherwise limited by
order of the court in accordance with this title, any party may obtain
discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject
matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion
made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”
 (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)  For discovery purposes, information is
regarded as relevant “if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the
case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement thereof.”  (City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court¿(2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 272, 288.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
A propounding party may move for
an order compelling a further response to a request for admission if the
propounding party deems that an answer is evasive or incomplete, or that an
objection is “without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290,
subd. (a).)  
 
A motion to compel further
responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be
brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate,
evasive or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. §¿2031.310(a).)¿
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.300 provides that “[o]n receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that . . .”[a]n answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)  
¿¿¿
A motion to compel further response lies where the party to
whom the interrogatories were directed gave responses deemed improper by the
propounding party; e.g., objections, or evasive or incomplete answers.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300.) “The ruling
usually is based on consideration of the following factors:  the relationship of the information sought to
the issues framed in the pleadings; the likelihood that disclosure will be of
practical benefit to the party seeking discovery; the burden or expense likely
to be encountered by the responding party in furnishing the information
sought.” (Rylaarsdam, et al., Civ. Pro. Before Trial.
(The Rutter Group 2015) § 8:1181.)
 
Discussion
 
            On August 8, 2023, Plaintiff propounded Requests for
Admissions, Set One; Requests for Production, Set One; Form Interrogatories,
Set One; and Special Interrogatories, Set One on Defendant.  (Babcock ¶ 4.)  On September 11, 2023, Defendant served
responses.  (Id. ¶ 5.)  On September 22, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
sent a meet and confer correspondence regarding the deficiencies in Defendant’s
responses.  (Id. ¶ 6.)  
 
            On January 11, 2024, the Court held an Informal Discovery
Conference regarding Plaintiff’s motions to compel.  (1/11/24 Notice of Ruling.)  In Defendant’s notice, Defendant states that
on March 19, 2024, it provided verified supplemental responses subject to the
Court’s direction at the IDC.  (3/19/24
Childs’ Notice.)  
 
On
March 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply brief to all the discovery motions,
requesting that sanctions still be awarded despite Defendant filing
supplemental responses.  Plaintiff states
that Defendant waited until the day before their Opposition was due to provide supplemental
responses and misrepresented the parties’ meet and confer efforts.  
 
The
parties do not dispute that supplemental responses were provided.  Thus, the Court finds that the motions are
denied as MOOT.  
 
However,
the Court agrees that Defendant failed to respond to Plaintiff’s meet and
confer correspondence and make reasonable attempts to resolve the discovery
disputes informally.  Plaintiff’s counsel
claims an hourly rate $395 and 4.5 hours preparing the motion and separate
statement, 2.5 hours reviewing the opposition and preparing a reply, and 2
hours to appear in court in addition to the $60 filing fee.  (Babock. ¶¶ 14-15.)  The Court finds that sanctions should be
imposed in the reduced amount of $850 per motion, for a total of $3,400.00 for
failing to sufficiently meet and confer and for causing unnecessary delay in
the discovery process.
 
It
is so ordered.
