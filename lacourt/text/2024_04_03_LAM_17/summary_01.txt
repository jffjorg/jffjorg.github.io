And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding a lawsuit filed by Iris Au against Enzo Zelocchi, Kenneth Childs, and David Do. The plaintiff propounded discovery requests on August 8, 2023, and the defendants served responses on September 11, 2023. However, the plaintiff's counsel sent a meet and confer correspondence on September 22, 2023, regarding the deficiencies in the responses. The plaintiff filed motions to compel further discovery responses, which were denied as moot since the defendants provided supplemental responses. The court imposed sanctions in the amount of $3,400.00 on Kenneth Childs and counsel for failing to sufficiently meet and confer and for causing unnecessary delay in the discovery process.
