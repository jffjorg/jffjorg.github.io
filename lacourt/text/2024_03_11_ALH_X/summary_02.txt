And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Marika McWhoter and Dietrich Riley, have filed a motion to set aside a default and default judgment entered against them in an unlawful detainer claim brought by ASN Pasadena LLC. The defendants claim they were never notified of the summons and complaint and therefore did not have an opportunity to defend the action. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the defendants have demonstrated that service of the summons and complaint did not result in actual notice to them in time to defend the action. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 473 and 473.5, which provide for relief from default and default judgment under certain circumstances.
