This is a tentative ruling by Judge Joel L. Lofton regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel by Robert Vanderveer, the attorney for Plaintiff Chris Arredondo. The case arises from Plaintiff's claim that he was struck by a motor vehicle while on a bicycle. The motion was filed on February 13, 2024, and the court will delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the clients and proof that the clients have been properly served with notice of the next trial date have been filed with the court. Subject to service of the proofs of service, the motion to be relieved as counsel is granted.
