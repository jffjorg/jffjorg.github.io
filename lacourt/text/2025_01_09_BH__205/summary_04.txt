And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to authorize the release of his phone records. The plaintiff is seeking the phone records to use as evidence in the case, which is a car-pedestrian accident that occurred on March 16, 2021. The defendant was driving a commercial van and hit the plaintiff while she was walking in a crosswalk.

The judge has concluded that the phone records are relevant and admissible evidence in the case and that the defendant has control over them. The judge has ordered the defendant to provide the phone records, including the length of the calls, which is critical to showing whether the defendant was on the phone at the time of the accident.

The judge has also awarded sanctions of $1,000 to the plaintiff against the defendant and his counsel for the defendant's refusal to provide the phone records. The judge has calculated the sanctions based on the number of hours spent by the plaintiff's counsel preparing the motion and the court's hourly rate of $200 per hour.

The judge has also ordered the defendant to provide authorization for the plaintiff to subpoena the phone records directly from AT&T, as AT&T will not provide the records without a signed authorization from the phone number owner.
