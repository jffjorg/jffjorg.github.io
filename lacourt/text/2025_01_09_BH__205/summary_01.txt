Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Lender Defendants, Sunny Acre LLC and Tsasu LLC, seek attorneys' fees for enforcing the Promissory Note against Borrower (Corp Realty USA LLC) and Meinhardt. The Promissory Note provides for attorneys' fees, and the Lender Defendants argue that they are entitled to recover their attorneys' fees as the prevailing party in the action. Meinhardt argues that he is not liable for the attorneys' fees because he is a non-signatory to the Promissory Note and did not sign the agreement.

The court finds that the Lender Defendants are entitled to recover their attorneys' fees, but reduces the amount sought by $9,000 for fees incurred in connection with an unlawful detainer action and denies fees related to bankruptcy proceedings and a motion to expunge lis pendens. The court awards fees in the amount of $84,600, which is the reduced amount of fees sought by the Lender Defendants.

The court's decision is based on the following factors: (1) the party claiming attorneys' fees must establish entitlement to such fees and the reasonableness of the fees claimed; (2) the determination of reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court; (3) the trial court may make its own determination of the value of the services without the necessity for expert testimony; and (4) the Lender Defendants are the prevailing party in the action.
