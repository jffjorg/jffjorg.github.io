And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the action. The action was dismissed without prejudice on November 19, 2024, because the court's docket system did not reflect the plaintiff's November 15, 2024 filings. The plaintiff's counsel claims that the failure to file the case management statement was due to a calendaring error resulting from a high turnover of calendar and support staff in their firm. The judge finds that the dismissal was not due to any of the items listed in Code of Civil Procedure ยง473(b), which provides for mandatory relief from dismissals caused by attorney neglect. The court concludes that the dismissal was procedurally equivalent to a default and grants the motion to vacate the dismissal. The action is reinstated, and a case management conference is set for February 20, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.
