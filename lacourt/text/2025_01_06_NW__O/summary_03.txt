As for the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Tesla Motors, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration in the case filed by Plaintiff Felix Gleizer. The dispute arises out of the purchase or condition of a 2019 Tesla Model 3. The judge finds that the Defendant has met its burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement between the parties, specifically the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement (MVOA) that the Plaintiff agreed to when purchasing the vehicle. The MVOA includes an arbitration provision that requires disputes to be resolved through arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The judge concludes that the dispute falls within the scope of the arbitration provision and grants the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration, staying the action pending arbitration.
