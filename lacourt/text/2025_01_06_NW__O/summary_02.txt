```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the definition of a joint venture and has determined that it requires three basic elements: joint control over the venture, sharing of profits, and ownership interest in the enterprise. The judge has also cited two court cases that establish these elements: Holtz v. United Plumbing and Heating Co. (1957) and Cochrum v. Costa Victoria Healthcare, LLC (2018). The judge's ruling provides guidance on the essential characteristics of a joint venture and will inform the discussion at the upcoming court hearing.
