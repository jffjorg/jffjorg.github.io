ORDER GRANTING
  DEFENDANT TESLA MOTORS, INC.’S, MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION



 


 
I.
       BACKGROUND 
This is a Song-Beverly
Act action filed by Plaintiff Felix Gleizer (“Plaintiff”) against Defendant Tesla
Motors, Inc., (“Defendant”).
Defendant now moves
to compel Plaintiff’s claims to arbitration.  
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On June 11, 2024,
Plaintiff filed his Complaint, alleging (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act –
Breach of Express Warranty; (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of
Implied Warranty; (3) Violation of The Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2; (4)
Violation of The Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.22 - Tanner Consumer Protection
Act. 
On July 31, 2024,
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration (“Motion”).
Plaintiff did not
file an Opposition. 
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD
“The party seeking
to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid
arbitration agreement.” (Avila v. Southern Cal. Specialty Care, Inc. (2018)
20 Cal.App.5th 835, 844.) 
“California courts
traditionally have maintained a strong preference for arbitration as a speedy
and inexpensive method of dispute resolution… To this end, arbitration
agreements should be liberally construed, … with doubts concerning the scope of
arbitrable issues being resolved in favor of arbitration.” (Market Ins.
Corp. v. Integrity Ins. Co. (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1095, 1098 (cleaned up).)
“This strong policy has resulted in the general rule that arbitration should be
upheld unless it can be said with assurance that an arbitration clause is not
susceptible to an interpretation covering the asserted dispute.... It seems
clear that the burden must fall upon the party opposing arbitration to
demonstrate that an arbitration clause cannot be interpreted to require
arbitration of the dispute.” (Bono v. David (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 1055,
1062 (cleaned up).)
California law
incorporates many of the basic policy objectives contained in the Federal
Arbitration Act (“FAA”), including a presumption in favor of arbitrability. (See
Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 971-972.)
The Court is empowered by Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.2[1]
to compel parties to arbitrate disputes pursuant to an agreement to do so.¿¿¿ 
The party opposing
the petition to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense. (See Giuliano
v. Inland Empire Personnel, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284.)
Accordingly, under both the Federal Arbitration Act and California law,
arbitration agreements are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except on such
grounds that exist at law or equity for voiding a contract. (See Winter v.
Window Fashions Professions, Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 943, 947.)
Thus, in deciding a
motion to compel arbitration, trial courts must first decide whether an
enforceable arbitration agreement exists between the parties, and then
determine the second gateway issue of whether the claims are covered within the
scope of the agreement. (See Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118
Cal.App.4th 955, 961.)
IV.         
ANALYSIS 
A.            
Request for Judicial Notice 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s
request for judicial notice of Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
///
///
B.            
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Arbitration is Granted
The arbitration
proponent must first recite verbatim, or provide a copy of, the alleged
agreement. (See Sprunk v. Prisma LLC (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 785, 793.) A
movant can meet this initial burden “‘by attaching a copy of the arbitration
agreement purportedly bearing the opposing party’s signature.’” (Id. (quoting
Rules of Court, rule 3.1330).) “[U]nless there is a dispute over authenticity,
it is sufficient for a party moving to compel arbitration to recite the terms
of the governing provision.” (Id. (citing Condee v. Longwood Mgmt.
Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 219).) “A voluntary acceptance of the
benefit of a transaction is equivalent to a consent to all the obligations
arising from it, so far as the facts are known, or ought to be known, to the
person accepting.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1589.) 
          Defendant
has submitted evidence of a valid arbitration agreement between the parties. Defendant
has attached a copy of its Motor Vehicle Order Agreement (“MVOA”) via the
declaration of one of its Business Resolution Managers, Raymond Kim (“Kim”). (See
Declaration of Raymond Kim filed July 31, 2024 (“Kim Decl.”), ¶ 3, Ex. 1.) Kim
declares Plaintiff “placed an order for a 2019 Tesla Model 3...on or about June
11, 2019.  In placing that order,
Plaintiff agreed to the terms of a [MVOA], thereby agreeing to be bound by its
terms and conditions, which included an agreement to arbitrate.” (Kim Decl., ¶
3.) Kim further declares Defendant made the MVOA available to Plaintiff via
hyperlink during the sales process, and Plaintiff was required to attest he
agreed to its terms before placing his order. (See id. at ¶¶ 3-4.)
          The
MVOA’s arbitration provision states, in relevant part, as follows: “If you have
a concern or dispute, please send a written notice describing it and your
desired resolution to resolutions@tesla.com. 
If not resolved within 60 days, you agree that any dispute
arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and
Tesla
will not be decided by a judge or jury but instead by a single arbitrator in an
arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under
its Consumer Arbitration Rules.” (Id. at ¶ 3, Ex. 1, pg. 3 (emphasis
added).) The instant action is a statutory claim between Plaintiff and
Defendant which arises out of the purchase or condition of the Vehicle. The
dispute falls within the scope of Defendant’s MVOA’s arbitration provision. Defendant’s
counsel also attests, uncontradicted, that Plaintiff refused the request to
stipulate to arbitration. (See Declaration of Ali Ameripuour filed July
31, 2024, ¶ 3.)  
          Defendant
has met its burden and Plaintiff has not submitted an opposition. Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion. 
V.       CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion to Compel Arbitration and stays
the action pending arbitration. 
Accordingly, the Court
sets a Status Conference re: Arbitration on January 9, 2026, at 8:30 a.m. The
parties are ordered to file a Joint Status Update on or before January 2, 2026.

          IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:
January 6, 2025

  Michael R. Amerian
