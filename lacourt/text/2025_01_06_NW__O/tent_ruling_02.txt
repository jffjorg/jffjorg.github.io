[2] For example: “A
joint venture has been defined in various ways, but most frequently perhaps as
an association of two or more persons who combine their property, skill or
knowledge to carry out a single business enterprise for profit.” (Holtz v. United Plumbing and Heating Co. (1957) 49 Cal.2d 501, 506.) A joint venture has
“‘three basic elements…: the members must have joint control over the venture
(even though they may delegate it), they must share the profits of the
undertaking, and the members must each have an ownership interest in the
enterprise.’” (Cochrum v. Costa
Victoria Healthcare, LLC (2018) 25
Cal.App.5th 1034, 1053 (internal citation omitted).)
