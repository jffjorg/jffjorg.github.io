And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. (ABC). The Judge grants summary adjudication of the first cause of action, which alleges that ABC violated the California Constitution by requiring employees to become vaccinated against COVID-19. The Judge denies summary adjudication of the remaining causes of action, including claims of religious discrimination, disability discrimination, and retaliation.

The Judge also issues a ruling on a motion for sanctions filed by the Plaintiffs, which alleges that ABC's counsel improperly coached a witness at a deposition. The Judge denies the motion, finding that the conversation between the witness and ABC's counsel was brief and did not prevent the Plaintiffs' counsel from inquiring about the inconsistencies in the witness's testimony.

Finally, the Judge sets the dates for the final status conference and trial, and orders that all future depositions shall be taken in-person unless the parties stipulate to conduct them remotely.
