Conference
 
            Plaintiff
Jilianne Paladino-Boyd (“Plaintiff”) alleges that she attended a concert at the
Hollywood Bowl on June 1, 2018, when she was assaulted by security guards.  Now, Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses from Defendant Contemporary Services Corporation (“Defendant”) to the
following discovery requests: (1) Requests for Production of Documents, Set
Three (“RPDs”), (2) Special Interrogatories, Set One (“SROG”), and (3) Requests
for Admission, Set Three (“RFAs”).  The
Court rules as follows:
 
            RPD #113 – Granted.  Defendant has provided a code-compliant
response, but apparently the response was misnumbered.  Defendant shall correct the numbering issue.
 
            RPD #114 –
Granted.
 
            RPD #115 – Granted.
 
            RPD #116 –
Granted.
 
            RPD #117 –
Granted.
 
            RPD #118 – Granted.
 
RPD #119 – Granted.  Defendant has provided a code-compliant
response, but apparently the response was misnumbered.  Defendant shall correct the numbering issue.
 
SROG #52 – Denied.  It is not relevant whether security guards
not involved in the incident had valid guard cards.     
 
SROG #55 – Denied.  Evidence of remedial measures is not relevant
or reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence under Evidence Code
section 1151.
 
RFA #53 – Granted.  This RFA is relevant to the issues of notice
and foreseeability.  
 
RFA #54 – Granted.  This RFA is relevant to the issues of notice
and foreseeability.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses to the RPDs is granted.  Defendant shall provide code-compliant
responses, without objections, within thirty (30) days and shall provide a
dated verification form.  The Court finds
that there was no substantial justification for the motion and orders Defendant
and Defendant’s counsel-of-record, Clark Hill LLP, jointly and severally, to pay
monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,560 to Plaintiff, by and through
counsel, within thirty (30) days.
 
            2.         Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses to SROG is denied.  
 
            3.         Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses to the RFA is granted.  Defendant
shall provide code-compliant responses, without objections, within thirty (30)
days and shall provide a dated verification form.  
 
            4.         The Court awards no sanctions for the
motions to compel SROG and RFA because Plaintiff prevailed on one motion and
Defendant prevailed on one motion.
 
            5.         The Court sets the following dates:
 
                        Final
Status Conference:        __________, ___,
at 9:00 a.m.
 
                        Trial:                                       __________,
___, at 9:30 a.m. 
 
The discovery and motions deadlines shall be based on the
new trial date.  
 
            6.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
