And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash subpoenas issued to the plaintiff's treating physicians seeking medical records from January 1, 2020, to the present. The plaintiff, Mandana Nazar and Fole, Inc. dba "Suncare Medical Supplies", is seeking to quash the subpoenas, citing a right to privacy in her medical records. The defendants, Shawn Yadidi, Promed Medical Supplies, and Navid Zad, are seeking to understand the plaintiff's medical conditions at issue in the case. The court has denied the motion to quash, stating that the plaintiff has put her medical condition at issue and has waived some of her physician-patient privilege. However, the court has given the plaintiff the option to withdraw her claims for damages related to her physical health and refile an ex parte application for reconsideration.
