requesting that the Court vacate its August 9, 2024, Order
 
RULING: Motion
is denied.
 
SUMMARY OF
ACTION
This case
involves the mortgage foreclosure of Plaintiffs’ real property located at 18503
Olympian Court, Santa Clarita, California. On March 29, 2023, this Court (Judge
Pfahler presiding) dismissed the action in its entirety with prejudice for
failure to prosecute. Plaintiffs Mylene Farooq and Ibrahim Farooq have since
appealed the case.
 
On July 8,
2024, the Court held a non-appearance case review and found that the appeal had
been dismissed. The Court set a case management conference (CMC) for August 9,
2024. At the CMC on August 9, the Court again found that the appeal had been
dismissed and continued the CMC to April 18, 2025. Later, after the hearing,
the Court reviewed the case and found that the matter was dismissed with
prejudice on March 29, 2023. The Court found that the August 9 hearing was set
in error and vacated the April 18, 2025, case management conference.
 
On September 3,
2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the August 9, 2024, order pursuant to
CCP §§ 663, 473(d), and 128.7. Plaintiffs appear to challenge the finding in
the August 9 order that their appeal had been dismissed, and they challenge the
removal of the April 18, 2025, CMC from the calendar. Since August 9,
Plaintiffs’ default on appeal has been vacated pending proof that Plaintiffs
paid their appellate fees within 15 days of the date of that order, which was
September 3. It appears that the appeal is currently active.
 
Defendant
Breckenridge Property Fund 2016, LLC (Defendant) filed an opposition to
Plaintiffs’ motion on October 16, 2024. Defendant argues that it was proper and
within the Court’s discretion to remove the CMC from its calendar and that the
order at issue has no bearing on the pending appeals. Defendant also argues
that none of the three sections cited by Plaintiffs are sufficient grounds to
set aside the order.
 
Defendant’s
Request for Judicial Notice: Defendant has requested that the Court take
judicial notice of two deeds recorded in the Official Records of Los Angeles
County and three court orders from this case. The Court takes judicial notice
of these documents.
 
ANALYSIS
First,
Plaintiffs’ move to vacate the order pursuant to CCP § 663. That section
provides the following:
A judgment or decree, when based upon a
decision by the court, or the special verdict of a jury, may, upon motion of
the party aggrieved, be set aside and vacated by the same court, and another
and different judgment entered, for either of the following causes, materially
affecting the substantial rights of the party and entitling the party to a
different judgment:
1. Incorrect or erroneous legal
basis for the decision, not consistent with or not supported by the facts; and
in such case when the judgment is set aside, the statement of decision shall be
amended and corrected.
2. A judgment or decree not
consistent with or not supported by the special verdict.
(CCP § 663.)
 
Defendant argues
that this section pertains to judgments. A motion to vacate a judgment under CCP
§ 663 may only be brought when the trial judge draws an incorrect legal
conclusion or renders an erroneous judgment upon the facts found by it to
exist. (Payne v. Rader (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1569, 1575 [disapproved of
on other grounds by Ryan v. Rosenfeld (2017) 3 Cal.5th 124].) A Section
663 motion “is designed to enable speedy rectification of a judgment rendered
upon erroneous application of the law to facts which have been found by the
court or jury or which are otherwise uncontroverted.” (Forman v. Knapp Press
(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 200, 203.) 
 
Plaintiffs have
not challenged a judgment. Instead, they have just challenged a normal order.
CCP § 663 would not be applicable to this situation. Plaintiffs are not
entitled to any relief under CCP § 663. Even if they were entitled to such
relief, Defendant also argues that Plaintiffs’ motion would have been untimely
filed, as such motion must be made within 15 days of the date of mailing of
entry of judgment by the clerk of the court, or within 180 days after entry of
judgment, whichever is earliest. (CCP § 663a(a)(2).) The August 9 order was
mailed to Plaintiffs on August 9, and this motion was filed on September 3,
which was 25 days after the service of the order. That means the motion was
untimely pursuant to CCP § 663.
 
Next,
Plaintiffs have moved to vacate the order pursuant to CCP § 473(d). That
section provides the following:
The court may, upon motion of the injured
party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders
as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on
motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void
judgment or order.
(CCP § 473(d).)
 
Defendant
argues that the order may not be set aside under CCP § 473(d). “[I]nclusion of
the word ‘may’ in the language of section 473, subdivision (d) makes it clear
that a trial court retains discretion to grant or deny a motion to set aside a
void judgment [or order].” (Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc. (2007) 146
Cal.App.4th 488, 495.) “However, the trial court ‘has no statutory power under
section 473, subdivision (d) to set aside a judgment [or order] that is not
void....’” (Pittman v. Beck Apartments Ltd. (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1009,
1020.) “A judgment is ‘void’ only when the court entering that judgment
‘lack[ed] jurisdiction in a fundamental sense’ due to the ‘entire absence of
power to hear or determine the case’ resulting from the ‘absence of authority
over the subject matter or the parties.’” (People v. North River Ins. Co.
(2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 226, 233.) “In general, a court has discretion in the
control and regulation of its calendar and may, for good cause, strike a case
from the calendar. (Maximum Tech. v. Sup Ct. (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 935,
937.)
 
There was
nothing void about the Court’s August 9 order. The Court may take a hearing
from a previously dismissed case off the calendar. The Court also has
discretion to manage its own calendar. Furthermore, with the appeal active
again, that means that the case is stayed at the trial court level. Taking a
CMC of a stayed case off calendar is entirely within the Court’s power. The
Court will not vacate the August 9 order based on CCP §473(d).
 
Finally,
Plaintiffs move to vacate the order based on CCP § 128.7 That section involves
the alleged misstatement of an attorney being grounds to set aside an order. When
a party or attorney “present[s] to the court” any pleading or paper, it thereby
certifies, among other things, that (1) “[t]he claims ... and other legal
contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument
for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the
establishment of new law” and (2) “[t]he allegations and other factual
contentions have evidentiary support.” (CCP § 128.7(b)(2)-(3).) A pleading or
paper that does not have the requisite legal warrant is said to be “legally
frivolous;” one that makes allegations without evidentiary support is said to
be “factually frivolous.” (Peake v. Underwood (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th
428, 440.)
 
Defendant
argues that the August 9 order may not be aside under CCP § 128.7. Plaintiffs
contend that an attorney for another party orally misrepresented to the Court
the status of Plaintiffs’ appeals at the August 9 CMC. Even if this is presumed
as true, though it is likely not true considering that Plaintiffs appeared to
be in default on their appeal at the time, this position was not taken by
Defendant or advocated in any pleading filed in the Court. CCP § 128.7 is not
an appropriate basis for vacating the August 9 order.
 
Based on the
foregoing, the sections cited by Plaintiffs are inapplicable or insufficient
grounds to vacate the August 9. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion to vacate that
order is denied.
 
CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs’
motion to vacate the August 9 order is denied.
 
Moving party to
give notice.
