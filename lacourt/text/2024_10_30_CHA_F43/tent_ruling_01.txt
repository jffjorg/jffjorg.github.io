SUMMARY OF
ACTION AND ANALYSIS
This case
involves a fee dispute between a law firm, Petitioner Grant | Shenon, APLC
(Petitioner), and its client, Respondent James Hoseini (Petitioner), that went
to arbitration. Respondent did not participate in or otherwise attend the
arbitration hearing. On June 11, 2024, the arbitrators in this case entered a
final award in favor of Petitioner in the amount of $59,064.00, which is the
sum of $56,251.43 in fee/costs plus $2,812.57 in arbitration filing fees. The
arbitration award is attached as Exhibit B to the petition.
 
This was a
dispute involving voluntary fees. California Business and Professions Code §
6200 gives the local bar association where an attorney practices law
jurisdiction to hear voluntary fee dispute arbitration. When parties do not
agree to binding arbitration in these circumstances, it is non-binding.
However, Bus. & Prof. Code § 6203(b) states that “[e]ven if the parties to
the arbitration have not agreed in writing to be bound, the arbitration award
shall become binding upon the passage of 30 days after mailing of notice of the
award, unless a party has, within 30 days, sought a trial after arbitration
pursuant to Section 6204.” 
 
The arbitration
award was served on the parties on June 20, 2024. Respondent had 30 days after
that date to seek a trial. He has not filed a complaint or taken any other
steps to seek a trial. Accordingly, the arbitration award is now final and
binding upon Respondent.
 
Furthermore, “Any
party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court
to confirm [the award]...” (CCP § 1285.) “[T]he court shall confirm the award
as made … unless … it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates
the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (CCP § 1286.) “If an award in
confirmed, judgment shall be entered in conformity therewith. The judgment so
entered has the same force and effect as, and is subject to all the provisions
of law relating to, a judgment in a civil action of the same jurisdictional
classification; and it may be enforced like any other judgment of the court in
which it is entered, in an action of the same jurisdictional classification.”
(CCP § 1287.4.)
 
Here,
Petitioner has met the requirements for confirmation of the arbitration award.
There are also no grounds for vacating or correcting the award pursuant to CCP
§§ 1286.2 or 1286.6. Accordingly, the Court confirms the arbitration award.
 
The Court
orders the award confirmed, and judgment is entered in favor of Petitioner in
the awarded amount of $59,064.00.
