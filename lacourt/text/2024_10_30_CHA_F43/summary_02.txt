The Judge found that the August 9 order was not erroneous and therefore could not be vacated. The Judge also found that the Court has discretion to manage its own calendar and may take a hearing from a previously dismissed case off the calendar.

The Judge further found that the Plaintiffs' motion to vacate the August 9 order under CCP § 473(d) and CCP § 128.7 was not grounds for relief. The Judge concluded that the motion to vacate the August 9 order was denied.
