Discussion
 
            Defendant
American Honda Motor Co., Inc. demurs to the First Amended Complaint as follows:
 
1.         Second
Cause of Action (Violation of Civil Code, § 1793.2(b)).
 
            Defendant
argues that this is not pled with the requisite particularity required for statutory
claims.
 
            The
second cause of action is for violation of Civil Code, § 1793.2(b), which reads
as follows:
 
(b) Where those service and repair facilities
are maintained in this state and service or repair of the goods is necessary because
they do not conform with the applicable express warranties, service and repair shall
be commenced within a reasonable time by the manufacturer or its representative
in this state. Unless the buyer agrees in writing to the contrary, the goods
shall be serviced or repaired so as to conform to the applicable warranties within
30 days. Delay caused by conditions beyond the control of the manufacturer or
its representatives shall serve to extend this 30-day requirement. Where delay
arises, conforming goods shall be tendered as soon as possible following termination
of the condition giving rise to the delay.
 
     (Civ. Code § 1793.2(b)[bold
emphasis added].)
 
            “[S]tatutory
causes of action must be pleaded with particularity.” (Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 771,
790.)
 
            This
cause of action is based on the allegation that:
 
Although Plaintiffs
presented the Vehicle to Defendant’s representative in 
this state, Defendant
and its representative failed to commence the service or repairs within a reasonable
time and failed to service or repair the Vehicle to conform to the applicable warranties
within 30 days, in violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (b). Plaintiffs
did not extend the time for completion of repairs beyond the 30-day requirement.  
 
     (1AC, ¶ 51.)
 
            Here, Plaintiffs only allege “some portions
of the Subject Vehicles” repair history, alleging June 13, 2019 and November 21,
2020 visits. (1AC, ¶¶ 23, 24.) Plaintiffs do not allege when the repairs commenced,
nor how long those repairs took. Plaintiffs must allege the date which was beyond
30 days.
 
            The demurrer to the second cause of action
is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
2.         Third
Cause of Action (Violation of Civil Code, § 1793.2(a)(3).
 
            Defendant
argues that this is not pled with the requisite particularity required for statutory
claims.
 
            The third cause
of action is for violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(a)(3). Subdivision(a) requires
that a manufacturer that sells consumer goods in California, for which it has made
an express warranty, shall “[m]ake available to authorized service and repair facilities
sufficient service literature and replacement parts to effect repairs during the
express warranty period.” (Civ. Code. § 1793.2(a)(3).)
 
            Here, Plaintiffs do not identify the
repair facility, and which repair could not be effected during the express warranty
period due to unavailable service literature and replacement parts.
 
            The demurrer
to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
3.         Fourth
Cause of Action (Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability—Civ. Code, §§ 1791.1,
1794, 1795.5.)
 
            Defendant
argues that this cause of action is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
 
A.        Re:
Statute of Limitations.
 
            Defendant argues
that this cause of action is time-barred under the 4-year statute of limitations
set forth in UCC § 2725.
 
            Plaintiffs allege
that they purchased their 2018 Honda Odyssey (“entered a warranty contract with
Defendant”) on January 28, 2018. (1AC, ¶ 6.) The Complaint in this action was filed
on December 30, 2022.
 
Here, Plaintiffs allege that their vehicle
is equipped with a defective transmission (1AC, ¶¶ 26, 27.) As such, the transmission
defect existed during the implied warranty period from the moment of sale.
 
(c) The duration
of the implied warranty of merchantability and where present the implied warranty
of fitness shall be coextensive in duration with an express warranty which accompanies
the consumer goods, provided the duration of the express warranty is reasonable;
but in no event shall such implied warranty
have a duration of less than 60 days nor more than one year following the sale of new consumer goods to a retail buyer.
Where no duration for an express warranty is stated with respect to consumer goods,
or parts thereof, the duration of the implied warranty shall be the maximum period
prescribed above.
 
(Civ. Code § 1791.1(d) [bold emphasis added].)
 
Because the transmission defect existed as of the date of the
sale, per the discussion below, the maximum time an implied warranty
under the Song-Beverly implied warranty of merchantability claim could be brought
would be four years from the date of sale,
The four-year statute of limitations set forth in UCC § 2725 began to accrue on
the day of the sale. (Mexia v. Rinker Boat
Co., Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1297, 1301, 1304-06, 1309-10; Donlen
v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 217
Cal.App.4th 138, 149, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Velasco v. Mercedes-Benz
USA, LLC (C.D.Cal. June
13, 2019, No. 2:18-cv-07880-MWF (SKx)) 2019 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 222387, at *3.) As such, Plaintiffs’ claim, to the extent it
is based upon a viable breach of implied warranty, must have been brought no later
than January 28, 2022. Having been
filed on December 30, 2022, this cause of action is time-barred..
 
In Mexia v. Rinker Boat Co., Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1297, as to implied warranties under the
Song-Beverly Act, the Court held that the duration provision did not limit when
the defect must be discovered, but instead,
limited the period during which the implied warranty existed:
 
[T]he plain language of the statute, particularly
in light of the consumer protection policies supporting the Song-Beverly Act, make
clear that the statute merely creates a limited, prospective duration for the implied
warranty of merchantability; it does not
create a deadline for discovering latent defects or for giving notice to the seller.



(Mexia, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at 1301 [bold emphasis added].)


The duration provision provides, in essence,
that the duration of the implied warranty of merchantability shall be the same as
the duration of any reasonable express warranty that accompanies the product, but
in no event shorter than 60 days or longer than one year. (Civ. Code, § 1791.1,
subd. (c).) There is nothing that suggests a requirement that the purchaser discover and report to the seller a latent
defect within that time period.


(Mexia, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at 1310 [bold emphasis added].)
 
The implied warranty of merchantability
may be breached by a latent defect undiscoverable at the time of sale. (See Moore
v. Hubbard & Johnson  [*1305]  Lumber Co. (1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 236, 241 [308
P.2d 794]; Brittalia Ventures v. Stuke Nursery Co., Inc. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th
17, 24 [62 Cal. Rptr. 3d 467]; Garlock Sealing Technologies, LLC v. NAK Sealing
Technologies Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 937, 950–952 [56 Cal. Rptr. 3d 177].)
Indeed, “[u]ndisclosed latent defects … are the very evil that the implied warranty
of merchantability was designed to remedy.” (Willis Mining, Inc. v. Noggle (1998)
235 Ga.App. 747, 749 [509 S.E.2d 731].) In the case of a latent defect, a product
is rendered unmerchantable, and the warranty
of merchantability is breached, by the existence of the unseen defect,
not by its subsequent discovery. 


(Mexia, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th 
at 1304-05 [bold emphasis and underlining added].)
 
            “Thus, although
a defect may not be discovered for months
or years after a sale, merchantability is evaluated as if the defect were known.” (Mexia,
supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at 1305 [bold emphasis added].)
 
The Song-Beverly Act does not include its
own statute of limitations. (Krieger, supra, 234 Cal.App.3d at p. 213.) California
courts have held that the statute of limitations for an action for breach of warranty
under the Song-Beverly Act is governed by the same statute that governs the statute
of limitations for warranties arising under the California Uniform Commercial Code:
section 2725 of the California Uniform Commercial Code. (Krieger, supra, at p. 215;
Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 132 [41 Cal. Rptr.
2d 295];   Carrau v. Marvin Lumber & Cedar
Co. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 281, 297 [112 Cal. Rptr. 2d 869].) Under this statute,
“(1) An  [*1306]  action for breach of any contract for sale must
be commenced within four years after the
cause of action has accrued. … [¶] (2) A
cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party's
lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that
where a warranty explicitly extends to future
performance (not applicable here[1]) of
the goods and discovery of the breach must
await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach
is or should have been discovered.” (Cal. U. Com. Code, § 2725, subds. (1), (2).)


(Mexia, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at 1305-1306 [bold emphasis and parentheticals
added].)
 
            The foregoing
principles expressed in Mexia lead to
the conclusion that the effect of the Song-Beverly implied warranty duration for
a minimum of 60 days to a maximum of one year is that if a latent defect exists at any point during that 60-day to
one-year period, as long as a lawsuit is
filed within the 4-year statute of limitations period which accrues when the
defect comes into existence—then the action for breach of implied warranty
is timely, regardless of whether the latent
defect was discovered after the 60-day to one-year implied warranty period.  In this regard, a discovery after the expiration of the 4-year statute of limitations
of a latent defect which breached the implied warranties would be time-barred.
 
This conclusion is consistent with Mexia because the defect was deemed to have
existed at the time of sale, i.e, within the 60-day to one-year period, and the
plaintiff filed within the four-year statute of limitation. (Mexia, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at 1300-01.)
Mexia did not articulate nor purport
to apply a delayed discovery rule, because resort to such a rule was unnecessary—the
action was filed within four years of the date of purchase.
 
[T]he statute of limitations for an action
for breach of warranty under the Song-Beverly Act is four years pursuant to section
2725 of the California Uniform Commercial Code. (See Krieger, supra, 234 Cal.App.3d
at p. 215; Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc., supra, 35 Cal.App.4th at p. 132.)
Under that statute, a cause of action for breach of warranty accrues, at the earliest,
upon tender of delivery. (Cal. U. Com. Code, § 2725, subd. (2).) Thus, the earliest date the implied warranty
of merchantability regarding Mexia's boat could have accrued was the date Mexia
purchased it—April 12, 2003. n7 Because he filed this action three years seven
months after that date, he did so within the four-year limitations period. Therefore,
Mexia's action is not barred by a statute of limitations.


(Mexia, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at 1306 [bold emphasis added].)
 
On the other hand, if the defect does
not come into existence until after the
60-day to one-year period expires, a cause of action does not accrue because
the implied warranty has not been breached after it ceases to exist.  The date of discovery of the defect would be irrelevant
in this instance.
 
The word “duration” has a clear and readily
understood meaning, viz., the period of time during which something exists or lasts.
(Webster's 3d New Internat. Dict. (1993) p. 703; Black's Law Dict. (7th ed. 1999)
p. 520, col. 1.) In the duration provision, the “something” that has a period of
existence is the implied warranty of merchantability. (Civ. Code, § 1791.1, subd.
(c).) According to its plain language, the implied warranty exists for at least
60 days and at most for one year after delivery of the product; after that time, the warranty ceases to exist.

To say that a warranty exists is to say
that a cause of action can arise for its breach. Defining the time period
during which the implied warranty exists, therefore, also defines the time period during which the warranty can be breached.
Thus, by giving the implied warranty a limited prospective existence beyond the
time of delivery, the Legislature created the possibility that the implied warranty
could be breached after delivery. 


(Mexia, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at 1309 [bold emphasis and underlining
added].)
 
Thus, there is no risk of an open-ended
period whereby a defendant is exposed to liability for breach of an implied warranty
under Song-Beverly. A cause of action for breach of implied warranty can only accrue
within the 60-day to one-year period, discovery of the defect can occur at any time
from the date of sale until the expiration of the four-year statute of limitations,
and a lawsuit must be filed within the four-year statute of limitations which can
accrue at any time within the 60-day to one-year period.  Thus, the maximum time an implied warranty under
the Song-Beverly implied warranty of merchantability claim could be brought would
be five years from the date of sale, utilizing the maximum one-year period which
begins to run at the time of sale (Civil Code § 1791.1(c)), assuming the defect
came into existence on the last day of the one-year period, and the four-year
statute of limitations began to accrue on the last day of the one-year period.
 
Ford argues allowing evidence of postwarranty repairs
extends the term of its warranty to whatever limit an expert is willing to testify.
We disagree. Evidence that a problem was fixed for a period of time but reappears
at a later date is relevant to determining whether a fundamental problem in the
vehicle was ever resolved. (Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th
112, 134–135 [41 Cal. Rptr. 2d 295].) Indeed, that a defect first appears after a warranty has expired does not necessarily
mean the defect did not exist when the product was purchased. (Mexia v. Rinker
Boat Co., Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1297, 1308 [95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 285].) Postwarranty
repair evidence may be admitted on a case-by-case basis where it is relevant to
showing the vehicle was not repaired to conform to the warranty during the warranty's
existence.
 
(Donlen v. Ford Motor Co. (2013)
217 Cal.App.4th 138, 149 [bold emphasis added], superseded by statute on other grounds

(SKx)) 2019 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 222387, at *3.)
 
Although Plaintiffs allege that they
did not discover facts regarding the wrongful conduct shortly before filing this
Complaint (1AC, ¶ 42), based upon the analysis above, the cause of action accrues
upon delivery, not upon the date of discovery. Because the cause of action accrues
regardless of the plaintiff’s lack of knowledge of the breach, issues of delayed
discovery/concealment or tolling are inapplicable. Based upon the January 28, 2018
sale date, Plaintiffs’ claim for breach
of implied warranty, must have been brought no later than January 28, 2022. Having
been filed on December 30, 2022, this cause of action is time-barred.
 
The demurrer to the fourth cause of
action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.  
 
4.         Fifth
Cause of Action (Fraudulent Inducement—Concealment).
 
            Defendant
argues that this is not pled with the requisite particularity required for statutory
claims, and it is barred by the economic loss rule.
 
A.        Re:
Lack of specificity.
 
Fraud causes of action must be pled
with specificity. (Hills Transportation Co.
v. Southwest Forest Ind., Inc. (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 702, 707.) The complaint must allege facts as
to “‘how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.’”
(Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d
59, 73.) “The requirement of specificity in a fraud action against a corporation
requires the plaintiff to allege the names of the persons who made the allegedly
fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they
said or wrote, and when it was said or written. (Citations omitted.)” (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.) 

 
 Less specificity
is required to plead fraud by concealment. 
(Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co.
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1199.) However, “[i]f a fraud claim is based upon failure to
disclose, and ‘the duty to disclose arises from the making of representations that
were misleading or false, then those allegations should be described.’ (Citation
omitted.)” (Morgan v. AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1235, 1262.)
 
Here, Plaintiffs allege in general terms
as follows:
 
32. Plaintiffs are a reasonable consumer
who interacted with sales representatives, considered Defendant’s advertisement,
and/or other marketing materials concerning the Defendant’s Vehicles prior to purchasing
the Subject Vehicle. Had Defendant revealed the Transmission Defect, Plaintiffs
would have been aware of it and would not have purchased the Subject Vehicle.  
 
(1AC, ¶ 32.)
 
More specificity is required as to when,
if at all, Plaintiffs were exposed to Defendant’s marketing materials and exactly
what statements were made in the materials upon which Plaintiffs relied. Plaintiffs
must allege statements which would constitute, at the very least, half-truths if
not outright misrepresentations as to the transmission of the subject vehicle, and
actual reliance upon such statements.
 
            Civil Code §
1710(3)(deceit is defined to include “[t]he
suppression of a fact, by one who is bound to disclose it, or who gives information of other facts which
are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact. . . .”)(bold emphasis
added). 
 In a misleading half-truth
situation, where the defendant undertakes to provide some information, the defendant
is “obliged to disclose all other facts which ‘materially qualify’ the limited facts
disclosed. (Citations omitted.)” (Randi W.
v. Muroc Joint Unified School Dist. (1997) 14 Cal.4th 1066, 1082.)
 
[T]he elements of a cause of action for fraud based
on concealment are: “ ‘(1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material
fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the
plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the
fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been
unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed
or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Citation
omitted.) 
 
(Kaldenbach v. Mutual of Omaha Life
Ins. Co. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 850.)
 
 “There are
‘four circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable
fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff;
(2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge
of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff;
and (4) when the defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses some
material facts. [Citation.]’ ” (Citations omitted.) Where, as here, there is no
fiduciary relationship, the duty to disclose generally presupposes a relationship
grounded in “some sort of transaction between the parties. [Citations.] Thus, a
duty to disclose may arise from the relationship between seller and buyer, employer
and prospective employee, doctor and patient, or parties entering into any kind
of contractual agreement. [Citation.]” (Citation omitted.)
 
(OCM Principal Opportunities Fund, L.P. v. CIBC
World Markets Corp. (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 835, 859 [bold emphasis added].)
 
            This ground
for demurrer is persuasive.
 
            The demurrer
to the fifth cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
B.        Economic
Loss Rule.
 
Defendant argues that this cause of
action is barred by the economic loss rule. 
 
The Complaint alleges that the transmission
defect may cause the transmission to hesitate on acceleration, lose power, engage
in hard and/or hard shifts and/or jerking, and is a safety concern because it severely
affects the driver’s ability to control the car’s speed, acceleration and deceleration,
and could cause the vehicle to fail without warning at highway speeds. (1AC, ¶¶
27, 28.)
 
This exposes Plaintiffs to the risk
of injuring other persons, and exposing Plaintiffs to liability to third parties.
 
            These facts would bring Plaintiffs’ claims
outside the economic loss rule for fraud which exposes the plaintiff to liability
to third parties, as recognized in Robinson
Helicopter and its progeny. The alleged fraud exposes Plaintiffs to causing
harm to third persons as a result of driving a vehicle with an undisclosed defect. (County of Santa Clara
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 326-29.
 
Because the application of the economic loss doctrine to plaintiffs' fraud
cause of action depends on our interpretation of the California Supreme Court's
recent decision in Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979 [22
Cal. Rptr. 3d 352, 102 P.3d 268] (Robinson), we turn to this question first.

Robinson was a breach of contract and fraud action.
Dana and Robinson had contracted for Dana to supply a part for Robinson's helicopters.
Their contract required the part to be manufactured to certain specifications and
prohibited changes to the manufacturing process without approval. When it delivered
the parts, Dana provided Robinson with certificates required by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA). These certificates asserted that the parts had been manufactured
to the requisite specifications. (Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana Corp., supra,
34 Cal.4th at pp. 985–986.) After a couple of years, Dana changed its manufacturing
process so that the parts did not meet Robinson's specifications and did not comport
with the required certificates. However, Dana continued to supply the required certificates
and did not tell Robinson about the change. (Id. at p. 986.) After more than a year  [*327] 
of supplying the nonconforming parts, Dana switched back to the original
manufacturing process that met the required specifications. It did not notify Robinson
of this change either. (Ibid.)

Eventually, Robinson's helicopters began to experience
a high failure rate for this part. (Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana Corp., supra,
34 Cal.4th at p. 986.) It was only after Robinson complained to Dana about the high
failure rate that Dana disclosed that the parts were nonconforming. (Id. at pp.
986–987.) The defective parts did not
cause any physical injury to person, property or other components of the helicopters.
However, Robinson was required to recall and replace the nonconforming parts.  And Dana was not very cooperative in providing
the information necessary to identify the nonconforming parts so that they could
be rapidly replaced. (Ibid.) Robinson incurred more than $ 1.5 million in expenses
for replacement parts and employee time spent investigating the matter, identifying
the nonconforming parts and replacing them. (Id. at p. 987.)

The jury found that Dana had breached its contract
with Robinson, breached the warranties, and committed fraud. (Robinson Helicopter
Co. v. Dana Corp., supra, 34 Cal.4th at pp. 987–988.) It awarded Robinson nearly
all of its claimed expenses as compensatory damages and also awarded Robinson $
6 million in punitive damages. (Id. at p. 987.) The Court of Appeal held that Robinson
had no tort action (and therefore could not recover punitive damages) because it
had suffered only economic loss. (Id. at p. 988.) The California Supreme Court granted
review to decide that issue. (Ibid.)

The court held that Dana's provision of false certificates of conformance supported a cause of action
for fraud even absent physical injury. (Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana
Corp., supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 988.)  Initially,
the court noted that the economic loss rule was intended to separate contract from
tort. (Ibid.) “ ‘[T]he economic loss rule allows a plaintiff to recover in strict
products liability in tort when a product defect causes damage to “other property”,
that is, property other than the product itself. The law of contractual warranty
governs damage to the product itself.’ ” (Id. at p. 989.)

Robinson claimed that its fraud cause of action was
permitted because it arose independently from the contract breach: the contract
was breached by the supply of nonconforming parts; the fraud was providing false
certificates claiming that the parts conformed. (Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana
Corp., supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 989.) Dana argued that its fraud was not independent
of the breach of contract. (Id. at p. 992.) The court concluded that, because Robinson
had relied on the certificates and its lack
of knowledge of the nonconformity had led to economic loss and exposed Robinson
to liability if  [*328]  any of the affected helicopters failed and caused
physical injury, the fraud was “independent” of the breach. (Id. at pp. 990–991.)

The court then reasoned that the economic loss rule did not bar Robinson's
fraud cause of action “because [the fraud cause of action was] independent of Dana's
breach of contract.” (Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana Corp., supra, 34 Cal.4th
at p. 991, italics added.) “ ‘Because of the
extra measure of blameworthiness inhering in fraud, and because in fraud cases we
are not concerned about the need for “predictability about the cost of contractual
relationships,” … fraud plaintiffs may recover “out-of-pocket” damages in addition
to benefit-of-the bargain damages.’ ” (Id. at p. 992, citation omitted.)

  “ ‘… [a] party to a contract cannot rationally calculate
the possibility that the other party will deliberately misrepresent terms critical
to that contract.’ … No rational party would enter into a contract anticipating
that they are or will be lied to. ‘While parties, perhaps because of their technical
expertise and sophistication, can be presumed to understand and allocate the risks
relating to negligent product design or manufacture, those same parties cannot,
and should not, be expected to anticipate fraud and dishonesty in every transaction.’
… Dana's argument therefore proposes to increase the certainty in contractual relationships
by encouraging fraudulent conduct at the expense of an innocent party. No public
policy supports such an outcome. [¶] Nor do we believe that our decision will open
the floodgates to future litigation. Our
holding today is narrow in scope and limited to a defendant's affirmative misrepresentations
on which a plaintiff relies and which expose a plaintiff to liability for personal
damages independent of the plaintiff's economic loss.” (Robinson Helicopter
Co. v. Dana Corp., supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 993, citations and fn. omitted.)

The determination of whether the economic loss rule
applies to plaintiffs' fraud cause of action depends on whether the California Supreme
Court intended in Robinson to obviate the application of the economic loss rule
to all intentional affirmative fraud causes of action where the fraud exposes the
plaintiff to liability or the court intended to provide a narrow exception to the
economic loss rule that applies only where that fraud cause of action also accompanies,
but is independent of, a breach of contract cause of action. We believe that the California Supreme Court's
decision in Robinson precludes the application of the economic loss rule to any
intentional affirmative fraud action where the plaintiff can establish that the
fraud exposed the plaintiff to liability.

The structure of the Robinson opinion supports this
conclusion. The first part of the Robinson opinion was concerned with whether Dana's
wrongful conduct constituted tortious conduct, not whether the economic loss rule  [*329] 
applied to it. It was only after the court held that Dana's conduct was a
tort independent of Dana's breach of contract that the court addressed the application
of the economic loss rule. (Robinson Helicopter Co. v. Dana Corp., supra, 34 Cal.4th
at p. 991.) The analysis that followed suggested that fraud itself is immune from
application of the economic loss rule because fraud is particularly blameworthy
and therefore unlike both contract causes of action and products liability causes
of action. Although the court suggested that its decision was a narrow one, its
explicit limits did not exclude a fraud cause of action such as the one pleaded
by plaintiffs.

Here, plaintiffs alleged that defendants' affirmative
misrepresentations about the dangers of low-level lead exposure, upon which they
justifiably relied, had caused plaintiffs to fail to make timely efforts to prevent
and treat low-level lead exposure. The delay in instituting prevention and treatment
caused more people to be exposed and increased the cost of treatment for those who
had been exposed or continued to be exposed. In addition, plaintiffs, as the owners
of numerous buildings containing unremediated lead, continued to expose people to
low levels of lead that plaintiffs believed were not harmful due to defendants'
misrepresentations. These people who were exposed to low levels of lead in plaintiffs'
buildings may hold plaintiffs liable for the permanent damage to their bodies that
no amount of prevention or treatment can now completely remediate. Thus, plaintiffs'
potential liability to these people
is independent of the economic harm to plaintiffs from the additional costs of prevention
and treatment. Accordingly, we conclude
that the economic loss doctrine does not apply to plaintiffs' fraud cause of action,
and we proceed to address whether defendants established that plaintiffs' fraud
cause of action had accrued more than three years prior to the March 2000 filing
of the original complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (d) [three-year limitations
period for fraud].)

Motion To Strike
 
Meet and Confer
 
            The
Declaration of Kevin D. Zipser reflects that Defendant’s counsel satisfied the meet
and confer requirement set forth in Civ. Proc. Code, § 435.5.
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
American Honda Motor Co., Inc. moves to strike the following portions of the First
Amended Complaint:
 
¿        Paragraphs 53 and 54, in their entirety, on the basis that the
applicable law does not allow for recovery of replacement or restitution and related
damages, including civil penalties, for violations of Civil Code Section 1793.2(b).
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436 (a) and (b).) 
 
            MOOT given
the ruling on the demurrer.
 
¿        Paragraph 57, in its entirety, on the grounds that Plaintiffs’
claim for civil penalties pursuant to an alleged violation of Civil Code section
1793.2(a)(3) is not supported by applicable law and therefore not drawn in conformity
with the laws of this state. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436 (a) and (b).) 
 
            MOOT given
the ruling on the demurrer.
 
¿        Paragraphs 26-37, and 63-76, in their entirety, and Paragraph
e on page 14 in the 
“Prayer for Relief” in their entirety, on the basis that Plaintiffs
have failed to properly allege allegations that would support punitive damages and
therefore the allegations are not drawn in conformity with the laws of this state.

            The allegations
at ¶¶ 26 -37 are appropriate and will be permitted.
 
            The motion to
strike ¶¶ 63 – 76 is MOOT given the ruling on the demurrer.
 
            The motion to
strike ¶ 8, page 14, Prayer for Relief (punitive damages) is GRANTED with leave
to amend.
 
For the reasons discussed above re:
the demurer, Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled fraud.
 
            Moreover, although
it appears that punitive damages are available as to the Song-Beverly Act claims
(Johnson v. Ford Motor Co. (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 137, 141, 143), so long as they are not awarded for the same acts for
which a civil penalty is recovered (Troensegaard v. Silvercrest Indus.
(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 218, 228.), Plaintiffs have not pled malice, oppression
or fraud[2] in
connection with the Song-Beverly Act violations. 
 
“The Johnsons sued Ford and Decker for intentional
and negligent misrepresentation and concealment, violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Civ. Code, §§ 1790–1795.7)
(Lemon Law), the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code, §§ 1750–1784), the
unfair competition law (Bus. & Prof. Code, §§ 17200–17210), and the prohibition
on false or misleading advertising (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17500). Plaintiffs
settled with Decker prior to trial and, after the jury verdict, voluntarily dismissed
their unfair competition and false advertising causes of action against Ford.” (Johnson, supra, 35 Cal.4th
at pp. 1197–1198, fn. omitted.)
 
. . .
The jury awarded plaintiffs $ 17,811.60
in compensatory damages and punitive damages of $ 10 million. The Supreme Court
summarized our disposition of defendant's appeal: “The Court of Appeal found substantial
evidence not only that Ford had fraudulently concealed material facts from the Johnsons
by failing to provide them the warranty buyback
notice required under section 1793.24, but also that punitive damages against the corporation were justified because ‘defendant's
entire customer response program was structured precisely to short-circuit lemon
law claims whenever defendant plausibly could,’ by restrictively interpreting state
lemon laws and ignoring the possibility of nonpresumptive lemons.” (Johnson, supra, 35 Cal.4th at
p. 1200.) In conducting our de novo review of the punitive damages for constitutional
excessiveness, however, we modified the $ 10 million judgment, concluding that punitive
damages of $ 53,435 (three times the compensatory damages) was the maximum award
permitted under the due process clause of the federal Constitution. 
(Johnson v. Ford Motor Co. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 137, 141, 143 [bold
emphasis added].)
As we stated in our earlier opinion in
this case, the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is the most comparable statutory
regulation of the kind of conduct involved in this case. Song-Beverly provides for
a civil penalty equal to twice the compensatory damages award when the defendant
has committed a “willful” violation of the act. Here, however, the jury found, in
essence, that defendant intentionally concealed information with the intent to defraud plaintiffs.
Thus, on the one hand, the statutory scheme does not (with its double damages penalty)
“tend to support the present award of [$ 10 million] in punitive damages, a sum
[560] times the financial harm defendant's fraud caused plaintiff.” (Simon, supra, 35 Cal.4th at
p. 1184 [in Simon the bracketed amounts were $ 1.7 million and 340
times the compensatory damages, respectively].) On the other hand, the present
intentional conduct (based, as it was, on formal company-wide practices and policies)
was  [*149]  significantly
more egregious than the minimum “willful” conduct sufficient to support a Song-Beverly
civil penalty. Accordingly, in our view, the comparison with Song-Beverly does
not begin to justify the $ 10 million punitive damages award, but neither
does Song-Beverly
represent a legislative determination that punitive damages for the intentional conduct
before us must be limited to the lower end of the ordinary range of such damages.
. . .  
We conclude that punitive damages of $
175,000, or just less than 10 times the compensatory award, will sufficiently vindicate
California's “legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its
repetition.” (BMW, supra, 517 U.S. at p. 568.) 
(Johnson, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at 148-149, 150 [bold emphasis and underlining
added].)
 
            It also appears
that punitive damages and a civil penalty cannot be recovered for the same acts,
i.e., double recovery is not permitted, and Plaintiffs may eventually be found to
have waived punitive damages:
 
We are of the opinion that had the Legislature, by Civil Code sections 3294
(permitting punitive damages)
and 1794 (permitting a civil penalty),
intended a double recovery of punitive and penal damages for the same willful, oppressive,
malicious, and oppressive acts, it would in some appropriate manner have said so.
And we believe that by seeking a "civil penalty" and also attorney's fees
and all reasonable expenses as allowed by Civil Code section 1794, plaintiff had
in effect elected to waive punitive damages under section 3294.
