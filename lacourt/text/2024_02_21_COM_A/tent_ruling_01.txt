Norm Reeves, Inc. v. Jose Jesus Navarrete aka etc; Laura Rodriguez
 

FSC: February 21, 2024 

 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER
DENYING PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT



 




 



      The complaint alleges that Defendants
breached a written sales contract to finance the purchase of a vehicle totaling
$58,013.91. Since Defendants could not obtain financing, Plaintiff reduced the
price of the vehicle and rewrote the finance contract for a financed amount of
$23,920.80 which Defendants signed. Plaintiff alleges that the second signed
contract contained a clerical error because it omitted the balance Defendants
still owed on their trade-in vehicle. Defendants refused to sign a corrected
contract. Plaintiff demanded payment of the omitted amount of $33,640.53.
Plaintiff alleges claims for breach of contract and common counts. 
      The clerk entered default against Jose
Jesus Navarrete on October 30, 2023. Plaintiff dismissed Laura Rodriguez on December
21,2024 and dismissed all DOE defendants on January 2, 2024. Plaintiff seeks
judgment against Navarrette only. 
      Well-pleaded
allegations are admitted by the defaulting defendant. (Carlsen v. Koivumaki (2014) 227
Cal.App.4th 879, 899.)
Damages, however, “may only be awarded a well-pled cause of action, and to that
end, the complaint must be examined." (Id.) 
      A
valid contract requires consent, a lawful object, and consideration. (Civ.
Code, § 1550.) Plaintiff alleges Defendants signed a re-written sales contract
for the purchase of the vehicle on August 10, 2021, for a total financed amount
of $23,920.80. (Vince Marquez Decl., Exhibit B.) While Plaintiff alleges that the
“rewrite” contained an error, Plaintiff admits that Defendants did not sign the
“corrected” contract containing the new terms. (Complaint, ¶ 12.). Accordingly,
Plaintiff is not entitled to an award of damages on terms to which Defendants
admittedly did not consent.
      Therefore, Plaintiff’s request for court
judgment is DENIED.
