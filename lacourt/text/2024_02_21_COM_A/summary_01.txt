This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Norm Reeves, Inc. and Jose Jesus Navarrete, regarding a breach of contract for the purchase of a vehicle. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant breached a written sales contract and refused to sign a corrected contract, resulting in an omitted balance of $33,640.53. The plaintiff seeks a judgment against Navarrete, but the judge has denied the request. The judge found that the plaintiff is not entitled to damages since the defendant did not consent to the new terms of the rewritten contract. The judge also based its decision on the principle that a valid contract requires consent, a lawful object, and consideration.
