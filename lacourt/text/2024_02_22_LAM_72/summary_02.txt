And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the anti-SLAPP motion filed by the defendants, McMurray Henriks, LLP, et al., and overrules the demurrer and motion to strike as moot. The plaintiff, Maurice Van Thrower, alleges that the defendants conspired to deprive him of any recovery in the wrongful death action filed on behalf of the Estate of Christopher Nash. The judge finds that the defendants' actions were protected by the litigation privilege and that the plaintiff has not shown a probability of success on the merits. The judge also finds that the plaintiff does not have standing to bring his claims for breach of fiduciary duty or malpractice because there is no attorney-client relationship between the parties. Finally, the judge notes that there is no duty owed by an attorney to an omitted heir, and therefore, the plaintiff's claims against the defendants are subject to dismissal.

The judge's ruling is based on California's anti-SLAPP statute, which requires the court to strike causes of action arising from an act in furtherance of the defendant's right of free speech or petition unless the plaintiff establishes that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim. The judge finds that the defendants' actions were protected by the litigation privilege and that the plaintiff has not shown a probability of success on the merits.
