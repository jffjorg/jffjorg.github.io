           Defendant Linda J. Maultsby (“Defendant”) moves
to transfer this case to another county. 
Plaintiff Mural Media LLC 401k Plan (“Plaintiff”) opposes.  The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion.
 
          Civil
Procedure Code section 397, subdivision (c), provides that a court may change
the place of trial when “the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice
would be promoted by the change.”  Defendant
has not shown an entitlement to transfer under this statute.  Defendant has not filed an answer, making
this motion premature.  Defendant has not
suggested another venue that would be appropriate, but states that even the
additional counties she names (Sonoma and Orange) may not be convenient.  Defendant has not shown that the testimony of
witnesses identified in other counties is relevant or admissible.
 
The notion that Los Angeles is an inconvenient forum, or
that some other forum is more convenient, does not seem credible on this record.
The subject property is here, Defendant is here, other witnesses are apparently
here, and there is no reason that the out-of-county witnesses cannot testify by
deposition or remotely if necessary.
 
Accordingly the Court denies the motion.
