Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has reviewed the case and made a tentative ruling. The City of Los Angeles has sought leave to file a cross-complaint against the Homeowners (Leon Faynsod, Diana Shian-Ling Wang Chao, Leo Pustilnikov, and Katherine Pustilnikov) for equitable indemnity, apportionment, and declaratory relief. The Homeowners have filed an application for determination of good faith settlement, which the City contests.

The judge grants the City's motion contesting the Homeowners' application for determination of good faith settlement and denies the Homeowners' application. The judge also grants the City's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint.

The judge's decision is based on several factors, including the rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of the non-settling defendants.

The judge concludes that the settlement is not in good faith because it is disproportionate to the estimated damages and because the City was not invited to the settlement discussions between the Homeowners. The judge also finds that the settlement may have been designed to leave the City with the remaining liability and protect the Homeowners from any claims for contribution by the City.
