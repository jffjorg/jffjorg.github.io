Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to MMG's motion for interpleader, which seeks to deposit the funds held in trust for Harbor and discharge MMG's liability. The Court continues this motion and orders Jupiter and Lai to show cause why this action should not be stayed pending the resolution of Case No. 23STCV08242 or, alternatively, why a notice of related case should not be filed in Case No. 23STCV08242.

The motion is based on the fact that multiple parties claim conflicting interests in the funds held by MMG, and MMG is a mere stakeholder with no interest in any portion of the funds. The Court finds that MMG has made a diligent effort to locate and serve Harbor, but ultimately, it is Jupiter's responsibility to effectuate service of process on Harbor for any judgment in this case to be valid.

The Court also raises concerns that Jupiter may obtain a double recovery, as it has filed a separate action against Lai and other defendants seeking repayment for the funds used in settlement of the Harbor Action.
