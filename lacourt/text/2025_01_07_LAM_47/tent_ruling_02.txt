Legal Standard
 
The function of a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an
opposing party can show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and, if
not, to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment
if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from
the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” 
(Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.)  “The function of the pleadings in
a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the
function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any
triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge
v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-82.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (Code Civ Proc. § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes,
Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) The lack of opposition by a plaintiff is
not grounds to grant a motion for summary judgment if a defendant cannot meet
their initial burden of proof. (See Thatcher v. Lucy Stores, Inc. (2000)
79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1087.)
 
            Once the
defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that
a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action
or a defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party
opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendants
request that the Court take judicial notice of the court files in a series of
bankruptcy proceedings, all entitled In Re Mary A. Luzuriaga, Debtor
filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, with
Case Nos. (1) 2:16-bk-20351-RK; (2) 2:17-bk-17592-SK; (3) 2:17-bk-20067-SK; (4)
2:17-bk-20067-SK; (5) 2:22-bk-10291-SK; (6) 2:22-bk-16457-SK; and (7)
2:23-bk-10924-SK. Defendants’ requests are GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code
section 452(d) (court records). 
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Plaintiff
requests that the Court take judicial notice of certain materials. However, as
the documents identified by Plaintiff are not relevant to the Court’s ruling,
Plaintiff’s request is DENIED. (Gbur v. Cohen
(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 296, 301 (“[J]udicial notice . . . is always confined to
those matters which are relevant to the issue at hand.”].) 
 
Defendants’ Evidentiary Objections
 
            Defendants
object to portions of Plaintiff’s evidence submitted in opposition to this
motion. However, as the Court does not rely on Plaintiff’s evidence because
Defendants have not carried their initial burden of production on this motion,
the Court declines to rule on Plaintiff’s objections. (Code Civ. Proc. §
437c(q).) 
 
Analysis
 
            Defendants
move for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s claim for professional negligence on
the grounds that Plaintiff cannot establish that any negligent conduct by
Defendants was the cause of Plaintiff’s injury.
 
In
an action for professional negligence arising from legal malpractice, a
plaintiff  must establish: “(1) breach of
the attorney's duty to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members
of the profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a proximate causal
connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (3)
actual loss or damage resulting from the negligence.” (Namikas v. Miller (2014)
225 Cal.App.4th 1574, 1581.) Causation in a professional malpractice context means establishing
by a preponderance of the evidence that, but for the negligence, "the
plaintiff would have obtained a more favorable judgment or settlement in the
action in which the malpractice allegedly occurred. The purpose of this
requirement, which has been in use for more than 120 years, is to safeguard
against speculative and conjectural claims." (O’Shea v. Lindenberg
(2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 228, 236.) 
 
The factual
history in this action is largely undisputed. Plaintiff took title to the
property located at 725 S. Valinda Avenue, West Covina, CA on July 25, 2001, as
a joint tenant with her father, Juan Vergara. (Separate Statement of Undisputed
Material Fact No. 4; Response to Separate Statement No. 4.) Mr. Vergara
transferred his interest to Plaintiff on December 19, 2003. (Id.
No. 5.) On June 20, 2005, Plaintiff executed a Deed of Trust, as borrower,
against the property in the amount of $343,000. (Id. No. 6.) A Notice of
Default and Election to Sell under Deed of Trust was recorded against the
property on September 15, 2011. (Id. No.  7.) At that time, Plaintiff was in default
totaling $8,232.06. (Id. No.  8.)
The Deed of Trust was assigned to Nationstar Mortgage, LLC on September 21,
2012. (Id.
No.  9) On June 18, 2014, Plaintiff
entered into a modification agreement with Nationstar which increased the
principal mortgage balance to $417,908.92. (Id. No. 10.) 
 
Beginning
in August 2016, Plaintiff filed a series of bankruptcy petitions to protect
against foreclosure on her home. The first petition was a Chapter 7 petition
filed August 3, 2016 and discharged November 18 of that year. (Separate
Statement Nos. 11-12; Response to Separate Statement Nos. 11-12.) Plaintiff
filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on June 22, 2017, which was dismissed on
July 10 for failure to file schedules, statements, or plans. (Id. Nos.
13-14.) Plaintiff then filed a second Chapter 13 petition on August 16, 2017,
which was dismissed on September 10 for the same reasons. (Id. Nos.
15-16.) Plaintiff filed a third Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on April 10,
2019, which was dismissed on March 11, 2020. (Id. Nos. 18-19.) By June
28, 2021, Plaintiff owed $139,866.91 in arrearages on her mortgage. (Id.
No. 24.) A Notice of Default was recorded on July 1, 2021, with a foreclosure
sale set first for November 30, 2021, then for February 22, 2022, and finally
for April 26, 2022. (Id. Nos. 24-26.) 
 
Plaintiff
filed a fourth Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on January 19, 2022, and
subsequently retained Defendants to represent her in that proceeding beginning
on February 2, 2022. (Separate Statement Nos. 27-28; Response to Separate
Statement Nos. 27-28.) The petition was dismissed on October 18, 2022, due to
the infeasibility of the Chapter 13 Plan. (Id. No. 29.) On October 19,
2022, Plaintiff received a new Notice of Foreclosure Sale scheduling the sale
of the property for November 29, 2022. (Id. No. 30.) Plaintiff retained
Defendants in connection with a fifth Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, which was
filed on November 25, 2022. (Id. Nos. 31-32.) As a result, the
foreclosure sale was cancelled. (Id. No. 33.) The fifth petition was
dismissed on December 13, 2022, at the election of Plaintiff because she was
not earning regular income, there was no longer a pending sale date, and
Plaintiff intended to enter into a loan modification agreement. (Id.
Nos. 35-36.) On January 18, 2023, a new Notice of Trustee’s Sale was recorded
setting the foreclosure sale date for February 22, 2023. (Id. No. 37.)
As of January 12, 2023, Plaintiff owed $552,029.63 in arrears on the mortgage.
(Id. No. 38.) Defendants, at Plaintiff’s direction, filed a sixth
Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on February 21, 2023. (Id. Nos. 39-40.)
Defendants also provided the foreclosing company with notice of the filing of
the petition that same date. (Id. No. 41.) Nevertheless, the foreclosure
sale proceeded on February 22, 2023. (Id. No. 42.) This action followed
on June 6, 2023, alleging that Defendants were negligent in the performance of
their legal services “by, among other things, failing to request a stay of a
real estate lender’s foreclosure sale.” (Complaint p.4 ¶ GN-1.)  
 
Defendants assert that Plaintiff cannot establish that,
but for Defendants’ negligence, she would not have suffered a foreclosure on her
home. At the outset, Defendants offer no expert testimony supporting their
assertion that the foreclosure could not have been halted, either through a
motion to stay, as suggested in the Complaint, or by any other means. “Where the
complexity of the causation issue is beyond common experience, expert testimony
is required to establish causation." (Hernandez v. County of Los
Angeles (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1614.) Indeed, “[t]he general
rule is that expert evidence is required to establish legal malpractice.” (O'Shea
v. Lindenberg (2021) 64 Cal. App. 5th 228, 236 [Citation omitted].)  Defendants entirely neglect this authority
and fail to address even the threshold question of whether causation in this
matter requires expert testimony. Even if expert testimony were not required,
Defendants merely assert that Plaintiff cannot prove the elements of her case
beyond “rank speculation and conjecture.” Defendants must offer evidence,
and not merely point out through argument, that Plaintiff does not possess and cannot
reasonably obtain needed evidence to establish an element of her cause of
action. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 854.) Likewise,
the assertion that the “true cause” of the foreclosure was Plaintiff’s failure
to pay her mortgage arrears is not evidence that Defendants played no part in
that outcome. Defendants’ unsupported conclusion that Plaintiff could not have
availed herself of the discretionary stay provision in section 362(c)(4)(B) of
the Bankruptcy Code are similarly insufficient in the context of a motion for
summary judgment. (See 11 U.S. Code § 362(c)(4)(B).) 
 
            Finally,
Defendants assert that the nature of the allegations in this action are
“tantamount to a claim of warranty” which cannot lie against a lawyer rendering
professional services. Defendants cite no authority in support of this
proposition beyond a vague gesture to CACI 602, which merely stands for the
general rule that unsuccessful efforts are not per se professional
negligence. Defendants’ bare assertion that this action is “tantamount to a
claim of warranty” does not establish that contention. 
 
            In summary,
Defendants have failed to offer expert testimony in support of their position
or to establish that such testimony has not required and offer only bare
assertions and unsupported arguments claiming that Plaintiff cannot prevail on
this action. This showing is not sufficient to carry Defendants’ burden to
demonstrate Plaintiff’s inability to prevail on her claim, and, consequently,
the burden does not shift to Plaintiff to demonstrate a triable issue of fact. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
