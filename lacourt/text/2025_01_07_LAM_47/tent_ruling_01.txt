Legal Standard
 
The function of a motion for
summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an
opposing party can show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and, if
not, to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment
if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from
the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” 
(Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.)  “The function of the pleadings in
a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the
function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any
triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge
v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-82.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, a plaintiff moving for summary judgment satisfies the initial burden
to show that there is no defense to a claim by proving each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment. (Code Civ Proc. § 437c(p)(1).)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) The
lack of opposition is not grounds to grant a motion for summary judgment if a
movant cannot meet their initial burden of proof. (See Thatcher v. Lucy
Stores, Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1087.)
 
            Once the
moving party has met their burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party to
show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause
of action or a defense thereto. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(1)-(2).) To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
Plaintiffs’ Requests for Judicial Notice
 
            Plaintiffs
request that the Court take judicial notice of (1) a February 22, 2022
Statement of Information filed with the California Secretary of State for 360
Capital Ventures, Inc.; (2) a February 22, 2022 Statement of Information filed
with the California Secretary of State for 3509 Laurelvale LLC; (3) a February
22, 2022 Statement of Information filed with the California Secretary of State
for Walnut & Brass; (4) a February 22, 2022 Statement of Information filed
with the California Secretary of State for 6461 Bryn Mawr LLC; (5) a February
22, 2022 Statement of Information filed with the California Secretary of State
for Pink Tree Studios 3 LLC; and (6) a February 22, 2022 Statement of
Information filed with the California Secretary of State for Pink Tree Studios
GS LLC. These requests are GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(c)
(official acts).
 
            Plaintiffs
also request that the Court take judicial notice of (7) a November 2, 2022
Certification of Records from the Contractors’ State License Board certifying
no records found listing Sachin Patel d/b/a 360 Capital Ventures Inc. as a
licensed California contractor between December 1, 2018 and the date of issue;
(8) a November 14, 2022 Certification of Records from the Contractors’ State
License Board certifying no records found listing 360 Capital Ventures Inc. as
a licensed California contractor between December 1, 2018 and the date of
issue; (9) this Court’s March 29, 2024 Minute Order; (10) the California
Department of Real Estate license information for Defendant Patel; and (11) the
California Secretary of State history detail for 360 Capital Ventures Inc.
Plaintiffs’ requests Nos. 7, 8, 10, and 11 are GRANTED pursuant to Evidence
Code section 452(c) (official acts). Plaintiffs’ request No. 9 is GRANTED
pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d) (court records).
 
Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Requests for Judicial Notice
 
            Plaintiffs
submit additional requests for judicial notice in connection with their reply
in support of this motion. These requests are not relevant to the Court’s
ruling and are therefore DENIED. (Gbur v. Cohen
(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 296, 301 (“[J]udicial notice . . . is always confined to
those matters which are relevant to the issue at hand.”].) 
 
Plaintiffs’ Evidentiary Objections
 
            Plaintiffs
object to portions of the evidence presented by Defendant in opposition to this
motion. As the evidence to which Plaintiffs object is not material to this
ruling, the Court declines to rule on these objections. (Code Civ. Proc. §
437c(q).) 
 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiffs
move for summary adjudication against Defendant Patel on the first cause of
action for restitution on an alter ego theory. The Court granted Plaintiffs’
Motion for Summary Adjudication on the first cause of action as against
Defendant 360 Capital Ventures Inc. on March 29, 2024, finding that the
undisputed facts established that the corporate Defendant had performed
contractor work without a license, thereby entitling Plaintiffs to
disgorgement. (See RJN Exh. 9; March 29, 2024 Minute Order.) The first cause of
action alleges that Defendant Patel is also liable for disgorgement of the
funds under an alter ego theory. (FAC ¶ 20.)
 
            To hold an
owner of a corporation personally liable for the acts of the corporation as an
alter ego of the owner, “[f]irst, there must be such a unity of interest and
ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that the separate
personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality exist.
Second, there must be an inequitable result if the acts in question are treated
as those of the corporation alone.” (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court
(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 539.) “Among the factors to be considered in
applying the doctrine are commingling of funds and other assets of the two
entities, the holding out by one entity that it is liable for the debts of the
other, identical equitable ownership in the two entities, use of the same
offices and employees, and use of one as a mere shell or conduit for the
affairs of the other. [citations] Other relevant factors . . . include
inadequate capitalization, disregard of corporate formalities, lack of
segregation of corporate records, and identical directors and officers.” (Id.
at 538-39.)
 
            Plaintiffs
offer evidence tending to support a finding that there is a unity of interest
and ownership between 360 Capital Ventures and Defendant Patel. For example,
Plaintiffs offer evidence that Defendant Patel was the exclusive point of
contact with 360 Capital (Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Fact No.
20), that Defendant Patel was the sole officer and director listed on 360
Capital’s February 22, 2022 Statement of Information (SSUMF No. 31), that
Defendant Patel was the only officer to sign grant deeds on 360 Capital’s
behalf (Nos. 57, 58, 60), and that 360 Capital frequently listed Defendant
Patel’s home address as its business address on bank statements and tax forms.
(SSUMF Nos. 33, 34, 41-45.) Defendant Patel has listed his same home address as
the business address for various other entities which he controls. (Nos.
36-40.) Plaintiffs also contend that 360 Capital lacked sufficient capital
between 2022 and 2024, with bank statements routinely showing low balances or
outright deficits (SSUMF Nos. 49, 54, 55) and tax records reporting losses for
the years of 2021 and 2022. (SSUMF Nos. 46-47.) The Court notes, however, that
this evidence, construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party,
as required on summary adjudication, does not conclusively establish 360
Capital’s undercapitalization, as it does not preclude the existence of other
capital or assets to cover 360 Capital’s liabilities. Finally, Plaintiffs offer
records showing numerous withdrawals and deposits between Defendant Patel, 360
Capital, and other Patel-controlled business entities. (SSUMF Nos. 50-53) and
property transfers between Patel and 360 Capital for which Defendant Patel
claimed tax exemptions on the grounds that the transferor and transferee were
comprised of the same parties. (SSUMF Nos. 57-61.) 
 
            All that
said, Plaintiffs fall short in their contention that, assuming a unity of
interest exists, an inequitable result would follow absent piercing of the
corporate veil. As Plaintiffs state, the alter ego doctrine applies when
“conduct amounting to bad faith makes it inequitable for the corporate owner to
hide behind the corporate form.” (Sonora Diamond Corp.et al. v. Superior.
Ct. (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 539. Piercing the corporate veil is
“justified as an equitable remedy when the shareholders have abused the
corporate form to evade individual liability, circumvent a statute, or
accomplish a wrongful purpose.” (Hub City Solid Waste Services, Inc. v. City
of Compton (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1124.) Although Plaintiffs contend
that 360 Capital is undercapitalized by relying on bank and tax records, those
materials do not, construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving
party, tend to prove that contention in the conclusive manner required on
summary adjudication. Plaintiffs’ assertion that 360 Capital Ventures would have
no money to cover a judgment against it is not sufficient. 
 
            Plaintiffs
also argue that Defendant Patel employed 360 Capital to “circumvent” the
license statute. Plaintiffs offer no evidence of Defendant Patel’s intent to
conceal from Plaintiffs that 360 Capital was not licensed. Nor do Plaintiffs
offer evidence of intent to deceive in support of their related contention that
360 Capital never obtained liability insurance, despite representations to the
contrary. (See SSUMF Nos. 11, 23.) While the Court held that 360 Capital was
improperly identified as the contractor on the construction agreement and that
it used a license number belonging to a third-party contractor, nothing in the
record before the Court establishes that 360 Capital was formed with the intent
to escape California licensing statutes. Indeed, 360 Capital argued in
opposition to the motion for summary adjudication against 360 Capital and again
in opposing this motion that the true contractor’s name, RE3 Restoration, was
inadvertently omitted from the contract and that Plaintiffs worked directly
with RE3 Restoration on the construction project.  (See RJN Exh. 9, p. 9.) Even if Plaintiff had
shepherded sufficient evidence of duplicitous intent, therefore, there would be
a triable issue of fact as to that issue.
 
            In bringing
their alter ego contentions in the context of a motion for summary
adjudication, Plaintiffs’ arguments are necessarily evaluated using the burden-shifting
standards and liberal construction of the evidence in favor of the non-moving
party that is required for a motion of this nature. (Dore v. Arnold
Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) Plaintiffs’ showing is not
sufficient to meet those standards and demonstrate, for the purpose of this
motion, that there is no defense to their alter ego theory such that the burden
shifts to Defendant to demonstrate a triable issue of fact. In so ruling, the
Court does not categorically reject Plaintiffs’ alter ego theory: the Court
merely finds that there has been a failure of proof under the strict standards
for summary adjudication. This ruling therefore is without prejudice to a
subsequent assertion of alter ego liability through another appropriate
procedure in this action.
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Adjudication is DENIED.
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
