And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion to compel filed by the defendant, which argues that the plaintiff failed to serve responses to discovery requests (RPDs) and failed to serve any responsive documents. The defendant set the hearing for August 8, 2024, but continued it multiple times, ultimately to January 7, 2025. The plaintiff filed an untimely opposition to the motion on December 26, 2024, arguing that the motion is substantively moot because responsive documents were served on June 21, 2023, and November 15, 2023, and verified responses to discovery were served on April 3, 2024. The plaintiff also claims that the reason for the tardy formal response was that all documents had been produced and the parties were discussing informal methods of resolution. The judge is inclined to find that the plaintiff showed good cause and substantial justification for the failure to timely respond to the RPDs and is denying the request for sanctions. The motion is substantively moot, and the defendant is ordered to give notice.
