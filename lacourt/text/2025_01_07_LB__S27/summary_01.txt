And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to bifurcate the case. The defendants, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, Memorial Health Services, Dr. Praveen R. Jonnala, and Dr. Ali Khoynezhad, are seeking to have the medical negligence cause of action tried separately from the corporate negligence cause of action. They argue that they will be prejudiced if the case is not bifurcated because the plaintiff's evidence will be irrelevant to the medical negligence cause of action. The plaintiff, Claudia and Josue Morales, opposes the motion, arguing that the defendants have not met their burden to show they are likely to prevail on the medical negligence claim. The judge has denied the motion, citing the inefficiency of having the causes of action tried separately and the potential for prejudice to be managed through motions in limine and jury instructions. The judge has ordered the defendants to give notice and has indicated that parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court.
