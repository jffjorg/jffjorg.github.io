 Case Number:  23LBCV01383    Hearing Date:   January 7, 2025    Dept:  S27 On 8/22/24, Plaintiffs filed a
Notice of Settlement.  On 10/23/24, the
Court held an OSC re: dismissal (settlement). 
Because three of the plaintiffs are minors, the Court specially set a
hearing on petitions to approve their settlements for 12/05/24, and also
continued the OSC to 12/05/24.  
 
Petitioner filed papers in support
of the petition on 12/03/24.  Because the
papers were not filed with sufficient time for review, the Court continued the
hearing to 1/07/24.  Petitioner gave
notice of the continuance of the hearing. 

 
Plaintiffs and Defendant have
agreed to settle the action for the total sum of $100,000.  If the settlement is approved, the adult
plaintiff will receive $85,000, and each of the three minor plaintiffs will
receive $5000.  Notably, this is a
habitability case, and none of the minor children suffered physical damages as
a result of the claims.  The Court finds
the apportionment is appropriate, as the bulk of the claimed damages consists
of back rent and relocation expenses.  
 
If the settlement is approved, each
of the minors will pay $1250 in attorneys’ fees.  The remaining $3750 will be given to
Petitioner, without bond, to use for the benefit of the children.  
The Court is concerned about
Petitioner’s declarations in support of the petitions.  Petitioner declares that the total value of
the minor children’s settlements does not exceed $5000.  Probate Code §3401(c), however, makes clear
that the proceeds of the settlement can only be paid directly to a parent if
the entire value of the child’s ESTATE, including the settlement payment, does
not exceed $5000.  This would include any
bank accounts or other assets held by the children.  The Court will hear from Petitioner on this
issue at the time of the hearing.  If the
Court is satisfied, the proposed orders will be signed.  If the Court is not satisfied, the monies
will need to be placed in a blocked account, and the Court will order
Petitioner to provide proposed orders to place the monies in blocked accounts.
 
Pursuant to CRC 7.952, Petitioner
and the minor plaintiffs must appear at the hearing unless the Court finds good
cause to excuse their appearance.  The
minor children are two (RH L), four (RO L), and sixteen (LV) years old.  The Court excuses RH L and RO L from
appearing, but will require LV to appear and testify before it grants the
petitions.
