```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the defendant's motion to vacate the judgment entered against her, which was filed after the summary judgment was granted. The defendant contends that new or different facts exist, specifically that Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. is now claiming to be the lender on the loan secured by the subject deed of trust. The defendant also cites Homeward Opportunities Fund I Trust 2019-2 v. Taptelis (2023) H049791 as new law that requires the prior motion to be granted.

However, the court has denied the motion, ruling that it is not procedurally proper after summary judgment is entered. The court has previously ruled that a motion to vacate is not procedurally proper after summary judgment is entered, and this ruling applies equally to a renewed motion to vacate. The defendant is ordered to give notice.
