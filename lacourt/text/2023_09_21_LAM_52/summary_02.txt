Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, KHRG La Peer LLC, Karina Celis, and Felipe Cucalon, move to compel arbitration and stay the action against plaintiff Cynthia Sandoval. The court finds that the defendants have presented sufficient evidence that plaintiff electronically signed an arbitration agreement on November 14, 2022, and that the defendants have met their burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff manifested her consent to the electronic arbitration agreement.

The court also finds that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable and that the provisions waiving plaintiff's right to bring representative claims under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) and requiring plaintiff to pay arbitration fees are severable. The court hereby severs these provisions and requires defendant KHRG La Peer LLC to pay all of plaintiff's costs that are unique to arbitration.

The court grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action, and orders plaintiff Cynthia Sandoval to arbitrate this action against defendants. The court hereby stays the entire action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding.
