The defendants, KHRG La Peer LLC, Karina Celis, and Felipe Cucalon, move to compel arbitration and stay the action against plaintiff Cynthia Sandoval. The court finds that the defendants have presented sufficient evidence that plaintiff electronically signed an arbitration agreement on November 14, 2022, and that the defendants have met their burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff manifested her consent to the electronic arbitration agreement.

The court also finds that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable and that the provisions waiving plaintiff's right to bring representative claims under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) and requiring plaintiff to pay arbitration fees are severable. The court hereby severs these provisions and requires defendant KHRG La Peer LLC to pay all of plaintiff's costs that are unique to arbitration.

The court grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action, and orders plaintiff Cynthia Sandoval to arbitrate this action against defendants. The court hereby stays the entire action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding.

## Tentative Ruling Summary

**Case Number:** 23STCV14467
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Dept:** 52

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Cynthia Sandoval
* **Defendants:** KHRG La Peer LLC, Karina Celis, and Felipe Cucalon

**Summary:**

The court grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. 

**Key Points:**

* **Arbitration Agreement:** The court finds sufficient evidence that plaintiff electronically signed an arbitration agreement on November 14, 2022. The court rejects the plaintiff's claims that defendant Karina Celis forced her to sign the agreement without her consent.
* **Unconscionability:**  
    * The court finds moderate procedural unconscionability due to the "take it or leave it" nature of the agreement and the limited opportunity for review. 
    * However, the court finds no substantive unconscionability because the provision waiving the right to bring representative PAGA claims is prohibited by law, and the provision requiring plaintiff to pay arbitration costs is also unenforceable under California law.
* **Severability:** The court severs the unconscionable provisions (PAGA waiver and attorney's fee provision) and enforces the remaining arbitration agreement.
* **Costs:**  Defendant KHRG La Peer LLC is ordered to pay all costs unique to arbitration.

**Disposition:**

The action is stayed pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding.

Summary:
This tentative ruling is regarding the motion to compel arbitration and stay the action brought by defendants KHRG La Peer LLC, Karina Celis, and Felipe Cucalon against plaintiff Cynthia Sandoval. The plaintiff disputes whether the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies. The court declines to reach the issue because the result would be the same under either the FAA or the California Arbitration Act. The plaintiff electronically signed the agreement on November 14, 2022, and defendants presented sufficient evidence of security precautions regarding the transmission and use of an applicant's unique username and password. The court finds that plaintiff manifested her consent to the electronic arbitration agreement. Plaintiff argues the agreement is unconscionable and therefore unenforceable, but the court finds no substantive unconscionability. The court will sever the PAGA waiver and the fee provision and require defendant KHRG La Peer LLC to pay plaintiff's arbitration fees. Plaintiff Cynthia Sandoval is ordered to arbitrate this action against defendants, and the court stays the entire action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding.
