And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice due to the failure to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d). The court finds that the motion complies with the Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16(b)(4), as the client has ceased nearly all communication with counsel, rendering it impossible for counsel to act on the client's behalf. However, the court notes that the forms were not served on all parties that have appeared in the case, including Defendants Ian F. Mitchell, Four Over Three, Inc., and Napoleon Canizales.
