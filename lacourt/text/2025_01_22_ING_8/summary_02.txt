And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Citibank, N.A. v. Chris Kastingar. The plaintiff, Citibank, has moved to deem requests for admission as admitted and has also requested monetary sanctions. The defendant, Chris Kastingar, has not responded to the requests for admission and has not filed an opposition to the motion. The court has granted the motion to deem the requests for admission as admitted, as the defendant has failed to respond. However, the court has denied the request for monetary sanctions, as the granting of the motion is devastating to the defendant's potential defenses in the case.
