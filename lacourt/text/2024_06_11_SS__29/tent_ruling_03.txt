 Case Number:  21STCV36936    Hearing Date:   June 11, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Terminating Sanctions and other relief filed by Defendant Los Angeles  County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. TentativeThe motion is granted in part and denied in part. Background On October 6, 2021, Denise Chow (“Plaintiff”) filed a  complaint against Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority  (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10, asserting causes of action for motor  vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out of a motor vehicle  accident occurring on April 19, 2021.  Defendant filed its answer on April 28, 2023. In October and November 2023, the Court issued a series of discovery  orders. On October 11, 2023, the Court denied Defendant’s motion for a  deemed-admitted order regarding Requests for Admission but issued monetary  sanctions against Plaintiff and counsel in the amount of $460. On November 21, 2023, the Court ordered Plaintiff to serve verified  initial responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) within 30 days of notice  and sanctioned Plaintiff and counsel $345. On November 22, 2023, the Court ordered Plaintiff to serve verified  initial written responses to Requests for Production (Set One) within 30 days  of notice and sanctioned Plaintiff and counsel $345. On November 27, 2023, the Court ordered Plaintiff to serve verified  initial responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) within 30 days of notice  and sanctioned Plaintiff and counsel $345. Plaintiff has not complied with the Court’s orders to provide  discovery responses.  (Paulick Decl., ¶  11.)  Plaintiff has not paid the monetary  sanctions.  (Id., ¶ 12.) On April 25, 2024, Defendant filed this a motion seeking: (1) an  order to compel Plaintiff to comply with the Court’s prior orders; (2) an order  for additional monetary sanctions; and (3) an order for terminating sanctions. No opposition has been filed. Legal Standard When a party “fails  to obey an order compelling further response to interrogatories, the court may  make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction,  an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 ….  In lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction,  the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 ….”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (e).) When a party “fails  to obey an order compelling further response [to a request for production], the  court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue  sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 ….  In lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction,  the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 ….”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (i).) In Chapter 7 of the  Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides that, “[t]o the  extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or  any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected  party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose … sanctions  against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process,”  including monetary sanctions, an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, and a  terminating sanction.  (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 2023.030, subds. (a)-(d).)  A “misuse of the discovery  process” includes (among other things) failing to respond or to submit to an  authorized method of discovery; making, without substantial justification, an  unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive response to a discovery  request; disobeying a court order to provide discovery; and making or opposing,  unsuccessfully, a motion to compel without substantial justification. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d)-(h).) The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and  “incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions  and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower  Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th  566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate  with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to  protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes  v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser  sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing  misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until  the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,  e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th  262, 279-280.)  Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174  Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)  75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the  authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating  sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less  severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly  shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th  at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,  preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe  sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial  court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174  Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders  that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21  v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los  Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles  v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.  Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan  v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.) The  primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil  Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.  Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super  Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery  sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a  better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply  complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery  Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,  1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure  Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.) A  “terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery  sanction is never justified.”  (Newland,  supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) An order for monetary sanctions is enforceable as a money judgment under  the Enforcement of Judgments Law, Code of Civil Procedure sections 680.010, et  seq.  (Ibid.) Discussion Plaintiff  has violated her obligations under the Civil Discovery Act.  Plaintiff has failed to comply with three  court orders to provide discovery responses and to pay sanctions.  This is serious misuse of the discovery process  that is prejudicial to Defendant and that merits serious sanctions.   Defendant  asks for three forms of relief.   First,  Defendant asks for a court order requiring Plaintiff to comply with the prior  orders.  That request is DENIED.  The Court has already made its orders, and  Plaintiff is under a legal obligation to comply with them.  An additional order requiring Plaintiff to  comply with the prior orders – which she already must – would not change  anything.   Second, Defendant asks for additional  monetary sanctions.  That request is  GRANTED.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (e) & 2031.310,  subd. (i).)  Defendant has incurred legal  fees as a result of Plaintiff’s misuse of the discovery process.  Plaintiff’s conduct is not substantially  justified, and it would not be unjust to award sanctions.  The Court sets additional sanctions in the amount  of $460, as requested, calculated based on two hours of attorney time  multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $230 per hour.  (Paulick Decl., ¶¶ 14-15.) Third,  Defendant requests terminating sanctions.   That request is DENIED.   For terminating sanctions, a party must  present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process, as  well as evidence that less severe sanctions have  not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Defendant has not, on this record at this  time, made such a showing.   Moreover, a discovery sanction should not  create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it  would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations  under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238  Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this  time, a terminating sanction would create such a windfall for Defendant,  particularly as Defendant has not sought, and does not now seek, any lesser  non-monetary sanction. The  denial as to terminating sanctions is without prejudice to Defendant seeking  other sanctions (monetary or nonmonetary) at a later stage of the proceedings,  based on a further showing of misuse of the discovery process. Conclusion The Court DENIES Defendant’s request for an  order compelling compliance with the Court’s earlier orders. The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for  monetary sanctions. The Court ORDERS Plaintiff and counsel of  record Sardarbegian Law Offices, jointly and severally, to pay $460 in monetary  sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to Defendant within 30 days of notice. Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions  is DENIED.  Moving  Party is ordered to give notice.
