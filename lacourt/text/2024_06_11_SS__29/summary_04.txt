And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies the motion to continue the trial date from June 11, 2024, to July 10, 2024. The Defendants' arguments for a continuance, including the need for further discovery and the unavailability of expert witnesses, are not sufficient to establish good cause. The court finds that the Defendants have had ample time to complete their discovery and that the requested continuance is not justified. The court also notes that the Defendants' claims of scheduling conflicts with their trial counsel and experts are speculative and not sufficient to warrant a continuance.
