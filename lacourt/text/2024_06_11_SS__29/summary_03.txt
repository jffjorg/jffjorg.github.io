  - "A discovery sanction should not create a 'windfall' for a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court's orders and the Civil Discovery Act."
  - "A terminating sanction should be used sparingly."
```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for terminating sanctions filed by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The Court has concluded that the plaintiff, Denise Chow, has failed to comply with court orders and pay monetary sanctions. The Court has granted the defendant's request for additional monetary sanctions in the amount of $460. The Court has also denied the defendant's request for terminating sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's misconduct does not warrant such a severe sanction at this time.
