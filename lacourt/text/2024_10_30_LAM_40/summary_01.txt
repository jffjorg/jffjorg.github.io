And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Pamela Cook vs. University of Southern California, Fatima Manuao, Lorena (Last Name Unknown), and Does 1 to 100. The case involves claims of racial discrimination, harassment, and retaliation by Cook, who was employed by the University of Southern California.

The judge granted Cook's motion to compel discovery responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Production of Documents, Set One. The judge ordered the defendants to serve fully compliant responses without objections within 20 days.

The judge also granted Cook's request for sanctions against the defendants in the amount of $2,310.00 for the motion to compel discovery responses to Form Interrogatories and $1,410.00 for the motion to compel discovery responses to Request for Production.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the defendants failed to serve responses to the discovery requests, despite being given multiple opportunities to do so. The judge found that the defendants' failure to comply with the discovery requests was not substantial justification and therefore imposed sanctions on them.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any objections or further argument presented at the hearing.
