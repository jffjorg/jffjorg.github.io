I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Pamela Cook sues
Defendants University of Southern California (USC), Fatima Manuao (Manuao),
Lorena (Last Name Unknown; hereafter, Lorena) (collectively, Defendants), and
Does 1 to 100 pursuant to a July 1, 2022 Complaint alleging claims of (1) FEHA
Race/Color/National Origin/Ancestry Discrimination, (2) FEHA Disability
Discrimination, (3) Failure to Accommodate or Engage in a Good Faith
Interactive Process, (4) FEHA Retaliation, (5) FEHA Hostile Work Environment
[Harassment], (6) FEHA Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, and
Retaliation, (6) Interference/Retaliation and Violation of Paid Sick Leave, (8)
Failure to Pay Wages, (9) Failure to Reimburse Employee for Necessary
Expenditures, (10) Failure to Prove Correct Itemized Wage Statements, (11)
Failure to Provide Final Pay and Penalty, (12) Interference with/Violations of
Kin Care, (13) Interference with/Violations of Paid Sick Leave, (14) Wrongful
Termination, (15) Negligent Hiring and Retention, (16) IIED, (17) Labor Code
Whistleblower Retaliation, and (18) Violation of Business and Professions Code
§ 17200, et seq. 
The claims arise from allegations
that in her employment with USC, among other things, Plaintiff—an African
American individual suffering from high blood pressure, headaches/migraines,
stress, right foot injury, and COVID-19/potential COVID-19—was subject to
disparate treatment based on race—e.g., racial slurs about “you people” against
her—prompting Plaintiff to file hostile work environment complaints with USC,
which were not acted upon, and that Plaintiff was not accommodated as to a
variety of health related time-off requests on the grounds that her requests
were wrong or unprofessional, all culminating in her constructive discharge on
August 24, 2021
 
B. Motion Before the Court
On September 29, 2022, Cook
propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One (FROGs) and Request for Production of
Documents, Set One (RFPs) on Defendant USC. (Both Motions, Ex. 1.) According to
the proofs of service, the discovery was served on USC via email and mail on September
29, 2022.) (Both Motions, Ex. 1, Proof of Service.) 
On September 10, 2024, Cook filed the
instant motions: (1) Motion to Compel
Responses to FROGs, Set One and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel
Responses to RFP, Set One and Request for Sanctions.  
On October 18, 2024, USC filed a joint opposition to the motions.
On October 23, 2024, Cook filed separate replies to the joint opposition.

 
II. Motion
A. Legal Standard
A motion to compel an initial
response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response
to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd.
(a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a) [demand to produce]; see Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404 (Sinaiko).) 
The discovering party can make a
motion to deem as admitted any unanswered requests for admission or any
requests answered in a late or unverified response. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd. (a) [RFA responses must
be signed by responding party under oath]; see Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no
response].) These requests are not automatically deemed admitted; the discovery
party must make the motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
To establish this ground, a movant
must show: 
(1) Proper service (see Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.080, subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.040 [demand to produce],
2033.070 [admissions].); 
(2) Expiration of the deadline for
the initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (see
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subds. (a), (b) [interrogatories], 2031.260,
subds. (a), (b) [demand to produce], 2033.250, subds. (a), (b) [admissions].);
and 
(3) No timely response (see Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 [interrogatories], 2031.300 [demand to produce],
2033.280, subd. (b) [admissions]).
The Court retains jurisdiction to
rule on the merits of discovery motions even after requested discovery was
provided after the motion was filed. (Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
p. 409.) 
B. Analysis
Here, the discovery was served via
email and mail on USC on September 29, 2022. (Both Motions, Ex. 1, Proof of
Service.) The deadline to respond was 30 days after service, plus five days for
service via mail (Code Civ. Proc. § 1013 subd. (a).) Thus, responses were due
on November 3, 2022. 
In opposition, USC argues that Cook
granted USC an extension to respond to discovery through May 2023, and additionally
that this case was stayed from October 24, 2022 through the date the remittitur
was issued on August 20, 2024. (Opp. pp. 2-3.) USC asserts that its objections
are not waived because the responses came due during the stay. (Opp. pp. 3-4.)
Lastly, USC argues that sanctions are not warranted because in September 2024 USC
offered to provide discovery responses by October 24 and stipulate to continue
the motion to compel hearing until November 28. (Guy Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. B.)
In its October 23 reply, Cook
argues that Defendant still has not served responses or objections of any kind,
and that it has been 65 days since remittitur has issued and this case became
active again in the trial court. Thus, Cook argues that even if there was a
stay during the appeal (which she disputes, citing Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.4 and caselaw), USC has not served any timely responses.
As of the date of the hearing on
these motions, there is no evidence before the Court that USC has served the
requested discovery responses.  Accordingly, Cook’s motion to compel discovery responses (FROGs, Set One) is GRANTED and Cook’s motion to compel discovery responses (Production of Documents) is
GRANTED. 
 
III. Request for Sanctions 
A.   
Legal Standard
The Court must impose monetary
sanctions against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes
or opposes the motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted
with substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanctions unjust. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand to produce]; see Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra,
148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404 [interrogatories and demand to produce].)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
Even after a party provides
discovery responses, a party can keep its motion on calendar and the court has
authority to grant sanctions, even if it denies the motion to compel responses
“as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko, supra, at
p. 409.)
B.   
Analysis
Cook requests sanctions for the
motion to compel discovery responses
(FROGs, Set One) against Defendant USC and/or its counsel of record John Giovannone,
in the total amount of $2,310.00 based upon counsel’s rate of $450.00/hour for 5.0
total hours of work as follows: (1) 3.0 hours to prepare this motion, (2) 1.0
hour reviewing the opposition and preparing a reply brief, (3) 1.0 hour
preparing for and attending the hearing, and (4) $60.00 filing fee. (Both Motions,
pp. 8-9.) 
The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the total amount of $2,310.00. 
Cook also requests sanctions for
the motion to compel discovery
responses (Production of Documents) against Defendant USC and/or its counsel of
record John Giovannone, in the total amount of $2,310.00 based upon counsel’s
rate of $450.00/hour for 5.0 total hours of work as follows: (1) 3.0 hours to
prepare this motion, (2) 1.0 hour reviewing the opposition and preparing a
reply brief, (3) 1.0 hour preparing for and attending the hearing, and (4)
$60.00 filing fee. (Both Motions, pp. 8-9.)
As USC filed a single brief opposition to both motions and this hearing
is set for the same day and time as the hearing for the motion to compel
discovery responses to the Form Interrogatories, Set One (FROGs), the
request for sanctions will be reduced by 2.0 hours. 
The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $1,410.00.
IV. Conclusion
The Motion to Compel Discovery
Responses (Form Interrogatories) [RES ID # 4836] is GRANTED. Defendant USC is ordered to serve fully
compliant responses without objections within 20 days. The request for
sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $2,310.00
 
The Motion to Compel Discovery
Responses (Request for Production) [RES ID # 9755] is GRANTED. Defendant USC is ordered to serve fully
compliant responses without objections, as well as the responsive documents,
within 20 days. The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $1,410.00.
