And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the complaint and demurrer filed by Vivian Ta, the authorized representative for State Farm General Insurance Company. The Court has determined that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against Vivian Ta and State Farm.

The Court has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract, finding that there is no contract between Plaintiff and Vivian Ta. The Court has also sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action for negligence, finding that Vivian Ta did not have a duty to handle, process, and investigate Plaintiff's insurance claim. Finally, the Court has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for bad faith insurance, finding that Vivian Ta is not a party to the insurance policy and therefore cannot be liable for bad faith.

The Court has denied Plaintiff's request to amend the complaint, finding that the defects raised by the demurrer are not reasonably capable of cure. The Court has also denied Plaintiff's request for leave to amend, finding that Plaintiff has not met its burden to show that the complaint can be amended successfully.

The Court's ruling is final and binding unless a motion is filed to reconsider.
