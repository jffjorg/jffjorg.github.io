And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses two motions: one by Ford Motor Company (Defendant) for judgment on the pleadings regarding the plaintiff's Second Cause of Action for fraudulent concealment, and another by WC Performance Ford dba Performance Ford (Defendant) for judgment on the pleadings regarding the plaintiff's third cause of action for negligent repair.

The court denies the motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding the fraudulent concealment claim, finding that the plaintiff has adequately pled allegations of fraudulent concealment. The court concludes that the defendant had a duty to disclose the defect and that the plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to support his claim.

On the other hand, the court grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding the negligent repair claim, finding that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the economic loss rule. The court holds that the plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to support his claim for negligent repair and that the economic loss rule applies to bar the claim.
