DEFENDANT NISSAN NORTH AMERICA, INC.’S MOTION TO
COMPEL ARBITRATION AND STAY PROCEEDINGS is CONTINUED. 
 
Background
 
This is a lemon law case. 
 
On June 30, 2022, Plaintiffs BRIANNA GARCIA and ENRIQUE
GARCIA filed suit.
 
On February 9, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion.
 
On July 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed its opposition.
 
On July 12, 2023, Defendant filed its Reply. 
 
On July 19, 2023, the court adopted its tentative and
continued the hearing. (There was no appearance by Plaintiffs’ Counsel.) 
 
Discussion
 
Similar
to the prior tentative, considering Plaintiffs’ heavy reliance upon the Ford
Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 (“Ochoa”) which is on
appeal, the court again continues the hearing. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based
on the foregoing, the motion to compel arbitration is continued.
