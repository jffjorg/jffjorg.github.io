And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial date for six months, from July 8, 2024 to January 8, 2025. The plaintiff argued that he needs more time to complete discovery and prepare for trial due to Defendants' bad faith refusal to cooperate in discovery. The court noted that the current trial date is less than two months away and that the case has been continued four times since it was first set. The court also cautioned the parties to cooperate in discovery and to have the case ready for trial on the new date.
