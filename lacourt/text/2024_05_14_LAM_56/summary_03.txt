And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply in this case. The Court has previously granted leave to Plaintiffs to amend their complaint and has sustained the demurrer to the original complaint. However, Plaintiffs have failed to file a valid amended complaint in a procedurally proper manner. Therefore, the Court grants the Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint and grants leave to Plaintiffs to file a valid amended complaint. The Court notes that any new causes of action alleged in the First Amended Complaint are not to be included in any future amended complaint. The Court also grants leave to Plaintiffs to file a new amended complaint within 20 days.
