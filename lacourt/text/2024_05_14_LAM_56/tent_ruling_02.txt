MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff Joseph L. Parker 
RESPONDING PARTY:        None as of May 9, 2024. 
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition or reply papers have been filed as of May 9, 2024. 
 
BACKGROUND
             Plaintiff was a tenant of Defendants for
twenty years. Plaintiff alleges Defendants falsely misrepresented to him that
other tenants were paying $500 a month in rent, and they would give him a $100
discount if he performed maintenance on the property.  Plaintiff alleges the other tenants were in
fact paying $400 per month, and Defendants lied to him to so that he would
perform maintenance on the property for free.
 
            On February 28, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a complaint alleging (1) breach of oral contract; (2) fraud and deceit;
(3) senior abuse and harassment; (4) illegal unit as residence; (5) IIED; and
(6) breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  
 
DISCUSSION
            On November 30, 2023, the Court
sustained Defendant Regency Outdoor Advertising’s demurrer with 30 days leave
to amend.  On December 14, 2023,
Plaintiff submitted a “Second Amended Complaint” for filing.  The clerk’s office rejected the “Second
Amended Complaint” on grounds that no “First Amended Complaint” had been
filed.  
 
            Plaintiff asks that the Court relieve
him from failing to correctly identify his amended complaint.  Plaintiff’s amended complaint was rejected,
because it included the word “second” when it was intend to be Plaintiff’s
first amended complaint.  Plaintiff seeks
relief pursuant to CCP §473(b) based on mistake.  Plaintiff attaches a proposed “Amended
Complaint” to the Motion.
 
            The Court notes that Plaintiff does
not need relief from the clerk’s rejection of the “Second Amended Complaint.” Instead,
the relief sought should be to file his “Amended Complaint” after the
expiration of the 30 days leave granted by the Court after the sustaining of
the demurrer.  Plaintiff may file a
motion seeking this relief.  The motion
that is currently on file is DENIED.
             
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
