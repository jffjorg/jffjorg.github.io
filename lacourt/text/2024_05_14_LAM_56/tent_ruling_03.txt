MOVING
PARTY: Defendant Bank of America, N.A. (“Moving Defendant”) 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiffs Rokit World, Inc. and Jonathan Kendrick (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) 
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.  
 
BACKGROUND
On
October 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the original complaint (the “Complaint”) in
the within case, alleging: (1) breach of implied contract of confidentiality; and
(2) violation of California Financial Information Privacy Act.  On January 5, 2024, the Moving Defendant filed
a demurrer to the Complaint. On January 23, 2024, Moving Defendant filed a
notice of non-opposition to the demurrer to the Complaint. 
On
January 29, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), without having
received leave of Court to file an amended complaint and after the time to
serve opposition to the demurrer had passed. 
 
On
January 31, 2024, the Court granted Moving Defendant’s Demurrer because it was
unopposed. (Minute Order 1/31/24.) The Court then granted 20 days leave for
Plaintiffs to amend their Complaint.   The
time to file a valid FAC pursuant to the Court’s order was thus from January 31
through February 20, 2024.  Plaintiffs
did not file a valid FAC pursuant to the Court’s January 31, 2024 order.  
 
On
March 29, 2024, Moving Defendant filed the instant demurrer (the “Demurrer”) as
to all four causes of action in the FAC and a motion to strike (the “Motion to
Strike”) the FAC. On May 1, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their opposition to the
Demurrer and Motion to Strike. On May 7, 2024, Moving Defendant filed its
reply. 
 
MEET
AND CONFER
            Moving Defendant’s counsel states
that he attempted to meet and confer over the course of several weeks and asked
Plaintiffs’ counsel to schedule a phone call to no avail. (Austin Decl. ¶ 2.)
Therefore, the meet and confer requirement has been met. 
 
JUDICIAL
NOTICE
            Moving Defendant requests judicial notice of the following document:       
Exhibit
1: Superior Court for the County of Los Angles, Dept.
56, Judge Holly J. Fujie, tentative ruling dated July 31, 2024, Rokit World,
Inc, et al. vs. Bank of America, N.A. (Case No. 23STCV25101).
 
            The Court notes that the tentative
was made the ruling of the Court and grants judicial notice pursuant to
Evidence Code section 453. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
            Motions to strike are used to reach
defects or objections to pleadings that are not challengeable by demurrer, such
as words, phrases, and prayers for damages. (See Code Civ Proc., §§ 435-437.) A
motion to strike can be made to strike irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading or to strike any pleading or part thereof not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule or order of the
court. (§ 436.)
 
DISCUSSION
            Moving Defendant moves to strike Plaintiffs’
First Amended Complaint or in the alternative, Plaintiffs’ third and fourth
causes of actions. (Mot. to Strike at p.1.) Plaintiffs argue that the Motion to
Strike is MOOT because the Court granted leave to amend, and any defect has
been cured. (Opp’n at pp. 2-3.)
 
            If Plaintiffs had filed the FAC
before the date the opposition was due to the demurrer to the original Complaint,
it would have been timely filed, but it was not.  Plaintiffs had until January 18, 2024 to file
an opposition to that demurrer to the Complaint. Plaintiffs filed their FAC on January
29 – eleven days after it could legally be filed without leave to file from the
Court. On January 31, 2024, the Court sustained the unopposed demurrer as to Plaintiffs’
Complaint, with 20 days leave to amend. (Minute Order 1/31/24.) Twenty days
from the Court Order would be on or before Tuesday, February 20, 2024. Plaintiffs
did not file their FAC either before January 18, 2024 or from January 31
through February 20, 2024. Therefore, the FAC was not filed in a procedurally proper
manner and must be stricken. 
 
            Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the
Motion to Strike Plaintiffs’ FAC, with 20 days leave to file a valid FAC.
Therefore, the Moving Defendant’s Demurrer is MOOT. 
            
            In preparing the FAC that the Court
has granted leave to file, the Court notes that it did not grant leave
to Plaintiffs to add new causes of action to the Complaint in connection with
the original demurrer.  As such, any FAC
that Plaintiffs file in connection with this order should not include
the additional causes of action alleged in the FAC filed on January 29, 2024.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
