  CASE NO.: 23STCV29843
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS
 
Date: 
  May 14, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Defendant Real Soon
Entertainment, LLC (“Real”)
RESPONDING PARTY:        Plaintiff Leonardo M. Lopez 
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers.  No opposition or reply papers
have been filed as of May 9, 2024.
 
BACKGROUND
             Plaintiff is the owner of premises located at
816 S. La Brea Avenue.  Plaintiff leased
the premises to non-party Jason Djuan Reed (“Reed”).  Plaintiff alleges Reed used the premises as the
principal place of business of Defendants Real and Up La Brea Studios.  Plaintiff filed an unlawful detainer action
against Reed and obtained a judgment against him on October 4, 2024 in the
amount of $34,323.27.  
            Plaintiff alleges Reed has not paid
the judgment or vacated the premises and that 
Defendants continue to operate on the premises illegally.  
 
            On December 12, 2023, Plaintiff
filed this action against Defendants, alleging: (1) injunctive relief; (2)
trespass; (3) unjust enrichment; and (4) waste.      
 
DISCUSSION
            Defendant Real moves to quash (the “Motion”)
personal service of the summons and complaint (collectively, the “Complaint”), proof
of service of which on December 10, 2023 was filed with the Court on December
15, 2023.  (Motion, Ex. A.)  In response to the Motion, Plaintiff served
the Complaint again by personal service on March 22, 2024.  The person served was Jason Djuan Reed,
Defendants’ agent for service of process. 
(Motion, Reed Dec., ¶¶1-2.)  Proof
of personal service on Reed was filed on May 3, 2024.  Defendant’s Motion to Quash is therefore moot.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
