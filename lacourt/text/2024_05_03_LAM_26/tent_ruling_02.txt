Procedural Background
On March
21, 2021, Plaintiff Walters Wholesale Electric Co. (“Plaintiff Walters”) filed an
action to foreclose mechanic’s lien and to enforce stop payment notice (“Walters
Action”) against Defendants Tobias Eugene Vargas (“Vargas”), Fred & Jamison
LLC (“Jamison”), Evertrust Bank (“Bank”), and Inland Development Company. (“Inland”).  On March 29, 2023, Plaintiff Walters filed
the operative First Amended Complaint (“Walters FAC”) against Defendants Vargas,
Jamison, Bank, and Inland.  The FAC
asserts six causes of action for (1) Common Count; (2) Common Count; (3) Common
Count; (4) Common Count; (5) Account Stated; (6) to Foreclose Mechanic Lien,
and (7) to Enforce Bonded Stop Payment Notice (against Defendants Fred & Jamison).

On
April 21, 2023, Plaintiff American Spring Heating & Cooling, Inc
(“Plaintiff American Spring”) filed a breach of contract and mechanic’s lien
foreclosure action (“Spring Heating Action”) against Defendants Nova Homes,
Inc., dba Inland Development (“Nova Homes”) and Jamison.  The American Spring Action complaint asserts
four causes of actions for (1) mechanic’s lien foreclosure; (2) breach of
contract; (3) common counts; and (4) declaratory relief. 
On
April 25, 2023, Plaintiff Tobias Vargas dba Signal Alarms & Electric Co.
filed a breach of contract and mechanic’s lien foreclosure action (“Vargas
Action”) against Defendants Jamison LLC, and Nova Homes.  The Vargas Action complaint asserts five
causes of action for (1) breach of written contract; (2) foreclosure of
mechanics lien; (3) open book account; (4) account stated; and (5) enforcement
of mechanics lien release bond. 
On May
17, 2023, Plaintiff White Cap, LP, formerly known as HD Supply Construction
Supply LTD (“Plaintiff White Cap”) filed a breach of contract and foreclosure
of mechanic’s lien action (“White Cap Action”) against Defendant Nova Homes,
Ivano Stamegna, an individual, and Jamison. 
The White Cap Action complaint asserts six causes of action for (1)
breach of written contract; (2) open book account; (3) account stated; (4)
quantum meruit; (5) breach of personal guaranty; and (6) foreclosure of
mechanic’s lien. 
On
July 11, 2023, Plaintiff Gavina Plumbing Inc. (“Gavina Plumbing”) filed a
foreclosure of mechanic’s lien and breach of contract action (“Gavina Action”)
against Defendants Nova Homes and Jamison LLC.  The Gavina Action complaint asserts two causes
of action for (1) foreclosure of mechanic’s lien; and (2) breach of contract. 
On May
4, the Court deemed the Walters Action and Vargas Action related and determined
Walters as the lead case.  (Minute Order
05/04/23.)  The related cases were
assigned to Judge Michael P. Linfield in Department 34.  Then, on June 12, 2023, the Court deemed the
Walters and Vargas Actions related to case 22STCV39619 and assigned 22STCV39619
(herein “Nova Homes Action”) as the lead case. (Minute Order 06/12/23.)   
On
August 25, 2023, Plaintiff Walters filed a Notice of Related cases and on
August 28, 2023, the Court deemed the Vargas Action and Gavina Action
related.  (Notice 08/28/23.)  On September 18, 2023, Defendant Nova Homes
filed a Notice of Related Case and the Court deemed American Spring Action
related to the Nova Homes Action. 
(CM-015 09/18/23.) 
All of
the related cases are assigned to Department 26 of this court.
On December
11, 2023, Plaintiff Walters filed a motion to consolidate the Walters Action
with the American Springs Action, Vargas Action, White Cap Action, and Gavina
Action (collectively “Actions”). 
However, in the Court’s Minute Order dated January 9, 2024, the Court
instructed Plaintiff Walters to refile its original motion to consolidate in
all Actions by January 12, 2024, as the status of the parties to the Actions
had changed since the original motion. Thus, on January 12, 2023, Plaintiff
Walters filed the instant and first amended Motion to Consolidate the Walters
Action with the referenced related actions.  Plaintiff Walters also filed a Proposed Order
Consolidating Actions on January 12, 2023, followed by a Declaration of
Attorney Paul MacCabe in Support of Joint Stipulation to Consolidate on
February 13, 2023.  No parties have filed
an opposition.
On February
14, 2024, the Court continued the instant motion to May 3, 2024.

California, and who at all times during the occurrences alleged herein was the
owner of the real property located at 510 S Oxford Los Angeles, California

Legal Standard
California Rules of
Court Rule 3.350(a) states in relevant part:
(1) A notice of motion to consolidate must:
(A) List all named
parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of
their respective attorneys of record;
(B) Contain the
captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered
case shown first; and
(C) Be filed in each case sought to be consolidated.
 
(2) The motion to consolidate:
(A) Is deemed a
single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case;
(B) Must be served
on all attorneys of record and all non-represented parties in all of the cases
sought to be consolidated; and
(C) Must have a proof of service filed as part of the motion.
(Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.350(a).) Also, the consolidation statute, Code of Civil Procedure
§ 1048, states in relevant part:
 
(a) When actions
involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may
order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the
actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders
concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
(b) The court, in
furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will
be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any cause
of action, including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any
separate issue or of any number of causes of action or issues, preserving the
right of trial by jury required by the Constitution or a statute of this state
or of the United States.
(CCP § 1048(a).) 
The granting or
denial of the motion to consolidate rests in the sound discretion of the trial court
and will not be reversed except upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion.
(See Fellner v. Steinbaum (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 509, 511.)
Discussion
            Plaintiff
Walters seeks to consolidate the Walters Action with the American Heating
Action, Vargas Action, White Cap Action and Gavin Plumbing Action for all
purposes.
            “Code of Civil Procedure section 1048, subdivision (a), authorizes the
trial court, when appropriate, to ‘order a joint hearing or trial’ or to ‘order
all the actions consolidated.’ Under the statute and the case law, there are
thus two types of consolidation: a consolidation for purposes of trial only,
where the two actions remain otherwise separate; and a complete consolidation
or consolidation for all purposes, where the two actions are merged into a
single proceeding under one case number and result in only one verdict or set
of findings and one judgment.”  (Hamilton
v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147.)  “Consolidation under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1048 is permissive, and it is for the trial court to determine whether
the consolidation is for all purposes or for trial only.”  (Id. at p.1149.)  Moreover, there is no requirement that the
parties be identical for a complete consolidation. (See e.g., Jefferson
Street Ventures, LLC v. City of Indio (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1175,
1206 [noting in action involving multiple but not completely overlapping parties
that “consolidation appears particularly appropriate in this case—the cases are
in the same court, involve the same property, and many (if not all) of
the same damages.”] [italics added].)
            Here,
numerous factors support a complete consolidation.  First, the five actions do involve the same
parties or subsidiaries of the same parties and subcontractors.  Further, each of the five actions involve the
foreclosure of mechanics liens and breach of contract regarding the money due
for the electrical equipment and/or further supplies related to the
construction. The time frames also overlap, being that the suits are filed
between March of 2021 and July of 2023, concerning events beginning mainly
commencing between 2018-2019 (with the agreement in Walters dating back to
1998.)   (Walters Compl. ¶ 8.)  Finally and perhaps more important, the
actions involve the same property located at 510 S. Oxford Ave., Los Angeles,
California 90020.
In sum, “consolidation
appears particularly appropriate in this case—the cases are in the same court,
involve the same property, and many (if not all) of the same damages.” (Jefferson
Street Ventures, LLC, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th at p.1206.)
As
explained above, the Actions share many common issues of law or fact as they
involve the same defendants, the same property, the same harm, the same
damages, and cover the same timeframe.  The
fact that the actions do not share exactly the same causes of action is
immaterial as the underlying factual basis for the claims concerns overlapping
facts.  Moreover, the fact that the
plaintiffs and defendants are represented by different firms is also
immaterial, as litigation can regularly involve numerous firms representing
numerous parties without issue.  
Further,
on January 12, 2024, Plaintiff Walters served a Proposed Stipulation and Order
to Consolidate Actions (“Joint Stipulation”) and a First Amended Motion to
Consolidate Actions (“Motion to Consolidate”) on all parties named in the
Motion to Consolidate. Plaintiff Walters also served a Proposed Order
Consolidating Cases for All Purposes.  (Decl.
of McCabe, Ex. A) As of the date of February 13, 2024, 13 of the 20 parties
named in the motion, including Walters, had executed signature pages for the
Joint Stipulation.[1]  (McCabe Decl., Ex 1. )
Accordingly,
the Court finds that consolidation for all purposes is warranted under the lead
action Case No. 23STCV06189.
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Based
on the foregoing, Walters Motion for complete consolidation of Case Nos. 23STCV06189 and 23STCV08994;
23STCV09227; 23STCV11102; 23STCV16220 is GRANTED.  Consolidation is ordered for all purposes with
Case No. 23STCV06189 as the lead case. 
All future pleadings are to be filed in the Lead Action only under Case
No. 23STCV06189, with annotation that it is the lead case.
Moving Party is ordered to give notice and
file proof of service of such.
