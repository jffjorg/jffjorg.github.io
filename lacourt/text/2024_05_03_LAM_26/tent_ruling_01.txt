 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to be relieved as counsel
 



 
On March 15,
2024, Michael J. Kapin, Esq. (“Counsel”), filed the instant motion to be relieved
as counsel for defendant High Times Production, Inc. (“Client”).  On March 25, 2024, Counsel filed an updated
proposed order.
Counsel has filed a form MC051 and MC-052
and has lodged with the Court a copy of the proposed order on form MC-053
pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362.  
The MC-052 form states that Counsel served
Client via mail at Client’s last known mailing address which Counsel states he
has confirmed as current within 30 days of the motion by mail, return receipt
requested.  
Counsel states “the specific facts which
give rise to this motion are confidential pursuant to Business and Professions
Code § 6068(e), the California Rules of Professional Conduct and by the
attorney client privilege (Evid.C. §§950 et seq).  In the event that this Court desires further
information to ascertain the good faith basis for this motion and for
withdrawal, it is respectfully requested that the Court have an in camera
hearing outside of the presence of all other parties so that the specific facts
demonstrating good cause for this withdrawal may be demonstrated to the court.
(E.g., Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1136, 1137).  (MC-051 ¶ 3.)
On March 18, 2024, the Court held a Trial
Setting Conference whereby on the Court’s own motion, the Court ordered the
Trial Setting Conference scheduled for 03/18/2024 to be continued to 06/05/2024
and ordered Defendant’s counsel to file amended moving papers for his motion to
be relieved clearly identifying the continued trial setting of 06/05/24.  Defendant’s counsel filed amended moving
papers on March 25, 2024. 
Based on the notice of motion, the
declaration filed by Counsel, and representations by Counsel in court, the
instant motion is GRANTED.  Counsel is
responsible for determining if there are any other hearings scheduled or due
dates for discovery for this case, including any motions hearings, which must
all be listed in the proposed order.  For
each hearing, Counsel must state the date, time, and location of the hearing
(“111 N. Hill St., Dept. 26, Los Angeles, CA 90012”).
A corporation cannot represent itself,
rather it must retain legal counsel. An Order to show cause as to Defendant
High Times Productions’ legal representation is set on June 5, 2024, at 8:30
a.m.
Counsel is ordered to serve copies of the
instant order and the signed form MC-053 order on all parties, including Client,
and file proof of service of such.  Counsel
is not relieved until proof of service is filed with the court.
