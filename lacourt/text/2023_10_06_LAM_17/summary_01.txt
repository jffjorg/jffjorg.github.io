Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff's third amended complaint is defective and cannot be fixed. The plaintiff's claims for professional negligence and fraud are dismissed. The judge found that the plaintiff's complaint does not allege sufficient facts to state a claim for professional negligence, as it does not specify what acts by the defendant were negligent and/or caused the plaintiff's mother's death. Additionally, the plaintiff's complaint does not allege a causal connection between the therapy or procedure and the appearance of cancer markers 16 months later. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claims for fraud are defective, as they are based on information and belief and do not allege specific facts that could show a prima facie case. The motion to strike is moot because the demurrer is sustained.
