[1]The Court notes
that Gibson states in his response to the instant motion that he “incorporates
by reference the statements and arguments set forth in his Motion to Quash
Service of the Motion to Amend Judgment and the Declaration of Gibson submitted
to support his Motion to Quash, both filed concurrently with this Response.” (Response
at p. 2:10-13.) Gibson does not cite to any legal authority demonstrating that
this approach is appropriate. Moreover, pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1113,
subdivision (d),
“[e]xcept in a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or
responding memorandum may exceed 15 pages.” Incorporating
Gibson’s motion to quash filed on September 25, 2023 into Gibson’s response to
the instant motion would result in the response exceeding 15 pages. For the
foregoing reasons, the Court declines to consider Gibson’s separate motion to
quash herein. 


[2]Plaintiff asserts
in the reply that “[a]lthough Gibson has submitted several declarations in this
case claiming that the company’s principal place of business is in Arizona,
such representations are inconsistent with Kandypens’ corporate documents and
legal pleadings outside this case. He should not be allowed to switch facts
whenever it suits his interests. If anything, this material inconsistency
undermines the credibility of the other bare assertions made in his
declarations.” (Reply at p. 4, fn. 2.) 


[3]As discussed
above, Gibson states that he is a resident of Arizona, and that in 2006, he
moved from California to Arizona. (Gibson Surreply Decl., ¶ 9.)  


[4]The Court notes
that Plaintiff’s counsel’s reply declaration indicates that “[a]ttached hereto as Exhibit 5 is a true and correct copy of relevant
excerpts of the March 9, 2023, debtor’s examination of Kandypens, Inc., which
designated James Zender as its witness.” (Crowell Reply
Decl., ¶ 6.)
