And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of a motion to amend judgment. The motion was filed by Gibson, who claims to be a resident of Arizona and has moved from California to Arizona in 2006. However, the Court notes that Gibson's declarations are inconsistent with Kandypens' corporate documents and legal pleadings outside of this case, which undermines the credibility of his claims. Additionally, the Court finds that Gibson's response to the instant motion incorporates motions and declarations from previous cases, which exceeds the 15-page limit set forth in California Rules of Court. Therefore, the Court declines to consider Gibson's motion to quash.
