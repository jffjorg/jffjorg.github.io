And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Citibank, N.A.'s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff Pacific Escrow, Inc.'s second cause of action. The motion was filed after the judge's previous order sustaining Defendant's demurrer to the third cause of action, with leave to amend. Plaintiff did not file an amended complaint, and Defendant filed an answer to the original complaint. The judge notes that the proof of service attached to Plaintiff's opposition to the motion does not show that it was served on Defendant, and that Defendant did not file a reply in support of the motion. As a result, the hearing on the motion is continued to January 18, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. in Department 50.
