English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to expunge the notice of lis pendens recorded against a property owned by the defendants. The defendants, including Leon Richard Mays and Millennium Concepts LLC, are seeking to expunge the notice, which was recorded in August 2019 and March 2023. The plaintiffs, Richard Meng and Vivian Meng, allege that the defendants misrepresented and fraudulently obtained funds from them, and that the defendants have a vested legal interest in the property.

The Judge has ruled that the defendants have met their burden to show that the notice of lis pendens does not contain a real property claim, and therefore the notice should be expunged. The Judge has also denied the plaintiffs' request for sanctions and awarded attorney's fees and costs to the defendants.

The ruling is based on the Court's interpretation of Code of Civil Procedure section 405.30, which requires that a notice of lis pendens be expunged if the pleading on which it is based does not contain a real property claim. The Judge has also cited several case law decisions, including Gale v. Superior Court and BGJ Associates v. Superior Court, in support of its ruling.
