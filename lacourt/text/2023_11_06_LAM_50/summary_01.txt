Case Number: 18STCV03053
Hearing Date: November 6, 2023

  - Unfair Competition Law
  - Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement Act

Tentative Ruling:
  - Plaintiff has demonstrated personal jurisdiction over Graham Gibson

  - The Court grants the People's motion to amend the judgment to add Graham Gibson as a judgment debtor under the alter ego doctrine

Significant Statements:

  - "The case is largely concluded, and a judgment is already entered... Gibson cannot make a convincing argument—let alone a compelling one—that exercising jurisdiction over him would be unreasonable."
  - "There is no showing below, and there is not the slightest suggestion in the briefs of appellants, that anyone, other than [the alter ego], had control of the litigation."
