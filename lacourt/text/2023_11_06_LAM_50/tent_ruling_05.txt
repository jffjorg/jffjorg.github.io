TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:
 
DEFENDANT
  CITIBANK, N.A.’S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS



 
Background
Plaintiff Pacific Escrow, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendant Citibank, N.A. (“Defendant”) on August 10, 2022. The Complaint alleges
causes of action for (1) tortious interference with contract, (2) unfair
business practices, and (3) tortious interference with prospective advantage. 
Defendant demurred to each of the causes of action of the Complaint. On
April 26, 2023, the Court issued an Order sustaining Defendant’s demurrer to
the third cause of action of the Complaint, with leave to amend. The Court
overruled the demurrer to the first and second causes of action. The Court’s
April 26, 2023 Order provides that “[t]he Court orders Plaintiff to file and
serve an amended complaint, if any, within 20 days of this Order. If no amended
complaint is filed within 20 days of this Order, Defendant is ordered to file
and serve its answer within 30 days of this Order.” Plaintiff did not file an
amended complaint, and on May 25, 2023, Defendant filed an answer to the
Complaint. 
Defendant now moves for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff’s
second cause of action. Plaintiff opposes. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter, the Court notes that the
proof of service attached to Plaintiff’s opposition to the instant motion
indicates that a document entitled “DECLARATION OF JONATHAN L ENDMAN IN
RESPONSE TO ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE FOR FAILURE TO TIMELY FILE PROOF SERVICE” was
served on “Attorney for Defendants WB Horizon Real Estate LLC and John
Baesler.” These parties are not defendants in this action, and the proof of
service does not show that Plaintiff’s opposition to the instant motion was
served on Defendant. In addition, Defendant did not file any reply in support
of the motion, so it is not clear whether Defendant received service of
Plaintiff’s opposition. 
In light of the foregoing, the hearing on Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is continued
to 1-18-2024, at 2:00 p.m. in Dept. 50. 
All opposition and reply filings are to be per
code. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
