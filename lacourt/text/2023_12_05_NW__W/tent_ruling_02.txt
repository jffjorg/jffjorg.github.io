March 1, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their proofs of personal service as to
Defendants Simakovski and GE Holdings LLC, indicating that personal service had
been effectuated at 7260 Kentland Ave, West Hills, CA 91307.
 
On
April 6, 2023, defaults were entered against Defendants Simakovski and GE
Holdings LLC. 
 
On
August 21, 2023, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the fourth, sixth, seventh,
eighth, and ninth causes of action.
 
On
November 7, 2023, Defendant Simakovski filed the instant motion to vacate and
set aside the entry of default and default judgment served on June 20, 2019 on
the grounds that Defendant Simakovski did not have sufficient actual notice of
the action pending against it and that any default judgment entered against him
is void for lack of proper service.
 
On
November 9, 2023, the court entered default judgment in Plaintiffs’ favor and
against Defendants Simakovski and GE Holdings LLC.
 
On
November 28, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an untimely opposition to the instant
motion.

DISCUSSION
 
A.      Procedural
Issues
 
As
a preliminary matter, it is noted that Plaintiffs filed an untimely opposition
to the instant motion. Plaintiffs explain that the reason for their untimely
filing was that the copy of the motion that they received from Defendant
Simakovski lacked a hearing date. (Opposition at pg. 2; Ramenian Decl. ¶ 2;
RJN, Exh. 23.) Due to the lack of a hearing date, Plaintiffs’ counsel inquired
with the court and had been informed that the hearing was scheduled for
December 12, 2023. (Ramenian Decl. ¶ 2.) It was not until Plaintiffs’ counsel
double-checked the court’s docket did he realize that the hearing was actually
scheduled for December 5, 2023. (Ibid.) Under these circumstances, the
court finds that Plaintiffs’ failure to timely file their opposition papers was
excusable and shall be considered.
 
Any
reply arguments advanced by Defendant Simakovski may be made at the hearing.
 
B.      Relief
under CCP § 473.5(a)
 
Defendant
Simakovski first request the court to set aside/vacate default pursuant to CCP
§ 473.5.
 
CCP
§ 473.5(a) provides in relevant part:  
 
When service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice
to a party in time to defend the action and a default or default judgment has
been entered against him¿or her¿in¿the¿action, he¿or she¿may serve and file a
notice of motion to set aside¿the¿default or default judgment and for leave to
defend the action.¿ The¿notice of motion shall be served and filed within a
reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after
entry of a default judgment against him¿or her; or (ii) 180 days after service
on him¿or her¿of a written notice that¿the¿default or default judgment has been
entered. 
 
Additionally,
the motion “shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under oath that the
party's lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by
his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party shall serve
and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other pleading
proposed to be filed in the action.” (CCP § 473.5(b).) 
 
Defendant
Simakovski attests that he was not provided with actual notice of this action
for the following reasons. First, he asserts that the address where service had
been conducted is improperly split among separate residential units, designated
as Units A through D. (Simakovski Decl. ¶ 1.) As a result, any incoming mail is
intermingled amongst the residents. (Id. at ¶ 2.) Second, Defendant
Simakovski declares that personal service could not have occurred on February
26, 2023 because he was at a 3-day event hosted by the “Ukrainian Cultural
Center of Los Angeles,” in which his non-profit, “Go Ukraina” was a
participant. (Simakovski Decl. ¶ 3.)
 
Under
the circumstances, the Court finds Defendant Simakovski’s arguments to be
unavailing. Here, the proof of service show that Defendant Simakovski was personally
served with the summons and complaint at 7260 Kentland Ave, West Hills, CA
91307 on February 26, 2023 at 9:30 a.m. by a registered process server. (See Proof
of Service re: Defendant Simakovski filed on March 1, 2023.) A proof of service containing a declaration
from a registered process server invokes a rebuttable presumption of valid
service that must be overcome by the party seeking to defeat service of
process.  (American Express Centurion
Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390; see also Evid. Code §
647.)   Preliminarily, because the
process server has declared that he personally served Defendant Simakovski, the
mailing argument advanced by Defendant Simakovski has no bearing on the court’s
analysis. 
 
Furthermore, the presumption of receipt has not been
sufficiently rebutted based on Defendant Simakovski’s evidence. While Defendant
Simakovski claims to have been attending a 3-day event hosted by the Ukrainian
Cultural Center of Los Angeles, he has failed to submit any admissible evidence
to show that he was actual in attendance when the service had occurred on
February 26, 2023 at 9:30 a.m. Even if the court were to accept the exhibits
included within Defendant Simakovski’s declaration, these documents do not
establish Defendant Simakovski’s whereabouts at the time of service. Instead,
the documents presented merely show that the event was scheduled to occur at
various locations in Southern California from February 24 to February 26, 2023,
and that Defendant Simakovski’s nonprofit “Go Ukraina” had some involvement.
(See Simakovski Decl., Exhs. A-B.) The extent of this involvement is unclear.
Without further admissible evidence, Defendant Simakovski is unable to meet his
burden. 
 
Moreover,
Defendant Simakovski’s motion is procedurally deficient because it lacks a copy
of his proposed answer to the complaint. (CCP § 473.5(b).) Furthermore, relief under Section 473.5 requires
a declaration of no actual notice, no evasion of service, and showing of
diligence, and Defendant Simakovski’s declaration lacks statements reflecting a
showing of diligence. (Trackman v. Kenney (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th
175, 180.)
 
Accordingly,
because Defendant Simakovski has failed to meet his burden in establishing
relief under CCP § 473.5, Defendants’ motion to set aside/vacate default is denied
on this ground.
 
C.      Relief
under CCP § 473(d)
 
Next,
Defendant Simakovski moves to set aside the default and default judgment
pursuant to CCP § 473(d).
 
Pursuant
to CCP § 473(d), “[t]he court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own
motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as
to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either
party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.”
 
Here,
Defendant Simakovski argues that the default judgment entered against him is
void because he was never properly served with the summons and complaint.
(Motion at pg. 3.) Considering Defendant Simakovski has failed to meet his
burden in establishing relief under CCP § 473.5, the court finds that service
was properly effectuated. Therefore, the default judgment entered against
Defendant Simakovski is valid. 
 
Accordingly,
the motion to set aside/vacate default and default judgment is denied on this
ground as well.
