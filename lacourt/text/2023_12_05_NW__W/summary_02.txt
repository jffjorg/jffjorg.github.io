And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant Simakovski's motion to set aside and vacate the default and default judgment. The court finds that service was properly effectuated and that Defendant Simakovski has failed to meet his burden in establishing relief under CCP § 473.5. The court also finds that the default judgment entered against Defendant Simakovski is valid and that Defendant Simakovski's motion is procedurally deficient because it lacks a copy of his proposed answer to the complaint. The court grants judicial notice of various documents and denies Plaintiffs' untimely opposition to the motion. The court concludes that Defendant Simakovski's arguments are unavailing and that he has failed to establish that he was not provided with actual notice of the action.
