Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to strike the answer filed by defendants BCH Enterprises, LLC and Twisted River Capital, LLC to the second amended complaint and to enter default against defendant Brett Harrison as to the third amended complaint. The court finds that the defendants have been unrepresented by counsel since June 9, 2023, and that they have failed to take any steps to retain new counsel. Therefore, the court grants the motion to strike the answer filed by defendants BCH Enterprises, LLC and Twisted River Capital, LLC.

As for the request to enter default against defendant Brett Harrison, the court finds that the third amended complaint has not been revised in a way that would render defendant Brett Harrison's prior answer no longer applicable. Therefore, the court denies the request to enter default against defendant Brett Harrison without prejudice.
