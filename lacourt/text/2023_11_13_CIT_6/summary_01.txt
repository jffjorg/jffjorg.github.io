And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint to amend the cause of action for general negligence. The plaintiff seeks to add sufficient detail to the operative complaint, which was filed approximately six months ago. The new legal representation retained by the plaintiff discovered that the original complaint lacked sufficient detail, and the amendment is necessary and proper to address this issue. The judge finds no prejudice in permitting amendment at this stage of the litigation and notes that the defendants did not oppose the motion. The judge does advise the plaintiff to comply with the requirements of the California Rules of Court in the future. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
