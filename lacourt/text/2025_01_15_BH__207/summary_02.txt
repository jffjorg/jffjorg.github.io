And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denies the Defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the Complaint. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant repeatedly trespassed onto the Plaintiff's property, cut down trees without permission, and instructed tree trimmers to enter the property and cut down the trees. The Court finds that these allegations are sufficient to specifically allege fraudulent conduct by the Defendant and intentional cutting down of trees in conscious disregard of the Plaintiff's property rights, sufficient to allege malice. The Court orders the Defendant to file an Answer to the Complaint on or before February 5, 2025, and will proceed with the Case Management Conference set on January 15, 2025.
