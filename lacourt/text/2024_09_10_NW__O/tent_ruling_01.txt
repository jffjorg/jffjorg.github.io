ORDER
  GRANTING CALLAN BUECHSENSCHUETZ’S MOTION TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF SHANE MOORE’S
  ANSWERS TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES



I.              
BACKGROUND 
This case
arises out of a motor vehicle accident between Plaintiffs Miguel Alanis and
Shane Moore (“Moore”)(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) and Defendants Callan Buechsenschuetz
(“Callan”) and Richard Buechsenschuetz (collectively, “Defendants”). 
Callan now seeks
to compel Moore’s discovery responses.  
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On March 16, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their
Complaint, alleging (1) Negligence. 
On January 16, 2024, Defendants filed
their Answer. 
On July 31, 2024, Callan filed their Motion
to Compel Moore’s Answers to Demand for Production of Documents (“Motion RFPs”),
Motion to Compel Moore’s Answers to Form Interrogatories (“Motion Form
Interrogatories”), and Motion to Compel Moore’s Answers to Special
Interrogatories (“Motion Special Interrogatories”).
On August 23, 2024, this Court granted
Moore’s counsel’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel. 
Moore did not file an opposition. 
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.            
Request for Production
 A party upon whom a demand for the production
of documents has been made has 30 days after service of the demand to respond.
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.260(a).)[1] The
propounding and responding parties may agree to extend the time for response. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.270(a).) When a party fails to serve a timely
response, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a motion to compel
response. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b).) A responding party that
does not provide responses waives the right to object to the demand, including
objections based on privilege or work product. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300(a).) 
B.            
Interrogatories 
If a party to whom interrogatories are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to
compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)    
IV.         
ANALYSIS
Three motions
are presently before the Court. The ruling will first address Callan’s Motion RFPs.
The Court will next address Callan’s Motion Form Interrogatories and Motion
Special Interrogatories together. 
A.            
Callan’s Motion RFPs is Granted.
On January
16, 2024, Callan served Moore with their Demand for Production of Documents,
Set One (“RFPs”). (See Declaration of Brad Elder filed July 31, 2024
(“Elder RFPs Decl.”), ¶ 2, Ex. A.) Callan’s counsel declares he followed up
with Moore’s former counsel regarding the missing discovery responses on March
5, 2024, and June 19, 2024; both times, Moore’s former counsel said they had
lost contact with Moore. (See Elder RFPs Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Exs. B-C.) To
date, Callan’s counsel declares he has received no discovery responses from
Moore or his former counsel. (See id. at ¶ 5.)
Moore did not
file an opposition.
The Court
finds Callan is entitled to an order compelling Moore’s answers to its RFPs.  
Accordingly, the
Court GRANTS Callan’s Motion RFPs and orders Moore to serve code compliant
responses without objection on or before September 30, 2024.
B.            
Callan’s Motion Form Interrogatories and
Motion Special Interrogatories are Granted. 
On January
16, 2024, Callan served Moore with their Form Interrogatories and Special
Interrogatories. (See Declaration of Brad Elder filed July 31, 2024
(“Elder Form Interrogatories Decl.”), ¶ 2, Ex. A; see Declaration of
Brad Elder filed July 31, 2024 (“Elder Special Interrogatories Decl.”), ¶ 2,
Ex. A.) Callan’s counsel declares he followed up with Moore’s former counsel
regarding the missing discovery responses on March 5, 2024, and June 19, 2024;
both times, Moore’s former counsel said they had lost contact with Moore. (See,
e.g., Elder Form Interrogatories Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Exs. B-C.) To date,
Callan’s counsel declares he has received no discovery responses from Moore or
his former counsel. (See id. at ¶ 5.)
Moore did not
file an opposition.
The Court
finds Callan is entitled to an order compelling Moore’s answers to its Form and
Special Interrogatories.  
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Callan’s Motion Form Interrogatories and Motion Special Interrogatories
and orders Moore to serve code compliant responses without objection on or
before September 30, 2024.
V.            
SANCTIONS 
“The court
shall impose a monetary sanction¿. . .¿against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel¿. . .” responses to interrogatories or production demands,
absent substantial justification or other circumstances that make imposing the
sanctions unjust.¿(Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.290(c).)
The court shall also impose a “monetary sanction…on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(c).) Similarly,¿“[t]he court
may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery
process includes “[f]ailing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery,” and “[d]isobeying¿a court order to provide discovery.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2023.010(d),
(g).) 
Callan seeks
a total of $1,180.00 in discovery sanctions, accounting for four hours of work/hearing
time for all three motions at a rate of $250.00/hr, plus $180.00 in filing
fees. 
The Court
finds Callan’s counsel’s hourly rate of $250 reasonable given the prevailing
rates in the Greater Los Angeles Area for attorneys with his level of
experience. However, the Court also finds Moore’s counsel was substantially
justified in his failure to provide responses due to the loss of communication
with his client. The Court will thus not award discovery sanctions against
Moore’s counsel, but the Court does find Moore’s unresponsiveness inappropriate
and sufficient to constitute a misuse of the discovery process. The Court thus
finds Moore should be required to pay Callan the full amount of their counsel’s
requested discovery sanctions. 
Moore shall
pay Callan discovery sanctions to Defendants’ counsel in the amount of
$1,180.00 on or before October 31, 2024. 
VI.         
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Callan’s Motion
to Compel Moore’s Answers to Demand for Production of Documents, Form
Interrogatories, and Special Interrogatories.
As a result,
the Court orders Moore to serve Callan with code compliant responses without
objection to Callan’s RFPs, Form Interrogatories, and Special Interrogatories on
or before September 30, 2024.
The Court
also GRANTS Callan’s request for discovery sanctions in the amount of $1,180.00.
Moore shall pay Callan’s counsel discovery sanctions in the amount of $1,180.00
on or before October 31, 2024 
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      September 9, 2024
