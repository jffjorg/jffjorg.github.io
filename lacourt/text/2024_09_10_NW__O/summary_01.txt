And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Callan Buechsenschuetz's motion to compel discovery responses from Shane Moore. The Judge found that Shane Moore failed to serve timely discovery responses, including a demand for production of documents and answers to form and special interrogatories. The Judge also granted Callan's motion for discovery sanctions, ordering Shane Moore to pay $1,180.00 to Callan's counsel. The Judge found that Shane Moore's unresponsiveness was a misuse of the discovery process, but did not award sanctions against Moore's counsel due to the loss of communication with his client. The Judge ordered Shane Moore to serve code compliant responses without objection on or before September 30, 2024, and to pay the discovery sanctions on or before October 31, 2024.
