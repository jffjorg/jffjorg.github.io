PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO DISMISS (filed on 02/05/24)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to dismiss is GRANTED. The Court dismisses this action without prejudice.
 
I. BACKGROUND
On December 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed his Complaint against
Botach Management LLC and Shlomo Botach. The Complaint alleges the following
causes of action: (1) Conspiracy, (2) Libel and Defamation, (3) Trespass, (4) Criminal
Damages to Property, and (5) Acting under Color of Law or Color of Authority in
the Violation of and in Conspiracy to Violate Civil Rights and Constitutional
Rights. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ failure to properly repair their
pipe caused damage to his property.
No trial date has yet been set.
On February 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant
motion to dismiss. No opposition or other response has been filed. 
II. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff moves this court for an order dismissing his
complaint, without prejudice, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 581(c).
Code of Civil Procedure § 581(c) provides that a “plaintiff
may dismiss his or her complaint, or any cause of action asserted in it, in its
entirety, or as to any defendant or defendants, with or without prejudice prior
to the actual commencement of trial.”
Therefore,
since Code of Civil Procedure § 581(c) provides that a plaintiff may dismiss
their complaint, with or without prejudice, prior to the actual commencement of
trial, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion.

 
III. CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to dismiss is GRANTED. The Court
dismisses this action without prejudice.
