And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to be relieved as counsel for the defendant. The defendant's counsel, John Markham, filed the motion on June 4, 2024, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and an unwaivable conflict between client and counsel. The court finds that the requirements for relief have been completed, but denies the motion without prejudice because the defendant would be prejudiced by the withdrawal and does not have a reasonable time to obtain new counsel. The trial is set for June 26, 2024, and a corporation cannot represent itself in court.
