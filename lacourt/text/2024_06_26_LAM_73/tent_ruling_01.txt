TENTATIVE RULING

Relieved as Counsel as to Defendant is DENIED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On May 27,
2022, Plaintiff EFT Global Holdings dba Sentar Pharmaceuticals (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendant Alternate Health Inc. (“Defendant”).
The Complaint alleges the
following. On or about September 21, 2016, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into
a License Agreement. (Compl., ¶ 5.)
Pursuant to the License Agreement, Plaintiff licensed
certain rights to the Patent Rights to Defendant in return for certain
consideration and Defendant's continued performance of certain obligations. (Ibid.) Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant did not uphold its part of the License Agreement. (Compl., ¶ 9.) On
October 12, 2017, Defendant filed a claim in which it asserted that the
Licensor Patent Rights are invalid or enforceable, specifically, Defendant
asserted Plaintiff had no patents at all. (Compl., ¶ 16.) Based on the mutual
assent of the parties stated in writing no later than September 12, 2017, and Defendant's
filed claim on October 12, 2017, the License Agreement terminated no later than
October 12, 2017. (Compl., ¶ 17.)
On
June 4, 2024, counsel for Defendant filed a Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel. Counsel
also filed a supporting declaration and proposed order.  
 
No
opposition or other response has been filed. 
 
II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard
 
California
Rules¿of Court,¿rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1)
notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form (MC-052)); (3) service
of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who
have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared
on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil¿form
(MC-053)).¿ 
 
The¿court has discretion
to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted¿provided
that¿there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of justice.¿¿(See¿Ramirez v.¿Sturdevant¿(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
904, 915.)¿ 
 
B.     Discussion
Here,
Defendant’s counsel, seeks relief under Code of Civil Procedure, Section 284(2).
Counsel correctly completed and filed the notice (Form MC-051) and declaration
(MC-052). (Code Civ. Proc., § 284(2); Cal. Rules Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a)
& (c).) In the declaration, counsel explains that this motion is being
brought under Section 284(2) instead of 284(1) because the attorney
client relationship has broken down and counsel states the client has
undertaken a series of actions which create an unwaivable conflict between
client and counsel. 
Counsel
served the notice (MC-051), the declaration (MC-052), and the proposed order
(MC-053) on Defendant and filed a Proof of Service with the Court. The Court
finds all the requirements for relief have been completed.
However,
the Court finds that Defendant would be prejudiced by the withdrawal. Trial in
this matter is set for June 26, 2024. Defendant does not have a reasonable time
to obtain new counsel. Further, “a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of
record either in propria persona or through an officer or agent who is not an
attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage Control
Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.) Therefore, the Court denies
the motion without prejudice. 
III. DISPOSITION
 
Accordingly, the Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
