And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiffs' motion to compel defendant Wang's response to special interrogatories, set one. Defendant Wang is ordered to provide verified responses within 30 days. Additionally, the court awards sanctions in the amount of $2,310 against defendant Wang and their attorney, jointly and severally, to be paid to counsel for the plaintiffs within 30 days of the date of this order.

The ruling is based on the fact that defendant Wang failed to respond to the special interrogatories and did not make a good faith effort to resolve the issue through meet and confer. The court finds that defendant Wang's boilerplate objections to the interrogatories were unmeritorious and failed to state how or why the interrogatories were not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The court also notes that defendant Wang engaged in the misuse of the discovery process by failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery, which constitutes a sanctionable offense. The court awards sanctions in the amount of $2,310, which is a reduced amount from the $5,110 requested by the plaintiffs.
