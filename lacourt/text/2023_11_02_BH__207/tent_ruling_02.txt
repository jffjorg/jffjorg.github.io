MOTION
 
            Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Blue
Lake Capital LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves for terminating and monetary sanctions
against Defendant and Cross-Complainant Amanda Moore (“Defendant” or “Moore”) for
failure to comply with the Court’s September 13 and 20 orders. 
 
            Moore has not opposed the motion.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
When a party misuses the discovery process by disobeying a court order
to provide discovery, the court in its discretion may impose a terminating
sanction by striking a party’s pleading or dismissing the action of the party.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (g), 2023.030, subds. (d)(1) & (d)(3);
2025.450, subd. (h), 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
California discovery law authorizes a range of
penalties for a party's refusal to obey a discovery order, including monetary
sanctions, evidentiary sanctions, issue sanctions, and terminating sanctions. A
court has broad discretion in selecting the appropriate penalty, . . . .
Despite this broad discretion, the courts have long recognized that the
terminating sanction is a drastic penalty and should be used sparingly. A trial
court must be cautious when imposing a terminating sanction because the sanction
eliminates a party's fundamental right to a trial, thus implicating due process
rights. The trial court should select a sanction that is tailored to the harm
caused by the withheld discovery. Sanctions should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.
 
(Lopez
v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 566, 604 [cleaned up].) 
 
When a party fails to respond to the opposing
party's interrogatories, the court should begin by imposing monetary sanctions
and ordering the party to respond. If a party then fails to obey an order
compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction.  In general, a court may not
impose issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions unless a party disobeys a
court order.  
 
(Moofly
Productions, LLC v. Favila (2020) 46 CalApp.5th 1, 11 [cleaned up] [citing Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (c)].)  However,
“a terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” (Newland v. Superior Court
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 615.)
 
ANALYSIS
            Deposition
 
On November 7, 2022, Moore failed to appear for her Noticed Deposition,
to which she had not objected.  (Perkin
Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6, Exs. B & D.)  Plaintiff
requested sanctions, which the Court denied, upon the representations made in
opposition that Moore had been dealing with personal issues and illness.  (Perkin Decl. ¶ 8.)  Subsequently, the parties engaged in some initial
written discovery and attended an unsuccessful mediation.  (Perkin Decl. ¶ 9.)  
 
Immediately following the mediation, Moore’s counsel withdrew as
counsel, and Moore is currently representing herself. (Perkin Decl. ¶ 10.)  Thereafter, Moore did not respond to
Plaintiff’s efforts to meet and confer regarding setting a date for Moore’s
deposition.  (Perkin Decl. ¶ 13.)  On August 17, 2023, Plaintiff moved to compel
Moore’s deposition.  (Ibid.)
 
On September 13, the Court ordered Moore to appear for deposition
within 20 days of notice of the Court’s order, and ordered Moore to pay $500 in
monetary sanctions.  (September 13, 2023
Minute Order.)  Moore did not attend the
hearing.  (Perkin Decl. ¶ 15.)  The Clerk mailed notice of the Court’s order
on September 18, 2023.  (See September
18, 2023 Certificate of Mailing.)  Plaintiff
noticed Moore’s deposition for October 3, 2023. 
(Perkin Decl. ¶ 18, Ex. H.)  Moore
did not object, and did not appear, thus violating the Court’s September 13
Order.  (Perkin Decl. ¶¶ 23, 24, Ex. K.)  
 
Written Discovery
 
Moore did not respond to Plaintiff’s meet and confer correspondence or
attend the July 27, 2023 informal discovery conference regarding deficiencies
in Moore’s discovery responses.  (Perkin
Decl. ¶ 11.)  On July 31, 2023, Plaintiff
filed four motions to compel further written discovery responses, which Moore
did not oppose.  (Perkin Decl. ¶¶ 12,
14.)  
 
On September 20, Moore did not appear at the hearing on Plaintiff’s
discovery motions, and the Court adopted its tentative ruling, granting
Plaintiff’s motions to compel further discovery responses in their entirety,
ordering Moore to serve further verified and code compliant responses, without
objections, to Special Interrogatories, Set 1; Form Interrogatories (General
and Employment), Set 1; Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1; and
Requests for Admission, Set 1, within 20 days of notice of the Court’s
September 20, 2023 order, and to pay additional monetary sanctions in the
amount of $3,040.00.  (September 20, 2023
Minute Order.)
 
Plaintiff served Moore with notice of the Court’s ruling on October 4,
2023, via overnight delivery and email. 
(Perkin Decl. ¶ 21 and Ex. J.)
 
As of the filing date of the motion, Moore has not complied with the
Court’s September 13 or 20 orders. 
(Perkin Decl. ¶ 28.)   
 
Plaintiff is prejudiced by Moore’s failure to engage in the discovery
process, because Plaintiff is unable to discover any critical facts, documents,
and percipient witnesses from Moore relating to Plaintiff’s claims, Moore’s
defenses, and Moore’s cross-claims against Plaintiff.  
 
Moreover, Moore has not opposed the motion, and has thus waived the
right to argue that a terminating sanction is unwarranted. (Sexton v.
Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Having found that Moore has
failed to comply with the Court’s September 13 and 20 orders, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for terminating sanctions.  As such, under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030, subdivisions (d)(1) & (d)(3), the Court strikes Moore’s Answer
to the Complaint filed on February 24, 2023 and dismisses Moore’s
cross-complaint also filed on February 24, 2023.  
 
With the Court granting
terminating sanctions against Moore, the Court finds the imposition of monetary
sanctions to be moot.  
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice
of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service of such.
