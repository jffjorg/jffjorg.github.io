And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 22SMCV01666 regarding a motion by the plaintiff, Blue Lake Capital LLC, for terminating and monetary sanctions against the defendant, Amanda Moore. The plaintiff is seeking sanctions due to the defendant's failure to comply with court orders, including failing to appear for a deposition and not responding to written discovery requests.

The court has found that the defendant has failed to comply with the court's orders and has granted the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions. As a result, the defendant's answer to the complaint and cross-complaint are struck, and the cross-complaint is dismissed.

The court has also imposed monetary sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $3,040.00, which is in addition to the $500 in monetary sanctions previously ordered. The court has found that the defendant's failure to comply with the court's orders has caused prejudice to the plaintiff and has deemed the imposition of monetary sanctions to be moot due to the granting of terminating sanctions.

The plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of the court's ruling and to file a proof of service of such.
