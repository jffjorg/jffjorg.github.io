 Case Number:  23STCP02565    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2023    Dept:  85 
 
John Doe v. Office of
Administrative Hearings et al, 23STCP02565


 
Tentative decision on motion
to strike: mostly denied



            
 
            Real
Party-in-Interest Los Angeles Community College District (“District”),
erroneously sued as Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees
(“Board”), moves to strike portions of John Doe’s (“Doe”) First Amended Petition
(“FAP”).
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply,[1] and
renders the following tentative decision. 
            
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
First Amended Petition
            Petitioner
Doe commenced this action on July 21, 2023. 
The operative pleading is the FAP filed on October 4, 2023, against
Respondent State of California Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) and Real
Party-in-Interest District, alleging a cause of action for administrative
mandamus.  The FAP alleges in pertinent
part as follows.
            At
all relevant times, Doe was an employee of Los Angeles City College
(“LACC”).  FAP at ¶1.  The pertinent issues under CCP section 1094.5
are whether the OAH proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a fair
trial, and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.  FAP at ¶9.
 
            a.
Board Misconduct and Adjudication Policies
            Board
Rules, Chapter XV, section 15001 (“Chapter XV”) was last amended March 9,
2016.  FAP at ¶10.  It states that the District’s policy is to provide
a safe educational, employment and business environment free from Prohibited
Discrimination, Unlawful Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct, as defined in the
Administrative Regulations associated with Board Rules.  FAP at ¶10. 
Section 15001(C) empowers the Office for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
(“ODEI”) to investigate all complaints, empowers the site’s Title IX
Coordinator to implement temporary sanctions, and empowers the College
President or a Deputy Chancellor at the Educational Services Center (“ESC”) to
implement permanent sanctions.  FAP at ¶11.
            District
Administrative Regulation C-14 (“Reg. C-14”) defines the terms “Gender-based Harassment,”
“Prohibited Discrimination,” “Retaliation,” “Sexual Harassment,” and “Sexual
Misconduct.”  FAP at ¶¶ 12-16.
            As
a recipient of federal funds, LACC is bound by Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”) and its regulations.  FAP at ¶17. 
LACC asserts that its grievance procedures and Reg. C-14 procedures for sexual
harassment and related offenses comply with Title IX and Education Code (“Educ.
Code”) section 67386.  FAP at ¶18.
            The
ODEI Director receives Title IX complaints and assigns each case to a
Compliance Officer.  FAP at ¶¶ 19-20.  The Compliance Officer investigates and
refers the matter to the Title IX Coordinator, who oversees the processing of
all Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct cases.  FAP at ¶¶ 20-21. 
            Reg.
C-14 requires a Compliance Officer to be an impartial resource, factfinder, and
investigator and not an advocate for any party.   FAP at ¶22. 
A Compliance Officer must apply the same impartial fact-finding and
investigation skills to investigations and reports of alleged Title IX
violations as other investigations.  FAP
at ¶22.  This dual or triple role of one
person acting as investigator, prosecutor, and judge creates a conflict that
deprives complainants and respondents of an adequate, reliable, and impartial
investigation.  FAP at ¶23.  The court in Doe v. Allee (2019) (“Allee”),
30 Cal.App.5th 1036, 1069, found that arrangement unlawful in California.  FAP at ¶23.
            Under
Reg. C-14(VII)(C), complaints not involving Sexual Misconduct must be filed
within one year of the date that “the Reporting Individual and/or Alleged
Victim knew or reasonably should have known” the facts underlying the
complaint.  FAP at ¶24.  Sexual Misconduct complaints must be filed
within 180 days of the alleged discrimination unless the OCR extends the
deadline for good cause.  FAP at ¶25.  Under Reg. C-14(VII)(C), an investigator must
complete the investigation within 60 calendar days unless good cause exists for
extending the time, in which case all parties must be kept informed.  FAP at ¶26.
            The
investigator meets with the parties separately, gathers evidence, and determines
the relevance of witnesses and other evidence. 
FAP at ¶¶ 27-28.  Both parties
must have an equal opportunity to meet with the investigator, submit
information and evidence, and identify witnesses.  FAP at ¶29.
            LACC
has no evidence that the Title IX investigator and adjudicator presiding over
Doe’s case was impartial or unbiased.  FAP
at ¶30.  LACC provided no live
evidentiary hearing for Doe to cross-examine the complainant and adverse
witnesses so that an independent, neutral adjudicator can evaluate party and
witness credibility before making factual findings.  FAP at ¶31.
            Reg.
C-14(VIII)(D) requires the Compliance Officer to submit a report on each
completed investigation to the college president or ESC Deputy Chancellor.  FAP at ¶33. 
The college president sends the accused and alleged victim a summary of
the report, informs them of and provides them with an opportunity to make an
oral statement, and hears the oral statements. 
FAP at ¶¶ 34-35.  
            The
president then determines if the accused committed the alleged acts, and he sends
a written decision on the complaint to the alleged victim and accused.  FAP at ¶¶ 33, 35.  In cases involving allegations of Sexual
Harassment, this written decision must be within 60 days of when the
investigation began.  FAP at ¶36.  Under Reg. C-14(XI)(C), the decision must
include specific language that a copy of the written decision will be placed in
the accused’s personnel file in a sealed envelope.  FAP at ¶37. 
The accused has the right to submit a response, which will also be added
to the file.  FAP at ¶37.
            Under
Reg. C-14(XI)(B), a complainant and respondent have an equal opportunity to
appeal the written decision and sanctions thereunder within 15 days of the
written decision.  FAP at ¶38.  The Board shall review the written appeal.  FAP at ¶39. 
If the Board does not act on the appeal within 45 days, the written
decision is final.  FAP at ¶39.  
            Reg.
C-14(XII)(A) entitles the accused to due process rights defined by law, Board
rules, the Personnel Commission, Student Discipline Policy and Procedures, and
any applicable collective bargaining agreement or Memoranda of
Understanding.  FAP at ¶40.
 
            b.
District Programs
            Extended
Opportunity Programs & Services (“EOPS”) is a state-funded program to
support students who are poor and have fewer educational opportunities.  FAP at ¶41. 

            In
2014, Senate Bill 1023 authorized the California Community Colleges
Chancellor’s Office to fund up to ten community college districts to support
the postsecondary education of current and former foster youth.  FAP at ¶42. 
Cooperating Agencies Foster Youth Educational Support (“CAFYES”), later
renamed NextUp, provides assistance to college-level foster youth.  FAP at ¶42. 
CAFYES/NextUp expands upon the services provided through EOPS and serves
a significant governmental and public interest. 
FAP at ¶43.  Various programs and
methods identify pre-qualified LACC students for recruitment to
CAFYES/NextUp.  FAP at ¶44.  LACC receives funding for identifying and
recruiting additional students to the CAFYES/NextUp program.  FAP at ¶45.
            
            c.
Doe’s Background
            Doe
is a first-generation immigrant whose mother brought him to the country in the
trunk of her car.  FAP at ¶49.  Doe focused on improving himself and
eventually received a PhD in Educational Leadership in 2009.  FAP at ¶54. 
He chose to dedicate his life to helping foster youth through non-profit
organizations and educational rights advocacy. 
FAP at ¶¶ 55-56.
            In
2016, he became an LACC CAFYES/NextUp Counselor/Coordinator.  FAP at ¶¶ 57-58.  He was the first to arrive at the office and
the last to leave.  FAP at ¶59.  He received 100% positive student evaluations
in 2016 and 99% in 2017.  FAP at ¶60.  His positive evaluations earned him a third-
and fourth-year contract.  FAP at ¶62.  He used CAYFES’ gift card incentive program
without impropriety or controversy, and the EOPS accountant kept records of the
gift cards he awarded.  FAP at ¶¶64-67.
            In
2018, Doe reported to LACC’s former Community Services Manager that the
EOPS/CAFYES Program was being mismanaged and its funding misappropriated.  FAP at ¶68. 
Soon after, six former student workers and students falsely accused Doe of
verbal and physical sexual harassment, discrimination based on sex or gender,
harassment based on race or ethnicity, and retaliation.  FAP at ¶69.
 
            d.
The Complaints
            (1).
The A.B. Complaint
            Part-time
Student Worker “A.B.” appears to be the start of the allegations.  FAP at ¶70. 
In March 2017, Doe hired A.B. as a CAFYES/NextUp student worker along
with “K.S.,” “J.E.,” and “A.P.”  FAP at ¶71.  A.B. was unproductive, inefficient, and had a
negative attitude in her capacity as a student worker.  FAP at ¶72. 
She arrived late at work and complained when asked to do her job.  FAP at ¶72. 
Her rude behavior when Doe tried giving her instruction made her
difficult to supervise.  FAP at ¶73.
            In
April or May 2017, Doe informed A.B. that he intended to fire her for poor
performance.  FAP at ¶74.  In May 2017, A.B. reported Doe to LACC Dean
and Title IX Coordinator Jeanette Magee for purportedly inappropriate sexual
communication and use of profanity.  FAP
at ¶75.  
            On
June 1, A.B. filed a formal complaint for race, sex, and gender discrimination
(“A.B. Complaint”).  FAP at ¶77.  She listed Guardian Scholars workers “L.B.”
and “L.S.” and Guardian Scholars student “C.A.” as witnesses, but not student
worker “J.A.”  FAP at ¶¶ 77-78.  
            The
A.B. Complaint falsely accused Doe of making her work over 25 hours without
pay.  FAP at ¶79.  All students clock in and out with EOPS, and
Doe was not involved in that system or LACC payroll.  FAP at ¶79.
            On
June 28, eight days after A.B. graduated, Compliance Officer Victoria Friedman
(“Friedman”) provided Doe notice of the A.B. Complaint.  FAP at ¶¶ 80-81.  This notice informed Doe that A.B. alleged
unlawful discrimination based on race, sex, and gender, plus multiple occasions
of racially charged or sexually suggestive comments to her, but the notice provided
no details.  FAP at ¶82.  Without knowledge of its allegations, Doe’s
July 12 response assumed the A.B. Complaint was based on his decision to
terminate A.B. as a student worker.  FAP
at ¶83.
            While
the LACC interviewed A.B. and Doe in August 2017, LACC staff member Veronica
Garcia (“Garcia”) recruited students to testify against Doe.  FAP at ¶85. 
LACC did not act on the A.B. Complaint until June 2018.  FAP at ¶86.
 
            (2).
The I.N. Complaint
            “I.N.”
was recruited to the CAFYES/NextUp program on April 28, 2016, four months
before Doe was hired at LACC.  FAP at ¶87.  They had infrequent contact and no apparent
issues through September 28, 2017.  FAP
at ¶88.
            On
November 9, 2017, I.N. submitted a complaint (“I.N. Complaint”) alleging unsolicited
unprofessional behavior by Doe during September 28 to November 8, 2017.  FAP at ¶89. 
I.N. listed Garcia, J.A., Guardian Scholars program assistant Myra
Infante, and Guardian Scholars worker “B.C.” as witnesses.  FAP at ¶89.
            Beginning
late September 2017, Doe repeatedly requested that I.N. provide a State of
California Foster Care Verification form. 
FAP at ¶90.  CAFYES/NextUP
requires these forms.  FAP at ¶90.  Nevertheless, the I.N. Complaint alleged this
made her feel like the CAFYES/NextUP resources she used were being
threatened.  FAP at ¶90.  I.N. also complained that on October 12,
2017, Doe made her attend a workshop before she could collect a $100 gift card
already awarded to her based on academic achievement.  FAP at ¶91. 
Also on October 12, Doe had jokingly asked I.N. in front of her peers if
she had been “smoking weed.”  FAP at ¶91.
            LACC
did not initially act on the I.N. Complaint. 
FAP at ¶92.  In Spring 2018, I.N.
transferred out of LACC.  FAP at ¶92.
 
            (3).
The Doe Complaint
            On
January 11, 2018, Doe informed several LACC directors and officers that
CAFYES/NextUp did not comply with the Chancellor’s Office’s rules and
regulations.  FAP at ¶93.  Students in the program were not receiving
services to which they were entitled by law. 
FAP at ¶93.  He also noted that
despite the current CAFYES/NextUp budget, LACC failed to hire the additional
staff the program needed.  FAP at ¶94.  Doe repeated these concerns multiple times in
January 2018.  FAP at ¶¶ 95-96.
            On
January 22, 2018, LACC Dean of Student Services Drew Yamanishi (“Yamanishi”) sought
to add a memorandum to Doe’s personnel file with the District Human
Resources.  FAP at ¶97.  These efforts failed.  FAP at ¶97.
            On
January 25, 2018, Doe filed a grievance (“Doe Complaint”) against Yamanishi and
EOPS/CAFYES/NextUp Counselor Araksia Dovlatyan (“Dovlatyan”).  FAP at ¶98. 
He alleged that Dovlatyan had invited him to present the CAFYES/NextUp
program at a “Counselor to College Summit” on January 26, 2018.  FAP at ¶98. 
Yamanishi and Dovlatyan then retracted the invitation to compel Doe to
attend a seven-hour customer service workshop he had already completed.  FAP at ¶98. 
This decision was discrimination, retaliation, and unfair.  FAP at ¶98.
            Interim
President Mary Gallagher did not address the Doe Complaint or address his
concerns about compliance with CAFYES/NextUp. 
FAP at ¶99.  She instead
reassigned Doe to split his time between CAFYES/NextUp Counselor and EOPS
Counselor.  FAP at ¶99.  His duties as a CAFYES/NextUp Coordinator
were terminated and transferred to Dovlatyan. 
FAP at ¶¶ 99-100.
            On
March 20, 2018 the LACC investigator interviewed Boris Lopez (“Lopez”).  FAP at ¶101. 
Lopez was a member of Doe’s evaluation and tenure committees in December
2016 and November 2017.  FAP at ¶101.  This was the first activity in LACC’s
investigation of the A.B. and I.N. Complaints against Doe since November 2017.  FAP at ¶101.
 
            e.
The LACC Investigation and OAH Hearing
            On
June 20, 2018, Doe received a Notice of Investigation.  FAP at ¶102. 
On June 25, he received notice that he was being placed on paid
administrative leave.  FAP at ¶102.
            Case
law such as Allee, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at 1069-70, holds that the
Title IX investigation model used by LACC is fundamentally flawed and lacking
in due process.  FAP at ¶103.  Friedman was the sole investigator and fact
finder for the complaints against Doe.  FAP
at ¶105.  Garcia was interviewed over
three days as the key witness, whereas Friedman only interviewed one of the 13
witnesses Doe said had specific knowledge about the allegations.  FAP at ¶¶ 105-106.  Friedman also chose not to consider the Doe
Complaint’s allegations of retaliation for protected whistleblower activities.  FAP at ¶107. 
Her investigation lasted 568 days, well over the 60-day limit for such
investigations.  FAP at ¶108. 
            Doe
denies all the allegations in the complaints against him.  FAP at ¶109. 
He did not engage in sexually inappropriate, discriminatory, and
intimidating conduct towards any LACC student, student worker, or staff.  FAP at ¶109.
            After
its investigation, LACC sought to terminate Doe’s employment.  FAP at ¶110. 
On May 10, 2021, LACC served him with a Notice of Intent to Dismiss or
Penalize and a Statement Of Charges.  FAP
at ¶111.  Educ. Code section 87675
prohibited the District from presenting testimony or evidence related to
matters that occurred over four years before the charges were filed.  FAP at ¶112.
             An administrative law judge (“ALJ”) heard the
matter in 2022.  FAP at ¶113.  On June 23, 2023, the OAH notified Doe that
the ALJ decided to uphold the District’s decision to terminate his
employment.  FAP at ¶114.  Doe has now exhausted his administrative
remedies.  FAP at ¶115.
            The
OAH decision was a “rubber stamp” of the District’s invalid actions and
decision.  FAP at ¶¶ 117-118.  Its proceedings were an extended version of
the LACC’s one-sided investigation.  FAP
at ¶119.  It included the cross-examination
of new witnesses who interacted with the parties daily and never even heard
rumors of Doe committing misconduct.  FAP
at ¶119.  The OAH committed an abuse of
discretion by ratifying District actions without rational basis.  FAP at ¶120.
            Doe
has a vested right under Title IX to not be deprived of his right to employment
via an administrative process that was not fair, impartial, reliable, and
equitable.  FAP at ¶122.  The court must therefore exercise its
independent judgment and find an abuse of discretion if the findings are not
supported by the weight of the evidence. 
FAP at ¶123.  Doe’s success in
this action will result in a substantial non-pecuniary benefit to those subject
to Title IX disciplinary processes.  FAP
at ¶128.
 
            f.
Prayer for Relief
            Doe
seeks an order compelling the OAH to set aside its decision, an alternative
writ of mandate compelling it to set aside the OAH Decision or show cause as to
why a peremptory writ of mandate to that effect should not issue, a peremptory
writ of mandate, and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  FAP Prayer for Relief at ¶¶ 1-5.
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On July 27, 2023, Doe
served the Board with the Petition and Summons.
            On October 3, 2023, Doe
electronically served the Board with the FAP.
            On October 4, 2023, Doe
filed the FAP.
            On November 2, 2023, the
District filed an Answer to the FAP.
            On December 7, 2023, the
District withdrew a demurrer to the FAP at the court’s suggestion. 
 
            B. Applicable
Law
            Any party, within the time allowed
to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part thereof.  CCP
§435(b)(1).  CCP section 436 permits the
court to strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter, as well as any
part of any pleading not in conformity with an order of the court.  Irrelevant matters are defined as those allegations
that are not essential to the statement of a claim or that are neither
pertinent nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim.  CCP §431.10(b).
            The notice of motion to strike shall
be given within the time allowed to plead, and if a demurrer is interposed,
concurrently therewith, and shall be noticed for hearing and heard at the same
time as the demurrer.  CRC 3.1322(b).  The notice of motion to strike a portion of a
pleading shall quote in full the portions sought to be stricken except where
the motion is to strike an entire paragraph, cause of action, count or defense.  CRC 3.1322(a).
            A motion to strike can serve an important
function of deleting matter for which a defendant may not be able to demur but
for which the defendant should not have to suffer discovery and navigate the
thicket of proceedings for summary adjudication.  Ph II, Inc. v. Superior Court  (1995) 33 Cal.app.4th 1680,
1682-83.  The grounds for a motion to
strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter
of which the court is required to take judicial notice.  CCP §437(a). 
Matter to be judicially noticed shall be specified in the notice of
motion.  CCP §437(b).  When the defect which justifies striking a
complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave to amend.  Perlman v. Municipal Court, (1979) 99
Cal. App. 3d 568, 575.

 
            C. Analysis
            The
District moves to strike portions of the FAP that discuss the District’s investigation
and adjudication policies (FAP at p. 3:16-17, ¶¶ 10-40, 103), Title IX
protections (FAP at ¶¶ 122, 128), District programs (FAP at ¶¶ 41-48), Doe’s
personal history (FAP at ¶¶ 49-69), and the history of the complaints and the
LACC’s investigation (FAP at ¶¶ 70-101). 
Mot. at 2-3.
 
            1.
Meet and Confer
            The
District presents evidence that, on October 26, 2023, it requested via letter
that Doe resolve the issues outlined in the motion to strike.  Travis Decl., ¶2, Ex. 1.  The parties met on October 30, 2023 to
discuss the issues in this letter but could not resolve them.  Travis Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.  The District fulfilled all meet and confer
requirements.
 
            2.
Merits
            a.
Outdated District Policies
            The
District cites the FAP’s discussion of the District’s “Misconduct and
Adjudication Policies”, which allege the process for investigating and
disciplining LACC students and staff after a complaint.  FAP at ¶¶ 10-40.  The District asserts that the court should
strike the entire section because “former” or “legacy” policies are not
relevant to this matter.  Mem. at 6;
Reply at 2.  It argues that the FAP
admits that these policies were amended in 2016 and are illegal, citing Doe
v. Allee, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at 1036, a decision
decided three years after the policies were amended.  FAP at ¶¶ 10, 23.  Mem at 7.
            The
District misinterprets the FAP’s allegations. 
The FAP asserts that Chapter XV was “last” amended in March 2016, meaning
that the current version -- presumably the version that was applied to Doe --
is illegal.  The FAP does not cite
outdated District policies on discrimination and harassment.  
 
            b.
Relevance of District Title IX Violations
            The
FAP alleges that Doe has a vested right under Title IX not to be deprived of
his right to employment via an administrative process that was not fair,
impartial, reliable, and equitable.  FAP
at ¶122.  As a recipient of federal
funds, LACC is bound by Title IX and its regulations.  FAP at ¶17. 
Doe’s success in this action will result in a substantial non-pecuniary
benefit to those subject to Title IX disciplinary processes.  FAP at ¶128.
            The
District argues that Doe’s claim lies in administrative mandamus and does not
make a substantive claim of a Title IX violation.  Therefore, the portions of the FAP that cite
Title IX (¶¶ 122, 128) should be stricken as irrelevant.  Mem. at 7. 

            Doe
responds that the FAP seeks relief from the OAH Decision, not the District’s
decisions.  Opp. at 6.  The FAP cites CCP section 1094.5 to identify
the pertinent issues to be whether OAH proceeded without jurisdiction, conducted
an unfair trial, or committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion.  FAP at ¶9. 

            An
abuse of discretion is established if the OAH has not proceeded in the manner
required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings
are not supported by the evidence.  CCP
§1094.5(c).  Doe has alleged that both the
LACC’s investigation and the ALJ’s proceedings violated the law for various
reasons.  For example, LACC extensively
interviewed its main witness and excluded most of the witnesses Doe
identified.  FAP at ¶¶ 105-06.  The ALJ’s hearing was an extended version of
this one-sided investigation but with new witnesses.  FAP at ¶119. 
The FAP concludes that the OAH committed an abuse of discretion because
its hearing did not comply with the procedural requirements of Title IX and due
process.  FAP at ¶122.
            The
FAP’s allegations that the District violated Title IX are relevant to judicial review
of the OAH decision.
             
            c.
District Programs, Doe’s Background, and False Claims Against Him
            The
District’s motion divides the FAP’s assertions of fact into three groups: (a) the
A.B. and I.N. Complaints against Doe and the LACC’s investigation into them (FAP
at ¶¶ 70-101); (b) background information on LACC programs (FAP at ¶¶ 41-48);
and (c) Doe’s personal background (FAP at ¶¶ 49-69).  The District argues that none are relevant to
a challenge of the OAH decision and the evidence presented in the
administrative proceeding.  Mem. at
7-8.  
            Paragraphs
70-101 outline the A.B. and I.N. Complaints underlying Doe’s termination (FAP
at ¶¶ 71-92), as well as the Doe Complaint that he alleges the LACC ignored
(FAP at ¶¶ 93-100).  Doe contests his
termination in part because he denies the wrongdoing outlined in the A.B. and
I.N. Complaints.  FAP at ¶109.  The FAP asks the court to review the evidence
to determine whether it supports the OAH decision’s factual findings on these complaints.  FAP at ¶123.
            The
District asserts that these allegations are irrelevant because the court’s
decision must be based on the administrative record.  Mem. at 8; Reply at 2.  That fact is not in dispute, but it is not significant
for the current issue.  The FAP may
allege what Doe considers to be the true facts, which the OAH erred in not finding.  That is the purpose served by (a) the complaints
against and by Doe and the LACC’s investigation into them (FAP at ¶¶ 70-101)
and (b) background information on LACC programs (FAP at ¶¶ 41-48).  The inclusion of these allegations was
proper.
            The
allegations concerning Doe’s background do not serve this purpose.  They detail Doe’s rise from an immigrant in
the trunk of his mother’s car to a CAFYES/NextUp Counselor/Coordinator who
inspires others.  FAP at ¶¶ 49-67.  These facts do not affect the merits of the complaints
against and by Doe or the lawfulness of the OAH decision.  Paragraphs 49-69 are stricken as irrelevant.
 
            d.
Time-Barred
            A
petition for administrative writ of mandate shall be filed not later than 90 days
following the date on which the decision becomes final.  CCP §1094.6(b).  
            The
District asserts that the allegations of District policies (¶¶ 10-40) and Title
IX (¶¶ 122, and 128) are irrelevant because mandamus actions based on District misconduct
or Title IX violations are time-barred.  Mem.
at 8.  The FAP asserts that Doe received
a Notice of Investigation on June 20, 2018. 
FAP at ¶102.  It alleges the
investigation took 568 days.  FAP at
¶108.  This means the investigation ended
on January 9, 2020.  Mem. at 8.  The statute of limitations for a mandamus
action expired 90 days later, on April 9, 2020, and Doe did not file the
Petition until July 21, 2023.
            The
District’s suggestion of untimeliness is based on the incorrect belief that the
FAP seeks review of the District’s decisions. 
Doe was required to exhaust his administrative remedies and he did not
