            [1] Smith
seeks judicial notice of the Board’s July 2023 “Guidelines for Prescribing
Controlled Substances for Pain”.  RJN Ex.
A.  While normally Exhibit A would be
subject to judicial notice, it must also be relevant.  As will be discussed post, the current
standard of care is not relevant to a material issue in this case.   The request is denied.  


[2]
As used in the Medical Practice Act, the Division of Medical Quality refers to
the Board.  B&P Code §2002.


            [3]
Certain excerpts of the administrative record repeat page numbers.  To remedy this, the court has renumbered the
pages to the July 22, 2022 Board hearing transcript (AR 17835-904) and the
briefs for Smith’s 2020 petition for a writ of mandate (AR 17905-54).  


[4]
Despite the fact that Smith raises only procedural issues, the Joint Appendix
consists of five binders.  This is principally
due to the parties use of block citing to evidence.  Both counsel are admonished to pin cite, not block
cite, in future mandamus cases so that the Joint Appendix will consist of one
binder.


[5] Smith adds that the Board’s counsel urged
that Smith’s probation be nunc pro tunc. 
AR 15937.  Nunc pro tunc
means “now for then” or “[h]aving retroactive legal effect through a court’s
inherent power…”  Black’s Law Dictionary
1097 (7th ed. 1999).  But the Board is a
creature of statute and has no inherent power; its power is derived solely from
statutory authority.  Pet. Op. Br. at 13,
n. 1.


[6] Smith lobbied for the no further
disciplinary action alternative.  After
the 2020 Decision was set aside, Smith argued to the Board that it should take
no further action and that a retrial of the original Accusation would be unfair
and unduly expend the resources of Smith and the Board.  AR 17613. 
 


[7] The
Board argues that the hearing falls under its statutory authority to modify the
2020 Decision’s penalty.  See Govt. Code §11517(c)(2)(B).  Opp. at 14. 
Smith replies that Govt. Code section
11517(c)(2)(B) applies to an agency’s reduction or mitigation of a proposed
penalty and the 2022 Decision did not reduce a proposed penalty.  Reply at 5. 
Smith is wrong.  The 2022 Decision
reduced the term of probation from seven years to five.  Compare AR 17719 and 17821.  
Smith also argues
that Govt. Code section
11517(c)(2)(B) has a 100-day time limit on reducing the proposed penalty, the final
factual determinations were made in the 2020 Decision and the 100-day time
limit has expired.  Reply at 5.  The court agrees.  Govt. Code section 11517(c)(2)(B) does not apply to the Board’s 2022 Decision.


[8] The
parties dispute whether the July 22, 2022 Board hearing was a reconsideration
of the 2020 Decision.  Pet. Op. Br. at 15; Opp. at 15.  Under
this alternative analysis, it was.  Smith
argues that the reconsideration was untimely under Govt. Code section 11521(a),
which ends the Board’s power to reconsider after the delivery or mailing of the
decision to a licensee.  Pet. Op. Br. at
14.  The problem with Smith’s argument is
that there was no Board’s decision to mail. 
The Board’s 2020 Decision had been vacated and therefore no clock for
reconsideration had started.  
Moreover, Smith
admits that the Board can lengthen the 30-day period for reconsideration up to
another 30 days, provided that the extension is granted within the first 30-day
period.  The Board complied with the writ
by setting aside the 2020 Decision on June 9, 2022.  The Board’s notice that it would reconsider
was issued on June 22, 2022, and the reconsideration hearing took place on July
22, 2022.  AR 17835, 17839.  The June 22 notice was made within 30 days of
the June 9 setting aside of the 2020 Decision and the July 22, 2022 hearing was
within the 30 day period extended by the June 22 notice.

It is for this reason that the court has denied judicial notice of the Medical
Board’s 2023 Guidelines.
