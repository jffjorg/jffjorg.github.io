            [1] Defendants
failed to lodge courtesy copies of their opposition, and Plaintiffs failed to
lodge a courtesy copy of their reply and opposition to claims of exemption, both
in violation of the Presiding Judge’s First Amended General Order Re: Mandatory
Electronic Filing.  Their counsel is
admonished to provide courtesy copies in all future filings.


            [2] Defendants
request judicial notice of (1) the entity formation documents for Amaxi
Nutrition (RJN Ex. A); (2) Amaxi Nutrition’s Statement of Information (“SOI”)
filed August 20, 2014 (RJN Ex. B); (3) Amaxi Nutrition’s SOI filed September
30, 2018 (RJN Ex. C); (4) the entity formation documents for Amaxi Regional
(RJN Ex. D); (5) Amaxi Regional’s SOI filed June 27, 2016 (RJN Ex. E); (6) Amaxi
Regional’s SOI filed August 17, 2018 (RJN Ex. F); (7) the entity formation
documents for Milk (RJN Ex. G); (8) Milk’s SOI filed July 9, 2015 (RJN Ex. H);
and (9) the entity formation documents for Amaxi WY on file with Wyoming’s
Secretary of State, dated July 29, 2021 (RJN Ex. I).  Exhibits A-H are on file with the California
Secretary of State and the requests are granted.  Evid. Code §452(c).
            Although Plaintiffs cite the FAC in their moving papers (Mem.
at 5), it is unverified and cannot be relied on as evidence.  CCP §446(a).


[3] All
three of Defendants’ written objections to Plaintiffs’ evidence are sustained.


            [4] The
SAC is not in the court’s electronic case file.


            [5]
Plaintiffs request judicial notice of the exhibits attached to their reply
declaration.  Shikai Decl., ¶¶ 5-6, Exs.
M-N.  Plaintiffs failed to file a
separate document requesting judicial notice. 
See CRC 3.1113(l).  The
requests for judicial notice are denied, but the court may still consider the
exhibits as evidence.


            [6] Defendants’
notice of opposition purports to seek exemptions for Khun.  However, it only says it seeks to exempt all
of Khun’s property.  The opposition
memorandum also does not discuss exemptions. 
Exemption Opp. at 3.  Therefore,
the exemption issue is waived.
