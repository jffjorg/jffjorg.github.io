Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that Smith's request for judicial notice of the Board's July 2023 "Guidelines for Prescribing Controlled Substances for Pain" is denied. The judge finds that the current standard of care is not relevant to a material issue in this case. The judge also rules that the Board's 2022 Decision, which modified the 2020 Decision's penalty, was not untimely and did not violate Govt. Code section 11517(c)(2)(B). The judge notes that the Board's 2023 Guidelines are not relevant to the case and that the Board's reconsideration of the 2020 Decision was proper. The judge also admonishes counsel to use pin citing instead of block citing in future mandamus cases.
