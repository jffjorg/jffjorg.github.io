Qiu v. Amaxi Nutrition Products Inc. et al., 22STCV35314
 
 
Tentative decision on applications
for right to attach orders against (1) Amaxi Nutrition Products, Inc., a
Wyoming Corporation: denied; (2) Andrew Khun: denied




 
            
            
Plaintiffs Jing Du (“Du”), Yu Bai (“Bai”), and Ye Qiu
(“Qiu”) apply for right to attach orders against Defendants Amaxi Nutrition
Products, Inc, a Wyoming corporation (“Amaxi WY”), and Andrew Khun (“Khun”) in
the amount of $1,575,000. 
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, reply, and Plaintiffs’
opposition to claims of exemption[1]
and renders the following tentative decision.
 
            A. Statement of the Case
            1.
Complaint
            Plaintiffs
Du, Bai, and Qiu filed their Complaint on January 7, 2022.  The operative pleading is the First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) filed on March 24, 2023 against Defendants Amaxi Nutrition
Products, Inc, a suspended California corporation (“Amaxi Nutrition”), Amaxi
Regional Center, LLC, a suspended California company (“Amaxi Regional”), USA
Milk Company (“Milk”) (collectively, “CA Entities”), Amaxi WY (collectively,
with CA Entities “Entities”); Khun; Jonathan Lau (“Jonathan”), Margaret Lau (“Margaret”),
and heirs and devisees of Macie Wang (“Wang”). 

The unverified FAC alleges claims for Plaintiffs Du and Bai
of fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract, and a
claim for Qiu of breach of contract.  The
FAC alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            Defendants
and Wang devised a scheme to obtain money from investors seeking to apply for
the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program (“EB-5”). 
EB-5 allows foreign investors and their families to apply for a Green
Card after making required investments in a U.S. commercial enterprise that
plans to create or preserve ten permanent full-time jobs for qualified U.S.
workers.
            Wang,
her brother Khun, Jonathan, and Margaret created the Entities to defraud the
investors seeking to apply for EB-5.  Amaxi
WY is the successor-in-interest to Amaxi Nutrition.  Khun is Amaxi WY’s principal.  Wang and Defendants solicited Plaintiffs to
invest in the Entities.
            In
2014, Defendants approached Du and Bai to convince them that Amaxi Nutrition
was a suitable investment for EB-5.  They
said Amaxi Nutrition was organized to develop and manufacture brands of baby
formula and other nutrition products.  Du
and Bai would pay a $1,000,000 offering price for 100,000 preferred shares,
plus $45,000 in expenses.  Wang, Jonathan,
and other Defendants also promised Du and Bai they would receive either a
return of their full investment, one or more parcels of real estate of equal
value, or an ownership interest in the business within five years of the
investment.  
            In
reliance on these representations, Bai signed a private placement memorandum (“PPM”)
with Amaxi Nutrition in 2014.  Du and Bai
gave $1,045,000 to Wang, Jonathan, and other Defendants.  Bai received a stock certificate signed by Jonathan
and dated September 23, 2014.
            In
2016, Defendants approached Qiu to convince her that Amaxi Regional and Milk were
suitable investments for EB-5.  They said
that Amaxi Regional and Milk were organized to develop and manufacture brands
of baby formula and other nutrition products. 
They advised Qiu to pay $500,000 for 0.5 shares of stock in Amaxi
Regional and Milk, plus a $30,000 investment fee. Wang and other Defendants
also promised Qiu that she would receive either a return of their full
investment, one or more parcels of real estate of equal value, or an ownership
interest in the business within five years of the investment.
            In
reliance on these representations, Qiu signed a subscription agreement with
Amaxi Regional and Milk (“Milk Subscription Agreement”) in June 2016 and paid
$530,000.
            In
2019, Qiu sent an inquiry to Wang and Defendants as to the status of her
investment.  On August 26, 2019, Wang,
Amaxi Regional, and Milk indicated that they would refund her investment on or
around the beginning of 2020.  
            In
the beginning of 2020, Du, Bai, and Qiu all asked Defendants about the status
of their investments.  Wang, Khun, and
the Entities confirmed the amount each had invested and reassured them those
amounts would be repaid.
            In
September 2022, Khun met with Bai regarding the Plaintiffs’ investments.  He acknowledged the Entities owed Plaintiffs
a refund of their investments.  He
promised to refund them by mortgaging his companies’ properties.  He provided written documents of the
properties he planned to mortgage to provide the funds needed to repay
Plaintiffs.  To date, none of the
Plaintiffs have received a refund.
            Plaintiffs
seek damages of at least $1,575,000, special damages, pre-judgment interest,
punitive and exemplary damages, and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
 
            2.
Course of Proceedings
            On
November 14, 2022, Plaintiffs served Margaret with the Complaint and Summons.
            On
November 15, 2022, Plaintiffs served Khun with the Complaint and Summons.
            On
November 30, 2022, Plaintiffs served Amaxi WY with the Complaint and Summons by
substitute service, effective December 10, 2022.  
            On
March 24, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the FAC and served it on Khun, Margaret, and
Amaxi WY by electronic mail.
            On
May 16, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiffs’ request, Department 53 (Hon. Robert
Broadbelt) dismissed the FAC without prejudice against the heirs and devisees
of Wang, unless otherwise a named Defendant.
            On
October 12, 2023, Department 53 granted Plaintiffs’ ex parte application
to serve the FAC and Summons on Jonathan by publication in the Los Angeles
Times and on the Entities by personal service on the California Secretary
of State.
            On
October 25, 2023, Department 53 sustained Khun, Margaret, and Amaxi WY’s demurrer
to Qiu’s breach of contract cause of action, sustained Khun and Margaret’s
demurrer to Bai and Du’s breach of contract cause of action, and overruled the
demurrers as to all other causes of action. 
It also granted a motion to strike the prayer for attorney’s fees.  The court granted 20 days’ leave to file a
Second Amended Complaint ("SAC”).
 
            B.
Applicable Law
            Attachment
is a prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the
defendant’s assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the
outcome of the trial of the action.  See
Whitehouse v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et
seq.) that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v.
Appellate Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536. 
See Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176
Cal.App.3d 1108, 1115.  As the attachment
statutes are purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly
construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner,
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 882.




            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is
“readily ascertainable” where the amount due may be clearly ascertained from
the contract and calculated by evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated
is not determinative.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
537, 540-41 (attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for
lease of commercial equipment).
            All
property within California of a corporation, association, or partnership is
subject to attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson,
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            The
plaintiff may apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the
order and serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the
application, and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
            The
notice of the application and the application may be made on Judicial Council
forms (Optional Forms AT-105, 115).  The
application must be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.  CCP §484.030.  
            Where
the defendant is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property
which is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil
Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient. 
CCP §484.020(e).  Where the
defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to
“all property of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  A specific description of
property is not required for corporations and partnerships as they generally
have no exempt property.  Bank of
America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
            A
defendant who opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of
opposition and supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not
later than five court days prior to the date set for hearing.  CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of opposition may be made on a
Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155). 

            The
plaintiff may file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for
the hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
            At
the hearing, the court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right
to attach order and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is
exempt from attachment.  The defendant
may appear the hearing.  CCP
§484.050(h).  The court generally will
evaluate the attachment application based solely on the pleadings and
supporting affidavits without taking additional evidence.  Bank of America, supra, 207
Cal.App.3d at 273. A verified complaint may be used in lieu of or in addition
to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts. 
CCP §482.040.  The plaintiff has
the burden of proof, and the court is not required to accept as true any
affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See
Bank of America, supra, at 271, 273.



            The
court may issue a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff
shows all of the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is
one on which an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is sought for no purpose other than the
recovery on the subject claim (CCP §484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
            Except
in unlawful detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the
sum of (1) the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff,
and (2) any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and
any allowable attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110.  CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak
Construction, (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must be reduced by the sum of (1)
the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has in a money judgment against plaintiff,
(2) the amount claimed in a cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown
would be subject to attachment against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any
security interest held by the plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together
with the amount by which the acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the
security interest) have decreased that security interest’s value.  CCP §483.015(b).  A defendant claiming that the amount to be
secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative defense must
make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an attachment
against the plaintiff.
            Before
the issuance of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any
wrongful attachment by the plaintiff in the action.  CCP §489.210. 
The undertaking ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If the defendant objects, the court may
increase the amount of undertaking to the amount determined as the probable
recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP
§489.220.  The court also has inherent
authority to increase the amount of the undertaking sua sponte.  North Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior
Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.
 
            C. Statement of Facts[2]
            1.
Plaintiffs’ Evidence[3]
            a.
Bai
            Bai
and Du are married.  Bai Decl., ¶1.   In 2014, they sought to make the required
investments to become eligible to apply for a Green Card under EB-5.  Bai Decl., ¶2.  Wang, Khun, and Amaxi Nutrition represented
that an investment in Amaxi Nutrition would be suitable for EB-5.  Bai Decl., ¶2.  They asserted that Amaxi Nutrition was
organized to develop and manufacture brands of baby formula and other nutrition
products.  Bai Decl., ¶2.  Du and Bai would need to pay a $1,000,000
offering price for 100,000 preferred shares, plus $45,000 in expenses, for a
total of $1,045,000.  Bai Decl., ¶2. 
            Wang,
Khun, and Amaxi Nutrition also sent Bai a PPM listing the offering price as $10
per share.  Bai Decl., ¶3, Ex. I, p.
1.  The purchase price of the minimum
purchase of 100,000 shares was $1,000,000, plus $45,000 in offering
expenses.  Bai Decl., ¶3, Ex. I, pp. 1,
11.  
            Amaxi
Nutrition’s plan was to manufacture and sell infant, baby, toddler, children,
and adult nutritional supplements.  Bai

Khun as Amaxi Nutrition’s President and one of the managers who would run the
company.  Bai Decl., ¶3, Ex. I, p.
21.  It described Khun as a
results-driven and dedicated individual with wide-ranging experience in
planning and leading operations involving the food manufacturing
environment.  Bai Decl., ¶3, Ex. I, p.
21.  The PPM also promised that Du and
Bai would receive either a return of their full investment, one or more parcels
of real estate of equal value, or an ownership interest in the business within
five years of the investment.  Bai Decl.,
¶4, Ex. I.
            Bai

Decl., ¶5, Ex. I.  
 
            b.
Qiu
            In
2016, Qiu sought to make the required investments to become eligible to apply
for a Green Card under EB-5.  Qiu Decl.,
¶2.  She learned about such an investment
opportunity with Wang, Amaxi Regional, and Milk and had counsel contact them
for more information.  Qiu Decl., ¶2.
            Wang,
Amaxi Regional, and Milk represented that an investment in Amaxi Regional and
Milk would be suitable for EB-5.  Qiu
Decl., ¶2.  They provided documents to
show that Amaxi Regional and Milk were organized to develop and manufacture
brands of baby formula and other nutrition products.  Qiu Decl., ¶2.  Qiu would need to invest $500,000 for 0.5
shares of stock in the companies.  Qiu
Decl., ¶2.  She would also need to pay a
$30,000 management fee.  Qiu Decl., ¶2.
            The
PPM explained the objective was to finance the acquisition of one facility and
the ongoing operations of an existing facility at 10655 7th Street, Rancho
Cucamonga, California 91730 (“Facility”). 
Qiu Decl., ¶5, Ex. A.  The
offering price was $100 per share.  Qiu
Decl., ¶5, Ex. A, p.1.
            The
PPM also asserted that Khun held 10% of outstanding Milk shares and was its
current President.  Qiu Decl., ¶3, Ex. A,
p. 5.  It described Khun as a highly
successful manager with wide-ranging experience in planning and executing
business operations in the food manufacturing environment.  Qiu Decl., ¶3, Ex. A, p. 5.  
            Milk’s
September 2015 business plan (“Business Plan”) listed its purpose as the
manufacturing and sale of infant, baby, toddler, children, and adult
nutritional supplements.  Qiu Decl., ¶4,
Ex. B, p. 16.  It listed Khun as President
and 20% owner.  Qiu Decl., ¶4, Ex. B, p.
14.  It asserted he is skilled in
evaluating and implementing continuous process improvements to minimize waste
and reduce costs while maximizing quality and yield.  Qiu Decl., ¶4, Ex. B, p. 14.  The Business Plan was “Sponsored by” Amaxi
Regional.  Qiu Decl., ¶4, Ex. B.
            Qiu
visited the Facility in June 2016.  Qiu
Decl., ¶6.  To induce her investment, Wang,
Amaxi Regional, Milk, and other Defendants promised Qiu that she would receive
either a return of their full investment, one or more parcels of real estate of
equal value, or an ownership interest in the business within five years of the
investment.  Qiu Decl., ¶6.  
            In
June 2016, in reliance on Defendants’ representations, Qiu signed a Milk
Subscription Agreement and paid Wang, Khun, Milk, Amaxi Regional, and other
Defendants $530,000.  Qiu Decl., ¶7, Ex.
C.  The Milk Subscription Agreement provided
that Qiu agreed to purchase 0.5 shares of preferred stock at a price of $100
per share, in accordance with the terms of the PPM.  Qiu Decl., ¶7, Ex. C.  Wang signed as Amaxi Regional and Milk’s CEO.  Qiu Decl., ¶7, Ex. C.  
 
            c.
Demands for Refund
            In
the beginning of 2019, Qiu texted Wang that she had learned the EB-5 program was
terminated in May 2018.  Qiu Decl., ¶8,
Ex. D.  She said that Wang should have refunded
the investment from that day.  Qiu Decl.,
¶8, Ex. D.  Qiu asked Wang to refund her
money by February 2020, the end of the five-year timeframe Defendants had
originally promised.  Qiu Decl., ¶8, Ex.
D.  
            On
August 5, 2019, Qiu sent a written demand for a $500,000 refund by the end of
September.  Qiu Decl., ¶9, Ex. E.  On August 26, 2020, Milk acknowledged receipt
of the demand and stated that the refund was scheduled for the beginning of
2020.  Qiu Decl., ¶10, Ex. F.  On March 10, 2020, Qiu sent Wang and Amaxi
Regional a final demand for the $500,000 refund.  Qiu Decl., ¶11, Ex. G.  
            From
2020 onward, Bai and Du began asking Wang and later Khun about the status of
their investment.  Bai Decl., ¶6.  Wang told Bai and Du that Amaxi Nutrition
never made the products it was supposed to make.  Bai Decl., ¶6.  Wang, Khun, and Amaxi Nutrition acknowledged
the amount of the investment Bai and Du made, and they promised to refund
it.  Bai Decl., ¶6.  Qiu learned about these conversations and
requested Bai and Du’s help in obtaining a refund for her investment as
well.  Bai Decl., ¶7; Qiu Decl., ¶12.
            On
July 2, 2020, counsel for Plaintiffs sent Khun a demand letter for both
investments (“July 2020 Letter”).  Marks
Decl., ¶2, Ex. K.  The letter listed the
recipient address as 15222 Valley Blvd., City of Industry, CA 91746.  Marks Decl., ¶2, Ex. K.  Plaintiffs’ counsel asserted he was informed
Khun would be handling issues related to Amaxi Nutrition and Wang’s
estate.  Marks Decl., ¶2, Ex. K.  He was also informed that Khun had told
Plaintiffs their investments would be repaid. 
Marks Decl., ¶2, Ex. K.
            On
July 17, Amaxi Nutrition replied that it had no record of an investment from
Qiu.  Marks Decl., ¶3, Ex. L.  The Facility’s address was listed on this
response.  Marks Decl., ¶3, Ex. L.  Because this response did not mention Bai and
Du, counsel for Plaintiffs interpreted it as an admission that Khun had agreed
to repay their investment.  Marks Decl.,
¶3, Ex. L.  
            Wang
passed away on or before September 15, 2021. 
Bai Decl., ¶8.  
Amaxi WY’s filings with the Wyoming Secretary of State list
its principal place of business as the Facility’s address.  Qiu Decl., ¶13, Ex. H.
 
            d.
Purpose of the Applications
            To
date, Plaintiffs have not received a refund of their investments.  Bai Decl., ¶10; Qiu Decl., ¶12.  They seek attachment only to recover Bai and
Du’s $1,045,000 investment and Qiu’s $530,000 investment.  Bai Decl., ¶12; Qiu Decl., ¶14.  These amounts are unsecured.  Bai Decl., ¶13; Qiu Decl., ¶15.

            Unlike
Amaxi Nutrition, Amaxi WY’s goal is to develop food products primarily for sale
within the U.S.  Khun Decl., ¶40.  The products it offers are also different.  Khun Decl., ¶40.  The two companies have no common ownership,
directors, or officers.  Khun Decl.,
¶40.  Amaxi WY did not acquire any assets
or stock from Wang’s companies or assume their obligations.  Khun Decl., ¶40.  Wang was never involved with Amaxi WY.  Khun Decl., ¶41.

            Khun
never told anyone he was handling issues related to Amaxi Nutrition and Wang’s
estate.   Khun Decl., ¶38.  He had not seen Plaintiffs’ July 2020 Letter
(Marks Decl., Ex. K) before this application. 
Khun Decl., ¶36.
            Until
he learned about Plaintiff’s contentions in this case, he did not know about
the PPMs or Milk’s Business Plan.  Khun
Decl., ¶¶ 18-19, 27.  He did not
authorize either document to list him as President or provide his information, and
he did not know they did so.  Khun Decl.,
¶¶ 18-19, 27.  Until Plaintiffs contacted
him, he did not know they invested in Wang’s companies.  Khun Decl., ¶¶ 20, 28-29.
            Khun
did not communicate with Plaintiffs until after Wang’s death.  Khun Decl., ¶¶ 20, 25, 30.  He sympathized with them when they contacted
him about amounts his sister Wang owed. 
Khun Decl., ¶25.  He engaged in
conversation with them for some time, but he never suggested he was involved in
Wang’s business affairs or legally responsible for her debts.  Khun Decl., ¶25.  He told them he was never involved with or a member,
officer, director, or board member of the CA Entities.  Khun Decl., ¶25.  He never promised to pay any money to
Plaintiffs to compensate them for claims against those companies or Wang.  Khun Decl., ¶¶ 25, 37.  He refused to sign a document prepared by
Plaintiffs’ counsel that would commit him to repaying the investments at
issue.  Khun Decl., ¶37.          The text Khun sent on October 10, 2021
did not promote Amaxi Nutrition products. 
Khun Decl., ¶33. A new company was formed developing these products under
a different label.  Khun Decl., ¶33.  Khun only mentioned this investment
opportunity as a way to recoup some of Plaintiff’s losses.  Khun Decl., ¶33.
 
            c.
Course of Proceedings
            The
Complaint alleged fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and two causes of action for
breach of contract.  Adair Decl., ¶2.  The causes of action were against all
Defendants but based only on Wang and her companies’ conduct.  Adair Decl., ¶2.  The Complaint did not allege that Khun and
Amaxi WY were part of the misrepresentations or parties to the contracts.  Adair Decl., ¶3.
            Defendants
demurred to the Complaint, but Plaintiffs filed the FAC before a hearing on the
demurrer.  Adair Decl., ¶3.  Because the FAC still did not allege that Khun
or Amaxi WY were part of the misrepresentations or parties to the contracts,
Defendants demurred again.  Adair Decl.,
¶3.
            Department
53 sustained the demurrer on behalf of Khun and Margaret as to the breach of
contract causes of action.  Adair Decl.,
¶4.  The court ruled that the FAC alleges
that Plaintiffs entered the contract with Wang and suspended corporation Amaxi
Nutrition, and they have not alleged that Khun and Margaret were parties to the
contract.  Adair Decl., ¶4.
            Plaintiffs
have recently filed the SAC, which alleges that Khun and Amaxi WY were parties
to the two contracts at issue.  Adair
Decl., ¶5.[4]  Neither Plaintiffs’ discovery responses nor the
evidence filed with this application demonstrates this.  Adair Decl., ¶5.
            Interrogatories
in this action asked Plaintiffs to identify every person with whom they
discussed possible investments. 
Dieringer Decl., ¶3, Exs. 1-3. 
Answers included Wang, Lixin Azarmehr, Yulian Yan, Jennifer Fu, and the
other Plaintiffs.  Dieringer Decl., ¶3,
Exs. 1-3; Adair Decl., ¶5.  Nobody named
Khun in responses or supplemental responses. 
Dieringer Decl., ¶3, Exs. 1-3; Adair Decl., ¶5.  This contradicts Bai’s declaration, which
states that Khun helped solicit Bai and Du’s investment in Amaxi Nutrition.  Dieringer Decl., ¶4.
            Requests
for Production of Documents (“RFPs”) in this action asked Plaintiffs for all
documents that constitute any communication between that Plaintiff and Khun
from 2016 to present day.  Dieringer
Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.  Qiu responded that she
could not produce any documents because no such communication ever
existed.  Dieringer Decl., ¶6, Ex.
4.  Bai and Du produced communications starting
from October 2021, years after the Plaintiffs’ investments.  Dieringer Decl., ¶6.
            Qiu
asserts she paid $530,000 to Wang, Khun, Milk, Amaxi Regional, and other
Defendants.  Dieringer Decl., ¶8.  She has produced the two checks to show this
payment.  Dieringer Decl., ¶8, Ex.
5.  Both were made out to Amaxi Regional,
not Khun.  Dieringer Decl., ¶8, Ex.
5.  
            Defendants
also requested that Bai produce documents evidencing the amount he invested in Amaxi
Nutrition.  Dieringer Decl., ¶10.  Bai produced hundreds of pages of documents, some
in Chinese, but none of it appears to be documentary evidence of his
payments.  Dieringer Decl., ¶¶
11-12.  Nothing suggests a payment to
Khun.  Dieringer Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.  
 
            3.
Reply Evidence[5]
            On
November 15, 2022, Plaintiffs personally served Khun with the Complaint and
Summons at 15222 East Valley Boulevard, City of Industry, CA 91746.  Shikai Decl., ¶5, Ex. M.  
            On
November 16, 2023, Plaintiffs electronically served counsel for Defendants with
the SAC.  Shikai Decl., ¶6, Ex. N.
 
            D. Analysis
            Plaintiffs
apply for right to attach orders against Defendants Amaxi
WY and Khun in the amount of $1,575,000.[6]
 
            1.
A Claim Based on a
Contract and on Which Attachment May Be Based
            A
writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for
money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the
total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500). 
CCP §483.010(a).  
            Plaintiffs’
claim a total of $1,575,000 paid pursuant to the subscription agreement in
Bai’s PPM and Qiu’s Milk Subscription Agreement.  Qiu Decl., ¶7, Ex. C; Bai Decl., ¶5, Ex. I.  Plaintiffs’ claim is also based on Khun’s alleged
misrepresentations creating an implied contract and his oral promises to repay
the investments.  Bai Decl., ¶9.  Plaintiffs have contract claims on which to base attachment.  See Reply at 2-3.
 
            2. An Amount Due That is Fixed
and Readily Ascertainable 
            A
claim is “readily ascertainable” where the damages may be readily ascertained by
reference to the contract and the basis of the calculation appears to be
reasonable and definite.  CIT
Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super DVD, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537,
540-41.  The fact that the damages are
unliquidated is not determinative.  Id.  But the contract must furnish a standard by
which the amount may be ascertained and there must be a basis by which the
damages can be determined by proof.  Id.
(citations omitted).
            Bai
asserts that he and his wife paid $1,045,000 pursuant to the subscription
agreement attached to the PPM to invest in Amaxi Nutrition.  Bai Decl., ¶¶ 2, 5, Ex. I.  Qiu asserts that she paid $530,000 under the Milk
Subscription Agreement to invest in Amaxi Regional and Milk.  Qiu Decl., ¶7, Ex. C.  
            Bai’s
PPM set the purchase price of 100,000 Amaxi Nutrition shares at $1,000,000,
plus $45,000 in offering expenses.  Bai
Decl., ¶3, Ex. I, pp. 1, 11.  Amaxi
Nutrition issued a stock certificate for 100,000 shares.  Bai Decl., ¶5, Ex. I.  Bai’s damages of $1,045,000 are
ascertainable.
            The
Milk Subscription Agreement provides that Qiu agrees to purchase 0.5 shares of
preferred stock at a price of $100 per share, in accordance with the terms of
the PPM.  Qiu Decl., ¶7, Ex. C.  This suggests an investment of only $50, not
$530,000 as Qiu asserts.  Because
Defendants do not contest the ascertainable damages, this defect is waived.
            Plaintiffs’
total readily ascertainable damages total $1,575,000.
 
            3. Probability of Success
            A
claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will recover on that claim. 
CCP §481.190.  In determining this
issue, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the
respective parties.  Kemp Bros.
Construction, Inc. v. Titan Electric Corp., (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
 
            a.
The Written Agreements (Subscription Agreement and the Milk Subscription
Agreement) and Implied Contract Through Fraud
            (1). Khun
Plaintiffs
assert Khun was one of the Defendants who told Du and Bai that an investment in
Amaxi Nutrition would be suitable for EB-5.  Bai Decl., ¶2. 
He also promised Bai via the PPM that Du and Bai would receive either a
return of their full investment, one or more parcels of real estate of equal
value, or an ownership interest in the business within five years of the
investment.  Bai Decl., ¶4, Ex. I.  Mem. at 5.
            Qiu asserts that
Amaxi Regional and Milk made similar representations to induce her investment
via the Milk Subscription Agreement. 
Mem. at 6; Qiu Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, 6. 
They made those representations through representatives, principals, and
officers like Khun.  Mem. at 6.
            Plaintiffs also assert
Khun orally agreed to repay the money they invested in Milk, Amaxi Regional,
and Amaxi Nutrition.  Bai Decl., ¶9.  He did this in furtherance of his role as
President of the Entities.  Plaintiffs
cite Bai’s PPM, Qiu’s PPM, and Milk’s September 2015 Business Plan.  Qiu Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4, Exs. A-B; Bai Decl., ¶5, Ex. I.  Mem. at 4; Reply at 5.  These
documents identify Khun as President of both Amaxi Nutrition and Milk.  Qiu Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4, Exs. A-B; Bai Decl., ¶5, Ex. I.  Mem. at 8.  
            Khun denies that he was
an officer, director, or owner of any of the CA Entities.  Khun and Wang never participated in
each other’s businesses.  Khun Decl.,
¶5.  Khun was never involved in the
formation, management, or operation of the CA Entities.  Khun Decl., ¶6.  Khun did not discuss the solicitation of
investments for the CA Entities with Wang or anyone else.  Khun Decl., ¶14.  
            Khun
has not received monies or anything of value from investment in the CA Entities.  Khun Decl., ¶15.  He has not received compensation for services
rendered to them.  Khun Decl., ¶15.  He has never held himself out as a
representative of any of the three Entities. 
Khun Decl., ¶13.          Until he learned about Plaintiff’s
contentions in this case, he did not know about the PPMs or Milk’s Business
Plan.  Khun Decl., ¶¶ 18-19, 27.  He did not authorize either document to list
him as President or provide his information, and he did not know they did
so.  Khun Decl., ¶¶ 18-19, 27.  Until Plaintiffs contacted him, he did not
know they invested in Wang’s companies. 
Khun Decl., ¶¶ 20, 28-29.  Multiple Amaxi Nutrition employees also
assert they never interacted with Khun about company matters or saw him perform
company duties or functions.  Douthwaite
Decl., ¶7; Tan Decl., ¶3.
As Defendants’
opposition notes, none of the PPMs or Business Plan was signed by Khun.  Opp. at 11. 
For example, although the Bai PPM identified Khun as Amaxi Nutrition’s President,
Wang signed it on a page identifying her as President.  Bai Decl., ¶3, Ex. I.  Filings with the California Secretary of
State for the CA Entities never
list him as a shareholder or officer. 
Opp. at 7; RJN Exs. A-H.  Khun’s
evidence is more persuasive.  Based on
the evidence presented, Khun demonstrates that he was never involved in the formation, management, or
operation of the CA Entities.  
Assuming arguendo Khun was an officer or shareholder of a CA Entity, this alone would not
render him personally liable for amounts the CA Entities owe thereunder.  Opp. at 11. 
A corporation is regarded as a legal entity, separate and distinct from
its stockholders, officers and directors, with separate and distinct
liabilities and obligations.  Opp. at 12;
Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000), 83 Cal. App. 4th 523,
538.  The mere status of officer,
director, or shareholder does not make that person personally liable for the
corporation’s debts.  Khun is not     personally liable under the contracts
between Plaintiffs and the CA Entities unless he participated in a fraud.
Plaintiffs also fail
to provide supporting foundation that Khun and Plaintiffs discussed possible
investment in the CA Entities, and Khun denies ever doing so.  Plaintiffs failed to provide such evidence during
discovery.  Dieringer Decl., ¶3, Exs.
1-3. Interrogatories asked Plaintiffs to identify every person with whom
they discussed possible investments. 
Dieringer Decl., ¶3, Exs. 1-3. 
None of the answers named Khun in responses or supplemental
responses.  Dieringer Decl., ¶3, Exs.
1-3; Adair Decl., ¶5.  When RFPs asked Qiu for documents
constituting any communication she had with Khun since 2016, she said there
never was any.  Dieringer Decl., ¶6, Ex.
4.  Bai and Du only produced
communications starting from October 2021, years after Plaintiffs’ investments.
 Dieringer Decl., ¶6.  Qiu asserts that she paid her $530,000
investment to Wang, Khun, Milk, Amaxi Regional, and other Defendants (Qiu
Decl., ¶7; Dieringer Decl., ¶8) but she only produced checks to Amaxi Regional.  Dieringer Decl., ¶8, Ex. 5.  
            Plaintiffs
have not shown that Khun has a personal obligation to repay the investments
either under the written agreements or participation in a fraud.
 
            (2). Amaxi WY
            Plaintiffs assert that
Amaxi WY is the successor-in-interest to Amaxi Nutrition.  Mem. at 5.
            Khun does not deny that he owns and controls
Amaxi WY.  Khun Decl., ¶39; RJN Ex.
I.  As Defendants note (Opp. at
14-15), Plaintiffs fail to provide any evidence of common ownership, directors,
or officers between the CA Entities and Amaxi WY.  Khun Decl., ¶40.  Khun founded Amaxi WY in 2021, a year after
Wang’s death.  Khun Decl., ¶39; RJN Ex.
I.  Defendants assert that Amaxi WY
develops different food products than Amaxi Nutrition for a different
geographical market.  Khun Decl., ¶40.  Amaxi WY did not acquire any assets or stock
from Wang’s companies or assume their obligations.  Khun Decl., ¶40.
            Plaintiffs
present evidence that Amaxi WY’s principal place of business is at the same
address as the Facility that Milk once operated.  Qiu Decl., ¶¶ 5, 13, Exs. A, H; RJN Ex. H.  The CA Entities used this Facility to manufacture,
produce, and market dietary supplements for different age groups.  Qiu Decl., ¶4, Ex. B, p. 16; Bai Decl., ¶3,
Ex. I, p. 19.  Reply at 4.  Amaxi WY now uses the same Facility for that
purpose.  Reply at 5, 7.  This does not alone does not demonstrate that
Amaxi WY is a successor-in-interest to any of the CA Entities. 
Plaintiffs have not shown that Amaxi WY has an obligation to
repay the investments under the written agreements.
 
            b. Statute
of Frauds
            Plaintiffs assert that Khun and Amaxi WY
entered into oral and implied-in-fact agreements to repay the amounts
Plaintiffs invested under the Bai PPM and the Milk Subscription Agreement.  Mem. at 8. 

A contract coming within the statute of
frauds is invalid unless it is memorialized by a writing subscribed by the
party to be charged.  Civil Code §1624(a);
Secrest v. Security Nat. Mortg. Loan Trust 2002-2, (2008) 167
Cal.App.4th 544, 552.  A special promise
to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another, except when
specified under Civil Code section 2794, comes within the statute of
frauds.  Civil Code §1624(a)(2).
            If Khun orally agreed after Wang’s
death to repay the amount that she and the CA Entities owed, such an agreement
falls within the statute of frauds.  Civil
Code §1624(a)(2).  Plaintiffs must
demonstrate that Khun memorialized this agreement in writing.  Civil Code §1624(a).  Plaintiffs argue that Khun does not cite a
written denial of liability (Reply at 6), but that argument improperly reverses
the burden.
            Plaintiffs assert that Khun promised
in a May 2022 conversation that he would refund Bai, Du, and Qiu’s investments
through Amaxi WY.  Bai Decl., ¶9.  Mem. at 6. 
Plaintiffs fail to provide a writing to satisfy the statute of
frauds.  Khun rejected a proposed written
settlement that would require him to admit he was responsible for amounts
owed.  Khun Decl., ¶37.  
            Assuming arguendo Khun orally
agreed to refund investments into the CA Entities, Plaintiffs cannot enforce
that agreement due to the statute of frauds.
 
            c. July
2020 Letter
            In the July
2020 Letter, Plaintiffs demanded that Khun refund both investments.  Marks Decl., ¶2, Ex. K.  Plaintiffs’ counsel asserted he was informed
Khun would be handling issues related to Amaxi Nutrition and Wang’s
estate.  Marks Decl., ¶2, Ex. K.  He was also informed that Khun had told
Plaintiffs their investments would be repaid. 
Marks Decl., ¶2, Ex. K.  
            On July 17,
2020, Amaxi Nutrition replied that it had no record of an investment from
Qiu.  Marks Decl., ¶3, Ex. L.  Because this response did not mention Bai and
Du, Plaintiffs’ counsel interpreted it as an admission that Khun had agreed to
repay their investment.  Marks Decl., ¶3,
Ex. L.  
            Plaintiffs
reassert this inference based on the doctrine of adoptive silence.  Reply at 6. 
When a person makes a statement in the presence of a party to an action
under circumstances that would normally call for a response if the statement
were untrue, the receiving party’s silence, evasion, or equivocation may be
considered as a tacit admission of the statements made in his presence.  In re Neilson’s Estate, (1962) 57
Cal.2d 733, 746; People v Charles, (2015) 61 Cal.4th 308, 323.           
            Khun denies
receiving the July 2020 Letter.  Khun
Decl., ¶36.  Plaintiffs note that the
address on the July 2020 Letter matches the address where it personally served
Khun with the Complaint and Summons.  Marks
Decl., ¶2, Ex. K; Shikai Decl., ¶5, Ex. M.  Reply at 5-6.
            If matching
addresses suggest that Khun received the Letter, Amaxi Nutrition’s July 17
response, which is unsigned, has a different address, which suggests that he
did not write it.  Marks Decl., ¶3, Ex. L.  In any event, Plaintiffs cite no authority
suggesting that a silent admission can overcome the statute of frauds.  Plaintiffs’ July 2020 Letter does not show that
Khun or Amaxi WY agreed to repay the investments.
 
            d. Conclusion
            Plaintiffs
have failed to show an enforceable agreement, written, oral, or implied,
against Khun or Amaxi WY and have failed to demonstrate a probability of
success on the merits.
 
            4.
Attachment Based on Commercial Claim
            If
the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a commercial claim which arises out of the defendant’s conduct
of a trade, business, or profession.  CCP
§483.010(c).  Consumer transactions
cannot form a basis for attachment.   CCP
§483.010(c); Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn & Rossi v. Wilson, (“Kadison”)
(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 (action involving trust property was a commercial,
not a consumer, transaction).
            These terms “trade,”
“business,” and “profession” encompass almost any activity engaged in for
profit with “frequency and continuity.”  Advance
Transformer Co. v. Superior Court, (1974) 44 Cal.App.3d 127, 139. 
The purpose of the attachment statutes is to confine attachment to
commercial situations and prohibit their use in consumer transactions.  Kadison, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d
at 4.
            Plaintiffs fail
to demonstrate Khun had any commercial interest in the CA Entities, whether
directly or through Amaxi WY.  As Defendants argue (Opp. at 15), Plaintiffs
claim boils down to Khun’s personal liability based on an oral promise to repay
Wang’s debt.  This is not a commercial
claim.  
            
            5.
Description of Property to be Attached
            Where
the defendant is a natural person, the description of the property must be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.  CCP §484.020(e).  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268. The requirement of
specificity avoids unnecessary hearings where an individual defendant is
willing to concede that the described property is subject to attachment.  Ibid. 
A general list of categories - e.g., “real property, personal
property, equipment, motor vehicles, chattel paper, negotiable and other
instruments, securities, deposit accounts, safe-deposit boxes, accounts
receivable, general intangibles, property subject to pending actions, final money
judgments, and personal property in decedents’ estates” – is sufficient.  Ibid. 
            Plaintiffs
seek to attach Khun’s interests in real property, except leasehold states with
unexpired terms of less than one year.  The
description of attachable property is adequate.
 
6. Attachment Sought for a Proper Purpose 
            Attachment
must not be sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon
which attachment is based.  CCP §484.090(a)(3).  Plaintiffs seek attachment for a proper
purpose.  Bai Decl., ¶12; Qiu Decl., ¶14.
 
            E. Conclusion
            The
applications for right to attach orders are denied.
