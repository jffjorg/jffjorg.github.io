And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several issues related to the case. First, the judge notes that both parties failed to provide courtesy copies of their filings, as required by the court's rules. The judge admonishes counsel to provide courtesy copies in the future.

Second, the judge grants defendants' request for judicial notice of certain exhibits, including entity formation documents and Statements of Information (SOIs) for various companies.

Third, the judge sustains all three of defendants' written objections to plaintiffs' evidence.

Fourth, the judge notes that the Special Appearance and Claim (SAC) is not in the court's electronic case file.

Fifth, the judge denies plaintiffs' request for judicial notice of exhibits attached to their reply declaration, as plaintiffs failed to file a separate document requesting judicial notice.

Finally, the judge notes that defendants' notice of opposition purports to seek exemptions for Khun, but only seeks to exempt all of Khun's property, and does not discuss exemptions. Therefore, the exemption issue is waived.
