further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise
stated.


[2] Although
the laws at issue govern zoning by other local government agencies, the court
shall refer to cities for convenience.


[3] RHNA is the statutory
process to identify the total number of housing units (by affordability)
allocated to each jurisdiction for planning purposes. As part of this process,
the California Department of Housing and Community Development (“HCD”), through its
regional sub-agencies, identifies the total housing need allocated to each city
for an eight-year period.


[4] The
court has ruled on the parties’ written evidentiary objections, sometimes
overruling an objection under Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. East Bay
Union of Machinists, Local 1304, Seelworkers of America, AFL-CIO, (1964)
227 Cal.App.2d 675, 712 (court may overruled objection if any portion of
objected to material is admissible).  The
clerk is directed to electronically scan and file the court’s rulings.
Kennedy requests judicial notice of (1) the Registrar
of Actions for the California Court of Appeal case City of Huntington Beach
v. The State of California et al., (“Appeal”) Case No. G061184 (RJN Ex. 1);
(2) the City’s opening brief in the Appeal, filed on August 18, 2022 (RJN Ex.
2); (3) City’s Motion to Take Judicial Notice in the Appeal, filed on August
18, 2022 (RJN Ex. 3); (4) Kennedy’s opposition to that motion, filed on
September 2, 2022 (RJN Ex. 4); (5) a letter from the State of California,
Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed in the Appeal on
September 12, 2022 (RJN Ex. 5); (6) Kennedy’s opposition for the Appeal, filed
on October 4, 2022 (RJN Ex. 6); and (7) the unpublished opinion for the Appeal,
issued June 14, 2023 (RJN Ex. 7).
            The City objects that the court cannot judicially notice
allegations in affidavits, declarations, briefings because such matters are
reasonably subject to dispute.  RJN Opp.
at 3-5, 6-7.  Kennedy does not seek judicial
notice of the facts in the appellate briefings, only that the issues and
alleged facts were presented on appeal. 
RJN Reply at 3.  The court may take judicial notice of the existence of a
court document, but not its truth.  Sosinsky
v. Grant, (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1551.
            The City also asserts that the Registrar of Actions (RJN
Ex. 1) cannot be judicially noticed because it is not an actual court
filing.  RJN Obj. at 4-5.  Not so. 
The court can judicially notice a Registrar of Actions under Evid. Code
section 452(d).   RGC Gaslamp, LLC v.
Ehmcke Sheet Metal Co. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 413, n. 2.  RJN Reply at 1-2.
            The City argues the court should not judicially notice
the September 12, 2022 letter (RJN Ex. 5) because it contains hearsay and lacks
foundation.  RJN Opp. at 6.  It admits this letter was filed in the
Appeal. While the court can judicially notice the existence of this court document,
it is offered for its truth.  Kennedy has
offered to withdraw this request for judicial notice and it is withdrawn.  See RJN Reply at 4.
            The City argues that it is unnecessary to judicially notice
the appellate court’s opinion (RJN Ex. 7). 
RJN Opp. at 5-6.  Whatever the
reason, the court can judicially notice an unpublished appellate opinion.  Gilbert v. Master Washer & Stamping Co.
(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 212, 217, n. 14. 
RJN Reply at 2.
            The requests to judicially notice Exhibit Nos. 1-4 and
6-7 are granted.  Evid. Code §452(d).


            [5] The City
lists Laughton’s hours as 12.99.  Opp. at
13.  Because all entries are in 0.1-hour
increments, the court assumes this is a typo.
