Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses judicial notice requests made by Kennedy in a case involving the City of Huntington Beach. The Judge grants Kennedy's requests to judicially notice certain court documents, including the Registrar of Actions, the City's opening brief, and the unpublished opinion of the California Court of Appeal. The Judge also rules on several objections made by the City, including the admissibility of certain evidence and the hearsay nature of some documents. The ruling provides guidance on the scope of judicial notice and its relationship to the truth of the documents being noticed.
