Here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has sustained the demurrer filed by Defendant State College Distributors, Inc. with leave to amend for Plaintiff Fernando Barajas-Salomon to allege additional facts. The court has also granted the motion to strike the phrase "and other silica-containing stone products to be identified during the course of discovery" from the First Amended Complaint. The court found that the Plaintiff's complaint fails to allege specific products and fraud. The Plaintiff alleged exposure to silica and other toxins caused lung disease. The court ruled that the Plaintiff's complaint fails to satisfy the Bockrath standard and that the Defendant is not liable for punitive damages.
