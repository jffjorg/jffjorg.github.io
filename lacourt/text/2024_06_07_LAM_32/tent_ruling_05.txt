  Case No.:  23STCV19544
  Hearing Date:  June 7, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to enforce settlement
  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 15, 2023, Plaintiff
Creditors Adjustment Bureau filed this action against Push Interactive, LLC to
recover outstanding debt in the amount of $48,879. The parties entered into a
settlement agreement on January 26, 2024 in the amount of $55,000 payable in
six installments. Defendant made two payments before defaulting.  
            On May 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion to enforce settlement. Defendant has not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6 provides:¿“If parties to pending litigation stipulate,
in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” Such a settlement agreement is a contract, and the legal
principles which apply to contracts generally apply to settlement contracts.¿(Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal. App. 4th 793, 815.) When ruling
on a Section 664.6 motion, the trial court acts as a trier of fact to determine
whether a settlement has occurred, which is also an implicit authorization for
the trial court to interpret the terms and conditions to settlement. (Skulnick
v. Roberts Express, Inc. (1992) 2 Cal. App. 4th 884, 889.)
DISCUSSION
            The parties’ settlement agreement
requires Defendant to pay $55,000 in six installments. (Weitz Decl., Ex. 1, §
1.) Defendant made two payments of $9,166.66 before failing to make the third
payment due April 5, 2024. (Id., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff contacted Defendant on
April 8, April 19, and May 2, reminding Defendant of the default. (Id.,
¶ 4.) To date, Defendant has not made any payments. (Id., ¶ 5.) These
undisputed facts show that Defendant is in default of the agreement. The
agreement provides that the non-breaching party may bring a motion under Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6. (Id., Ex. 1, § 8.) Therefore,
Plaintiff is entitled to enforce the agreement under Section 664.6.  
            The agreement further provides that
the prevailing party on a motion under Section 664.6 shall be entitled to the
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs for bringing the motion. (Weitz Decl., Ex.
1, § 8.) Plaintiff reasonably requests $1,573.65 for bringing the motion. (Id.,
¶ 8.) 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to enforce
settlement is GRANTED. Attorney’s fees and costs are granted in the amount of
$1,573.65.
