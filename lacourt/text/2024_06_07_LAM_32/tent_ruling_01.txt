  order RE:
defendants’ motion to amend judgment 




 


 



BACKGROUND
On November 9, 2018, Plaintiffs Hero Dogs
Season One LLC (HDS1) and Nuriya Entertainment LLC (Nuriya) commenced this
action against Defendants Dean A. Avedon, Bemel, Ross & Avedon, LLP, David
Beitchman, and Beitchman & Zekian, a Professional Law Corporation. The
operative First Amended Complaint was filed June 11, 2019. The matter came on
for a bench trial on October 31, 2022. The Court found in favor of Defendants
and entered judgment accordingly on December 6, 2022. Plaintiffs then appealed
the judgment, but the appeal has since been dismissed.  
            On May 1, 2024, Defendants filed the
instant motion to amend the judgment to add Melinda Lee as a judgment debtor. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“When jurisdiction is, by the Constitution
or this Code, or by any other statute, conferred on a Court or judicial
officer, all the means necessary to carry it into effect are also given; and in
the exercise of this jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be not
specifically pointed out by this Code or the statute, any suitable process or
mode of proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the
spirit of this Code.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 187.) 
“Pursuant to section 187, a trial court
has jurisdiction to modify a judgment to add additional judgment debtors.” (McClellan
v. Northridge Park Townhome Owners Ass'n (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 746, 752.) “Judgments
are often amended to add additional judgment debtors on the grounds that a
person or entity is the alter ego of the original judgment debtor.” (NEC
Electronics Inc. v. Hurt (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 772, 778.) “This is an
equitable procedure based on the theory that the court is not amending the
judgment to add a new defendant but is merely inserting the correct name of the
real defendant.” (Ibid.) “Such a procedure is an appropriate and
complete method by which to bind new . . . defendants where it can be
demonstrated that in their capacity as alter ego of the [judgment debtor] they
in fact had control of the previous litigation, and thus were virtually
represented in the lawsuit.” (Ibid.) 
DISCUSSION
I.
Control of Litigation
“Control of the litigation sufficient to
overcome due process objections may consist of a combination of factors,
usually including the financing of the litigation, the hiring of attorneys, and
control over the course of the litigation.” (NEC Electronics Inc. v. Hurt
(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 772, 781.)
Ms. Lee has been the “sole manager” of
Plaintiffs since she “took control in November 2017.” (Def.’s Ex. 19 (03/16/23
Lee Decl.) ¶¶ 1, 9.) Ms. Lee “filed this lawsuit on behalf of” Plaintiffs. (Id.,
¶ 5.) She has “paid the remainder of the Entities expenses from [her] own bank
account.” (Id., ¶ 11.) Ms. Lee has confirmed that “discovery was drafted
by [her] and merely proofed by” counsel. (Def.’s Ex. 18 (07/12/21 Lee Decl.) ¶¶
8-9.) Ms. Lee repeatedly referred to this litigation as “my case” and
referenced her counsel as “represent[ing] me in this matter.” (Id., ¶¶
3, 20, 21.) This sufficiently shows that Ms. Lee controlled and was virtually
represented in the litigation.   
II.
Alter Ego
“The alter ego doctrine arises when a
plaintiff comes into court claiming that an opposing party is using the
corporate form unjustly and in derogation of the plaintiff's interests . . . In
certain circumstances the court will disregard the corporate entity and will
hold the individual shareholders liable for the actions of the corporation.” (Greenspan
v. LADT LLC (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486, 510.) Establishing alter ego “generally
requires the proponent to demonstrate two elements: (1) a unity of interest and
ownership such that the separate personalities of the corporation and the
individual do not exist; and (2) an inequitable result if the corporate
identity is not disregarded.” (JPV I L.P. v. Koetting (2023) 88
Cal.App.5th 172, 189.) “In addition, even if all the formal elements necessary
to establish alter ego liability are not present, an unnamed party may be
included as a judgment debtor if ‘the equities overwhelmingly favor’ the amendment
and it is necessary to prevent an injustice.” (Carolina Casualty Ins. Co. v.
L.M. Ross Law Group, LLP (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1188-1189.) 
“The alter ego test encompasses a host of
factors,” and “[t]his long list of factors is not exhaustive.” (Zoran Corp.
v. Chen (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 799, 812.) “No single factor is
determinative, and instead a court must examine all the circumstances to
determine whether to apply the doctrine.” (Ibid.) Some factors to
consider include: that the individual defendant dominated and controlled the
entity defendant; that a unity of interest and ownership existed between the
individual defendant and entity defendant; that the entity defendant was a mere
shell and conduit for the individual defendant’s affairs; that the entity
defendant was inadequately capitalized; that the entity defendant failed to
abide by corporate formalities; and that the individual defendant used the
entity defendant’s assets as her own. (See Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Plaza
Del Rey (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 235-36.)  
a. Unity of Interest
Ms. Lee has sole control of the Plaintiff
entities. She has been the “sole manager” of Plaintiffs since she “took control
in November 2017.” (Def.’s Ex. 19 (03/16/23 Lee Decl.) ¶¶ 1, 9.) The bankruptcy
filings list only Ms. Lee as an officer, director, managing member, general
partner, member in control, controlling shareholder, or other person in control.
(Def.’s Ex. 9, 10.) On this motion, Ms. Lee further confirms that she is the
“sole manager” of Plaintiffs, having been “granted control” through a settlement
agreement. (05/24/24 Lee Decl. ¶¶ 1, 14.) Additionally, as discussed above, Ms.
Lee made the decision to file this lawsuit in Plaintiffs’ name and controlled
the litigation. Therefore, there is a sufficient unity of interest between Ms.
Lee and the Plaintiff entities.   
            b. Inequitable Result
“[T]here is no likelihood that . . .
Defendants will ever be paid by the Entities.” (Def.’s Ex. 19 (03/16/23 Lee
Decl.) ¶ 15.) The Plaintiff entities are undercapitalized. They have been
insolvent since 2017, before this lawsuit was filed. (Id., ¶ 4.) It has
been known “throughout the lawsuit” that “the Entities neither have the assets
nor cash to pay litigation costs.” (Id., ¶ 10.) Ms. Lee has “paid the
remainder of the Entities expenses from [her] own bank account.” (Id., ¶
11.) Bankruptcy filings confirm that Plaintiffs have total assets of $8.00 and
$0.00, respectively. (Def.’s Ex. 11, 12.)  

An inequitable result would follow from
treating Ms. Lee and Plaintiffs as separate because Ms. Lee has sole control of
Plaintiffs and filed this action on Plaintiffs’ behalf knowing that Plaintiffs
were insolvent. If Plaintiffs had prevailed, Ms. Lee would have benefitted from
the monetary recovery as the sole manager. It would be inequitable to allow Ms.
Lee to escape liability for an unfavorable result, considering she solely
initiated and controlled the litigation. Having hailed the Defendants into court
and caused them to incur substantial costs defending the action, Ms. Lee cannot
now hide behind the Plaintiff entities to avoid the consequences of an
unsuccessful litigation. Ms. Lee filed this action knowing that Plaintiffs had
no assets and would not be able to pay in the event they lost. Defendants
should not be left without recourse. Therefore, application of alter ego is
warranted under the facts of this case. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’
motion to amend judgment is GRANTED
