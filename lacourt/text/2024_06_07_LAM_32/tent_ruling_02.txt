  order RE:
MOTION to compel deposition of defendant
  Volkswagen’s person most knowledgeable




 


 



 
Background
            Plaintiffs adolfo
jair santana and LENIN TOSCANO
SANTANA
(Plaintiffs) commenced this action against Defendant VOLKSWAGEN
GROUP OF AMERICA, INC. (Volkswagen) on April 17, 2023.  The Complaint asserts causes of action for
violations of the Song Beverly statute.  Plaintiff’s
claims arise from his purchase of a 2019 Volkswagen Jetta (Vehicle).
Legal
Standard
“If, after service of a deposition notice,
a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document … described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document … described in the deposition
notice.”  (CCP § 2025.450(a).)  The motion shall set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document
described in the deposition notice.  (CCP
§ 2025.450(b)(1).)  The motion shall also
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.  (CCP § 2025.450(b)(2).)
            If the motion is granted, the court
shall impose a monetary sanction in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.  (CCP §
2025.450(g)(1).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant Volkswagen
to produce a PMK for deposition and produce documents specified in Plaintiff’s
deposition notice. 
1. Deposition Appearance
GM must appear for deposition unless it
has served “a valid objection under Section 2025.410.”  (CCP § 2025.450(a).)  Section 2025.410 concerns errors and
irregularities with the deposition notice. 
Plaintiff’s deposition notice contains 20 categories of examination. 
GM
interposed numerous boilerplate objections including relevancy, burden, and
attorney-client privilege.  GM, however, agreed
to produce a PMK for some categories. 
            The scope of a deposition, like the scope of discovery in general, may
relate to “any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in
that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  (CCP § 2017.010.)  “For discovery purposes, information should
be regarded as ‘relevant to the subject matter’ if it might reasonably assist a
party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement
thereof.”  (City of Los Angeles v.
Superior Court (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 272, 288.)  “Doubts as to whether particular matters will
aid in a party’s preparation for trial should generally be resolved in favor of
permitting discovery.”  (Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 551.)
            In
this case, The
Court finds validity to some of GM’s objections. Most of the deposition topics relate to the Vehicle, GM’s policies and
procedures for reimbursement in response to complaints, and to Recalls or
Training Service Bulletins concerning the vehicle. These deposition topics
would plainly fall within the broad scope of discovery in this lemon law case.
            In
sum, GM must produce a PMK for the deposition for the following topics:
1.    
Repair
orders and invoices concerning the subject vehicle.
2.    
Communications
with dealer, factory representative and/or call center concerning the subject
vehicle.
3.    
Warranty
claims submitted to and/or approved by Defendant concerning the subject
vehicle.
4.    
Any
Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual published by defendant and provided to its
authorized repair facilities, within the State of California, for the date the
subject vehicle was purchased to the present.
5.    
Any
Recall Notices and Technical Service Bulletins that relate to defects alleged
in the subject vehicle.  GM is not
required to do a search of emails. 
6.    
Documents
that evidence any policy and/or procedure used to evaluate customer requests
for repurchase pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, from the
date of purchase to the present.
7.    
Customer
complaints received from 2019 to December 31, 2021,  concerning shifting issues that involve
vehicles for the same year, make, and model of the subject vehicle (2019
Volkswagen Jetta) that were sold in California.
2. Document Production
            The
Court finds Plaintiffs’ document requests to be overly
broad and unduly burdensome.  As such,
the Court issues the following discovery order regarding document production: 
1.    
Repair
orders and invoices concerning the subject vehicle.
2.    
Communications
with dealer, factory representative and/or call center concerning the subject
vehicle.
3.    
Warranty
claims submitted to and/or approved by Defendant concerning the subject
vehicle.
4.    
Any
Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual published by defendant and provided to its
authorized repair facilities, within the State of California, for the date the
subject vehicle was purchased to the present.
5.    
Any
Recall Notices and Technical Service Bulletins that relate to defects alleged
in the subject vehicle.  GM is not
required to do a search of emails. 
6.    
Documents
that evidence any policy and/or procedure used to evaluate customer requests
for repurchase pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, from the
date of purchase to the present.
7.    
Customer
complaints received from 2019 to December 31, 2021,  concerning shifting issues that involve
vehicles for the same year, make, and model of the subject vehicle (2019
Volkswagen Jetta) that were sold in California.

granted in part.  Volkswagen must produce

finds that each party acted with substantial justification.
