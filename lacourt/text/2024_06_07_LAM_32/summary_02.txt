And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion to compel deposition of defendant Volkswagen. The Plaintiffs, Adolfo Jair Santana and Lenin Toscano Santana, are seeking to compel Volkswagen to produce a person most knowledgeable (PMK) for deposition and to produce documents specified in the deposition notice. The Judge finds that some of Volkswagen's objections to the deposition notice are valid, but also finds that some of the deposition topics are relevant to the subject matter of the case. The Judge grants the motion in part, ordering Volkswagen to produce a PMK for deposition and to produce the specified documents. The Judge also denies sanctions, finding that each party acted with substantial justification.
