And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of their complaint. The plaintiff, Mane Karapetian, fell on a liquid spill at a bathroom at the Griffin Club Los Angeles and alleges that they sustained severe injuries. The defendants, including Meriwether Companies LLC and Singerman Real Estate LLC, had previously moved to dismiss the complaint due to the plaintiff's failure to serve them within 60 days. The plaintiff argued that the court should grant additional time to effect service due to their attorney's neglect, but the motion was denied. The plaintiff now argues that the defendants' insurance carriers were on notice of the pending action and were working to resolve the matter, and that two attorneys for the defendants were actively involved in pre-litigation discovery to bring about an amicable resolution. The court finds that these "different facts" warrant reconsideration and grants the motion for reconsideration, vacating the dismissal and setting a case management conference for April 4, 2024.
