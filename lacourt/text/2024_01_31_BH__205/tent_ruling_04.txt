 Case Number:  22SMCV02598    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2024    Dept:  205  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  GEICO GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY,   Plaintiff, v.  STEPHEN K. KOP, et al.,    Defendants.    Case No.:  22SMCV02598     Hearing Date:  January 31, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   CROSS-DEFENDANT LOS ANGELES    COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES    DEPARTMENT’S DEMURRER AND    MOTION TO STRIKE STEPHEN K. KOP’S    FIRST AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT      This hearing is on Cross-Defendant Los Angeles County Child Support Services’ (“CSSD’s”) demurrer and motion to strike the First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by Cross-Complainant Stephen K. Kop.  Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41 and 435.5 requires that before the filing of a demurrer or motion to strike, the moving party “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone” with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer or motion to strike for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer or motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a), 435.5(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a)(2), 435.5(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the moving party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a)(3), 435.5(a)(3).)   CSSD submits the Declaration of Anita Susan Brenner which fails to show the parties met and conferred in “person or by telephone.”  Rather, Cross-Defendant sent counsel for Cross-Complainant a letter, which letter in any event fails to outline all the arguments raised in the demurrer and motion to strike.  For this reason, the Court will continue the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike, so that CSSD can comply with the requirements of §§ 430.41 and 435.5.  The hearing is continued to March 12, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: January 31, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
