  Case Number:  20SMCV00492    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2024    Dept:  205   Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   EDGAR A. MEINHARDT, et al.,  Plaintiffs, v.  SUNNY ACRE LLC, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  20SMCV00492     Hearing Date:  January 31, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT    ON THE PLEADINGS     In this action, Plaintiff Edgar Meinhardt alleges Defendants1 misrepresented the terms of a home loan, including the amount of the loan, and then wrongfully foreclosed on his home.  The property at issue is located at 10936 Pacific View Drive, Malibu, California in Ventura County (the “Property”).     This hearing is on Moving Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings.  Moving Defendants argue that the only “real party in interest” with legal standing to assert any claims is the borrower and owner of the Property, Corp. Realty, but Corp. Realty has been dismissed from the case, and Plaintiff Meinhardt does not have standing to prosecute Corp. Realty’s claims.       Plaintiff filed a 20 page opposition which exceeds the allowable page limit of 10.  (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1113(d).)  An¿oversize brief is treated the same as a¿late-filed brief. (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1113(g).) The Court has discretion to¿disregard late-filed papers and therefore also has discretion to¿disregard oversize briefs.  (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1300(d).)  Notwithstanding, the Court will allow Plaintiff leave to file an opposition that complies with the page limits.   The Court continues the hearing on the motion for judgment on the pleadings to March 19, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.  Plaintiff must file his new opposition by February 9, 2024. Moving Defendants may, if they wish, file a reply brief by February 20, 2024. DATED: January 31, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B. Moreton, Jr. Judge of the Superior Court
