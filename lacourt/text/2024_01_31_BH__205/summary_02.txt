Summary in English text:

This "Tentative Ruling" document outlines the Judge's thinking on a future Court Hearing in the case of AARON CELIOUS vs. CITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al. (Case No. 22SMCV00915). The case arises from a failed bid for two government projects by Plaintiff Aaron Celious, owner of Maroon Society Inc. Defendant Ernesto Morales' company, North Star Alliances LLC, was awarded one of the projects, while Defendant Robin Engel's company, Star Insights, LLC, was awarded the other. Plaintiff alleges that defendants grossly and fraudulently misrepresented their qualifications and experiences to obtain an unfair competitive advantage. The Judge has granted Defendant Morales' request to continue the hearing to March 27, 2024, to allow him to comply with the meet and confer requirements of Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41, 435.5. The Court has also reversed its prior order striking Plaintiff's second amended complaint, and will rule on the merits of Morales' demurrer and motion to strike the Second Amended Complaint at the March 27, 2024 hearing.
