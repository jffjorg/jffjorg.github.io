And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Lenny & Larry's, LLC's motion for a new trial after a jury verdict in favor of Plaintiff on claims of breach of implied warranty of merchantability and against Defendant A&B Ingredients, Inc. on claims of breach of implied warranty of fitness, intentional representation, and negligent representation. The Judge denied the motion, finding that the verdict was supported by the evidence and that Plaintiff failed to substantiate the existence of lost profits "with reasonable certainty". The Judge also rejected Plaintiff's argument that the jury's decision to award $0 in lost profits was contrary to evidence, finding that the jury was entitled to credit Defendant's evidence over Plaintiff's and reject the notion that CytoGuard CDP caused Plaintiff's lost profits. The Judge concluded that the evidence supports the verdict and denied the motion for a new trial.
