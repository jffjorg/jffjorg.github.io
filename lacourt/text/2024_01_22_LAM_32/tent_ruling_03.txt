     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiffs’ motion to compel deposition
  of pmq 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 7, 2021, Plaintiffs 3D
Clean, LLC and MediClean Linen & Laundry, Inc. filed this action against
Defendant Emerald Los Angeles, LLC, asserting causes of action for (1) breach
of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (2) breach of contract, and (3)
money due and owing. 
            On December 22, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed the instant motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Emerald’s PMQ.
Defendant filed its opposition on January 8, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“If, after service of a deposition notice,
a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document … described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document … described in the deposition
notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs move to compel Defendant to
produce a PMQ to testify as to Topics 15, 16, 21, 25-31, and 36, and to produce
documents responsive to Requests 1, 47, and 48. (Mtn. 2:1-9.) There is no
dispute that Plaintiffs are entitled to depose Defendant’s PMQ and obtain associated
documents, but the parties have conflicting accounts of the meet and confer
process and disagree about how knowledgeable the PMQ must be. Plaintiffs argue that
Defendant failed to timely respond to the deposition notice, interposed belated
objections, and has offered inconsistent positions on whether it would produce
a PMQ. Defendant argues that it has agreed to designate a PMQ and has produced
the requested documents, and therefore the motion is needless and designed to
harass. 
            Plaintiffs served the deposition
notice on May 2, 2023 and set the deposition for June 22, 2023. (Schaus Decl. ¶
3, Ex. B.) On June 9, 2023, Plaintiffs wrote a letter to Defendant regarding
Defendant’s purported failure to respond to written discovery and to confirm
deponent appearances. (Id., Ex. C.) The letter did not mention the
deposition notice for the PMQ or claim that Defendant’s response to that notice
was late. Based on the initial deposition date of June 22, 2023, Defendant had
until June 19, 2023 to object to the deposition. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410(a).)
The deposition was subsequently rescheduled to July 18 and 19, 2023, and
Defendant timely served its objections on July 14, 2023. (Knudsen Decl. ¶ 7.) 
In its July 14 response, Defendant
objected to the Topics at issue and stated, “To be determined and supplemented.”
(Schaus Decl., Ex. D.) As for Topic No. 36, Defendant objected but then
identified two individuals who would “provide testimony on the topic identified
to the extent possible.” (Ibid.) Defendant served a supplemental
response on September 27, 2023. (Id., Ex. E.) In the September 27
response, Defendant indicated that it would produce a witness for Topics 15, 16,
and 36, and then asserted that the remaining Topics at issue are overbroad because
multiple employees possessed responsive information, making it impossible to designate
a PMQ. (Ibid.) Defendant also stated that it would produce all
non-privileged responsive documents to the extent they exist. (Ibid.) During
subsequent meet and confer, Defendant expressed the position that because the
individuals most knowledgeable on certain Topics no longer worked for
Defendant, Defendant is not obligated to make any current employee sufficiently
knowledgeable in order to testify. (Schaus Decl., Ex. H.) Defendant stated it
will produce a PMQ who “will only be able to read records.” (See Schaus Decl.,
Ex. K, L.) 
Defendant’s obligation is to “produc[e]
the most knowledgeable person currently in its employ and making sure that that
person has access to information and documents reasonably available within the
corporation.” (Maldonado v. Superior Court (2002) 94 Cal.App.4th 1390,
1398.) The designated witness should make “some effort to familiarize
themselves with the areas of their supposed ‘knowledge.’” (Id. at p.
1397.) Defendant is not excused from producing a PMQ just because multiple
employees may have knowledge, or because certain knowledgeable individuals no
longer work for Defendant. However, Defendant is not required to designate the
PMQ beforehand, and neither Plaintiff nor the Court may designate the PMQ for
Defendant. It cannot be determined at this stage whether the PMQ will be adequate
or not.
Lastly, Defendant has produced all
responsive documents in its possession and conducted a further check for missed
documents. (Knudsen Decl. ¶¶ 11-12.) Defendant cannot be expected to produce
anything more. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion to compel
deposition is GRANTED. Defendant shall produce the Person(s) Most Knowledgeable
on the Topics at issue. Sanctions are denied as the parties acted with
substantial justification.
