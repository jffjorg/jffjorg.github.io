  Hearing Date:  January 22, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant usaa’s motion for summary
  judgment 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 5, 2022, Plaintiff Justin
Dowdell filed this action against Defendants USAA Casualty Insurance Company
and United Services Automobile Association, asserting (1) breach of contract
and (2) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Plaintiff
alleges that USAA failed to properly cover his medical costs after he was
injured in an auto accident. 
            On November 2, 2023, Defendant USAA
Casualty Insurance Company filed the instant motion for summary judgment or
adjudication in the alternative. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section
437c, subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if
all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th
1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is
to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations
is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues
delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th
59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App.
3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden
of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a
defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes,
Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden,
the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To establish
a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Breach of Contract
            To establish breach of contract, a plaintiff must show: (1) the contract
existed, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the
plaintiff. (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) 
            At
the time of the accident, Plaintiff had a policy with Defendant that contained
a Med Coverage Limit of $50,000. (UF 1.) The policy obligates Defendant to
cover “medical expense benefits to an insured who sustains bodily injury . . .
caused by an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a
motor vehicle.” (UF 2.) Medical expenses are defined as those that are “reasonable
and necessary.” (Ibid.) The policy further requires the claimant to promptly
provide proof of claim and “any other information which may assist [USAA] in determining
the amount due and payable.” (Ibid.) The claimant must also “[a]uthorize
[USAA] to obtain medical reports and other pertinent records . . . [which] may
be used by [USAA] in determining whether [benefits] are payable under this
policy.” (Ibid.) 
            The
accident occurred on November 23, 2016, and Plaintiff filed a claim for Med Pay
benefits with Defendant on November 28, 2016. (UF 3, 5.) For the first time on
August 27, 2018, Plaintiff submitted medical records and $48,220 in medical
bills. (UF 7.) Plaintiff demanded that Defendant pay the policy limit of
$50,000. (Ibid.) Defendant retained Auto Injury Solutions, Inc. (AIS) to
review Plaintiff’s submitted documentation. (UF 9.) After consultation with
AIS, Defendant issued payouts in the amounts that it determined were reasonable
and necessary. (UF 10-14.) For the amounts that were denied or adjusted,
Defendant found that they were not properly substantiated but requested further
documentation to continue its evaluation. (UF 15-16.) Defendant sent multiple
notices to Plaintiff and his medical providers for additional documentation but
received none. (UF 17-20.) 
            The
undisputed evidence shows that Defendant complied with the contract terms,
specifically by paying out those amounts that were deemed “reasonable and
necessary.” The contract terms required Plaintiff to provide documentation
supporting his claim, which Plaintiff failed to do. Defendant was not obligated
to cover those amounts that were unsupported by proper documentation. Additionally,
Plaintiff submitted $48,220 in medical bills but already recovered $100,000 from
the other driver’s insurance. (UF 4.) Therefore, assuming Defendant breached
the policy, Plaintiff cannot prove damages arising from such breach.  
Defendant has
satisfied its burden on summary judgment, and Plaintiff presents no evidence raising
a triable issue. Therefore, summary adjudication is warranted on the breach of
contract claim. 
II. Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing
“The covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, implied by law in every contract, exists merely to prevent one
contracting party from unfairly frustrating the other party’s right to receive
the benefits of the agreement actually made.” (Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc.
(2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 349-50.) “When the insurer engages in unreasonable
conduct in connection with an insured’s insurance claim, the insurer is said to
have tortiously breached the implied covenant.” (Century Surety Co. v. Polisso
(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 922, 948.) This requires more than a mere failure to
discharge its contractual duties due to mistake, bad judgment, or negligence; instead,
there must be a conscious and deliberate act designed to frustrate the
reasonable expectations of the insured. (Id. at p. 949.) An insurer does
not act in bad faith if it withholds benefits based on a legitimate dispute as
to the insurer’s liability. (Ibid.)  
The undisputed evidence discussed above
shows that Defendant acted reasonably and denied coverage based on a genuine
dispute regarding its liability. Defendant consulted with an outside provider, paid
out certain amounts, and requested further supporting documentation from
Plaintiff, which Plaintiff failed to provide. Defendant was contractually
entitled to determine which costs were “reasonable and necessary.” (See UF 2.)
The implied covenant cannot “be read to prohibit a party from doing that which
is expressly permitted by an agreement.” (Carma Developers (Cal.), Inc. v.
Marathon Development California, Inc. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 342, 374.) Absent
contrary evidence, this shows as a matter of law that Defendant did not breach
the covenant. Therefore, summary adjudication is warranted on the breach of implied
covenant claim. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant USAA Casualty Insurance
Company’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
