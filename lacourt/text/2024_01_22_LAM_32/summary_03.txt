And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of the person most knowledgeable (PMQ) on the topics at issue. The defendant has produced all responsive documents in its possession and conducted a further check for missed documents. However, the defendant has not produced a PMQ who is adequately knowledgeable on the topics at issue. The court finds that the defendant's obligation is to produce the most knowledgeable person currently in its employ and making sure that that person has access to information and documents reasonably available within the corporation. The court also finds that the defendant is not excused from producing a PMQ just because multiple employees may have knowledge, or because certain knowledgeable individuals no longer work for the defendant. The court denies sanctions as the parties acted with substantial justification.
