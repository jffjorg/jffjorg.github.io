The Judge has found that the defendant has satisfied its burden of proof and that the plaintiff has not presented any evidence raising a triable issue of material fact. Specifically, the Judge has found that the defendant complied with the contract terms by paying out amounts deemed "reasonable and necessary" and that the plaintiff failed to provide documentation to support denied or adjusted claims.
