And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to quash service of summons, arguing that she never received service of the summons and complaint or three-day notice to quit. The plaintiff had filed a proof of service of the summons and complaint, and the court has jurisdiction over the defendant since the summons was served. The motion is moot because the plaintiff has already filed proofs of service, and actual notice of a lawsuit is not a substitute for proper service of process.
