```

And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Ford Apartments, LP, et al., and has determined that the demurrer is OVERRULED and the motion to strike is DENIED.

The court has found that the complaint adequately states a cause of action for breach of contract/covenant of quiet enjoyment/warranty of habitability, and that the allegations are sufficient to support punitive damages. The constructive eviction claim is also adequately pled.

The court has further found that the defendants' arguments that the complaint is defective because it fails to allege actual reliance or causation, and is duplicative of other claims, are without merit.

The court has also found that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to support an inference of malice and oppression for pleading purposes, and that the defendants' failure to repair defects in the property and extract full rental value despite uninhabitable conditions, demonstrates a conscious disregard for the plaintiffs' rights and safety and unjust hardship.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and argument.
