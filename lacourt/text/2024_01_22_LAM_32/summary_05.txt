And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from Defendant Huntington Pacific Hotels, LLC regarding Request for Production No. 26. The Plaintiff is seeking production of documents related to Marriott International's "System and Standard" for franchise owners and operators, which are referenced in specific provisions of the franchise agreement. The Defendant initially objected to the request, citing concerns about trade secrets and confidentiality, but ultimately agreed to produce the documents subject to a protective order. The judge found that the Plaintiff has established good cause for the production and that the request is narrowly tailored to the relevant information. The Defendant's opposition did not adequately explain how the request is overbroad or irrelevant. As a result, the judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion and ordered the production of the documents subject to a protective order.
