And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to quash a subpoena issued by Plaintiff Angela Hsu to JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, seeking bank records related to Account#8720579660, which is jointly held by Angela Hsu's deceased husband and the defendant Pichi Lin. The judge is granting the motion in part, limiting the subpoena to records pertaining only to Account#8720579660. The judge finds that the subpoena is overbroad and that the information sought is directly relevant to the case, but notes that Plaintiff's need for the information outweighs Defendant's interest in privacy. The judge is also denying sanctions as the parties have acted with substantial justification.
