     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant pichi lin’s motion to quash
  subpoena 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 26, 2020, Plaintiff
Angela Hsu initiated this action against various Defendants for (1) quiet
title, (2) cancellation of instruments, and (3) usury. Plaintiff alleges that
she and her husband (Decedent) were joint tenants of real property located in
Oceanside, California as of September 1977 (the Property). In May 2015 and
October 2017, unbeknownst to Plaintiff, Decedent borrowed $100,000 and $50,000
from Defendants, secured by the Property. Decedent passed away in August 2020, and
Plaintiff alleges that as a result, she wholly owns the Property without encumbrance.
Defendants have refused to remove the subject liens from the Property, prompting
this lawsuit. 
            On March 4, 2021, Defendants Tsasu
LLC and Hestter Investment, LLC (collectively, the creditors) filed a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff for breach of contract and declaratory relief,
alleging that Plaintiff is responsible for the loans made to Decedent. 
            On August 1, 2022, Plaintiff filed
the First Amended Complaint, which added causes of action for unjust enrichment
and equitable indemnification against Pichi Lin (Lin). Plaintiff alleges that
Decedent and Lin made the loans together without Plaintiff’s knowledge and that
Lin benefitted from the money. Plaintiff alleges that if she is held liable to
the creditors, then in fairness Lin should be liable to her, since Lin was the
true beneficiary of the loans. 
On February 17, 2023, the Court sustained
Lin’s demurrer to the FAC because the facts did not support how Lin was unjustly
enriched or at fault for Plaintiff’s liability, since it is undisputed that
Decedent alone made the loans. However, the Court granted Plaintiff leave to
amend to allege a cause of action based on Family Code section 1100(b), which
allows a spouse to void an improper transfer of community property. The Court
also granted leave to assert causes of action based on improper rent collection
and forgery. 
On March 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative Second Amended Complaint incorporating the Family Code allegations
and adding causes of action for conversion and fraud by forgery. On May 8,
2023, the Court sustained Lin’s demurrer without leave to amend as to the
unjust enrichment and equitable indemnity claims.
On December 22, 2023, Defendant Lin filed
the instant motion to quash a subpoena issued to JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA.
Plaintiff filed her opposition on January 8, 2024. Defendant filed her reply on
January 12, 2024.     
LEGAL STANDARD
“If a subpoena requires the attendance of
a witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored
information, or other things …, the court, upon motion reasonably made by [a party]
. . . may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or
directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall
declare, including protective orders.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a),
(b).) Good cause must be shown to compel a nonparty to produce documents. (See Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.)   
DISCUSSION
            The subpoena at issue seeks “Any and
all bank records, including but not limited to bank statements, wire transfer
records, deposit slips, receipts, for Account#8720579660, or any account of
Pichi Lin.” (Parker Decl., Ex. A.) 
            Based on the community property
allegations, evidence related to how the loan funds were received, distributed,
or used is relevant. The fact that Defendant denies receiving the funds, or has
produced evidence of how some of the funds were used, does not preclude
Plaintiff from conducting this discovery. The records are relevant also because
Plaintiff alleges that rental proceeds from the Property were obtained through
forgery and deposited into the joint account of Decedent and Lin. Defendant’s argument
that the claims are meritless does not preclude Plaintiff from conducting
discovery. 
However, Plaintiff’s explanation in
support of the subpoena only establishes the relevance of the joint account (Account#8720579660),
not “any and all bank records” or “any account of Pichi Lin.” The subpoena is
therefore overbroad on its face. The subpoena is limited to bank records
pertaining to Account#8720579660. For these records, the information is
directly relevant, and Plaintiff’s need for the information outweighs Defendant’s
interest in privacy. (See Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th
531, 552.) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Pichi Lin’s motion to quash
is GRANTED in part. The subpoena to JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA is limited to
records pertaining to Account#8720579660, without prejudice to Plaintiff
issuing further subpoenas upon discovering other relevant bank accounts.
Production shall be subject to a
protective order.
Sanctions are denied as the parties acted
with substantial justification.
