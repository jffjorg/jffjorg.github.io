OLIVER TRUONG,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
MISHA COLLINS, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV29880
  Hearing Date:  January 22, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion to quash service of
  summons 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 7, 2023, Plaintiff
Oliver Truong filed this unlawful detainer action against Defendant Misha
Collins.
            On December 14, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a proof of service of the three-day notice to quit.
            On December 18, 2023, Defendant
filed the instant motion to quash service of summons, arguing that she never
received service of the summons and complaint or three-day notice to quit. 
            On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a proof of service of the summons and complaint.
LEGAL STANDARD
“[T]he court in which an action is pending
has jurisdiction over a party from the time summons is served on him as
provided by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10).” (Code Civ. Proc, §
410.50(a).) “[A] court acquires jurisdiction over a party by proper service of
process or by that party's general appearance.” (In re Jennifer O.
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 539, 547.) Actual notice of a lawsuit is not a
substitute for proper service of process. (Abers v. Rohrs (2013) 217
Cal.App.4th 1199, 1206.) A defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to
quash service of summons on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).) 
DISCUSSION
            The motion is moot because Plaintiff
has filed proofs of service of the summons and complaint and three-day notice
to quit. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to quash is
DENIED.
