ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION ATTENDANCE OF A PERSON MOST QUALIFIED AND
  CUSTODIAN OF RECORDS OF DEFENDANT AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO., INC., AND REQUEST
  FOR SANCTIONS
 



 
Plaintiff In Seouk Hong (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order compelling
Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“Defendant”) to produce a Person(s)
Most Qualified and Custodian of Records to be deposed. Plaintiff also seeks monetary
sanctions against Defendant and its counsel of record. 
Plaintiff’s motion will be continued to a
new date as set forth below. NO HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON MAY 9, 2024.
  
Pursuant to the
Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court
orders the parties in this case to participate in an Informal Discovery
Conference (“IDC”). (Note:¿The Court’s policy regarding IDCs appears in the
Courtroom Information available in Dept. 50 and on the Court’s website.)[1]¿Lead or
other designated counsel for the parties with full authority are ordered to
participate in person in an IDC. After consulting with opposing counsel
regarding available dates, Plaintiff must make
a prompt reservation for the IDC using the Court’s online reservation system. Plaintiff must file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC form in the department
seven days prior to the IDC, and the responding parties may file the same form
in the department setting forth a response three days prior to the IDC.   
Once Plaintiff has confirmed
an IDC date, Plaintiff must use the Court’s
online reservation system to continue the motion to a post-IDC discovery
hearing date. The parties are ordered to have with them whatever materials are
needed to make the IDC session productive and successful. Prior to the IDC
date, lead or other designated counsel for the parties, with full authority,
are to meet and confer, in person or via telephone in
a further attempt to resolve as many of the issues as possible before the IDC.
(See CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).) If the parties resolve their
discovery disputes before the IDC date, Plaintiff is ordered to take both the IDC and the motion off
calendar as soon as possible. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
