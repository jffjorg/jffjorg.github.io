And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of a continuance of the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to compel deposition attendance and request for sanctions. The court has ordered the parties to participate in an informal discovery conference (IDC) to resolve discovery disputes. Before the IDC, the parties are required to meet and confer in person or via telephone to resolve as many issues as possible. The plaintiff is required to file a one-page IDC form in the department seven days prior to the IDC and the responding parties may file a response three days prior to the IDC. The court has also ordered the parties to have necessary materials prepared for the IDC.
