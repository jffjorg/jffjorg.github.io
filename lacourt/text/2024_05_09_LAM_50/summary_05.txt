And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet, discloses that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck approximately 24 years ago. The truck developed electrical problems, and the manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to take it back and refund the purchase price. The judge does not believe that her past experience will cause her to be biased for or against either party. However, if you believe that her experience may impact her impartiality, you have until May 23, 2024, to file and serve a verified statement of disqualification. The hearing on the Case Management Conference will be continued to July 8, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 50, unless both parties waive the right to file a statement of disqualification.
