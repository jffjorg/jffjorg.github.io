The judge's tentative ruling outlines the process used to determine a blended rate for attorney fees. The court first reduced each attorney's hourly rate to a reasonable rate, then multiplied this rate by the hours worked on a case. The totals were added up and divided by the total hours incurred to arrive at a single blended rate. In this case, the blended rate is $438 per hour, based on the calculations of the hours worked by attorneys Barry, Quinn, Matera, Rabieian, and Kim.
