Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants and has made the following rulings:

* The demurrer to the second cause of action (intentional interference with contractual relationship) is overruled, and the plaintiffs are allowed to proceed with this claim against defendant Golembiewski.
* The demurrer to the fourth cause of action (breach of fiduciary duty) is also overruled, and the plaintiffs are allowed to proceed with this claim against defendant Golembiewski.
* The demurrer to the sixth cause of action (negligence) is sustained, meaning the plaintiffs will not be allowed to proceed with this claim against defendant Golembiewski without amending the complaint to provide more specific allegations of fact.

The judge has given the plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint and has set a deadline of December 6, 2024, for filing the amended complaint.
