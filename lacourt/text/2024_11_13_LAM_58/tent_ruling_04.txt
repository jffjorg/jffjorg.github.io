 
This is a
Song-Beverly action. In July 2019, Plaintiffs
Raul Reyes, Sr. and Raul Reyes, Jr. (Plaintiffs) purchased a 2019
Chevrolet Silverado (Vehicle). On January 23, 2023, Plaintiffs sued Defendant
General Motors, LLC (GM) alleging two breach of warranty claims under
Song-Beverly, and a cause of action for fraudulent concealment. 
 
The parties settled this
Song-Beverly matter except as to the issues of attorney fees and costs.
Plaintiffs now move for an award of attorneys’ fees. 
 
Plaintiffs argue that, as the
prevailing party, they are entitled to fees and costs under Civil Code section
1794, subdivision (d). Plaintiffs seek lodestar attorneys’ fees of $51,912.50, plus a 1.25 multiplier -- in the amount of $12,978.12
-- and costs of $2,018.22. The total requested in attorney fees and costs
is $66,908.84. 
 
Defendant filed an opposition,
arguing the amounts requested in fees and costs are excessive and unreasonable.

 
The motion is granted in a reduced
amount. 
 
Plaintiffs’ objection to Defendant’s
evidence is ruled as follows: No. 1-16, 18-22 are overruled, and No. 17 is
sustained.
 
Legal Standard
 
            A prevailing buyer in an action
under Song-Beverly “shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including
attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the Court to have
been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.”¿¿(Civ. Code, § 1794,¿subd. (d).) 
 
            The
prevailing party has the burden of showing that the requested attorney fees
were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.” (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California
Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.) The party seeking attorney fees “
‘is not necessarily entitled to compensation for the value of attorney services
according to [his] own notion or to the full extent claimed by [him].’ ” (Levy
v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc.¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807,
816.)¿¿Therefore, if the “time expended or the monetary charge being made for
the time expended are not reasonable under all the circumstances, then the
court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.”
(Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America¿(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            A court may
“reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a routine,
noncomplex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and
inflated fees resulted.”¿¿(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America¿(2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)¿¿It is also appropriate to reduce an award based on
inefficient or duplicative efforts. (Id.¿at p. 38.) However, the
analysis must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions of
fairness. (Kerkeles¿v. City of San Jose¿(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th
88,¿102.)¿¿Moreover, in conducting the analysis, courts are not permitted to
tie any reductions in the fee award to some proportion of the buyer’s damages
recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc.¿(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
39.)
 
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff seeks
$51,912.50 in
attorneys’ fees for the Barry Law Firm, plus a 1.25 multiplier enhancement, and
costs of $2,018.22, for a total of $66,908.84. 
 
In opposition, Defendant GM argues
that the Court should reduce fees by $28,202.50, limiting the attorney fees to
the amount of $23,710.
 
            A
calculation of attorneys’ fees for a Song-Beverly action¿begins with the
“lodestar” approach, under which the Court fixes the lodestar¿at¿“the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Margolin
v. Regional Planning Com.¿(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004-1005.)
“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Ibid.)¿ “ ‘The reasonable hourly
rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.’ ” (Id.¿at p.
1004.) The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services¿provided.¿(Serrano v. Priest¿(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25,
49;¿PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler¿(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) 
 
            “[T]rial
courts need not, and indeed should not, become green-eyeshade accountants. The
essential goal in shifting fees (to either party) is to do rough justice, not
to achieve auditing perfection. So trial courts may take into account their
overall sense of a suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an
attorney's time.” (Fox v. Vice (2011) 563 U.S. 826, 838.)
 
Attorneys’ Fees
 
I.              
Hourly Rate: 
 
            In
assessing the reasonableness of hourly billing rates,¿“the court may rely on
its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the
experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees [citation],
the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied
[citations], and affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in
the community and rate determinations in other cases.”¿(569 East County
Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.¿(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th
426, 437; see¿Mountjoy v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th
266, 272 [“ ‘ “a reasonable hourly rate is the product of a multiplicity of
factors…[including] the level of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount
to be obtained in the litigation, the attorney’s reputation, and the undesirability
of the case” ’ ”].)¿
 
            Here,
Plaintiffs’ counsel seeks Court approval of hourly rates ranging from $675 to $350.
(Mot., 13:17-14:27.) Defendant challenges Plaintiffs’ counsels’ hourly
rates as unreasonable. 
 
A review of each declaration
submitted in support of the motion for attorney’s fees – which contains a
description of each attorneys’ education, date of law school graduation, bar
passage, and legal experience – Plaintiffs’ evidence demonstrates the significant
skill and expertise of Plaintiffs’ counsel. (Barry Decl., ¶¶ 26-27, 38-41; Quinn
Decl., ¶¶ 4-112; Matera Decl., ¶¶ 3-94; Rabieian Decl., ¶¶ 3-25; Kim Decl., ¶¶ 3-96;
Rosner Decl., ¶¶ 1-11 [expert declaration] Pascal Decl., ¶¶ 1-5; Kim Decl., ¶¶ 1-9.)

 
However – based on the Court’s
familiarity with the current local market, and Plaintiffs’ evidence of the
experience and skills of the various attorneys, and the non-complex nature of
the litigation – the Court finds that Plaintiffs' requested rates per hour are
excessive for a straightforward, simple lemon law case. Specifically, the Court
will apply counsel’s hourly rates as follows: Attorney Barry at an
hourly rate of $600; Attorney Quinn at an hourly rate of $550; Attorney Matera
at an hourly rate of $425; Attorney Rabieian at an hourly rate of $425; and
Attorney Kim at an hourly rate of $300.
 
As such, the Court will apply a
weighted blended rate of $438.[1]

 
II.            
Number of Hours Incurred: 
 
            Defendant GM
challenges the reasonableness of the number of hours incurred for various tasks
during this litigation.
 
Pre-engagement Work: Defendant argues that Attorney Barry
should not recover for the 1 hour for time incurred before Plaintiffs were even
clients of counsel’s firm. Specifically, counsel “billed” to “[r]eview repair
orders and research technical service bulletins and recalls[.]” (Barry Decl.,
Ex. 4, p. 1.) GM’s challenge is well-taken; although pre-litigation fees (fees
incurred prior to filing a complaint) are recoverable, this cost represents
time incurred before Plaintiffs were even clients and thus is more akin to a
business overhead costs in vetting potential clients than a litigation cost.
The fees are reduced by 1 hour ($438). 
 
Communications
Regarding Case Status: Defendant seeks to reduce .7 hours for communications with
Plaintiffs regarding the “case status” before counsel even “drafted” the
complaint. As noted above, pre-litigation fees are recoverable; here, these
pre-complaint fees are recoverable and not excessive.
 
Discovery: Plaintiffs’ counsel billed 4.8 hours to draft Plaintiffs’
discovery requests and the PMK deposition notice. Defendant
argues that this amount is excessive given Plaintiffs’ counsel’s reliance on templates.
This argument is well taken, especially given Plaintiffs’ counsel purported
expertise in this area of litigation. The Court will reduce the fees by 3
hours ($1,314).
 
Discovery Responses and Meet and Confer: Plaintiffs’ counsel billed a total
of 4 hours to review GM’s discovery responses and draft meet-and-confer
letters. (Barry Decl., Ex. 4, pp. 10-11.) Defendant argues that this amount is
excessive given Plaintiffs’ counsel’s reliance on templates and experience in
this area of the law. A reduction is warranted here for the same reasons as
identified in the Court’s reduction to the other discovery related fees.
However, Defendant’s reduction is too aggressive. The Court will reduce these
fees by 2 hours ($876). 
 
Demurrer to Complaint: Defendant argues Plaintiffs should
not recover 5.1 hours that counsel “billed” to “review” GM’s demurrer and
motion to strike and reply brief and to “draft” Plaintiffs’ opposition to GM’s
demurrer and motion to strike. (Barry Decl., Ex. 4, pp. 6-8.) Defendant’s
challenge to the fees are well taken given Plaintiffs’ counsel’s reliance on
templates and experience in this area of the law. The Court will reduce these
fees by 2 hours ($876).  
 
Demurrer to First Amended Complaint: Plaintiffs request 6 hours to
“review” GM’s demurrer and motion to strike and reply brief and to draft
Plaintiffs’ opposition to GM’s demurrer and motion to strike. (Barry Decl., Ex.
4, pp. 19-21.). For similar reasons as stated in on the Court’s ruling
on the demurrer to the Complaint, the Court will reduce the hours incurred for
this task by 3 hours ($1,314).
 
Preparing Discovery Responses— June 13 & 14, 2023; July
6 & 7, 2023:
Plaintiffs request 6.2 hours for reading GM’s discovery request and preparing
discovery responses. Defendant contends that these fees are unreasonable given
the use of templates and Plaintiffs’ experience with this type of case – noting
that there are numerous active cases pending against GM by this law firm. (Kay
Decl., ¶ 18.) A reduction is warranted here for the same reasons as identified
in the Court’s reduction to the other discovery related fees. However,
Defendant’s reduction is too aggressive. The Court will reduce these fees by 4 hours
($1,752). 
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production – July 28, 2023; December 1
& 4-6, 2023:
Plaintiffs seek 18.1 hours to draft multiple motions to compel further and
review oppositions, and draft the replies. A reduction is warranted here for
the same reasons as identified in the Court’s reduction to Plaintiff’s other
discovery related fees. Moreover, Plaintiffs only achieved minimal success on
these motions. (See 12/13/2023 Minute Order [denying most items in the motions
to compel further].) Nonetheless, Defendant’s reduction is too aggressive. The
Court will reduce fees by 12 hours ($5,256). 
 
Motion to Compel Deposition of GM’s Person Most
Knowledgeable—June 26, 28 & 30, 2024; July 20: Plaintiffs request 9.3 hours for
drafting, revise and the motion to compel deposition of Defendant’s PMK, review
the opposition, and reply. Although Plaintiffs’ counsel never took the
deposition, they are entitled to fees; however, the fees sought are excessive
for discovery given counsel’s experience with this type of litigation. The Court
will reduce the fees by 7 hours ($3,066). 
 
“Draft Memo for/to File”—June 14 & 20, 2023; September
26, 2023; December 12, 2023: Defendant argues Plaintiffs should not be able to recover
1.5 hours by Plaintiffs’ counsels for time incurred to draft a “memo for/to
file.” (Barry Decl., Ex. 4, pp. 11, 19, 26 & 33.) These tasks are not
clerical in nature and appear to be recoverable legal work. The Court is not inclined
to reduce the fees for this task.
 
Stipulated Protective Order—July 5, 2023: Defendant moves to strike .3 hours incurred
by Attorney Matera to “r]eview: and execute GM’s Proposed Stipulation and
Protective Order.” (Barry Decl., Ex. 4, p. 12.) Defendant argues that this is
the same protective order GM offers in all its cases with Counsel, and Attorney
Matera has reviewed this document numerous times.  However, Plaintiff’s
counsel has a duty to review and confirm the terms of the protective order even
if GM always provides the “same” one. The request to strike these fees is
denied.  
 
Attorneys’ Fees Demand—August 23, 2024; September 27, 2024
and TBD:
Plaintiffs requests fees for 12.3 hours incurred (or estimated to be incurred)
on their fee motion. Defendant again repeats similar arguments made stating
that Plaintiffs’ counsel largely relies on template work, which drastically reduces
the number of hours that may be reasonably requested for these tasks. The
argument is well taken. The Court will reduce fees by 8 hours ($3,504).
 
            Multiplier
adjustment:
 
            Finally,
Plaintiffs seek a 1.25 lodestar multiplier based on the risk of taking this
case on contingency, the delay in payment and based on the public interests at
issue in this matter.  
 
            Relevant
factors to determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  
 
            Although
this matter was taken on contingency (Barry Decl., ¶¶ 40-43), none of the other
factors support the application of a multiplier. This was a garden variety
Song-Beverly case; there were no novel or difficult questions presented. (Thayer
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819, 834.) Further,
the¿contingent risks, skill, and difficulty¿that Plaintiffs’ attorneys¿assert are
absorbed by¿their¿already high hourly rates. (See¿Robertson v. Fleetwood
Travel Trailers of California. Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 822.) 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ request for a lodestar multiplier is denied.
 
            After
applying the weighted blended attorney fee rate, the total lodestar fees
requested are $44,719.80. Other adjustments to attorneys’ fees are summarized
as follows:

$26,323.80




 
            The Court
grants Plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees in the sum of $26,323.80.
 
Costs: 
 
Finally, Defendant challenges
Plaintiffs’ request for costs seeking a reduction of $919.99. 
 
Item No. 2 – jury fees: Defendant
argues that it should not have to cover Plaintiff’s jury fee of $150 when the
case never went to trial. This cost was reasonably necessary to the litigation even
if the case did not go to trial. The request to strike this cost is denied. 
 
Item No. 2 – court reporter:
Plaintiff seeks $550 in court reporter fees for the hearing on the fee motion.
Defendant argues that these fees are not recoverable because they have not yet
been “actually incurred.” These costs can be assessed at the time of the
hearing when they will arguably be incurred. 
 
Item No.
14—Fees for electronic filing or service: Plaintiff seeks $219.99 in “[f]ees
for electronic filing and service.” Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ counsel
provides no explanation for these alleged costs. Although these costs may be
recoverable, the reply does not further substantiate these costs and,
therefore, Plaintiff has not met its burden for this cost. Accordingly, these
costs will be stricken in their entirety. 
 
Accordingly, the Court will grant costs in the reduced
amount of $1,248.23 (a reduction of $769.99).
            
Conclusion
 
            The motion
for attorneys’ fees and costs is granted in part. In sum, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees in the total
amount of $26,323.80, which is a reduction of the
lodestar amount by $18,396. The request for costs is granted in the
amount of $1,248.23.  
 
            Defendant
GM is ordered to pay to Plaintiffs’ counsel the sum of $27,572.03 ($26,323.80 +
$1,248.23) for attorneys’ fees and costs on or before December 16,
2024.
