[1] The Court reached this blended rate by first reducing each attorney’s
hourly rate by the amounts stated to reach a reasonable hourly rate. Then, the
Court multiplied
this reduced hourly rate of each attorney involved in a case by the hours they
worked, then added up those totals and divided by the total hours incurred for
the entire case, essentially giving the Court a single rate representing the
combined cost of all attorneys working on the matter based on their workload.
The math was as follows: 15.9 x 600 =9,540 (Barry); 3.6 x 550 =1,980 (Quinn);
26.6 x 425 = 11,305 (Matera); 40.8 x 425 = 17,340 (Rabieian); 15.2 x 300 =
4,560 (Kim). These amounts were then added together, equaling 44,725. Then,
this amount (44,725) was divided by the total hours incurred (102.1) for a
blended rate of $438 per hour.
