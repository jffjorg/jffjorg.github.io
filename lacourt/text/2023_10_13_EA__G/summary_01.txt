The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Dear John Denim, Inc. and Chiu Fai Yeung to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) of Gladden Makin House, Ltd. and Derek Wong is sustained with 10 days leave to amend. The court finds that the FAC fails to cure the defects of the original complaint and that Dear John did not breach the alleged sale agreements with Makin International, Inc. The court concludes that Gladden's FAC does not state a cause of action for breach of contract with third-party beneficiary, as it does not allege that Dear John committed a breach of contract.
