And here is the summary in English text:

This is a breach of contract case between Colorado Bankers Life Insurance Company (CBL) and Avalon By The Sea AC, LLC. CBL provided financing to Avalon and is secured by a first lien on virtually all of Avalon's assets. Avalon defaulted on its debt to CBL and CBL has a security interest in all of Avalon's assets. The Court appointed a Receiver to take control of Avalon's assets and manage them. The Receiver has been marketing the assets for over 5 years and has entered into several letters of intent and negotiated purchase and sale agreements with prospective buyers. However, the buyers failed to post the required earnest money deposit. The Receiver has now received an offer to purchase the assets from Benjamin Deutsche and has entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with him. The Court grants the Receiver's motion to approve the sale of the Avalon assets.
