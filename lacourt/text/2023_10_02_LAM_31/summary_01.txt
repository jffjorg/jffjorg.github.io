The court has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion to enforce the settlement agreement against Oak Remodeling, Inc. The parties had stipulated to a settlement agreement in May 2021, which provided for the defendant to make periodic payments of $625 per month, with a total payment of $10,000.

The defendant is ordered to pay the remaining balance of $2,160.
