Plaintiff’s Unoposed Motion to Enforce the Settlement is GRANTED.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP section 664.6
provides that “[i]f parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff
moves for an order pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 to enforce the settlement against defendant
1 Oak Remodeling, Inc. for the remaining balance of $2,160. Defendant made
periodic payments toward the $10,000 settlement but stopped making payments in
November 2022.
“[W]here the plaintiff has filed a voluntary dismissal of an action …,
the court is without jurisdiction to act further …, and any subsequent orders
of the court are simply void.” (Paniagua v. Orange County Fire Auth. (2007) 149
Cal.App.4th 83, 89, (internal quotes omitted).) The result is different where a
signed, written settlement agreement (or oral settlement before the court)
states the court retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement because that
agreement could be enforced under C.C.P. § 664.6. (See Wackeen v. Malis
(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 439-440; Khavarian Enterprises, Inc. v. Commline,
Inc. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 310, 326—court had continuing jurisdiction to
consider attorney fees and costs motions after dismissal where settlement
agreement provided court retained jurisdiction to enforce agreement pursuant to
CCP § 664.6.))
 
C.C.P. § 664.6(a) states: “If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement.” Counsel may
sign the request on behalf of their clients (C.C.P. § 664.6(b)(2) (added eff.
1/1/21)). The request should be made while the court still has jurisdiction. (Wackeen
v. Malis, supra, 97 CA4th at 433; see Sayta v. Chu (2017) 17
Cal.App.5th 960, 962.)
Here, pursuant
to paragraph 3 of the parties’ settlement agreement, Defendant was to pay
Plaintiff as follows: $10,000: $2,500 within 7 business days of the receipt of
a fully executed agreement, and thereafter make twelve consecutive monthly
payments in the amount of $625 to commence 30 days/a month after the initial
payment. (Rose Decl., ¶ 2; attachment ¶ 3.) 
Further, the parties stipulated that the Court may retain jurisdiction
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the settlement terms.
(5/6/21 Stipulation.) The Court also signed an order pursuant to the parties’
stipulation to retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6.
(5/6/2021
Order.) 
Defendant made periodic
payments, but stopped making payments in November 2022. (Rose Decl., ¶ 3.) The
balance still owed is $2,160. (Id., ¶
4.)
Therefore, as the Court retained
jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, the motion is GRANTED. 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce the Settlement is
GRANTED. 
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice.
