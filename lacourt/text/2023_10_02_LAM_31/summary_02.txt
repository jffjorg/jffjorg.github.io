  - "The moving party must support their motion with a meet and confer declaration."
  - "The Court orders the parties to meet and confer to draft a stipulated protective order confining the scope of disclosure and use of the raw test data and audio-recording of the interview and examination."
  - "The protective order should include instructions to destroy the material at the conclusion of the matter."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part the defendant's motion to compel a mental examination of the plaintiff. The examination will be limited to the issues in controversy in the case, and the raw test data and audio recordings of the examination will be produced to the plaintiff's counsel. The parties will need to meet and confer to draft a stipulated protective order that confining the scope of disclosure and use of the raw test data and audio recordings. The protective order should include instructions to destroy the material at the conclusion of the matter.

The judge has also ordered the parties to meet and confer to draft a stipulated protective order confining the scope of disclosure and use of the raw test data and audio recordings. The protective order should include instructions to destroy the material at the conclusion of the matter.

The judge has rejected the defendant's argument that producing the raw test data and audio recordings would violate the ethical obligations of the psychologists conducting the examination. The judge has noted that the psychologists could fulfill their ethical obligations by agreeing to a protective order.

The judge has also rejected the defendant's argument that the protective order would not provide adequate protection for the highly sensitive test data. The judge has noted that the protective order would ensure that the test data is only used for the purposes of the litigation and is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals.

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel a mental examination of the plaintiff, but has limited the scope of the examination to the issues in controversy in the case. The judge has also ordered the parties to meet and confer to draft a stipulated protective order confining the scope of disclosure and use of the raw test data and audio recordings.
