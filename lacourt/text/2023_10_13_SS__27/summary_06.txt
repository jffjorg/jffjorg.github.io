And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ariana Escobar v. Classic Motor Inn, Inc., et al. The case involves an expedited petition to approve a minor's compromise, where the plaintiff, Ariana Escobar, has agreed to settle her claims against the defendants in exchange for $4,999.99. The court has reviewed the petition and found that the plaintiff has cured the defects noted in the court's previous order. However, the court cannot approve the petition because the plaintiff has not filed an amended Form MC-355. The court has continued the status conference to October 27, 2023, and ordered the plaintiff to file an amended Form MC-355 no later than 5 court days before the conference.
