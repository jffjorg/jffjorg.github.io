PETITION
FOR RELIEF FROM LATE GOVERNMENT CLAIM 
PURSUANT
TO GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION 946.6 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff/Petitioner
Aurora Blanco
 
RESPONDING PARTY:      Respondent Los
Angeles Unified School District
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On June 28, 2022, Plaintiff, Aurora Blanco, filed this
action against Defendant, City of Los Angeles (“City”), for injuries and
damages arising from a trip and fall on an uneven portion of a sidewalk.  The subject sidewalk was controlled by Los
Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”).
 
Relevant Procedural Background
 
The alleged accident took place on December 19, 2021.  Plaintiff presented the City, a governmental
entity, with a claim for the incident on May 19, 2022.  The claim was timely filed, however Plaintiff
presented the claim to the wrong entity.  The City rejected the claim on July 13, 2022.  
 
On January 6, 2023, the City filed an Answer and a
cross-complaint against LAUSD.
 
On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff submitted a claim to LAUSD.  On January 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
Amendment to the Complaint naming LAUSD as Doe 1.
 
On February 2, 2023, LAUSD rejected Plaintiff’s claim form
for being untimely. 
 
On May 19, 2023, Petitioner filed an application for leave
to present a late claim to the Board of Directors for the LAUSD.  The application was denied on June 7, 2023.
On September 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed this Petition for Relief
from Late Government Claim Against the Los Angeles Unified School District
Pursuant to Government Code Section 946.6. 

 
LAUSD filed an opposition.[1]  Plaintiff did not reply.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Except as provided in Sections
946.4 and 946.6, a written claim must be presented to a public entity and must
be denied or deemed denied before a suit for money or damages may be brought
against the public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is required to
be presented.  (Gov. Code, § 945.4; Munoz
v. State of California (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1777.)  The claim
must be filed within six months.  (Gov.
Code, § 911.2, subd. (a); Munoz, 33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1777.)
 
When a claim that is required by
Section 911.2 to be presented not later than six months after the accrual of
the cause of action is not presented within that time, a written application
may be made to the public entity for leave to present that claim.  (Gov. Code, § 911.4, subd. (a).) The
application shall be presented to the public entity as provided in Article 2
(commencing with Section 915) within a reasonable time not to exceed one year
after the accrual of the cause of action and shall state the reason for the
delay in presenting the claim.  The
proposed claim shall be attached to the application.  (Gov. Code, § 911.4, subd. (b).)
 
If an injured party who has failed
to timely file a claim has submitted a written application to the public entity
for leave to present such claim and the application has been denied, the
injured party may petition to the court for relief from the claim
requirements.¿ A petition pursuant to Government Code section 946.6 must be
“filed within six months after the application to the board is denied or deemed
to be denied pursuant to section 911.6.”¿ (Gov. Code, § 946.6, subd. (b); see
also City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 621,
627.)¿¿ 
 
Section 946.6 further provides, in
relevant part: 
 
The petition shall show each of
the following:  (1) That application was made to the board under
Section 911.4 and was denied or deemed denied. (2) The reason for failure
to present the claim within the time limit specified in Section 911.2. (3)
The information required by Section 910.  (Gov. Code, § 946.6, subd. (b).) 
 
The court shall relieve the
petitioner from the requirements of Section 945.4 if the court finds that the
application to the board under Section 911.4 was made within a reasonable time
not to exceed that specified in subdivision (b) of Section 911.4 and was denied
or deemed denied pursuant to Section 911.6 and that one or more of the
following is applicable: 
 
(1)¿The failure to present the
claim was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect unless
the public entity establishes that it would be prejudiced in the defense of the
claim if the court relieves the petitioner from the requirements of Section
945.4. 
 
(2)¿The person who sustained the alleged injury, damage, or
loss was a minor during all of the time specified in Section 911.2 for the
presentation of the claim. 
 
(3)¿The person who sustained the
alleged injury, damage, or loss was a minor during any of the time specified in
Section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim, provided the application is
presented within six months of the person turning 18 years of age or a year
after the claim accrues, whichever occurs first. 
 
(4)¿The person who sustained the
alleged injury, damage, or loss was physically or mentally incapacitated during
all of the time specified in Section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim
and by reason of that disability failed to present a claim during that time. 
 
(5)¿The person who sustained the
alleged injury, damage, or loss was physically or mentally incapacitated during
any of the time specified in Section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim
and by reason of that disability failed to present a claim during that time,
provided the application is presented within six months of the person no longer
being physically or mentally incapacitated, or a year after the claim accrues,
whichever occurs first. 
 
(6)¿The person who sustained the
alleged injury, damage, or loss died before the expiration of the time
specified in Section 911.2 for the presentation of the claim. 
 
(Gov. Code, § 946.6, subd. (c).) 
 
III.      JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            LAUSD
requests judicial notice of nine documents and fact propositions.  The unopposed requests are GRANTED.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subds. (c), (d), and
(h).)
 
IV.       DISCUSSION
 
A petition for section 946.6
relief must show all the following: (1) That application was made to the board
under Section 911.4 and was denied or deemed denied. (2) The reason for
failure to present the claim within the time limit specified in Section 911.2. (3)
The information required by Section 910.  (Gov. Code, § 946.6, subd. (b).) 
 
Plaintiff argues relief from the claim requirement is
mandatory because she has satisfied the procedural requirements set forth under
Government Code sections 911.4, 911.6, and 946.6.  Specifically, Plaintiff argues she did not
timely file a claim with LAUSD because Plaintiff mistakenly believed the City owned
and controlled the subject sidewalk. 
Thus, Plaintiff inadvertently filed her claim with the City and not
LAUSD.
 
LAUSD argues the Petition lacks merit for at least three
reasons: (1) Plaintiff did not submit her claim to LAUSD within one year after
accrual of the cause of action; (2) Plaintiff does not meet her burden of proof
to establish LAUSD owned or controlled the subject sidewalk, and relatedly, (3)
Plaintiff does not establish her untimely claim is the result of mistake,
inadvertence, and excusable neglect.
 
Further briefing
is necessary.  “When a claim that is
required by Section 911.2 to be presented not later than six months after the accrual
of the cause of action is not presented within that time, a written application
may be made to the public entity for leave to present that claim.  The application shall
be presented to the public entity ... within a reasonable time not to exceed
one year after the accrual of the cause of action ....”  (Gov. Code, § 911.4, subds. (a)-(b), emphasis added.)  “The accrual date for presenting a government
tort claim is determined by the rules applicable to determining when any
ordinary cause of action accrues. (§ 901.) That date may be postponed under the
delayed discovery doctrine. [Citation.] Under this doctrine, a cause of action
does not accrue until the plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover, the
cause of action.  [Citation.]  A plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of
action when he or she has reason to at least suspect a factual basis for its
elements.”  (S.M. v. Los Angeles Unified
Sch. Dist. (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 712, 717.)
 
Here, neither party addresses the accrual issue.  LAUSD argues the claim accrued exactly one
year after the alleged incident occurred. 
However, LAUSD does not address how Plaintiff’s delayed discovery of
LAUSD impacts the accrual analysis. 
Plaintiff, on the other hand, does not identify the facts or otherwise explain
when she learned LAUSD was the proper entity to present her claim and/or how these
facts impact the accrual analysis.  The
Court continues the hearing and orders further briefing on the issue of
accrual. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
Accordingly, the petition is CONTINUED to November 17, 2023
at 1:30 PM.  The parties are directed to file
further briefing on the accrual issue. 
Plaintiff may file a supplemental brief no later than October 27,
2023.  LAUSD may file a response no later
than November 13, 2023.  Supplemental
briefing is not to exceed 7 pages. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
