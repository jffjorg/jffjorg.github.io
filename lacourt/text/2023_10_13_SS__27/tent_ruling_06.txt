CASE:                                Ariana Escobar v. Classic Motor Inn, Inc., et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 22STCV14334
 





















 
EXPEDITED
PETITION TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioner
William Escobar
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
            Claimant,
Ariana Escobar, a minor, by and through her parent and guardian ad litem, Petitioner,
William Escobar, has agreed to settle her claims against Defendants
Classic Motor Inn, Inc., G6 Hospitality LLC, and G6 Hospitality Franchising,
LLC in exchange for $4,999.99.
 
            The
Court reviewed the Petition on July 13, 2023. 
The Court noted several defects and continued the hearing to allow
Petitioner to file an amended Petition.
 
            On
July 28, 2023, Petitioner filed an amended Petition.  The Court could not approve the Petition because
the Petitioner intended to deposit the settlement balance in a Well Fargo Bank
in Phoenix, Arizona despite selecting Item 19b(2) which provides deposit of the
settlement balance in a financial institution in the State of California.  
 
            On
September 1, 2023, Petitioner filed an amended Petition.  The Court found Petitioner had cured the
defects noted in the Court’s previous order. 
The Court further found the settlement and request for attorney’s fees
to be fair and reasonable.  However, the
Petition could not be approved because Petitioner did not submit an amended
Form MC-355.
            
            The
Court notes that an amend Form MC-355 has not been filed.  
 
            Accordingly,
the Status Conference for the Petition is CONTINUED to October 27, 2023, at 8:30
a.m. in Department 27 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  Petitioner is to file an amended Form MC-355
no later than 5 court days before the conference.
 
Moving party to give notice.
