And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Kerry Bensinger in the case of Donald Jenkins, Jr. v. City of Los Angeles. The case is about a motion for relief from waiver of a jury trial. The Plaintiff, Donald Jenkins, Jr., filed a complaint against the City of Los Angeles on April 13, 2021, and the City demanded a jury trial. The Plaintiff posted jury fees on August 4, 2022, but this was more than 365 days after the filing of the initial complaint, which waives the right to a jury trial. The Plaintiff is now seeking relief from this waiver.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff is entitled to relief from the waiver of the jury trial, as both parties sought a jury trial and there is no opposition to the motion. The Court grants the motion and allows the Plaintiff to have a jury trial.
