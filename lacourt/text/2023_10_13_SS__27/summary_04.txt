And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Kerry Bensinger in the case of Letisia Torres, et al. v. Margaret Juarez, M.D., et al. (Case No. 21STCV38524). The case involves a medical malpractice action against AHMC San Gabriel Valley Medical Center LP and others, alleging negligence in the delivery of a set of twins, resulting in significant injuries to one of the twins and the death of the other.

The tentative ruling grants the Application for Determination of Good Faith Settlement filed by the settling defendant, AHMC San Gabriel Valley Medical Center LP, finding that the settlement was made in good faith. The settlement agreement provides for a payment of $9,975,000 to the plaintiffs.

The ruling also addresses a Petition to Approve Minor's Compromise filed by Letisia Torres, as Guardian ad Litem for her minor daughter, Darlene Ramirez. The petition seeks approval of a proposed trust instrument, which provides for the distribution of settlement proceeds to pay medical expenses, attorney's fees, and other expenses. The court finds that the proposed trust instrument meets the requirements of California law and grants the petition.

The ruling notes that the proposed trust instrument provides for the trustee to take fees on an interim periodic basis and to invest in proprietary funds, mutual funds, and bonds with maturity dates greater than five years. The court also finds that the settlement proceeds do not exceed the amount reasonably necessary to meet the special needs of the minor beneficiary.

The ruling is subject to change based on the submissions of the parties and any appearances at the hearing.
