And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to continue the trial date. The trial date was originally set for March 18, 2024, but the defendant has argued that it needs more time to complete discovery and prepare for a summary judgment motion, which is currently set for March 26, 2024. The Court has determined that good cause exists to continue the trial date due to the defendant's need to complete discovery and prepare for the summary judgment motion. The Court has also continued all related deadlines, including the discovery cut-off date and the summary judgment motion hearing date, to the new trial date of September 19, 2024.
