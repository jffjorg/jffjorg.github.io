And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by Plaintiff Gavin Polone against Defendant Shawmut Woodworking & Supply Inc. et al. The demurrer was filed by Shawmut in response to the SAC's allegations of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.

The Judge granted the request for judicial notice and reviewed the SAC's allegations. The SAC alleges that Schram, an employee of Shawmut, made misrepresentations to Polone in December 2017, inducing Polone to sign a contract with Shawmut instead of Winters-Schram. The SAC also alleges that Polone incurred damages of over $3 million as a result of the misrepresentations.

The Judge found that the SAC does not meet the heightened pleading standard for fraud because it does not allege where, how, and by what means the misrepresentations were made. However, the Judge also found that the SAC's allegations of Schram's agency with Shawmut and the representations made in December 2017 are sufficient to plead the fraudulent inducement theory.

The Judge sustained the demurrer with 10 days' leave to amend, allowing Polone to cure the deficiencies in the SAC.
