And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Plaintiff Wendy Klenk's motion for a new trial and motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) on her causes of action for Tortious Breach of the Warranty of Habitability and Breach of the Implied Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment.

Plaintiff contends that the court erred in excluding evidence of certain test results showing the levels of formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds, and that the court should have allowed into evidence its ruling on the preliminary injunction. However, the court finds that the exclusion of the test results was proper as they were excluded as hearsay, and that the preliminary injunction orders were properly excluded from the record at trial.

Plaintiff also argues that the jury failed to consider the binding impact of the admissions by Defendants' corporate designee that Plaintiff's apartment home was uninhabitable due to the "presence of potentially dangerous chemicals" and that the apartment had been under construction since November 2022 through the time of trial and therefore was uninhabitable during that time frame. However, the court finds that while the presence of potentially dangerous chemicals may be a material breach of habitability, Plaintiff does not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim, and that the jury's finding of no liability on the habitability and quiet enjoyment claims is supported by substantial evidence.

Finally, the court finds that Plaintiff's JNOV motion is denied because Plaintiff fails to cite evidence which would support Defendants' liability as a matter of law, and that the jury's findings are supported by substantial evidence.
