                         Plaintiff,
            v.
 
ADRIAN AVILA, et al., 
                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  24STCV17129
  Hearing Date:  November 20, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for leave to file
  first amended complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 10, 2024, Plaintiff the
Labor Commissioner of the State of California filed this action against various
defendants for foreclosure of mechanics’ liens, unpaid wages and related
penalties, rest break premiums, and itemized wage statement penalties on behalf
of ten construction day laborers. 
            On October 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. 
LEGAL STANDARD
The court may, in furtherance of justice,
and on such terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc, §§ 473(a), 576.) Courts must apply a policy of liberality in
permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding, including during trial,
when no prejudice to the opposing party is shown. (Duchrow v. Forrest
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377.) In determining the extent of prejudice to
the opposing party, the court must consider various factors, such as whether
the amendment would delay trial or increase the discovery burden. (Demetriades
v. Yelp, Inc. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 294, 306.)
A motion for leave to amend a complaint
must be accompanied by a declaration that explains: (1) the effect of the
amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts
giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why
the request for amendment was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule
3.1324(b).)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks to amend the
complaint to rectify certain drafting errors: (i) correct the name of a
defendant; (ii) remove the allegation that the mechanics’ liens were recorded
within 90 days after the laborers finished their work; and (iii) reduce
liability on the sixth cause of action to two defendants rather than all
defendants. (Hung Decl. ¶¶ 3-6.) 
            These changes are necessary to
rectify drafting errors. There is no fundamental change to the nature of the
complaint, and no prejudice to Defendants. Thus, the Court finds good cause for
the amendment. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file
first amended complaint is GRANTED.
