And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Green Financial LLC's motion to compel arbitration in an employment discrimination action brought by Edward Casillas (now represented by his mother Terry Casillas as his successor-in-interest) against Liberty Life National Insurance Company and others.

The Court has already granted Liberty Life National Insurance Company's motion to compel arbitration based on an Independent Agent Contract between the parties. The current motion is based on the same contract, but seeks to compel arbitration by Green Financial LLC, a non-signatory to the contract.

The Court finds that the allegations in the complaint treat Liberty Life National Insurance Company and Green Financial LLC as identical entities and accuses them of identical misconduct, making it unfair to allow the Plaintiff to invoke agency principles to favor one over the other. Therefore, the Court grants Defendant Green Financial LLC's motion to compel arbitration, despite being a non-signatory to the contract.
