  Case No.:  24STCV16208
  Hearing Date:  November 20, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to deem matters
  admitted (CRS# 1884) 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 28, 2024, Plaintiff Javier
De La Rosa filed this action against Defendants Fat-Buffalo Foods, Inc. and
Sherry Doe, asserting causes of action for (1) discrimination, (2) wrongful
termination, (3) retaliation, (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress,
and (5) harassment. 
            On October 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to deem matters admitted against Defendant Fat-Buffalo
Foods, Inc.. Defendant has not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff served the subject
discovery on July 12, 2024. (Rosa Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant did not respond by the
statutory deadline of August 16, 2024. (Id., ¶ 4.) Thereafter, Plaintiff
reached out to Defendant inquiring about the responses, and Defendant requested
an extension. (Id., ¶¶ 5-6.) Plaintiff agreed to give Defendant until
October 10, 2024 to respond. (Id., ¶ 7.) Defendant did not provide
responses by October 10, 2024. (Id., ¶ 8.) This motion followed. 
            The record indicates that Defendants
have failed to timely respond to the subject discovery, even after a voluntary
extension. The matters in RFAs Set One will be deemed admitted unless Defendant
serves substantially compliant responses before the hearing on the motion. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to deem matters
admitted is GRANTED unless Defendant serves substantially compliant responses
before the hearing on the motion.
