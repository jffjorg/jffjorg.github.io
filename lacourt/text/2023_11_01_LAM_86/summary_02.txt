Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a denial of the petition for writ of mandate and declaratory relief filed by Greenenvtech, LLC and Greenenvtech Grow, LLC against the County of Los Angeles and Kerstin Schlegel. The petitioners seek to rescind the notice of building code violations and obtain an appeal hearing. The court finds that the petitioners have failed to file an opening brief or present evidence to support their claims, and therefore have not met their burden of demonstrating error. The court further finds that the petitioners have not overcome the presumption of regularity contained in Evidence Code section 664, and that their failure to file a memorandum in support of their motion is fatal to their claims. The remaining causes of action are transferred to Department 1 for reassignment to a non-writ department.
