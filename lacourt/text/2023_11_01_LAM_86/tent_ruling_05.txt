against Defendant for claim and delivery.
 
On July 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed this application
for writ of possession.  
 
On August 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint.
 
Plaintiff has not filed proof of service of the
summons, complaint, application for writ of possession, or notice of hearing on
Defendant. 
 
Defendant has not filed any opposition to the
application for writ of possession.  
 
SUMMARY OF
APPLICABLE LAW 
 
“Upon the
filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply
pursuant to this chapter for a writ of possession by filing a written
application for the writ with the court in which the action is brought.” (Code
Civ. Proc.,[1] §
512.010, subd. (a).)
              
Pursuant to section
512.010, subdivision (b), the application must be submitted under oath and
include:
 
(1) A showing of the basis of the
plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the
property claimed. If the basis of the plaintiff's claim is a written
instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be attached.
 
(2) A showing that the property is
wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the manner in which the defendant came
into possession of the property, and, according to the best knowledge,
information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the reason for the detention.
 
(3) A particular description of the
property and a statement of its value.
 
(4) A statement, according to the best
knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the location of the
property and, if the property, or some part of it, is within a private place
which may have to be entered to take possession, a showing that there is
probable cause to believe that such property is located there.
 
(5) A statement that the property has not
been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant to a statute; or seized
under an execution against the property of the plaintiff; or, if so seized,
that it is by statute exempt from such seizure.
 
“The writ
will be issued if the court finds that the plaintiff's claim is probably valid
and the other requirements for issuing the writ are established.” (§
512.040(b).) “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than not
that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.”
(§ 511.090.)  
 
Prior to the
issuance of a writ of possession, the laintiff must file an undertaking “in an
amount not less than twice the value of the defendant's interest in the
property or in a greater amount.” (§ 515.010, subd. (a).)  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
No Proof of Service 
 
Before the
hearing on the application for writ of possession, the defendant must be served
with (1) a copy of the summons and complaint; (2) a notice of application and hearing;
and (3) a copy of the application and any affidavit in support thereof. (§
512.030.)
 
Plaintiff has not filed proof of service of the
summons, complaint, application for writ of possession, or notice of hearing on
Defendant.  Accordingly, the application
must be DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
 
Probable
Cause re: Location of the Vehicle
 
Pursuant to section
512.010, subdivision (b)(4), the application must include: 
 
(4) A statement, according to the best
knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the location of the
property and, if the property, or some part of it, is within a private place
which may have to be entered to take possession, a showing that there is
probable cause to believe that such property is located there.
 
Because the
application asks for an order permitting a levying officer to enter private
property and take possession of the Vehicle, Plaintiff must establish “probable
cause” to believe the Vehicle is located at the property. (§§ 512.010(b)(4),
512.080.)   
 
Plaintiff
seeks a writ of possession authorizing entry into the following private places
to take possession of the Vehicle: 
 
·       1225 W 38th St, Los Angeles, California  
·       2950 5th St, Apartment 7, Chino, California
 
In his
declaration, Plaintiff’s representative states: “The file of Plaintiff reflects that defendant Hector
Ramos resides at 1225 W 38th St, Los Angeles, CA 90037 and also at 2950 5th St
Apt 7 Chino, CA 91710. In reliance upon the information contained in the file
and computer system of Plaintiff pertaining to the subject motor vehicle, to
the best of my knowledge, information and belief, the current location of the
subject motor vehicle is as follows: 1225 W 38th St, Los Angeles, CA 90037 or
2950 5th St 16 Apt 7 Chino, CA 91710.” 
(Singleton Decl. ¶ 10.)  
 
This evidence does not establish probable
cause to believe the Vehicle is located at one of the stated locations. Plaintiff
does not submit evidence that process servers or other agents observed the
Vehicle at either location; or that Plaintiff has any other current information
in its files showing the Vehicle may be found at the identified locations. The
sales contract and certificate of title show a different address for Defendant
in Beltsville, Maryland. (Id., Exh. A.) 
Plaintiff has not filed proof of service showing personal or substitute
service on Defendant at 1225 W 38th St,
Los Angeles, California or 2950 5th St 16 Apartment 7 in Chino, California.
 
Because Plaintiff has not shown probable
cause to believe the Vehicle is located at the stated addresses, the
application is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The application is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
 
 IT IS SO ORDERED.
