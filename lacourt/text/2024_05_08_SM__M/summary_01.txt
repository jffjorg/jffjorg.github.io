And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration is granted, and the court orders the plaintiff's claims to arbitration. The court finds that the defendants did not waive their right to arbitrate, despite the delay in filing the arbitration motion. The court notes that the defendants immediately notified the plaintiff of their arbitration defense in their answer, and the action was stayed pending appeal of the anti-SLAPP ruling. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not shown any prejudice as a result of the delay. The court orders the entire action to be stayed pending the completion of the arbitration, and sets a status conference for April 3, 2025.
