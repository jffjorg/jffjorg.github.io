And here is the English-text summary:

This is the tentative ruling on a demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint in the case of LMS v. WLS et al. The defendant, Lauren Sanchez, demurred to the first and second causes of action, arguing that the plaintiff's breach of contract claim fails because the contract does not demonstrate an eighteen-week term. The court finds that the contract does not demonstrate an ambiguity and that the parties did not agree to an eighteen-week term without conditions. The court also finds that the plaintiff does not allege any facts that show the agreement was extended beyond the initial term. As such, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The court also sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges an oral contract. The anti-SLAPP motion is deemed moot.
