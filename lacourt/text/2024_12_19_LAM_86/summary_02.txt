And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Christian Arturo Llamas Corona v. Claudia Llamas et al. The ruling states that all evidentiary objections are overruled, and the court will not consider any evidence submitted after the plaintiff filed his reply. The court also denied all requests for judicial notice, finding them unnecessary to the resolution of the issues.

The plaintiff, Christian Arturo Llamas Corona, alleges that he is the sole shareholder and rightful owner of Yellow Owl Properties Managements, Inc. He relies on a copy of the SS-4 form and a copy of a stock certificate to establish his ownership. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's evidence is insufficient and that he has failed to meet his burden of establishing his standing to bring an action under Corporations Code Section 709.

The court also notes that the defendants contend that they are the owners of Yellow Owl based on an amendment to a trust, and that the plaintiff is disputing the validity of the amendment in a probate proceeding. Given the pendency of the probate proceeding and the plaintiff's slight and insufficient evidence, the court cannot make any determination regarding the plaintiff's shareholder status.

The court declines to find that the plaintiff is a director of Yellow Owl and expresses no opinion on who the shareholders or directors of Yellow Owl are. The court's ruling is based on the record before it and does not reach the issues of who the shareholders or directors of Yellow Owl are.
