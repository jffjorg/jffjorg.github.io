  Case Number:  21STCV12097    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2024    Dept:  N This Motion:  Defendants Wellness Wave, LLC and Liza Vismanos’s Motion for an Order to Seal Settlement Agreement is GRANTED.TENTATIVE RULINGDefendants Wellness Wave, LLC and Liza Vismanos’s Motion for an Order to Seal Settlement Agreement is GRANTED.Defendants Wellness Wave, LLC and Liza Vismanos to give notice. REASONINGThe trial court “may order that a record be filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.” (McGuan v. Endovascular Techs., Inc. (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 974, 988, paragraph breaks omitted.)Defendants Wellness Wave, LLC and Liza Vismanos move the Court for an order allowing them to seal the details of their settlement with Plaintiffs Rose Lynch and Michael Lynch, consistent with the parties’ confidential Settlement Agreement and General Release, on the ground the terms of the settlement agreement are confidential, as the parties agreed not to disclose the agreement’s terms, and disclosure of the details would violate the settlement agreement.While a stipulation between the parties to keep the terms of a settlement confidential does not itself provide a basis for the Court to seal portions of the motion, as there is a right of public access to court records, the Court finds it proper to seal the redacted portions of the motion, as there is an interest in encouraging settlements, and Defendants Wellness Wave, LLC and Liza Vismanos have narrowly tailored their redactions to only the specific terms of the agreement between the parties. Accordingly, Defendants Wellness Wave, LLC and Liza Vismanos’s Motion for an Order to Seal Settlement Agreement is GRANTED.
