The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion by defendants Wellness Wave, LLC and Liza Vismanos to seal the details of their settlement agreement with plaintiffs Rose Lynch and Michael Lynch.

The court finds that the interests of encouraging settlements outweigh the public's right to access the court records, and the defendants' redactions are narrowly tailored to only the specific terms of the agreement.
