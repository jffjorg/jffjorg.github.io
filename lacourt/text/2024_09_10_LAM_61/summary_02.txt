And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the joint motion filed by the parties to deem the present action related to six other pending matters. The cases involve similar claims and transactions, including allegations of violations of the covenant of habitability owed by the defendants to tenants residing at two properties in Los Angeles. The judge finds that trying these cases before separate courts would risk substantial duplication of judicial resources, and therefore grants the motion. The parties will need to provide notice of the ruling.
