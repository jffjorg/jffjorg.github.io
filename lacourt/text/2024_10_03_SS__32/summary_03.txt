```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against State Farm. The defendant claims that State Farm denied liability under their homeowner's insurance policy, and the cross-complaint alleges eight causes of action against State Farm, including breach of contract, bad faith denial of insurance claim, and fraud. The judge finds that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises from the same occurrence as the original complaint, and that granting leave to file the cross-complaint is in the interest of justice. The defendant must file and serve the cross-complaint within 10 days of the order.
