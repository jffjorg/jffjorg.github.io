The judge has denied the motion, finding that there are triable issues of fact regarding whether the injury occurred in the course of employment. The judge has also found that Defendant failed to meet its burden to show the absence of a triable issue of fact that Plaintiff's action is barred by workers' compensation exclusivity. The judge has also rejected Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's injury arose out of and in the course of employment, as well as Defendant's argument that Plaintiff was compensated by receiving workers' compensation coverage. The judge has ordered that Defendant give notice of the Court's order and file a proof of service of such.
