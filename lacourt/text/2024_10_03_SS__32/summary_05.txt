And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice. This means that the plaintiff can no longer pursue their claims against the defendant. The judge reached this decision because the plaintiff failed to file a second amended complaint after the court sustained the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike. The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, and since the plaintiff did not file an opposition, the court found that the motion was meritorious. The judge also cited California law and a previous court case to support their decision.
