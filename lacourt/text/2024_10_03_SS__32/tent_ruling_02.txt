[1] On March
19, 2024, Defendant withdrew its earlier summary judgment motion, filed on June
14, 2023, and filed the instant Amended moving papers. 


[2] Defendant
relies solely on Plaintiff’s deposition testimony. Defendant does not present
documents regarding its dominion or control over the parking lot, and does not
explain what is meant by “a part of Defendant’s premises” or how such a
characterization would bring this injury within the course of employment.


[3]
Defendant’s UMF 20-21 and 24 rely on Plaintiff’s broad statements to a
physician and the physician’s conclusions in a report and request for
authorization.


[4]
Defendant has not expressly raised judicial estoppel, nor addressed the
elements of the doctrine, and therefore the Court declines to apply it here.
