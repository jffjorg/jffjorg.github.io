And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the latest submissions from the defendant and has issued a tentative ruling. The defendant withdrew its earlier motion for summary judgment and filed new papers, relying solely on the plaintiff's deposition testimony. However, the defendant failed to provide any evidence or explanations about its control over the parking lot or what it means by "a part of Defendant's premises." The judge also notes that the defendant did not raise judicial estoppel as an issue and therefore does not consider it applicable in this case. The judge will consider these points further before making a final ruling.
