Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 22CHCV00816

 
Motion
filed: 1/24/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs Satini Boonlue and Mom Can
Cook Thai., Inc. dba Mom Can Cook Thai Kitchen
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Saeko Eats, LLC dba Sen
Noodle House
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order compelling Defendant to produce supplemental responses to Plaintiffs’ second
set of Special Interrogatories, and imposing monetary sanctions in the amount
of $22,610.00.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an alleged breach of a non-compete
agreement by Defendants.
 
On October 4, 2022, Plaintiffs Satini Boonlue and Mom Can Cook Thai., Inc. dba Mom Can
Cook Thai Kitchen (“MCCTK”) (collectively, “Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint
against Defendants Chris
Roongfangarm, Kittirungruang, Saeko Eats, LLC dba Sen Noodle House (“Sen Noodle
House”), Keith Kittirungruang, Kevin Kittirungruang, (collectively,
“Defendants”), and Does 1 to 20, alleging the following causes of action: (1)
Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing, (3) Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations, (4) Violation
of California Unfair Competition Law, Business and Professions Code Section
17200 et seq., and (5) Intentional Misrepresentation. Subsequently, Defendants
filed their Answer to the Complaint on November 15, 2022. 
 
On January 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two (the “Motion.”)
Subsequently, Sen Noodle House filed its Opposition on September 4, 2024, and
Plaintiffs replied on September 10, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a
particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of the
option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(a).)
 
A.   
Incorrect
Motion Title and Improperly Combined Motions
 
As a preliminary matter,
there are two defects associated with the Motion. 
 
First, the Court observes
that the Motion’s title incorrectly states “Motion to Compel Responses,”
whereas its contents seek relieves to “compel further” responses. The Court
emphasizes that these are two distinct motions governed by separate code
sections. Therefore, the title of the Motion should match the relief requested
to avoid confusion and to ensure proper notice to the opposing party. 
 
Here, despite the incorrect
title of the Motion, the Notice of Motion cites the applicable Code of Civil
Procedure sections that govern motions to compel further responses.
Additionally, given that Defendant Sen Noodle House’s Opposition correctly addresses
the issues, the Court deems that no prejudice was caused by the incorrect
Motion title and will consider the Motion on its merits.
 
Second, Plaintiffs
improperly combined and filed two motions as a single filing. 
 
Multiple
motions should not be combined into a single filing.  (See Govt. Code § 70617(a)(4) (setting forth
the required filing fee for each motion, application, or any other paper or
request requiring a hearing); see also Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before
Trial, [8:1140.1] at 8F-60 (The Rutter Group 2011) [“Motions to compel
compliance with separate discovery requests ordinarily should be filed
separately.”])
 
Because
Special Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents are two
different discovery methods, this Court requires Plaintiffs to file the Motion
to Compel Further Responses and Motion to Compel Further Productions separately
and pay two filing fees. The improperly combined Motion has only one filing fee
paid.
 
As
a result, the Court will only considers one Motion, and the ruling herein
applies only to the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set Two.
 
B.    
Procedural
Requirements 
 
1.     
Timeliness
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300,
subdivision (c), notice of this motion must be given within 45 days following
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
by a later date agreed-upon in writing, failing which the propounding
party waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c); but see Golf & Tennis Pro Shop,
Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 134-136 [suggesting that
the 45-day deadline does not apply to (i.e., it does not begin to run with
service of) objections-only responses; it only applies to responses that are
required to be verified].)
 
The 45-day deadline “is ‘jurisdictional’
in the sense that it renders the court without authority to rule on motions to
compel other than to deny them.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Here, Defendant Sen Noodle House
served its verified responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two, on November
28, 2023. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (c),
Plaintiffs had 45 days to file the a motion to compel further responses,
setting the deadline at January 12, 2024. However, based on the parties’
agreed-upon extension to file the applicable motion by January 26, 2024. (Yeung
Decl. ¶ 21), Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion on January 24, 024. 
 
Accordingly, the Court determines that the Motion is timely.
 
2.      Meet
and Confer 
 
“A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) 
 
Here, Plaintiffs’ counsel attests that
on December 27, 2023, she sent a meet and confer email to Defendants’ counsel
regarding the deficiencies in the verified responses and demanded Defendant to
cure the deficiencies by January 4, 2024. (Yeung Decl. ¶ 20, Ex. “10.”) On
January 6, 2024, Defendants’ counsel responded and asked for additional time to
amend the responses. (Id. ¶ 21.) Subsequently, on January 11, 2024, the
parties had a meeting via zoom to discuss the deficiencies; however, the
meeting was ended by Defendants’ counsel in the middle of Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
explanation on the issue of relevance. (Id. ¶ 22.) Another meet and
confer email was sent to Defendants’ counsel on January 12, 2024. (Id. ¶
23, Ex. “13.”) Despite the efforts, the parties were unable to resolve the
issues, and no further amended responses had been received from Defendant Sen
Noodle House by the time of the filing of the Motion. (Id. ¶ 24.)
 
Based on the above records, the Court
determines that Plaintiffs’ meet and confer efforts were sufficient. 
 
3.      Separate
Statement
 
The California Rules of Court rule
3.1345 (a)(2) explicitly states that “Any motion involving the content of a
discovery request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a
separate statement. The motions that require a separate statement include a
motion: ... (2) To compel further responses to interrogatories[.]” “A separate
statement is a separate document filed and served with the discovery motion
that provides all the information necessary to understand each discovery
request and all the responses to it that are at issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1345(c).)
 
Here, Plaintiffs have fulfilled the
requirement by concurrently filing a separate statement with the Motion.
 
C.   
Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two
 
A party may use interrogatories to request the
identity and location of those with knowledge of discoverable matters. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.010.) To show an interrogatory seeks relevant, discoverable
information “is not the burden of [the party propounding interrogatories]. As a
litigant, it is entitled to demand answers to its interrogatories, as a matter
of right, and without a prior showing, unless the party on whom those
interrogatories are served objects and shows cause why the questions are not
within the purview of the code section.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531,.541, citing West Pico Furniture
Co. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 422.)
 
“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to
a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2) An exercise of
the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection
to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Plaintiffs move to compel further responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set Two, Nos. 10-55, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, subdivision (a). They argue that the responses served by Sen
Noodle House contained only boilerplate and meritless objections and there were
no substantive or straightforward responses to each of the requests in the
Special Interrogatories, Set Two. (Yeung Decl. ¶ 18.)
 
These special interrogatories nos. in question include:
 
“10. State Sen Noodle House’s transaction count for
the year of 2020.
11. State Sen Noodle House’s
transaction count for the year of 2021.

providers of Sen Noodle House from

31. State any and all advertisement

32. State the dollar amount of Sen
Noodle House’s income that came from third party

including but not limited to Ubereats, DoorDash, Postmates, Grubhub, Yelp etc.
for the year of 2020. 
33. State the dollar amount of Sen
Noodle House’s income that came from third party
delivery agents or websites
including but not limited to Ubereats, DoorDash, Postmates,
Grubhub, Yelp etc. for the year of
2021.”
 
(Yeung Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. “1A.”)
 
In its Opposition, Sen Noodle
House argues that it is not required to answer any discovery which requires
defendants to create a compilation, abstract, audit, or summary of or from
documents which have been produced. (Opp’n. at p. 3.)
 
            Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230, “[i]f the answer to an interrogatory
would necessitate the preparation or the making of a compilation, abstract,
audit, or summary of or from the documents of the party to whom the
interrogatory is directed, and if the burden or expense of preparing or making
it would be substantially the same for the party propounding the interrogatory
as for the responding party, it is a sufficient answer to that interrogatory
to refer to this section and to specify the writings from which the answer may
be derived or ascertained. This specification shall be in sufficient detail to
permit the propounding party to locate and to identify, as readily as the
responding party can, the documents from which the answer may be ascertained.
The responding party shall then afford to the propounding party a reasonable
opportunity to examine, audit, or inspect these documents and to make copies,
compilations, abstracts, or summaries of them.” 
(Underlines added.)
 
Additionally, “[a]Answers must be complete and responsive.
Thus, it is not proper to answer by stating, ‘See my deposition,’ ‘See my
pleading,’ or ‘See the financial statement.’ Indeed, if a question does require
the responding party to make reference to a pleading or document, the pleading
or document should be identified and summarized so the answer is fully
responsive to the question.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771
(Deyo).)
 
            Here, Sen
Noodle House’s verified responses, dated November 28, 2023, contains only
uniformed objection. (Yeung Decl. Ex. “1A,” see generally Pl.’s Separate
Statement.) Sen Noodle House argues that “all documents have been produced
pursuant to meet and confer in lieu of amending responses to the Special
Interrogatories, Set Two and additional documents at issue have been produced
via the Document Demand and a separate subpoena by Plaintiffs to Defendants, …
from which the answer to the interrogatories may be ascertained[.]” (Def.’s
Separate Statement, at p. 2.) However, its responses were devoid of any details
or specificity as to which writings the answers may be derived for ascertained.

 
            Therefore,
the Court finds Defendant Sen Noodle House’s responses failed to comply with
the requirements mandated by Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.230, as well
as principles set forth in case law, including those stated in Deyo, supra.
            
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two.
            
D.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Plaintiffs also request the imposition of monetary
sanctions in the amount of $22, 610. (Mot. at p. 15.) The Court finds the
requested amount, which represents the total for two improperly combined
motions, to be excessive. 
 
Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality
of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work in preparing the Motion is $900.00,
calculated at a reasonable hourly rate of $300.00 for three hours reasonably
spent. 
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiffs’ request
for sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two, filed
by Plaintiffs Satini Boonlue and Mom Can Cook
Thai., Inc. dba Mom Can Cook Thai Kitchen, is GRANTED.
 
Defendant
Saeko Eats, LLC dba Sen Noodle House is ordered to provide supplemental
responses to Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories, Set Two, within 20 days.
 
Plaintiffs’
request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
Defendant
Saeko Eats, LLC dba Sen Noodle House and its
