English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is on a motion for sanctions brought by the plaintiff, Andy Guy, against the defendants, Timothy Roth and others. The case was previously dismissed with prejudice, but the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal was granted. The plaintiff seeks sanctions against the defendants and their counsel for allegedly frivolous conduct, including the filing of a request for dismissal without authorization. The defendants, in turn, request sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel for allegedly overinflating the amount of sanctions sought. The Judge finds that the defendants' counsel's conduct was not frivolous and that the filing of the request for dismissal was not intended to harass or cause unnecessary delay. The Judge denies the motion for sanctions and also denies the defendant's request for sanctions.
