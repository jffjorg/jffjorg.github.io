And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a lawsuit filed by Antonio Zaragoza against The Picerne Group, Inc. and Wallcraft Drywall, Inc. alleging negligent hiring, supervision, or retention of employees and negligence. The defendants filed a demurrer, arguing that the allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action and that the Privette doctrine applies, which bars liability for injuries sustained by an employee of an independent contractor hired to do work. The judge ruled that the Privette doctrine appears to bar the causes of action against The Picerne Group, which is alleged to be the general contractor, and that the allegations are insufficient to encompass any of the exceptions to Privette. The judge sustained the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend the complaint.
