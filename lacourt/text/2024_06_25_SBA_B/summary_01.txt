Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's request to tax the defendants' memorandum of costs. The defendants are seeking $2703.65 in filing and motion fees, $4727.56 in deposition costs, $662.15 in service of process, and $588 in interpreter fees. The plaintiff argues that the memorandum of costs was not served properly and that the costs are excessive and unreasonable. The defendants argue that the memorandum of costs was properly and timely served and that the costs are reasonable and necessary. The court finds that the plaintiff has not met her burden of showing that the claimed costs are not recoverable and that the defendants have properly itemized each cost.
