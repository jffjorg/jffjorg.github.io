BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Law
Offices of Adela Z. Ulloa, APC had posted a job for a managing attorney for
their practice, AZU, upon experiencing exhaustion and health issues. Plaintiff
alleges Defendant Sarkissian responded to the job posting and during the
initial interview, misrepresented himself to be an expert attorney in the
practice area of wrongful foreclosure. Plaintiff alleges Defendant also
breached the agreement by failing to meet basic deadlines and failure to submit
legible billing. 
 
On March 28, 2023, this action was
related to Defendant’s Labor Commission Appeal action against Law Offices of
Adela Z. Ulloa, APC (LASC Case No. 21VECP00029). 
 
On July 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
First Amended Complaint for 1. Breach of Contract; 2. Breach of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing; 3. Estoppel; 4. Fraudulent Misrepresentation; 5. Fraudulent Promise
without Intention to Perform; 6. Fraudulent Concealment; 7. Negligence; and, 8.
Breach of Fiduciary Duty.
 
[TENTATIVE]
RULING
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedures § 128.5 and §128.7 in the sum of $7,991.48
against Defendants and their Counsel is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff Law Offices of Adela Z. Ulloa, APC move for an order
requesting sanctions against Defendants Areg Sarkissian and Sarkissian Real
Estate Inc. and their attorneys, Sogol Gohari and Vittoria Onufrio Hollosy,
jointly and severally under Code of Civil Procedure §128.5 and §128.7 in the
total sum of $7,991.48 for cost and fees incurred opposing Defendants’ patently
frivolous Motions to Quash Plaintiff’s service of summons and complaint filed
with this Court.
 
Defendants first oppose the motion on the grounds Plaintiffs did
not follow the stringent notice requirements or safe harbor provisions of Code
of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7. 
 
Section 128.7 provides a 21-day safe harbor provision whereby the
offending party can avoid sanctions by withdrawing the improper pleading. 
(CCP § 128.7(c)(1); Galleria Plus, Inc. v. Hanmi Bank (2009) 179
Cal.App.4th 535, 538.)  Under this provision, notice of the motion shall
be served on the offending party, but “shall not be filed with or presented to
the court unless, within 21 days after service of the motion, or any other
period as the court may prescribe, the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention,
allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately correct.”  (CCP §
128.7(c)(1).)  “A formal noticed motion is required to begin the 21-day
period.”  (Galleria Plus, Inc., supra, 179 Cal.App.4th at
538.) Section 128.5 also contains a similar safe harbor provision
providing that “[i]f the alleged action or tactic is making or opposing of a
written motion . . . that can be withdrawn or appropriately corrected, a notice
of the motion shall be served as provided in [CCP] Section 1010, but shall not be
filed with or presented to the court, unless 21 days after service of the
motion or any other period as the court may prescribe, the challenged action or
tactic is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected.”  (CCP §
128.5(f)(1)(B).) 
 
On May 5, 2023, Defendants served a copy of their Motion to Quash
on Plaintiffs. The Motion was filed with the Court on May 8, 2023. Thereafter,
on May 30, 2023, Plaintiffs provided Defense counsel with notice Plaintiffs
would file a 128.5 and 128.7 Sanctions Motion if Defendants did not take their
motion to quash off calendar. (Ulloa Decl. ¶5, Exh. H.) The notice was an
e-mail to Defense counsel stating “if you do not take the motions off calendar,
I will be filing a 128.7 motion with the Court as both Motions are frivolous
and without basis.” (Ulloa Decl., Exh. H.) Plaintiff’s counsel goes on to say
why the Motions are frivolous and states Plaintiff’s “will be seeking sanctions
against you, as his counsel, and him collectively for all fees and costs
including those for having the process servers appear.” (Ulloa Decl., Exh. H.) Plaintiffs
followed up June 5, 2023. (Ulloa Decl. ¶5.) The hearing on the Motion to Quash
was heard June 13, 2023 and Plaintiffs’ filed the instant Motion for Sanctions
on August 29, 2023. 
 
The court agrees the notice of sanctions in the instant matter
does not satisfy the 21-day “safe harbor” requirement pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.7. Although the e-mail to Defense counsel specified
against whom sanctions were sought, the type of sanctions sought, and the basis
for the sanctions, a formal sanctions motion is required. “A party does not
comply with the notice provisions of section 128.7 simply by sending a letter
of its intent to seek sanctions to the offending party. (Barnes, supra,
74 Cal.App.4th at p. 136, 87 Cal.Rptr.2d 594 [“informal notice of an intent to
seek sanctions in the future cannot serve as a substitute to the requirements
set forth in section 128.7 for a formal noticed motion”]; Cromwell v.
Cummings, supra, 76 Cal.Rptr.2d 171, 65 Cal.App.4th Supp. at p.
15[“[a]pplication of the doctrine of substantial compliance would be
inconsistent with the plain language of the ‘safe harbor’ provision”].)” (Martorana
v. Marlin & Saltzman (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 685, 700.) The notice
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7(c)(1) are mandatory. (Ibid.)
Because Plaintiffs’ never commenced the 21-day “safe harbor” period, the court
finds the instant motion untimely. 
 
As for Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, the same standard
applies. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5(c), “Expenses
pursuant to this section shall not be imposed except on notice contained in
a party's moving or responding papers or, on the court's own motion, after
notice and opportunity to be heard. An order imposing expenses shall be in
writing and shall recite in detail the action or tactic or circumstances
justifying the order.” (Emphasis added.) No moving or responding papers were
provided. As such, because no adequate notice was provided, the 21-day safe
harbor period did not begin. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedures § 128.5 and §128.7 in
the sum of $7,991.48 against Defendants and their Counsel is DENIED.
