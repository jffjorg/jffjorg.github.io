The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendants and their counsel in the sum of $7,991.48. The plaintiff's motion is based on the defendants' alleged frivolous motions to quash the service of summons and complaint. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's notice of sanctions does not satisfy the 21-day "safe harbor" requirement under Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7. The court concludes that the plaintiff's motion is untimely and therefore denies the motion.

## English Summary:

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendants and their attorneys. The judge found that the plaintiff did not properly notify the defendants of their intent to seek sanctions, failing to follow the 21-day "safe harbor" period required by California Code of Civil Procedure §128.7.  Although the plaintiff emailed the defendants' counsel expressing their intent to file a sanctions motion if the defendants did not withdraw their Motions to Quash, the judge ruled that this did not constitute formal notice required by law.  Therefore, the 21-day period for the defendants to withdraw their motions and avoid sanctions never began.

English text:

The tentative ruling for case number 23STCV05765, scheduled for hearing on October 3, 2023, in department W, is denying the Plaintiff's Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedures § 128.5 and §128.7 in the sum of $7,991.48 against Defendants and their Counsel. The Plaintiff, Law Offices of Adela Z. Ulloa, APC, sought sanctions against Defendants Areg Sarkissian and Sarkissian Real Estate Inc. and their attorneys, Sogol Gohari and Vittoria Onufrio Hollosy, for cost and fees incurred opposing Defendants’ patently frivolous Motions to Quash Plaintiff’s service of summons and complaint. However, the court found that the Plaintiff did not follow the notice requirements or safe harbor provisions of Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7. The court concluded that the Plaintiff’s notice of sanctions did not satisfy the 21-day “safe harbor” requirement and the motion was untimely.
