And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendants and their counsel in the sum of $7,991.48. The plaintiff's motion is based on the defendants' alleged frivolous motions to quash the service of summons and complaint. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's notice of sanctions does not satisfy the 21-day "safe harbor" requirement under Code of Civil Procedure sections 128.5 and 128.7. The court concludes that the plaintiff's motion is untimely and therefore denies the motion.
