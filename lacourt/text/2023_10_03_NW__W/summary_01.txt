The case involves a plaintiff, Albert Boyajian, who alleges that defendants, including Surge Global Bakeries Partners GP, ET AL, engaged in fraudulent concealment, breach of contract, and other wrongdoing. The defendants, including Lewis Sharp, Thomas Beauchamp, and Surge Private Equity LLC, move to quash service of summons on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has not shown purposeful direction or purposeful availment and accordingly, has not met its initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction over Surge Private Equity LLC.

The judge also finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated further discovery will lead to the production of evidence establishing jurisdiction against Surge Private Equity LLC and continues the hearing to allow for jurisdictional discovery. The judge does not address the motions of Lewis Sharp and Thomas Beauchamp as they did not file an opposition to the motion.
