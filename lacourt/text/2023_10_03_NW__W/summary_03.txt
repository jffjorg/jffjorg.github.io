```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Areg Sarkissian and Sarkissian Real Estate Inc. The court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend in part, dismissing the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action (breach of contract, breach of good faith and fair dealing, estoppel, and fraud) due to the statute of limitations. The court has also denied the motion to strike certain allegations and paragraphs of the complaint.

The court has determined that the statute of limitations for the contract-based claims was tolled due to the Labor Commission Appeal, and therefore the claims are timely. The court has also rejected the defendants' argument that the plaintiff maliciously filed the claim after the Labor Commission granted the defendants' appeal.

The court has denied the defendants' request for sanctions and has not addressed the request for sanctions in the demurrer. The court has also denied the defendants' motion to strike certain allegations and paragraphs of the complaint, finding that they are relevant and proper.

The case will proceed with the remaining causes of action, and the parties will have an opportunity to present further evidence and arguments at the hearing date.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike. The defendants, Areg Sarkissian and Sarkissian Real Estate Inc., had demurred to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint on the grounds that all of the causes of action are outside the statute of limitations and thus barred. The judge disagreed with this argument, finding that the statute of limitations for breach of contract and breach of good faith and fair dealing was tolled by the filing of the defendant's appeal.

The judge sustained the defendants' demurrer to the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action without leave to amend, but denied their request for sanctions. The judge also denied the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's allegations supporting a claim for punitive damages and several paragraphs alleging the defendant's purported fraud.

The judge noted that the defendants had requested judicial notice of several documents, including an agreement, correspondence, and a termination letter, but denied the request, finding that these documents are not indisputable and are outside the scope of judicial notice.
