  - "The court finds this rule only applies to pleadings within the same case. The 'relation back' rule does not apply merely because defendant's claim could have been asserted as a cross-complaint."
  - "Any such argument is not appropriate for demurrer. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice."
  - "A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not on the evidence or facts alleged."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Areg Sarkissian and Sarkissian Real Estate Inc. The court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend in part, dismissing the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action (breach of contract, breach of good faith and fair dealing, estoppel, and fraud) due to the statute of limitations. The court has also denied the motion to strike certain allegations and paragraphs of the complaint.

The court has determined that the statute of limitations for the contract-based claims was tolled due to the Labor Commission Appeal, and therefore the claims are timely. The court has also rejected the defendants' argument that the plaintiff maliciously filed the claim after the Labor Commission granted the defendants' appeal.

The court has denied the defendants' request for sanctions and has not addressed the request for sanctions in the demurrer. The court has also denied the defendants' motion to strike certain allegations and paragraphs of the complaint, finding that they are relevant and proper.

The case will proceed with the remaining causes of action, and the parties will have an opportunity to present further evidence and arguments at the hearing date.
