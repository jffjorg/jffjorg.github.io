And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. The plaintiff, Pamelia Bailey, has 30 days to amend the complaint. The court has set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) for July 19, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. to address the amended complaint. The judge found that the FAC was ambiguous and uncertain, making it difficult for the defendant to respond to the complaint.
