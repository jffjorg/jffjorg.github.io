And here is the English text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Plaintiff, Rebecca Castillo, has filed an application for a default judgment against Defendant CATSA, INC for alleged violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (UCRA). The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant's website is inaccessible to visually impaired individuals like herself. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's complaint fails to plead particular, sufficient facts establishing an UCRA violation. Specifically, the complaint is 20 pages with 53 factual allegations, most of which provide no relevant or material facts to the UCRA cause of action. Moreover, the complaint does not plead specific, relevant facts to establish an ADA violation or intentional discrimination. Therefore, the Court denies the Plaintiff's application for default judgment with prejudice.
