[1] Zimmerman’s report dated 9/8/22 states “Symptoms,
complaints and diagnoses are causally related to the accident” (p. 45 of 155 of
PDF) but there is no explanation (i.e., connecting the imaging reports to the
accident) and the court does not have the expertise to analyze a medical
report. 
 


[2] On this note, according to this report, Plaintiff
states “that her spine got fractured” (p. 137 of 155 of PDF), but according to
Plaintiff, the ER doctor(s) made no such findings.
