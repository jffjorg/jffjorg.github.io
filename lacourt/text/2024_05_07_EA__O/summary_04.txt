And here is the summary in plain English:

The court is considering a demurrer filed by the California Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (CDCR) against a negligence lawsuit brought by Randal Williams. Williams alleges that the defendants, including the City of El Monte, the County of Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, caused him harm when they cut and/or punctured his leg while removing his ankle monitor. The court has previously sustained the City's demurrer, but Williams dismissed the City. CDCR has now filed a demurrer, arguing that the complaint does not plead a statutory basis for the causes of action. The court agrees with CDCR and sustains the demurrer with leave to amend.
