On February 14, 2024, Ministry filed its answer. 
 
On February 16, 2024, default was entered against Greene.
 
On March 27, 2024, Counsel Benjamin Berger, Sasha Chegini
&Berger Harrison, APC for Ministry filed the instant motion. 
 
On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion For Order
Vacating Entry Of Default Against Defendant, Christiana O. Greene.
 
Discussion
 
1.    
Set Aside Default
 
Plaintiff makes the motion on the grounds that a statement
of damages was not served upon Greene prior to entry of default. Indeed,
it is well
settled that a plaintiff may not take a defendant's default without giving the
defendant actual notice of the amount of damages claimed. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 425.11, subds.
(b), (c), see also Matera v. McLeod (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 44, 60.) In
fact, absent service of the statement of damages, the underlying default is void.
(Department of Fair Employment & Housing
v. Ottovich (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th
706, 712.) Thus, to proceed with entry of default judgment, the default against
Greene should be void until she is properly served with a Statement of Damages.
 
Therefore, the court sets aside and vacates the default
taken on 2/16/23 against Defendant Greene. 
 
2.    
Relieved as Counsel 
 
Counsel Berger states that “Certain facets of the
attorney-client relationship have deteriorated to the point that attorney is
unable to continue representing One Touch of Christ Evangelistic Ministries.”
(MC-052 Form.) 
 
Here, absent an opposition by Defendant Ministry, the court
finds no prejudice in granting the motion, notably as there are no substantive
motions on calendar that involve Ministry. Additionally, Counsel has complied
with California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 as the MC-051, 052, and 053 forms
have been filed. 
 
Notwithstanding, the only defect the court finds is that not
all parties have been served with notice of the motion; the proof of
service indicates that only Ministry was served. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Counsel’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel is GRANTED, effective upon serving notice of the motion upon all parties and service of this
court’s order relieving Counsel sent to Plaintiff, Defendants, and all other
parties who have appeared in the case.
 
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, both motions are granted, and the
motion to be relieved as counsel is effective upon service of motion and the
court’s order upon all parties.
