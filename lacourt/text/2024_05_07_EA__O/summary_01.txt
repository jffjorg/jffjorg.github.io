```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to vacate the entry of default against defendant Christiana O. Greene. The court finds that the default was taken without serving Greene with a statement of damages, which is a requirement under California law. As a result, the default is void, and the court sets it aside. Additionally, the court grants counsel Benjamin Berger's motion to be relieved as counsel. Berger states that certain aspects of the attorney-client relationship have deteriorated, making it impossible for him to continue representing the defendant. The court finds no prejudice in granting the motion, as there are no substantive motions on the calendar that involve the defendant. However, the court notes that the only defect in the motion is that not all parties were served with notice of the motion. The court orders that the motion to be relieved as counsel is effective upon serving notice of the motion and the court's order on all parties.
