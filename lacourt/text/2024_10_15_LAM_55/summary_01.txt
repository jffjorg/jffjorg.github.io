Summary in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens filed by 2315 Loma Vista LLC. The Motion was denied. The Judge based the ruling on the following:

* The Plaintiff has standing to bring the lawsuit, despite the sale of the property and subsequent reconveyance.
* The Plaintiff alleged a real property claim in the Complaint, which includes a dispute over the existence of an easement.
* The Defendant failed to provide evidence to support a claim of statutory abandonment of the easement.
* The Plaintiff showed probable validity of her real property claim through adverse possession, and it is more likely than not that she will prevail on her claim for quiet title and declaratory relief against the Defendant regarding Lot 10-A.
* The Plaintiff did not show probable validity of her real property claim as to Lot 10-B, but the Defendant did not argue in support of any easement over Lot 10-B.

The Judge's decision is based on California Civil Procedure Code sections 405.2, 405.4, 405.30, 405.31, 405.32, 405.3, California Code of Civil Procedure section 405.4, subdivision (b), California Civil Code sections 803, 887.030, 887.050, and several California appellate court decisions.
