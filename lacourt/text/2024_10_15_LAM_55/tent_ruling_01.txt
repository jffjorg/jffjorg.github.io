  Case Number:  23STCV05340    Hearing Date:   October 15, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS: Hearing on 2315 Loma Vista LLC's Motion to Expunge Lid Pendens
 
2315 Loma Vista LLC's Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens is denied. 
 
BACKGROUND
On March 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against defendants
2315 Loma Vista LLC (“Defendant”), Mariati Situmorang, and others, seeking to
quiet title over two adjoining parcels of land owned by Plaintiff, Lots 10-A
and 10-B (collectively “Plaintiff’s property”) and seeking declaratory relief
determining that defendants do not have an easement or other interest in
Plaintiff’s property.
On January 17, 2024, Plaintiff recorded a Notice of Pendency
of Action (“lis pendens”) identifying three properties, including 2315 Lorna
Vista Place, Los Angeles, California, Assessor’s Parcel No. 5422-009-025
(“Defendant’s property”).  
The motion now before the Court is Defendant's Motion to Expunge Lis
Pendens. Plaintiff opposed the motion, and Defendant filed a reply.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD
A lis pendens is an instrument recorded in the office of the
county recorder that gives constructive notice of a pending lawsuit affecting
title to the real property described in the lis pendens. Gale v. Superior Court
(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1395. For the purposes of expunging lis pendens, a
real property claim is a cause of action that, if successful, would affect
title to or right of possession of specific real property or the use of an
easement identified in a pleading. Code Civ. Proc., §§ 405.2, 405.4.[1] “If the
pleading filed by the claimant does not properly plead a real property claim,
the lis pendens must be expunged upon motion under CCP 405.31.” Kirkeby v.
Superior Court (2004) 33 Cal.4th 642, 647 (citation omitted) (internal
quotation marks omitted). “In making this determination, the court must engage
in a demurrer-like analysis.” Id. at p. 648. 
Where a motion to expunge a lis pendens has been filed, the
proponent of the lis pendens carries the burden of establishing the existence
of a real property claim and that it is probably valid. §§ 405.30, 405.32. To
establish probable validity, the claimant must show that “it is more likely
than not that the claimant will obtain a judgment against the defendant on the
claim.” § 405.3.  
 
ANALYSIS
I. Standing
“At any time after notice of pendency of action has been
recorded, any party, or any nonparty with an interest in the real property
affected thereby, may apply to the court in which the action is pending to
expunge the notice.” § 405.30. 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant lacks standing to bring this
motion because, after Plaintiff filed the initial complaint, Defendant sold the
Property on December 13, 2023. Opposition at 3:1-2 p.m. In its reply, Defendant
acknowledges the transfer of ownership but provides a declaration and attached deed,
showing that the property was reconveyed to Defendant and the deed recorded on
September 4, 2024. Reply at p. 2:14-19; Exhibit 2; Declaration of Julia Sklar
at ¶ 3.   Accordingly, the Court
concludes that Defendant has standing to bring this motion.
 
II. Real Property Claim           
Defendant argues that the Court is required to expunge the
lis pendens under section 405.31 because the Complaint does not include a real
property claim as to Defendant’s property. 

First, Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to allege in
the Complaint that Defendant claims any portion of Plaintiff’s property,
including any easement as to the driveway. Motion at p. 7:12-14.  This is not accurate. Plaintiff alleges that
Mariati Situmorang is the sole or managing member of 2315 Loma Vista LLC.
Complaint at. ¶ 21.  Plaintiff further
alleges that Situmorang “demanded to see ‘her easement,’” brought a group of
men onto Plaintiff’s property, asserted to Plaintiff that she had the right of
ingress and egress through Plaintiff’s property, and built a fence on
Plaintiff’s property. Complaint at ¶¶ 22, 23, 25, 35.  As pleaded, these facts are sufficient to
constitute a real property claim because they demonstrate a conflict as to the
existence of an easement. See § 405.4.  
Second, Defendant argues that there is no real property
claim as to Defendant’s property, because the allegations in the complaint only
concern rights to Plaintiff’s property and do not affect title to Defendant’s property.

“The land to which an easement is attached is called the
dominant tenement; the land upon which a burden or servitude is laid is called
the servient tenement.” Civ. Code § 803. In Kendall-Brief Co. v. Superior
Court (1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 462, 468 (Kendall-Brief), the court
affirmed denial of a motion to expunge a lis pendens recorded against a
landlocked dominant estate, holding that while the existence of the easement
did not affect defendant’s title, it affected right to possession because,
without the easement, there was no access to defendant’s property. The 1992
amendments to sections 405.4 and 405.20 codified Kendall-Brief, and
explicitly acknowledged that an easement dispute constitutes a real property
claim. Park 100 Investment Group II, LLC v. Ryan (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th
795, 810 (Park 100). In Park 100, supra, 180 Cal.App.4th
at p. 810-11, the court held that the definition of a “real property claim”
under section 405.4 includes the use of an easement, even where the recording
of a lis pendens is on the dominant tenement, and the dispute involves a
property that is not landlocked. 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant claims a right to an
easement on Plaintiff’s property (the servient estate) and recorded the lis
pendens on Defendant’s property (the dominant estate). While Defendant is
correct that Plaintiff’s claims do not affect title to Defendant’s property, they
affect “the use of an easement identified in the pleading.” See § 405.4,
subd. (b); Kendall-Brief, supra, 60 Cal.App.3d at p. 468. That
Defendant’s property is the dominant estate is irrelevant. See Park 100,
supra, 180 Cal.App.4th at p. 810-11 Accordingly, the Court
concludes that Plaintiff alleged a real property claim in the Complaint. 
 
III. Probable Validity 
Plaintiff argues that she can establish probable validity of
her real property claim because any easement was extinguished by abandonment or
adverse possession.
Under Civil Code section 887.050, an easement is abandoned
if, for 20 years immediately preceding commencement of the action, (1) the
easement is not used at any time, (2) no separate property taxes are paid on
the easement, and (3) no instrument evidencing the easement is recorded. The
statutory abandonment provision supplements and does not limit other common law
or statutory remedies. Civ. Code § 887.030. 

“An easement or servitude created by grant cannot be lost by
mere nonuse. However, a recorded easement may be extinguished if the use of the
servient tenement … amounts to adverse possession of the easement, and nonuse
by the dominant tenement may be a factor in determining whether possession has
been adverse.” Vieira Enterprises, Inc. v. McCoy (2017) 8 Cal. App.5th
1057, 1075 (Vieira) (citations omitted).  ‘“In an action to quiet title based on adverse
possession the burden is upon the claimant to prove every necessary element:
(1) Possession must be by actual occupation under such circumstances as to
constitute reasonable notice to the owner. (2) It must be hostile to the
owner's title. (3) The holder must claim the property as his own under either
color of title or claim of right. (4) Possession must be continuous and
uninterrupted for five years. (5) The holder must pay all the taxes levied and
assessed upon the property during the period.”’ Ibid (quoting Dimmick
v. Dimmick (1962) 58 Cal.2d 417, 421). 
Plaintiff fails to provide any admissible evidence
supporting a claim of statutory abandonment. Her declaration does not contain
personal knowledge that, for the past 20 years, the easement has not been used,
separate taxes were not paid on the easement, or that no document evidencing
the easement was recorded.  Accordingly, based
on the record, Plaintiff fails to show by a preponderance of the evidence that
the easement was abandoned under Civil Code section 887.050. 
However, statutory abandonment is not the exclusive method,
as easements may also be terminated by adverse possession.  
Plaintiff testifies that she has exclusively owned and
occupied 2256 Earl Street (Lot 10-A) since April 15, 2013, and that her use of
the property has been continuous and uninterrupted.  Demarco Declaration at ¶¶ 19, 20. Plaintiff
further testifies that her possession of the property has at all times been
open and notorious, and she did not recognize that Defendant had any ownership
rights. Demarco Decl., at ¶¶ 21, 22. Moreover, Plaintiff’s conduct is consistent
with her exclusive and hostile use. When Situmorang attempted to exercise the
easement on January 27, 2022, Plaintiff informed her that no easement
existed.  Complaint at p. 23. Finally,
Plaintiff testifies that she has at all times claimed the property as owner
under color of title and has paid all of the taxes assessed on the property
during the eleven years since she acquired title. Demarco Decl., at
¶¶23-24.  
Defendant offers no evidence contradicting Plaintiff’s showing
of adverse possession and makes no arguments regarding her probable validity
beyond those challenging the existence of a real property claim.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that it is
more likely than not that Plaintiff will prevail on her claim for quiet title and
declaratory relief against Defendant, as relates to Lot 10-A.  
While Plaintiff has shown probable validity regarding her claims
to Lot 10-A through adverse possession, she has not made such a showing as to
Lot 10-B, which she acquired on April 20, 2022. However, the Court concludes
that Plaintiff’s probable success in her quiet title and declaratory relief
actions against Defendant regarding any easement on Lot 10-A is sufficient
constitute probable validity of a real property claim, even if she does not
prevail as to Lot 10-B. This decision is bolstered by the fact that it is
unclear if Defendant has any easement over Lot 10-B, and Defendant has declined
to argue in support of such an easement. 

 
CONCLUSION
2315 Loma Vista LLC's Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens is denied.
