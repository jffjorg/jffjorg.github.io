And here is the summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to join indispensable parties. The defendant, William Samoska, moved to dismiss the case for failure to join EZBanc, an indispensable party. The court denied the motion, finding that EZBanc is not an indispensable party in the instant suit. The court also granted Samoska's motion to request judicial notice.

The court analyzed the relevant statutes and case law, including Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 389, which governs the joinder of indispensable parties. The court found that while EZBanc is an indispensable party, the court has discretion to proceed with the case despite the absence of EZBanc. The court also found that Samoska would have an adequate remedy if the case is dismissed, as he can file a cross-complaint against any joint tortfeasors.

The court also denied a motion to stay the action pending the outcome of the federal action. The court found that the two cases do not concern the same subject matter and that a stay is not warranted.
