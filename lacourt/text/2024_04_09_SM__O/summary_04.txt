Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Santa Monica's motion for attorney's fees is granted in the amount of $144,210.00. The City is the prevailing party in the action and is entitled to attorney fees and costs pursuant to the contract. The Deed Restriction and Development Agreement provide for the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The City's lead attorney, Gary Rhodes, has worked a total of 262.2 hours at an hourly rate of $550, and the Court finds this rate and time spent to be reasonable. The Court overrules the defendant's objections to time spent in the first phase trial. The Court finds that awarding a multiplier under the facts and history of the litigation is unreasonable, and therefore awards the City attorney's fees in the amount of $144,210 to be paid by the defendant within 60 days of service of a signed order.
