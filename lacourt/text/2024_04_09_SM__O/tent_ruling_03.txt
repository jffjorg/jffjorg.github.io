SUBJECT:                 MOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE
TO JOIN INDISPENSABLE PARTIES
MOVING
PARTY:   Defendant William Samoska
RESP.
PARTY:         Plaintiffs BSI Group,
LLC And International Business Solutions Group LLC
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendant William Samoska’s Motion to Dismiss for Failure
to Join Indispensable Parties is DENIED. EZBanc is not an indispensable party
in the instant suit and Defendant has an adequate remedy in filing a cross-complaint
against alleged joint tortfeasor EZBanc.
            
            Defendant
William Samoska’s RJN is GRANTED.
 
I.     
Failure to Joint Indispensable Party Pursuant to
CCP § 389
 
            Within CCP § 389(a)’s first clause,
or the “complete relief” clause, the statute “focuses not on whether complete
relief can be afforded all possible parties to the action, but on whether
complete relief can be afforded the parties named in the action.” (Deltakeeper
v. Oakdale Irrigation Dist. (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 1092, 1101; Code Civ.
Proc. § 389, subd. (a).) As to CCP § 389(a)’s second clause regarding potential
impairment to an absent party’s ability to protect a claimed interest, it has
been held that to the extent that the absent party and existing defendants
share goals with respect to the outcome of the litigation, it is unlikely for
the absent party’s interests to be impeded or impaired. (See Countrywide
Home Loans, Inc., supra, 69 Cal.App.4th at p. 796; see also Citizens
Ass’n for Sensible Dev. of Bishop Area v. Cnty. of Inyo (1985) 172
Cal.App.3d 151, 161.) Regarding CCP § 389(a)’s multiple recovery and
inconsistent obligations clause “[a] ‘substantial risk’ [of multiple recovery] means
more than a theoretical possibility of the absent party’s asserting a claim
that would result in multiple liability.” (Union Carbide Corp. v. Superior
Court (1984) 36 Cal.3d 15, 21.) “[I]nconsistent obligations occur when a
party is unable to comply with one court’s order without breaching anther
court’s order concerning the same incident.” (Van Zant v. Apple Inc. (2014)
229 Cal.App.4th 965, 977, internal quotations omitted.)
 
            Furthermore, “[i]t has long been the
rule that it is not necessary for all joint tortfeasors to be named as
defendants in a single lawsuit.” (Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 785, 796; See Am. Motorcycle Ass’n v.
Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 578, 607 [“a defendant is generally
authorized to file a cross-complaint against a concurrent tortfeasor for
partial indemnity … even when such concurrent tortfeasor has not been named a
defendant in the original complaint”].)
 
            Following the initial determination under CCP § 389(a),
“[i]f a person who qualifies as a necessary party ‘cannot be made a party’ to
the action, the court must determine under [Code of Civil Procedure section
389] subdivision (b) whether ‘in equity and good conscience the action should
proceed among the parties before it, or should be dismissed without prejudice,
the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.’” (Doe v. Regents of
the University of Cal. (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 282, 301 (quoting Code Civ.
Proc. § 389, subd. (b).) That is, a party may be deemed “indispensable” or
“necessary” under subdivision (a), but that finding will not automatically
result in dismissal should the Court determine otherwise under subdivision (b).
(See Deltakeeper, supra, 94 Cal.App.4th at p.1106; Code
Civ. Proc. § 389, subd. (a)-(b).) 
 
            It has been held that the statute governing joinder of
indispensable parties “does not now provide, and never has provided, that the
absence of an indispensable party deprives a court of subject matter
jurisdiction. Rather, the decision whether to proceed with the action in the
absence of a particular party is one within the court’s discretion, as governed
by the various factors enumerated in subdivision (b) of section 389, Code of
Civil Procedure.” (Sierra Club, Inc. v. Cal. Coastal Comm. (1979) 95
Cal.App.3d 495, 500.) Those factors include: “(1) to what extent a judgment
rendered in the person’s absence might be prejudicial to him or those already
parties; (2) the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by
the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or
avoided; (3) whether a judgment rendered in the person’s absence will be
adequate; (4) whether the plaintiff or cross-complainant will have an adequate
remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 389,
subd. (b).) “It is for reasons of equity and convenience, and not because it is
without power to proceed, that the court should not proceed with a case where
it determines that an ‘indispensable’ party is absent and cannot be joined.” (Tracy
Press, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1300, internal
quotations omitted.)
 
            The
claims within BSI Group LLC v. EZBanc, et al., Case No.: 3:23-CV-00127-BSM
(E.D. Ark. 2023) (RJN, Ex. A.) and the instant case are not substantially
similar as both claims deal with different alleged unauthorized transfers of
monies between different Defendants or sets of Defendants. Here, the alleged
unauthorized transfers of money concerns two 2-21-23 wire transfers of funds
directly from Plaintiffs’ BSI Group, LLC And International Business Solutions
Group LLC (“Plaintiffs”) bank accounts to Defendant William Samoska’s
(“Samoska”) client trust account. (FAC, ¶¶ 44, 45.) In the Federal case the alleged
unauthorized transfers of money concerned wire transfers in December 2022 and
January 2023. (See RJN, Ex. A ¶¶ 45–125.) 
The instant case focuses solely on the act of Samoska and his acceptance
of the alleged unauthorized transferred funds; thus Samoska will receive
complete relief. (See Deltakeeper, supra, 94 Cal.App.4th
at p. 1101; see also Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., supra, 69
Cal.App.4th at p. 793–794.) 
 
            Samoska
is afforded the opportunity to file a cross-complaint against any joint
tortfeasors that could be party to this action including EZBanc, thus there
will be no prejudice to Samoska through not dismissing this case. (See Countrywide
Home Loans, Inc., supra, 69 Cal.App.4th at p. 796.)
 
            Plaintiffs
argue they have no other adequate remedy against Samoska if the instant case is
dismissed because the Federal action concerns entirely distinct alleged
unauthorized transactions to which Samoska would likely argue he is not
involved in, and if joined under the Federal further, Samoska would likely
contest jurisdiction if named in Arkansas. (Oppo, p. 17.) The Court finds these
assumptions reasonable and agrees that Plaintiff could have no other adequate
remedy against Samoska if the instant case is dismissed. 
 
            Thus,
The Court will not exercise its discretion to dismiss the case over failure to
join a necessary party to the action. 
 
 
 
II.            
Motion to Stay Pending the Outcome of the
Federal Action
            
            “It is black letter law that, when a Federal action has
been filed covering the same subject matter as is involved in a California
action, the California court has the discretion but not the obligation to stay
the state court action.” (Caiafa Prof. Law Corp. v. State Farm Fire &
Cas. Co. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 800, 804.)
 
            No stay is warranted because the two cases at issue do not
concern the same subject matter as argued by Samoska, and as analyzed above. Both
cases involve different sets of transactions and different receiving parties.
The Court will not use its discretion to stay the action pending the outcome of
the federal action.
