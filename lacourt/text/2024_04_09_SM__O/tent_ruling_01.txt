            Cross-Defendants
Toby Contrarsy and Nikki Ceniceros Demurrer without motion to strike is
OVERRULED. Cross-Complainant Tree Lane, LLC’s successfully pleads all the
elements of the 13th, 15th, and 16th causes of

            Cross-Complainant
Tree Lane, LLC’s Objections are SUSTAINED.
 
I.               
Demurrer to 13th Cause of Action for Declaratory
Relief –OVERRULED
 
“To allege facts sufficient to
state a cause of action for declaratory relief, the plaintiff must allege two
essential elements: (1) a proper subject of declaratory relief, and (2) an
actual controversy involving justiciable questions relating to the rights or
obligations of a party.” (Childhelp, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (2023)
91 Cal.App.5th 224, 235, as modified (May 5, 2023), [internal citations
omitted].)
 
Cross-Defendants Toby Contrarsy and
Niki Ceniceros (“Cross-Defendants”) argue this cause of action is duplicative of
the other causes of action including breach of contract, breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing and slander of title, and thus is
improper. (Demurrer, pp. 8–9.) Cross-complainant Tree Lane, LLC (“Tree Lane”)
argues this is incorrect as complaint may plead alternative theories of
recovery. (Oppo., p. 6.) The Court find that a complaint may plead alternative
forms of recovery. (See Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202
Cal.App.4th 1342, 1388  [“it is true that
modern rules of pleading generally permit plaintiffs to set forth alternative
theories in varied and inconsistent counts.”]; see also Eichler Homes of San
Mateo, Inc. v. Superior Court of San Mateo County (1961) 55 Cal.2d 845, 847
[“The same cause of action, of course, may be stated variously in separate
counts.”].)


Cross-Defendants argue they are
improper parties to this cause of action since they are not the beneficiaries
on any deed of trust, nor the lender. (Demurrer, p 9.) Tree Lane argues Cross-Defendants
are alleged to have been direct participants in both the Loan-to-Own Scheme,
and the 1 Acre Lot Fraud. (See FACC ¶¶ 12, 77, 234, 243, 244). Further, Tree
Lane argues that their declaratory relief “seeks a determination of the
enforceability of the Loan Agreements, of the usury claims, and of the
validity, priority, and extent of Skylark’s liens against the property, and a holding
that Tree Lane’s Property should remain with Tree Lane, notwithstanding the
improper 1 Acre Lot Fraud.” (See Oppo, pp. 6–7; FAC, ¶¶ 227.) 
 
The Court finds that
Cross-Defendants have properly plead an actual controversy that requires
declaratory relief against 
 
II.            
Demurrer to 15th Cause of Action for
Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations –OVERRULED 
 
“The elements which a
plaintiff must plead to state the cause of action for intentional interference
with contractual relations are (1) a valid contract between plaintiff and a
third party; (2) defendant's knowledge of this contract; (3) defendant's intentional
acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship;
(4) actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; and (5)
resulting damage.” (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998)
19 Cal.4th 26, 55, as modified (Sept. 23, 1998).)
 
“The tort duty not to interfere with the contract
falls only on strangers—interlopers who have no legitimate interest in the
scope or course of the contract's performance.” (Applied Equipment Corp. v.
Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 514.) “It is also well
established that corporate agents and employees acting for and on behalf of a
corporation cannot be held liable for inducing a breach of the corporation's
contract.” (Shoemaker v. Myers (1990) 52 Cal.3d 1, 24.) “[T]he “agent's
immunity rule” has no direct applicability to a claim for interference with
contract rights. The rule is simply that “duly acting agents and employees
cannot be held liable for conspiring with their own principals....” (Mintz
v. Blue Cross of California (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1594, 1605.)
 
Tree Lane pleads there was a valid contract between Tree
Lane and Skylark, and other third parties including Lydda Lud, and “various
contractors, sub-contractors and suppliers. (FACC, ¶¶ 231, 237.) Tree Lane
pleads that Cross-Defendants knew of the contracts. (FACC, ¶ 232.) Tree Lane
pleads Cross-Defendants intentional acts to induce the breach, actual breach,
and the resulting damage. (FACC, ¶¶ 239, 240.) Tree Lane pleads actions of the Cross-Defendants
“interfered with the 1 Acre Lot PSA” or the contract. (FACC, ¶ 240.) Tree Lane
pleads that Cross-Defendants were not acting for or on behalf of Skylark when
perpetuating the alleged contractual interference. (FACC, ¶ 240.)  Thus, Tree Lane has successfully plead a cause
of action for Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations. 
 
III.          
Demurrer to 16th Cause of Action for
Aiding and Abetting Torts –OVERRULED
 
“Liability may also be imposed on
one who aids and abets the commission of an intentional tort if the person (a)
knows the other's conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial
assistance or encouragement to the other to so act or (b) gives substantial
assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result and the person's own
conduct, separately considered, constitutes a breach of duty to the third
person. (Saunders v. Superior Court (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 832, 846.)
 
“[D]uly acting agents and employees cannot be held
liable for conspiring with their own principals (the “agent's immunity rule”).
(Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th
503, 512.)
 
Tree Lane has plead around the agent’s immunity rule
by alleging that Cross-Defendants were not acting for or behalf of Skylar when
perpetuating the alleged intentional torts including tortious Interference with
contract. (FACC, ¶ 240.)  Tree Lane has
plead all the elements of aiding and abetting as to Cross-Defendants. (FACC, ¶ 242–245.)
 
Cross-Defendants argue that the claim is uncertain it
that it combines two different primary torts into one aiding and abetting cause
of action, however Cross-Defendants do not provide authority as to why this is
an issue, and Demurrer’s for uncertainty are not favored. 
 
Thus, Tree lane has properly plead a claim for Aiding
and abetting as to Cross-Defendants.
