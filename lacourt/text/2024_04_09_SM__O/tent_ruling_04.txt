TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiff
City of Santa Monica’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $144,210.00.
 Plaintiff is the prevailing party
in the action and is entitled to attorney fees and costs pursuant to the
contract. 
 
            Plaintiff
City of Santa Monica (“the City”) is the prevailing party in cause of action
based on contract, specifically the Deed Restriction and Development Agreement.
(See 12-12-23 Judgement.) Both the Deed Restriction and the Development
agreement provide for the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorney’s
fees and costs from the losing party. (Deed Restriction at p. 5, ¶ 8;
Development Agreement, p. 30 ¶ 10.) 
 
            The
City provides a memorandum of costs totaling $6,713 (See Memorandum of Costs,
p. 5.) The City declares they are seeking only a $550 hourly rate for hours
worked by lead attorney Gary Rhodes (“Rhodes”), an attorney with thirty years
of experience. (Rhodes Decl., ¶¶ 4, 5; Frank Decl., ¶ 3.) The Court finds that
rate is reasonable. The City attaches exhibits with a description of the work
done and time involved, and declares the hours were calculated after the fact,
but are based on a careful review of the case files, court docket, and counsel’s
calendar, erring on the side of “under-estimating and rounding-down.” (Rhoades
Decl., ¶¶ 7–11, Ex. A.) The City declares the total hours to date is 262.2
which is a conservative estimate. (Rhoades Decl., ¶ 12.) The Court finds the
time spent is reasonable.       
 
            The Court
overrules Sung’s objections to any time spent in the first phase trial that was
consolidated trial with the unlawful detainer action.  The issues in the first phase were fully intertwined
with the City’s efforts to enforce the restrictions on the use of Sung’s unit.
 
            Therefore,
the Court finds the loadstar fee requested of $144,210 is reasonable.  The Court finds awarding a multiplier under
the facts and history of the litigation is unreasonable.  Therefore, the Court award’s the City
attorney’s fee in the amount of $144,210 to be paid by Sung within 60 days of service
of a signed order.  
 
The City is to prepare the proposed order.
