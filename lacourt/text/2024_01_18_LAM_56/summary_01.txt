Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further deposition testimony of Defendant's Person Most Qualified (PMQ). The court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, and has found that Mootchnik, the PMQ, appeared reasonably prepared to respond to questioning on the scope of the identified inquiries. The court has also found that Defendant has waived attorney-client privilege/work-product protection objections to inquiries on the subject, as it has put the adequacy of the investigation directly at issue. As a result, the court grants the motion insofar as it relates to topics regarding the sufficiency of Mootchnik's responses that invoked attorney-client privilege or work product protection.
