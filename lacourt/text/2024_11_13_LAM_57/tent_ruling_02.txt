 Case Number:  23STCV25066    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is granting Defendant John Schlanger's motion to compel Plaintiff Mohammad Behboudi to provide further responses to Defendant's Special Interrogatories Numbers 1, 5, 8, 11, 14, 16, and 18.  Code of Civil Procedure Section 2030.210, subdivision (a) sets forth the acceptable answers to an interrogatory, which are:(1) An answer containing the information sought to be discovered.(2) An exercise of the party’s option to produce writings.(3) An objection to the particular interrogatory.(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.210, subd. (a).) Case law is clear on what this means.  “Answers must be complete and responsive. Thus it is not proper to answer by stating, ‘See my deposition’, ‘See my pleading’, or ‘See the financial statement.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783-784.)   Behboudi's responses to the special interrogatories at issue contravene these commands.   They incorporate verbatim very lengthy declarations of Behboudi, co-Plaintiff Maryam Rezaie, and their counsel Charles Gomez that previously were filed in the action that gives rise to Behboudi and Rezaie's suit against Schlanger.  This is highly improper.  It is difficult, if not impossible, for Defendant to parse the multiple pages of the declarations to ascertain precisely what Behboudi's responses are to specific interrogatories.   Behboudi offers no support the proposition that his responses are ok.  Behboudi must provide further responses to the interrogatories by December 16, 2024.At Schlanger's request in the motion, the Court is imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,260 against Behboudi and his counsel Gomez, jointly and severally,  which reflects the amount of the attorney's fees and costs that Schlanger incurred in connection with the motion.    There is no substantial justification for the responses that Behboudi provided.  The sanctions are payable to Schlanger by December 31, 2024.
