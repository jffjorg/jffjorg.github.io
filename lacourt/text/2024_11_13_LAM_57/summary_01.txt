And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Guillermo Madrigal's nonstatutory motion for judgment on the pleadings. The motion was filed as a motion in limine, challenging all three claims in the complaint of Plaintiff Ignacio Carmona. The Judge denied the motion with respect to the breach of contract claim, finding that the alleged contract could be performed within a year and that Madrigal's arguments about impossibility were unavailing.

The Judge granted the motion with leave to amend as to the claim for negligent misrepresentation, finding that the complaint does not currently plead the necessary elements of that claim and that it is reasonably possible for Carmona to amend the complaint to cure that defect.

The Judge granted the motion without leave to amend as to the claim for quantum meruit, finding that Carmona fails to allege that Madrigal retained the benefit of the services Carmona rendered, which is a necessary element of a quantum meruit claim. The Judge found that it does not appear reasonably possible for Carmona to amend the complaint to cure this problem.
