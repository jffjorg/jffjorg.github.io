And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to provide further responses to the defendant's special interrogatories. The plaintiff's previous responses were incomplete and unresponsive, incorporating lengthy declarations without providing specific answers to the interrogatories. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to provide further responses by December 16, 2024. Additionally, the judge has imposed monetary sanctions of $1,260 against the plaintiff and his counsel, payable by December 31, 2024. The sanctions reflect the amount of attorney's fees and costs incurred by the defendant in connection with the motion. The judge ruled that the plaintiff's responses were highly improper and difficult to parse, and that there was no substantial justification for the responses provided.
