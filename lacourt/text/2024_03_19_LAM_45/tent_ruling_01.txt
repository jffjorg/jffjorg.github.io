Background
This case
involves a motor vehicle accident. Plaintiffs Maynard Matthews and Tanis
Matthews filed this action on March 29, 2019 against defendant Patrick Ryan,
alleging causes of action for (1) Negligence; and (2) Loss of Consortium. The
Complaint alleges that plaintiff Maynard Matthews was operating a 2014 Mercedes
E 350 on August 3, 2018 on Zoo Drive, approximately 300 feet each of Griffith
Park Drive. (Compl., ¶ 8.) Defendant allegedly negligently operated a 2003
Mercedes CLK430 so as to cause a collision with Plaintiff. (Id.)
This action went
to trial on August 7, 2023 and concluded on August 31, 2023. Judgment was
entered in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant on October 10, 2023.
Defendant Ryan
filed this motion to tax costs on November 9, 2023.  Plaintiffs filed an opposition on March 6,
2024.  Defendant filed a reply on March
12, 2024.  
 
Legal Standard
            To obtain costs, the prevailing
party must file and serve a memorandum of costs, which “must be verified by a
statement of the party, attorney, or agent that to the best of his or her
knowledge the items of cost are correct and were necessarily incurred in the
case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a).) 
            Copies of bills, invoices,
statements, or other documentation need not be attached to the memorandum (Jones
v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267), but the memorandum must
provide enough detail to determine the cost sought is statutorily awardable (Nelson
v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 132.)  If the items on the face of the cost
memorandum appear to be proper charges, the verified cost memorandum is prima
facie evidence of their propriety, and it is the challenging party who bears
the burden to show the costs were not reasonable or necessary.  (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn.
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.)  The
only identifiable requirement for a memo of costs is that it set forth the
costs claimed and be verified.  (CRC
3.1700(a)(1).)  
            The mere filing of a motion to tax
costs may be a proper objection to an item if the necessity of that item
appears doubtful, does not appear to be proper on its face (Nelson, supra,
72 Cal.App.4th at p. 131), or presents a legal question (Fennessy v.
Deleuw-Cather Corporation (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1192, 1195–1996 (motion to
tax questioning entitlement to deposition costs incurred by all six defendants
represented by the same counsel was sufficient to place the cost at issue
without additional declarations or affidavits).)  If section 1033.5 expressly allows the
particular item and it appears proper on its face, the burden is on the
objecting party to show the costs to be unnecessary or unreasonable. (Nelson,
supra, at 131.)
            If costs are properly placed at
issue, the burden of proof shifts to the party seeking costs to justify them by
providing evidence and supporting documentation that the costs were reasonable
and necessarily incurred. (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn., supra,
19 Cal.App.4th at p. 774; see Jones v. Dumrichob, supra, 63
Cal.App.4th at p. 1267.)
Discussion
            Defendant
Ryan moves to tax Plaintiffs’ memo of costs filed on October 25,
2023. 
Ryan’s initial briefing moved to tax on grounds that Plaintiffs failed
to provide any documentation in support of their motion to tax costs.  Ryan also moved to tax individual items as
follows:  (1) Item 1-Filing Fees in the
amount of $1,650; (2) Item 4—Deposition costs in the amount of $13,826.43; (3)
Item 5—Service of Process Costs in the amount of $811.98; (4) Item 8—Witness
Fees in the amount of $216,796.33; (5) Item 11—Models, Enlargements,
Photocopies in the amount of $8,545.63; (6) Item 12—Reporter’s Transcript Costs
in the amount of $76,903.77; and (7) Item 16—Other Costs in the amount of
$720,890.
            In
opposition, Plaintiff submitted over 500 pages of documentation to support its
memo of costs.  Plaintiff also conceded that
$738,362.20 in costs should be taxed. 
Plaintiff conceded to taxing the following cost items:  (1) attorney’s fees in the amount of
$720,890; (2) record retrieval of $3,010.02; and (3) prejudgment interest to
the extent the Court strikes the item without prejudice to a future motion for
recovery of prejudgment interest.  
            Plaintiffs
maintain they are entitled recover the remaining costs.  Plaintiff argues the costs were reasonable
and necessary and supported by documentation provided in opposition.  
            In
reply, Defendant maintains the disputed items are subject to being stricken as
being unnecessary and/or unreasonable. 
Defendant maintains the following costs items should be taxed:  (1) Item 1—$1,128; (2) Item 4—Deposition
Costs in the amount of $93,100.10; (3) Item 5—Service of Process Costs in the
amount of $1,555.24; (4) Item 8—Witness Fees in the amount of $170,241.05; (5)
Item 12—Reporter Transcripts in the amount of 
$62,441.59; (6) Item 16—Record Transcript Costs in the amount of
$62,4541.59; (7) Item 16—T
Record Retrieval in the full amount; (8) Item 16—travel expenses in the full
amount or $7,810.26. 
(1) Item 1 Filing Fees—DENY 
            Motion
to tax filing fees is denied.  Filing
fees are expressly recoverable under CCP §1033.5(a)(1).  
            The
messenger fees included in Item 1 are also recoverable to the extent reasonably
necessary and at the court’s discretion per CCP §1033.5(c)(4).  (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 132 (messenger fees not allowed where party failed to show
charges were reasonable or necessary); Benach v. County of Los Angeles
(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 836, 858 (messenger costs recoverable because of
complexity of legal issues involved, sheer volume of motions and pleadings
filed and served, and heavy workload maintained by two attorneys assigned to
case which prevented them from filing documents in advance of court deadlines).)  A declaration by counsel attesting to the use
of messenger fees relating to trial preparation, filing documents, complying
with discovery demands and transportation of exhibits to and from the courtroom
is substantial evidence of these charges were reasonably necessary.  (Ladas, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th
at 776.)  Counsel submits a declaration
attesting to the reasonable necessity of the messenger fees to deliver trial
documents and to deliver courtesy copies required by the Court.  (Opposition, Douglass Dec., ¶3.)  
            Per
CCP §1033.5(a)(14) allows for recovery of “[f]ees for the electronic filing or
service of documents through an electronic filing service provider if a court
requires or orders electronic filing or service of documents.”  The Los Angeles Superior Court mandated
electronic filing as of 1-2-19.  Plaintiffs’
electronic filing fee costs are therefore recoverable under CCP
§1033.5(a)(14).  
(2) Item 4 Deposition costs—DENY
            CCP
1033.5(a)(3)(A) allows for recovery of the costs for “[t]aking, video
recording, and transcribing necessary depositions, including an original and
one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy of depositions taken by
the party against whom costs are allowed. (B) Fees of a certified or registered
interpreter for the deposition of a party or witness who does not proficiently
speak or understand the English language. (C) Travel expenses to attend
depositions.”  Charges to expedite a transcript
are permitted within the discretion of the Court when the charge was reasonably
necessary to the conduct of litigation. (Hsu v. Semiconductor Systems, Inc.
(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1330, 1342.)
            On
reply, Defendant limits the request to tax deposition costs to $4,440.78 in
fees to expedite six deposition transcripts. 
Plaintiffs submit a declaration explaining the need to expedite the
deposition transcripts as a result of the pending trial date and the late dates
on which certain witnesses were produced. 
(Opposition, Douglass Dec., ¶8.)  Trial
was set for August 7, 2023, and the fees objected to by Defendants were
incurred for deposition within approximately three months of the trial
date.  The expedited fees were reasonably
necessary. 
(3) Item 5 Service of Process Costs—DENY
            Costs
for service of process by a public officer, registered process server, or other
means” are recoverable under CCP §1033.5(a(4)). 
On reply, the only remaining service of process costs in dispute are $368
for service of deposition notices on four witnesses who were never deposed due
to scheduling conflicts. The mere fact that they were ultimately not deposed
does not establish that their depositions were not reasonably necessary in
preparing the case for trial.  (Opposition,
Douglass Dec., ¶10.)  The motion to tax
is denied as to the service of process costs. 

(4) Item 8 Witness Fees—DENY 
            On
reply, Defendant continues to maintain $46,555.28 in expert witness fees for
Daniel Voss, Anand Shah, MD and Enrique Vega, MD should be stricken as
excessive.  Plaintiff’s counsel submits a
declaration explaining that Voss was required to review the analysis of
Defendant’s three accident reconstruction experts.  (Opposition, Douglass Dec., ¶¶14-15.)  
            Defendant’s
initial objection to the fees of Shah and Vega were limited to Plaintiffs’
failure to submit documentation. 
Plaintiffs cured this objection by submitted the invoices for all listed
experts, including Shah and Vega. 
(Opposition, Douglass Dec., Ex. H.) 

            Defendant
raises a new objection to Shah and Vega on reply, arguing that their charges
were double the charges incurred by Defendant for the same type of expert.  The court will not consider the argument as
it was raised for the first time on reply. 
Moreover, the mere fact that the fees for Plaintiffs’ experts were
approximately double the fees of Defense experts does not alone establish that
the costs were not reasonably necessary to the litigation.  
(5) Item 11 Models, Enlargements,
Photocopies—DENY 
            “Models,
the enlargements of exhibits and photocopies of exhibits, and the electronic
presentation of exhibits, including costs of rental equipment and electronic
formatting, may be allowed if they were reasonably helpful to aid the trier of
fact.”  (CCP §1033.5(a)(13).)  
            On
reply, Defendant no longer objects to these costs.  Defendant’s initial objection based on lack
of invoices and supporting documentation was cured by Plaintiffs’ submission of
supporting documentation.  (Opposition,
Douglass Dec., Ex. I.)  
(6) Item 12 Reporter’s Transcript Costs—
GRANT as to $14,462.18 
            Plaintiffs
agrees to $14,462.18 of the $62,441.59 in transcript costs should be
taxed.  On reply, Defendant accepts this
concession and does not assert any other objections to Item 12. 
(7) Item 16 Other Costs—GRANT as to $742,788.91
            Attorney’s
fees and record retrieval.  Plaintiffs
agree that (1) attorney’s fees in the amount of $720,890 and (2) $3,010 in
records retrieval costs should be taxed. 

            Prejudgment
interest.  Plaintiffs also agree that
the prejudgment interest should be stricken without prejudice to Plaintiffs
filing a separate motion for prejudgment interest.  Defendant’s motion to strike the prejudgment
interest from the memo of costs is granted on grounds that prejudgment interest
per CCP §998 should not be included as a cost item per CCP §998 but pursuant to
noticed motion.  
            Travel,
Food and Lodging Costs.  “The only
travel expenses authorized by section 1033.5 are those to attend depositions.
(§ 1033.5, subd. (a)(3).) Routine expenses for local travel by attorneys or
other firm employees are not reasonably necessary to the conduct of
litigation.”  Ladas, supra,
19 Cal.App.4th at 775–776; see also Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp.
(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 72.  CCP
1033.5(a)(3) “clearly contemplates recovery of travel costs incurred by counsel
to attend depositions.  By negative
implication, this statute does not provide for recovery of local travel
expenses by attorneys and other firm employees unrelated to attending
depositions nor does it allow recovery for meals eaten while attending local
depositions.”  (Gorman, supra,
178 Cal.App.4th at 73.)  
            On
its face, Defendant’s request for meal costs incurred during the course of the
litigation are not recoverable as “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation.”  Counsel was required to eat
lunch and dinner regardless of the litigation and eating at restaurants nearby
was merely convenient.  Likewise,
Defendant’s local travel expenses unrelated to depositions, including parking
fees and mileage/parking fees for attorneys and paralegals are not recoverable
per Ladas and Gorman.  
            Defendant
moved to tax Plaintiffs’ travel, food and lodging costs.  Defendant asks that the Court either tax
these costs in their entirety or limit Plaintiffs recovery to $4,750 for
lodging, $1368 for food, $1,365.81 for travel and $326.54 for parking.  
            Plaintiffs
fail to establish that they are entitled to recover these costs under CCP
§1033.5(a)(4) as reasonably necessary at the Court’s discretion.  Defendant’s motion to tax is granted as to
Item 16 for Lodging, Trial Related Travel and Conference Room during Trial in
the amount of $18,888.91.  
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s motion to tax costs is GRANTED in the amount of $757,251.09
and DENIED as to all other amounts.  
It is so
ordered.
