Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff 
            The
court considered the moving papers, the declaration in opposition and the reply
papers.
            Defendants’
motion to compel deposition of Plaintiff Ron Hacker, as Successor Trustee for
1713 Stearns Laverne Family Trust, dated August 1, 2012 to appear for oral
deposition is granted.  Plaintiff is
ordered to appear for deposition on April 12, 2024. 
Background
            Plaintiff
alleges he was the rightful owner of the property located at 1713-1717 Stearns
Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90035 prior to the illegal foreclosure sale scheduled
for July 6, 2016. Plaintiff alleges Defendants sold the subject property at
foreclosure sale based on void, forged and invalid documents.  
            The
operative complaint in this action is the Second Amended Complaint filed on
November 21, 2018.  Pursuant to the Stipulation
and Order filed on November 9, 2021, Plaintiff’s causes of action based on
breach of short sale agreement were stricken. 
The only remaining causes of action of the SAC are (1) 3rd
cause of action for wrongful foreclosure, (2) 5th cause of action
for unfair business practice under B&PC §17200, (3) 6th cause of
action for cancellation of void instruments, (4) 7th cause of action
for quiet title and (5) 8th cause of action for declaratory
relief.  
Discussion
            “If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (CCP §2025.450(a).)
            “A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with both of the following: (1) The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice. (2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (CCP §2025.450(b).)
            Defendants noticed Plaintiff’s deposition twice and
contacted Plaintiff about both nonappearances. 
(Motion, Chavat Dec., ¶¶4-13.)  Defendants
served Plaintiff with a Notice of Deposition on June 30, 2023 for deposition on
August 1, 2023.  (Id.)  After failing to appear at the August 1, 2023
deposition, Plaintiff served a second deposition notice on Plaintiff on August
4, 2023 for deposition on September 8, 2023. 
(Id. at ¶¶9-11.)  Plaintiff
failed to appear on September 8, 2023 after emailing Defendants at 3:13pm on
September 7, 2023 advising that he would unavailable.  (Id. at ¶12.)  Defendants ask that the Court sanction
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of $3,733.50.  
            In response, Plaintiff’s counsel
filed a declaration indicating that parties had agreed that Plaintiff would
appear for deposition on April 12, 2024. 
(Quigg Dec., ¶7.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel states that Defendants refused to continue the motion until after that
date.  (Id. at ¶8.)
            In reply, Defendants argue Plaintiff
does not dispute that he failed to appear twice for deposition.  Defendants argue they did not continue the
motion or take the motion off calendar, because they believe given Plaintiff’s
history of nonappearance that he may not appear for his deposition of April 12,
2024.  Defendants ask that the Court
order Plaintiff to appear for deposition and to pay sanctions in the amount of
$3,733.50.
            Defendants’ motion to compel
Plaintiff’s attendance at deposition is granted.  Defendants’ concern that Plaintiff will not
appear for his deposition on April 12, 2024, despite the parties’ agreement, is
reasonable.  Plaintiff is ordered to appear
for deposition on April 12, 2024. 
Plaintiff and counsel are ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of
$3,733.50 (8.9 hours @ $300/hr, $60 filing fee and $1,003.50 in costs obtaining
a Certificate of Non-Appearance), within 30 days.  
            It
is so ordered.
