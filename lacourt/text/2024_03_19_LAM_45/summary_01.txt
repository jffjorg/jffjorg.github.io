And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Rolf M. Treu on a motion to tax costs filed by Defendant Patrick Ryan. The case involves a motor vehicle accident that occurred on August 3, 2018, and the plaintiffs, Maynard Matthews and Tanis Matthews, filed the action on March 29, 2019. The trial took place from August 7, 2023 to August 31, 2023, and judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs on October 10, 2023.

The defendant disputes the reasonableness and necessity of certain costs incurred by the plaintiffs, including filing fees, deposition costs, service of process costs, witness fees, models and enlargements, and other costs. The court grants the defendant's motion to tax costs in the amount of $757,251.09 and denies it as to all other amounts.

The court finds that the filing fees, deposition costs, and service of process costs are recoverable under California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง1033.5. The court also finds that the witness fees and models and enlargements were reasonably necessary to the litigation. However, the court denies the defendant's motion to tax travel, food, and lodging costs, finding that they are not recoverable under CCP ยง1033.5.

The court grants the defendant's motion to tax costs for attorney's fees, record retrieval costs, and transcript costs, but only to the extent agreed to by the parties. The court denies the defendant's motion to strike the prejudgment interest from the memo of costs, finding that it should be stricken without prejudice to a future motion for recovery of prejudgment interest.
