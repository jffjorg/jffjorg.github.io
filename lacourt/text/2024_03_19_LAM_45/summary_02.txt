And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the Petition to Approve Minor Compromise of Disputed Claim filed by Plaintiff Imani Asiyah Fattah on behalf of minor Claimants Kaden Zion Rivers and DeAnder LeAnthony Brown Jr. The Court has also considered similar petitions filed by Britney Rouse on behalf of minor Claimant Sarai Crenshaw and by Plaintiff Althea Richardson on behalf of minor Claimants Jordyn Richardson, Jyair Thomas, Jeremiah Walker, and Jayden Jones.

The Court has reviewed the proposed settlements and finds that they are fair and reasonable. The requested attorney's fees, which amount to approximately 25% of the total settlement, are also fair and reasonable.

Therefore, the Court GRANTS the petitions and approves the compromises of the disputed claims. The Court sets an OSC for proof of deposit and directs that the money be deposited into a blocked account subject to withdrawal only upon authorization of the court.
