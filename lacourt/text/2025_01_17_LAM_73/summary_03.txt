And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's request for default, but denies their request for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff is ordered to submit a new default judgment application curing the defects in their previous application by January 31, 2025. The judge notes that the defendant owed the plaintiff rent in the amount of $122,333.33 and failed to file an answer to the complaint, justifying entry of default. However, the judge is inclined to only approve attorney fees in accordance with Los Angeles Superior Court Rule 3.214, and the plaintiff is required to submit a cost memorandum to determine what costs are allowable under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1033.5.
