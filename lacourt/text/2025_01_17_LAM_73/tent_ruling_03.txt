I. BACKGROUND
 
On
September 24, 2024, Plaintiffs Paul Sislin and Leno Sislin, Trustees of the
Sislin Family Trust, U/D/T dated July 10, 1992 (“Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint
for Unlawful Detainer against Defendant Byte to Bite (California), LLC
(“Defendant”). Plaintiffs allege that they own the real property commonly known
as 1954-1958 Colorado Boulevard, Eagle Rock, CA 90041 (the “Premises”).
(Compl., ¶2) Plaintiffs further allege on or about October 29, 2021, Plaintiffs
and Defendant entered into a written Standard Industrial/Commercial
Multi-Tenant Lease – Gross (the “Lease”) for a term of seven years commencing
December 1, 2021 and ending November 30, 2028 for $9,000.00 per month. (Id.
¶4, Ex. A.) Plaintiffs further allege as of August 2, 2024, Defendant owed
Plaintiffs rent in the amount of $122,333.33. (Id. ¶5.) Plaintiffs also
allege that a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit (the “Rent Notice”) was
personally served on Defendant on August 5, 2024 and expired on August 8, 2024.
(Id., Ex. B.)
 
Defendant
and all Unknown Occupants in Possession were served with the summons and
complaint on September 26, 2024 by substitute service on Kac “Doe,” Manager. 
 
On
October 7, 2024, Plaintiffs submitted a default judgment packet seeking entry
of default and default judgment. 
 
II.
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure Section 585 permits entry
of a judgment after a Defendant has failed to timely answer after being
properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by the Court
must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) except in unlawful detainer
cases, a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible
evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as
necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a declaration of
nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; (6) a
proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment
is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil Procedure
Section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits
as necessary; and (9) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by
the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800, subd. (a).)

Plaintiffs
seek default and default judgment against Defendant in the sum of $165,575.37
consisting of (1) $122,333.33 for past-due rent; (2) $33,800.00 for holdover
damages; (3) $5,344.50 for attorney fees; and (4) $1,097.54 for costs. (Decl.
for Default Judg. at ¶15(a).) Plaintiffs also seek possession of the Premises,
cancellation of the Lease, and forfeiture of the Lease. (Id. at
¶¶15(b)-(c).) Plaintiff has shown that Defendant was properly served with the
summons and complaint, and failed to file an Answer to the Complaint. Thus,
entry of default is appropriate.
 
As to default
judgment, the Court notes that the Lease states at Paragraph 31, “the
attorneys’ fees award shall not be computed in accordance with any court fee
schedule, but shall be such as to fully reimburse all attorneys’ fees
reasonably incurred.” However, Plaintiffs’ do not submit an attorney fee
declaration attesting to why greater fees should be allowed. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800, subd. (b).) Thus, the
Court is inclined to only approve attorney fees pursuant to Los Angeles
Superior Court (“LASC”), Rule 3.214, subdivision (a), which is calculated as
follows: [0.01 (1%) x $65,575.37 (the excess over $100,000.00) + $2,890.00 =
$3,545.75]. Likewise, the declaration for default judgment by court submitted
by Plaintiffs indicates court costs in this case including fee are $1,097.54
but there is no cost memorandum provided for the Court to determine what the
other costs and if they are items allowable per Code of Civil Procedure Section
1033.5. (Decl. for Default Judg. at ¶14.)
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ request for default is
GRANTED. Plaintiffs’ request for default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to submit a new default judgment
application curing the above identified defects by January 31, 2025.
