And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, IN-N-OUT BURGER, has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff, TONY A HADLEY, cannot establish that IN-N-OUT was negligent or that IN-N-OUT's negligence caused the plaintiff's alleged harm. The defendant has met its initial burden to show that there are no triable issues of material fact as to whether it was negligent, whether there was a dangerous condition, and whether the defendant's negligence caused the plaintiff's injuries. The plaintiff has failed to provide any argument in response to the defendant's argument and evidence in this motion. The plaintiff's opposition merely recounts the legal standard for a motion for summary judgment and the law as it pertains to his causes of action, but fails to provide any factual evidence to support his claims. Therefore, the Court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and denies the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions as moot. The Court also grants the defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents and orders.
