And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for an order compelling the Superior Court Judge to execute subpoenas as to Veterans Affairs. The defendant has attempted to obtain the specific authorization used by the VA from the plaintiff, but to no avail. The VA will accept a judge-signed subpoena to obtain records, but the defendant has not provided any authority for this motion. The court does have authority to compel a non-party's compliance with a proper deposition subpoena for records, but the judge cannot create additional methods of discovery. The defendant may bring a motion to compel compliance after personally serving the deposition subpoena on the VA Hospital and personally serving any motion on the VA Hospital.
