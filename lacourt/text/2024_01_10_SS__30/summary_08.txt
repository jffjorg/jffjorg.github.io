And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motion to reclassify the case as a limited jurisdiction action is denied. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's damages will not exceed $25,000, citing medical bills of $3,885, property damage already paid, and no claim for loss of income. However, the plaintiff argues that her ongoing medical treatment and claims for general damages and wage loss put her potential damages above the jurisdictional amount. The court finds that there is no "high level of certainty" that the plaintiff's damages will not exceed $25,000, and therefore denies the motion to reclassify.
