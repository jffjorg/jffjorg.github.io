            The motion

BACKGROUND
            On January 4, 2024, plaintiff John
Yeressian filed a complaint against defendants Stephanie Andrea Martinez
Espinoza, Chrstiain Martinez Espinoza, Juan L. Martinez, Hala Zahalan, and Does
1 to 30, inclusive, for (1) breach of contract, (2) common counts, (3) fraud,
and (4) intentional deceit. 
            On February 15, 2024, default was
entered against Mercedes Gabriela Alvarez Rivera, who was not named in the
complaint. Also, on such date, default was entered against defendant Christian
Martinez Espinoza. 
            On February 29, 2024, default was
entered against defendant Juan L. Martinez. 
            On March 22, 2024, default was
entered against defendant Hala Zahalan. 
            On April 2, 2024, default was
entered against defendant Stephanie Andrea Martinez Espinoza. 
            On June 21, 2024, the court held a case
management conference at which plaintiff and defendants appeared. (06/21/24
Minute Order.) On the court’s own motion, the court continued the case
management conference to July 12, 2024. (06/21/24 Minute Order.) 
            On July 10, 2024, plaintiff filed and
served the instant motion to continue case management conference. 
            On July 12, 2024, the court held a case
management conference and the court indicated that it was “aware of the Plaintiff’s
Proposed Motion to Continue the Case Management Conference submitted on
07/10/2024.” (07/12/24 Minute Order.) The court, after reviewing the motion,
denied plaintiff’s motion to continue on the grounds it was untimely and
unacceptable. (07/12/24 Minute Order.) The court continued the case management
conference, on its own motion, to October 1, 2024. (07/12/24 Minute Order.) 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            “[C]ourts have inherent authority to
control their own calendars and dockets . . . .” Walker v. Superior Court (1991)
53 Cal.3d 257, 267. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff
seeks an order continuing the July 12, 2024 case management conference for 60
days to September 27, 2024 or the next available Monday in October on the
court’s calendar.
The
court, however, has already reviewed and denied plaintiff’s motion to continue
the case management conference. (07/12/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) Moreover, the
court has already continued the July 12, 2024 case management conference to
October 1, 2024. (07/12/24 Minute Order at pp. 1-2.) 
As such,
plaintiff’s motion is moot. 
ORDER
            The
motion is taken OFF-CALENDAR as it is MOOT.
            Moving
party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
