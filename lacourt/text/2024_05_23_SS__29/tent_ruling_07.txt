 Case Number:  22STCV32697    Hearing Date:   May 23, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint from Defendants Rosegarden
Center, LLC and Westridge Commercial, Inc.
 
Tentative
On October 5, 2022, Randy Gill (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Dhillon Foods, Inc. dba Jack in the Box, Rosegarden Center,
LLC, and Westridge Commercial, Inc. for premises liability and general
negligence causes of action arising from a fall relating to a railing which
collapsed. 
 
On March 27, 2023, Dhillon Foods filed an answer and
cross-complaint against Roes 1 to 15 for (1) express indemnity, (2) equitable
indemnity, (3) contribution, and (4) declaratory relief.
 
On March 30, 2023, Rosegarden Center, LLC and Westridge
Commercial, Inc (“Moving Defendants”) filed an answer. On December 12, 2023,
Moving Defendants filed a cross-complaint Dhillon Foods, Inc dba Jack in the
Box for (1) express indemnity, (2) equitable indemnity, (3) contribution, and
(4) declaratory relief.
 
January 9, 2024, Moving Defendants filed this motion for
leave to file a cross-complaint. No opposition has been filed. 
 
The motion was heard on April 23, 2024.  Moving parties had failed to include in their
moving papers a copy of the proposed cross-complaint, as is required by the
rules.  Accordingly, the Court continued
the hearing to May 23 to allow moving parties to cure this procedural defect.  The Court ordered moving parties to file and
serve a declaration from counsel attaching the proposed cross-complaint by
April 30.
 
Moving Defendants did not do so.  They did file such a declaration before April
30, on April 30, or at any time since April 30.
 
As a result, the motion is denied, without prejudice, for
failure to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a)(1).
 
Moving parties to give notice.
