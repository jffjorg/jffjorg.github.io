  Case Number:  20STCV30503    Hearing Date:   May 23, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff 
 
Tentative
The
motion is granted.
Background
On August 12, 2020, Maria Velasco Rodas (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Defendant”), Lisa Doe, and
Does 1 through 25, asserting causes of action for negligence and premises
liability arising out of a slip and fall that occurred on November 18, 2018, in
a Costco store on Century Boulevard in Inglewood. 
The Court does not see an answer to the complaint in the file.
Defendant appeared in this action in November 2021 and has been litigating the
matter.
Defendant has noticed Plaintiff’s deposition
on multiple occasions, beginning in December 2022.  (Bell Decl., ¶¶ 4-9 & Exhs. A-E.)  In February 2024, Plaintiff confirmed that
she was available for deposition on March 19, 2024.  (Id., ¶ 10 & Exh. F.)  Defendant then served a notice for Plaintiff
to appear for deposition on March 19.  (Id.,
¶ 11 & Exh. G.)  Two days before the scheduled
deposition, Plaintiff reached out to confirm that Defendant would provide an
interpreter for the deposition.  (Id.,
¶ 12 & Exh. H.)  Plaintiff did not
appear for the deposition.  (Id.,
¶¶ 13-15.)  Defendant contacted Plaintiff
to inquire about the nonappearance.  (Id.,
Exh. H.)
On April 5, 2024, Defendant filed the motion
to compel the deposition of Plaintiff. 
Defendant also seeks sanctions.
No opposition has been filed. 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd.
(a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  Any such motion to compel
must show good cause for the production of documents and, when a deponent has
failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a declaration stating that
the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.”  (Id., subd.
(b).)   
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
After numerous prior attempts to take
Plaintiff’s deposition, Plaintiff confirmed that she was available for
deposition on March 19, 2024.  (Bell
Decl., ¶ 10 & Exh. F.)  Defendant noticed
the deposition for that date and, upon Plaintiff’s request, confirmed that an
interpreter would be available.  (Id.,
¶¶ 11-12 & Exhs. G-H.)  Plaintiff did
not appear.  (Id., ¶¶ 13-15.)
Plaintiff
did not serve objections, appear for the deposition, or oppose this
motion.  Defendant has made a sufficient
showing in support of its motion.  Therefore,
the motion to compel is granted.
 
The
Court also grants in part Defendant’s request for sanctions. The Court sets
sanctions in the amount of $2,378.45. 
That amount is calculated based on the following.  First, given the relatively straightforward
nature of this motion, the awards sanctions based on 2 hours of attorney time, multiplied
by a reasonable billable rate of $205 per hour for the work necessary on this
motion, for a total of $410.  (See Bell
Decl., ¶ 17.)  In addition, the Court includes
in the sanctions the costs reasonably incurred by Defendant of the $60 filing
fee for the motion, a court reporter fee of $450, a videographer fee of
$418.50, and interpreter services of $1,039.95.  (Id., ¶¶ 18, 20.)
