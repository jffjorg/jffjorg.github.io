```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for a second physical examination of the plaintiff without prejudice. The defendant sought to conduct a second examination by a neurosurgeon, citing the need to assess the plaintiff's ongoing neck and back pain and potential future treatments. The court found that the defendant had shown good cause for the examination, but denied the motion due to a procedural error in the defendant's moving papers. The court ruled that the defendant's failure to specify the type of tests and examinations to be performed in the motion was insufficient, and that the defendant should have included this information in the original motion rather than in a subsequent reply.
