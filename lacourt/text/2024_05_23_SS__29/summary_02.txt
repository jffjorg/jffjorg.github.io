And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling is that the motion to substitute a successor in interest, filed by Karma Townsend, the son of the deceased Plaintiff Jarrett Townsend, is continued. The Court notes that Jarrett Townsend died on September 21, 2023, and that Karma is his only child and successor in interest. However, since Karma is a minor, a guardian ad litem must be appointed. The Court has rejected the previous application for appointment of a guardian ad litem due to procedural reasons, and the Court will continue the motion pending the appointment of a guardian ad litem.
