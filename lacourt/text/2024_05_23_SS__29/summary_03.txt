Here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge grants the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Defendant Abel Reyna. The settlement was made in good faith as it is the maximum available to Reyna from insurance with no other assets currently available to him and there is no evidence of collusion or fraud. The Judge finds that the settlement was reasonable in light of the settling tortfeasor's proportionate share of liability.
