And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer with a motion to strike filed by the defendant, Brandy Blaske. The defendant demurs to the plaintiff, Michael Allen Longmire's, First Amended Complaint (FAC) for breach of contract. However, the court has no record of the FAC being filed, and Blaske only references an allegedly filed FAC in her demurrer. The judge notes that there is no motion to strike filed and that the hearing scheduled for September 10, 2024, is a demurrer with a motion to strike, but since there is no motion to strike mentioned or filed alongside the demurrer, the judge cannot rule on the motion to strike. The judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer, without prejudice.
