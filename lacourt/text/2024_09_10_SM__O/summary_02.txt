And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary adjudication filed by Plaintiff Ronny Graham against Defendant Windsor Haysac Holdings, LLC. The motion was filed to dispose of certain affirmative defenses raised by the defendant.

The judge granted the motion as to the 2nd, 4th, 12th, 15th, and 16th affirmative defenses, which were previously withdrawn by the defendant. The judge denied the motion as to the 20th affirmative defense, which was not withdrawn by the defendant.

The judge also denied the defendant's 13th affirmative defense for Offset, which was based on the doctrine of comparative negligence. The judge found that the doctrine does not apply to the case because the defendant's breach of duty was a professional one, and MICRA (Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act) applies to such cases.

Finally, the judge continued the defendant's 23rd affirmative defense for Binding Arbitration Agreement, pending the outcome of a subpoena issued by the defendant to obtain medical records from Kaiser Permanente, which may contain an arbitration agreement that governs the case.
