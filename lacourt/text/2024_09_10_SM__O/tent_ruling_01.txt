ORAL TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendant Brady Blaske’s Demurrer to Plaintiff Michael
Allen Longmire’s first and only cause of action within his First Amended
Complaint  for breach of contract is OVERRULED,
without prejudice.  
 
            Defendant Brady Blaske (“Blaske”) demurs to Plaintiff Michael
Allen Longmire’s (“Longmire”) FAC, however the Court has no record of a FAC
being filed. Blaske references an allegedly filed FAC in the demurrer, so it
appears Longmire served Blaske with the FAC, but never filed with the Court. Blaske
did not include the FAC filing date in her demurrer, nor did she attach a copy
of the FAC to the demurrer. 
 
            The Court notes that there is no motion to strike filed,
and no motion to strike is mentioned in the caption of the motion, however the
hearing scheduled for 9-10-24 is a Demurrer with Motion to Strike. Since
there is no motion to strike mentioned or filed alongside or within the
demurrer the Court cannot rule on any motion to strike.
