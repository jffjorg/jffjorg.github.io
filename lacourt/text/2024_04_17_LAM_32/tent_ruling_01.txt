PAULA PURCELL,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
EQUITY RESIDENTIAL MANAGEMENT LLC, et
  al., 
                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV25037
  Hearing Date:  April 17, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 13, 2023, Plaintiff Paula
Purcell filed this action against Defendants Equity Residential Management LLC
and Duane Oseguera. The complaint alleges that Plaintiff’s neighbor harassed
and terrorized her and that Defendants knowingly failed to address the
situation. Plaintiff has since dismissed Duane Oseguera from the complaint. 
            On March 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel Defendant Equity’s responses to interrogatories
and requests for production. Defendant filed its opposition on April 4, 2024. Plaintiff
filed her reply on April 5, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff served the subject
discovery on February 1, 2024. (Greer Decl. ¶ 4.) Defendant did not provide
responses by the deadline of March 6, 2024. (Id., ¶ 5.) Defense counsel
requested an extension after the deadline, and Plaintiff agreed to an extra 1.5
weeks, to March 18, 2024. (Id., ¶ 6.) Defendant failed to provide
responses by that deadline as well. (Ibid.) Defendant did not provide
responses until March 22, 2024, after this motion was filed. (Malloy Decl. ¶
8.) Plaintiff acknowledges in reply that the motion is moot to the extent it
seeks an order compelling responses.  
            However, Plaintiff maintains the
motion as to sanctions. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal. App. 4th 390, 408-09.) Defense
counsel avers that he missed the initial March 6 deadline due to a calendaring
oversight. (Malloy Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant ultimately served responses four days
after the voluntary extension. The Court finds that the delay was due to
inadvertence or excusable neglect and did not result in prejudice to Plaintiff.
Therefore, sanctions are not warranted for this motion. To the extent Plaintiff
believes the responses are inadequate, she may file a motion to compel further,
and sanctions for that will be considered separately.   
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel is DENIED
as moot. Sanctions are denied.
