And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding Plaintiff Paula Purcell's motion to compel responses from Defendant Equity Residential Management LLC. The Plaintiff had filed the motion on March 20, 2024, after Defendant failed to provide responses to interrogatories and requests for production by the deadline. Despite a voluntary extension granted by the Plaintiff, Defendant failed to provide the requested information. The judge has denied the motion to compel responses as moot, as the Defendant has now provided the requested information. The judge has also denied sanctions, finding that the delay in providing responses was due to inadvertence or excusable neglect and did not result in prejudice to the Plaintiff. The judge has given the Plaintiff permission to file a separate motion to compel further responses if necessary.
