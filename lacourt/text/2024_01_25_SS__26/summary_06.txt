And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is written by a judge in a court case between Romex Textiles, Inc. (plaintiff) and Promises, Promises, Inc. and Eugene Michael Hardy (defendants). The case is about a breach of contract and common counts. The defendants filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint, which the judge sustains with 20 days leave to amend. The judge also deems the motion to strike portions of the first amended complaint moot. The judge finds that the plaintiff's reliance on invoices alone is not sufficient to allege the existence of a written contract between the parties. The judge also finds that the common counts are based on the same facts as the breach of contract claim and therefore must also fail. The judge grants leave to amend with 20 days to amend, allowing the plaintiff to re-file a complaint that satisfies the court's requirements.
