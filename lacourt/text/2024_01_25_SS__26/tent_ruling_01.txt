Walia
v. Azusa Unified School District, et al. MOTION TO TAX OR STRIKE COSTS(Govt.
Code, § 12965)





TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Azusa Unified School
District’s Motion to Tax Costs is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
This action arises
from the employment of Plaintiff Pritpal Walia (“Plaintiff”) as an afternoon
aid for Defendant Azusa Unified School District (“Defendant”). On August 5,
2019, Plaintiff filed the operative Complaint for (1) FEHA discrimination, (2)
FEHA retaliation, (3) FEHA failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation,
(4) FEHA failure to provide reasonable accommodations, (5) FEHA failure to
engage in the interactive process, (6) declaratory relief, and (7) failure to
permit inspection of personnel and payroll records. The action was initially
filed as an unlimited civil case. 
 
Plaintiff passed away during the pendency of
this action and a stipulation was filed allowing their successor-in-interest,
Manmohan Walia (“Plaintiff’s successor”), to substitute into the case. (Stip
and Order, 05/18/21.) On March 21, 2022, the action was reclassified to the
limited jurisdiction court. 
 
On November 19, 2019, trial in this matter
was set for August 17, 2020. Trial was then continued multiple times until
October 25, 2022. On October 4, 2022, the Court held a hearing on Defendant’s
Motion to Quash Trial Subpoenas, at which time it set an Order to Show Cause
regarding Bench Trial v. Jury Trial for October 11, 2022. (Minute Order,
10/04/22.) On October 11, 2022, the OSC was continued to November 3, 2022.
(Minute Order, 10/11/22.) 
 
On October 25, 2022, the Court did not call
the matter for trial and placed it off calendar. (Minute Order, 10/25/22.) On
November 3, 2022, the Court set a Motion to Determine Bench Trial vs Jury Trial
for January 10, 2023. On January 10, 2023, the Court set the matter for jury
trial. (Minute Order, 01/10/23.) On August 4, 2023, the parties filed a 998
offer to compromise and the Court entered judgment accordingly on August 28,
2023. (Offer to Compromise, filed 08/04/23.) Judgment was entered in the amount
of $7,999.99 in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant. (Judgment, 08/28/23.)
Notice of entry of judgment was filed on October 20, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs on
October 24, 2023. Defendant filed the instant Motion to Tax and/or Strike Costs
on November 8, 2023. Plaintiff’s successor filed an opposition on January 11,
2024 and Defendant replied on January 18, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
“Any
notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days
after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by
mail, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section
1013. If the cost memorandum was served electronically, the period is extended
as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1).) The Memorandum of Costs was timely filed and
served on Defendant on October 24, 2023 by mail. (Memo of Costs, filed
10/24/23, p. 2.) The instant Motion to Tax Costs was timely filed and served 15
days later. 
 
Defendant moves to tax certain itemized costs set forth in the Memorandum
of Costs pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5 on the grounds that they were not “reasonably necessary.”
(Citing Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c).) In opposition, Plaintiff’s
successor argues that the correct standard for costs is whether they were
“reasonable” under the FEHA statute. (Citing Govt. Code, § 12965, subd.
(c)(6).) The parties, therefore, dispute the correct statute for determining
what costs can be awarded in this action. The Court finds that Plaintiff is
seeking costs under Government Code section 12965 and that filing a memorandum
of costs does not limit Plaintiff’s successor to costs under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5, as Defendant argues in its reply. Government Code
section 12965 does not prohibit a party moving for costs from utilizing the
optional Judicial Council memorandum of costs form, or otherwise require a
noticed motion. Defendant argues that it cannot assume that Plaintiff was
moving for costs under Government Code section 12965 but the Complaint makes
the basis of the costs request clear. Each of the causes of action, save the
seventh under the Labor Code, cites Government Code section 12965 as the authority
for costs and attorney’s fees. (Compl., ¶¶44, 55, 60, 67, 74, 84.) Ultimately,
it does not appear that the standard under the statutes is markedly different.
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 refers to “reasonably necessary” costs,
Government Code section 12965 refers to “reasonable” costs, and Rule 3.1700
refers to costs that were “necessarily incurred.” 
 
Defendant moves to
strike (1) Item 4, deposition costs in the amount of $4,402.29; (2) Item 5,
service of process costs in the amount of $125.00; (3) Item 11, court reporter
fees in the amount of $659.00; (4) Item 13, interpreter fees of $480.00; and
(5) Item 16, other fees in the amount of $5,891.79.
 
Items 4 and 13
 
The Court will consider
all these costs together as they pertain to the depositions of six witnesses
(Plaintiff’s fellow playground workers). Defendant argues that the six
depositions were unnecessary as they were taken in very close proximity to
Plaintiff’s death, which limited the damages to her lost income and benefits.
(Motion, Williams Decl., Exh. 1.) This argument does not address to what extent
the co-worker depositions were necessary to demonstrate Defendant’s liability. Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment was initially set for hearing on April 6, 2021 and
trial was set for June 21, 2021. As pointed out in the opposition, Plaintiff’s
counsel could not have known exactly when Plaintiff would pass away even if she
was ailing at the time of the mediation in March 2021. Three of the depositions
were taken on March 15, 2021 and three were taken on March 17, 2021, which was
the day Plaintiff passed away. (Motion, Williams Decl., ¶¶8-9.) Furthermore,
Defendant did not file the motion to reclassify until December 2021 and it was
not granted until March 2022. The posture of the action in March 2021,
therefore, was of an unlimited case and the taking of Plaintiff’s co-workers’
depositions to investigate questions of liability was reasonable. The Court
denies the request to strike the costs from Items 4 and 13.
 
Items 5 and 11
 
These costs concern
service of process and court reporter fees for Plaintiff’s successor’s
opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Quash Plaintiff’s Notice to Appear at Trial
in Lieu of Subpoena. Defendant argues that it prevailed on the Motion to Quash
with respect to eight of the nine witnesses involved. While Defendant
predominately prevailed on the Motion to Quash, Plaintiff’s opposition was not
unreasonable because it addressed and ultimately, preserved, the Notice to
Appear at Trial with respect to witness Jorge Ronquillo. (Minute Order,
11/03/24.) Defendant conceded that the Motion to Quash was improper as to that
witness in its reply. (Ibid.) The costs in connection with Plaintiff’s
successor’s opposition to the Motion to Quash were reasonable. The request to
strike costs in Items 5 and 11 is denied. 
 
Item 16
 
Defendant moves to tax
the “other” costs in Item 16 in the amount of $5,891.79 for mail and
photocopies, investigations (skip tracing), travel expenses, food allowances,
and mediation expenses. Although Defendant broadly objects that these expenses
are expressly disallowed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 and were not
reasonably necessary to the litigation, the Motion does not provide an analysis
of the reasonably necessary objection with respect to mail, photocopies, skip
tracing, or travel expenses. Instead, Defendant only provides argument and
authority that these costs are not allowed under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5. (Motion, pp. 9:13-10:8.) As discussed above, Plaintiff’s
successor is moving for reasonable costs under Government Code section 12965.
By failing to address why these costs were not reasonably incurred in the
litigation, Defendant has not shown a basis to strike them.
 
Defendant’s objections
to the food allowance as unreasonable is based on the argument that parties
have to eat whether they are conducting litigation or not. (Citing Ladas v.
California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 775.) In
opposition, Plaintiff’s successor points out that Plaintiff had to travel to
defense counsel’s office for an all-day deposition while ill, making the meal
expense reasonable. The Court finds the meal expense to be reasonable. While
parties do have to eat regardless of whether they are conducting litigation,
there is a significant difference in the cost of eating out compared to, say,
eating at home. 
 
Finally, Defendant
moves to tax the mediation costs incurred by Plaintiff on the grounds that
Plaintiff’s counsel did not participate in good faith, as evidenced by the
excessively high floor demand made at the start of the mediation, from which
Plaintiff’s counsel only came down on the eve of trial. (Motion, Williams
Decl., ¶¶11-19 and Exh. D.) Defendant cites to Berkeley Cement, Inc. v.
Regents of Univ. of California (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1133 for the rule
that, “The question whether mediation fees should be awarded as costs in a
particular matter must be determined based on the facts and circumstances of
the particular action.” (Berkeley Cement, Inc. v. Regents of Univ. of
California (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1133, 1143.) Berkeley, however,
concerned a case where the mediation was not court-ordered and its ruling was
that “mediation fees incurred for mediation that was not ordered by the court
are not categorically nonrecoverable as “not reasonably necessary to the
conduct of litigation.” (Ibid.) The more relevant case is Gibson v.
Bobroff (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1202, in which the Court of Appeals upheld
the trial court’s determination that an award of costs for court-ordered
mediation could be made under the discretionary provision of the costs statute,
even where the mediation had been unsuccessful. (Gibson v. Bobroff
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1209.) Here, the parties were ordered to mediation
by the court and Plaintiff had no option but to incur the costs. 
 
Regarding whether
Plaintiff’s mediation conduct was in bad faith, as Defendant argues, Plaintiff’s
successor objects that Defendant has revealed mediation communications in
violation of Evidence Code section 1119. Evidence Code section 1119 states: “No
evidence of anything said or any admission made for the purpose of, in the
course of, or pursuant to, a mediation or a mediation consultation is
admissible or subject to discovery, and disclosure of the evidence shall not be
compelled, in any arbitration, administrative adjudication, civil action, or
other noncriminal proceeding in which, pursuant to law, testimony can be
compelled to be given.” (Cal. Evid. Code, § 1119, subd. (a).) Defendant’s
introduction of the attorneys’ communications prior to starting the mediation
fall within the broad purview of matters said “for the purpose of, in the
course of, or pursuant to, a mediation.” The reply incorrectly argues that the
communications are not barred because they are not offered for admission in an
arbitration, administrative adjudication or civil action. This ignores the
plain language of the first sentence of the statutory provision. The Court,
therefore, will not consider Defendant’s evidence of these communications and
finds that in light of the order to mediate, the costs were reasonably incurred
by Plaintiff. The request to tax the costs in Item 16 is denied.
 
Finally, Defendant
makes arguments in reply that were not raised in the Motion, which the Court
will not consider because Plaintiff’s successor did not have an opportunity to
address them. These arguments include (1) that Court may deny attorney’s fees and
costs if a FEHA case could have been brought in the limited jurisdiction court
and the judgment was within the limited jurisdiction maximum, citing Chavez
v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970; and (2) Plaintiff’s successor
has not shown they are the prevailing party under Government Code section 12965.
 
Conclusion
 
Based
on the foregoing, Defendant Azusa Unified School District’s Motion to Tax Costs
is DENIED.

 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
