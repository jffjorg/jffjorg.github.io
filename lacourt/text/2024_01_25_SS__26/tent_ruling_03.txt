 Case Number:  22STLC01445    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  26  
Wilson v. ND Sepulveda II, LP, et alMOTION
TO VACATE DISMISSALTENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Leon Wilson’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal is
DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Leon Wilson (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action
against Defendant ND Sepulveda II, LP (“Defendant”) on March 3, 2022. The case
came for trial on August 31, 2023 and upon Plaintiff’s failure to appear, the
Court dismissed the case without prejudice. (Minute Order, 08/31/23.) Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on October 24, 2023. The Motion
initially came for hearing on November 15, 2023 and was continued to allow
Plaintiff to file supplemental briefing. No supplemental briefing has been
filed to date. 
 
As the Court previously noted, the
Motion is not accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities, as
required. “The memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a concise
statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the
statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b).) Indeed, Plaintiff’s failure to provide a
memorandum as required by the Rule is an “admission that the [request] is
without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(a),
(b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 964,
976.)
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff Leon Wilson’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal is DENIED.

 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
