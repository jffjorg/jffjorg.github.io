And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Leon Wilson's Motion to Vacate Dismissal. The case was originally filed on March 3, 2022, and was dismissed without prejudice on August 31, 2023, due to Plaintiff's failure to appear in court. The Motion was filed on October 24, 2023, and was initially set for hearing on November 15, 2023, but was continued to allow Plaintiff to file supplemental briefing. However, no supplemental briefing has been filed. The Court notes that the Motion is not accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b). The Court concludes that Plaintiff's failure to provide a memorandum is an admission that the request is without merit and cause for its denial, and therefore denies the Motion.
