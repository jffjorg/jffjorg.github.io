ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Nationwide Mutual
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for automobile
subrogation against Defendant Curtis Brown (“Defendant”) on April 20, 2023. June
2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a copy of the
parties’ settlement agreement with a request for dismissal and retention of
jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The Court dismissed
the action pursuant to the stipulation on the same date. (Stip and Order, filed
06/02/23.) 
 
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment. To
date, no opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) Plaintiff has demonstrated the settlement agreement complies with
the statutory requirements set forth above as it was signed by both parties.
(Motion, Smith Decl., Exh. 1, pp. 5-6.)
 
Furthermore,
the request for retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the
parties, before the action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of
jurisdiction to conform to the statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis
(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If, after a suit has been dismissed, a party
brings a section 664.6 motion for a judgment on a settlement agreement but
cannot present to the court a request for retention of jurisdiction that meets
all of these requirements, then enforcement of the agreement must be left to a
separate lawsuit.”].) The parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction
complies with these requirements because it was made in writing to the Court
before the action was dismissed. (Motion, Smith Decl., Exh. 1, ¶7.) 

 
The
settlement provides that Defendant would pay Plaintiff $15,601.22, plus filing
fees in the sum of $740.00, plus service fees in the sum of $69.00, plus
mandatory e-filing fees in the sum of $40.89, through monthly payments starting
on June 29, 2023. (Id. at Exh. 1, ¶3.) The settlement agreement also
provides that if Defendant defaulted, Plaintiff would seek judgment in the settlement
amount, less any monies paid, plus costs. (Id. at Exh. 1, ¶6.) Payments
of only $228.48 were made towards the settlement, after which Defendant
defaulted. (Id. at ¶¶6-7 and Exh. 2.) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff is
entitled to entry of judgment against Defendant in the requested amount of $15,372.74
principal ($15,601.22 - $228.48), $895.48 costs, and interest in the sum of
$772.87. (Id. at ¶8.) 

 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Nationwide Mutual
Insurance Company’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED. JUDGMENT
IS TO BE ENTERED IN PLAINTIFF’S FAVOR AND AGAINST DEFENDANT CURTIS BROWN IN THE AMOUNT OF $15,371.12
PRINCIPAL, $895.48 COSTS, AND $722.87 INTEREST.
