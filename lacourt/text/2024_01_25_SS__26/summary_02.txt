And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Judgment Creditor Salvatore Manzella's request for attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $1,775.01 in attorney's fees and $160.01 in costs. The court found that Judgment Debtor Rami S. Najjarin failed to comply with court orders and ordered a bench warrant, which was later recalled and quashed. Judgment Creditor incurred additional attorney's fees after filing the motion, which the court did not find reasonable. The court awarded Judgment Creditor an additional $500.00 in attorney's fees, bringing the total to $1,775.01, plus costs of $160.01.
