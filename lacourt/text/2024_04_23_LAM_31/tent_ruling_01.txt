RJP Investment Group, Inc., et al. CASE NO.:                 21STCV46480  MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL MOVING PARTY:               Neil Pedersen, Pederson Law, APC RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition  I.         INTRODUCTION On February 22, 2024, Neil Pedersen, counsel for Plaintiff, Aziz Damak, filed this Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.               The Motion is unopposed. II.        LEGAL STANDARD  California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).  The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)   III.      DISCUSSION  Neil Pedersen seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff for the following reasons: “Mr. Damak will not consent to voluntary withdrawal and refuses to sign Substitution of Attorney.”  (Form MC-052.)    Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)   Upon review, the court finds the Motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. IV.       CONCLUSION                    Accordingly, the unopposed Motion is GRANTED and effective upon the filing of the proof of service of this signed order upon Plaintiff.            The court sets a Status Conference re: Plaintiff’s Counsel for May 16, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.               Counsel to give notice.Dated:   April 23, 2024                                         Kerry Bensinger    Judge of the Superior Court
