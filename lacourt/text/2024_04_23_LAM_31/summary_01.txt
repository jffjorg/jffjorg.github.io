Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Neil Pedersen, counsel for Plaintiff Aziz Damak. The motion was filed because the Plaintiff will not consent to voluntary withdrawal and refuses to sign a Substitution of Attorney. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but must consider whether withdrawal would cause prejudice to the client. In this case, the court finds that the motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and grants the motion. The court also sets a Status Conference for May 16, 2024.
