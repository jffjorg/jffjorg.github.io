Significant Statements:

  - "Courts must instead place the burden on the party asserting a privacy interest to establish its extent and the seriousness of the prospective invasion, and against that showing must weigh the countervailing interests the opposing party identifies, as Hill requires." (Williams v. Superior Court)
  - "The party seeking information may raise in response whatever legitimate and important countervailing interests disclosure serves, while the party seeking protection may identify feasible alternatives that serve the same interests or protective measures that would diminish the loss of privacy. A court must then balance these competing considerations." (Williams v. Superior Court)
  - "Any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action ... if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." (CCP § 2017.010)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Jacob Shaw's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents (RPD Nos. 54, 55, and 56) related to Honda's hiring decisions. The judge found that there are alternative means to obtain the information requested that are less burdensome, such as submitting interrogatories or deposition questions. The judge also denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions against Defendant Honda. Additionally, the judge granted Plaintiff's request to strike the sur-reply. The judge's ruling is based on the principles of privacy and the need to balance competing interests.
