Background
 
On December 5,
2022, Jacob Shaw (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Honda Performance
Development, Inc. (“Honda”); Experis US, Inc.; Experis US, LLC; Manpower Group
US, Inc. (“Manpower”) (collectively “Defendants”) and Does 1 to 50.  
 
On May 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint.  On July 7, 2023, the parties stipulated to allow
Plaintiff to file the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).  On October 4,
2023, the court granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to file a Third Amended
Complaint (“TAC”). The TAC alleges fifteen causes of action: (1) disability discrimination, (2) failure to engage in
the interactive process, (3) failure to accommodate disability, (4) retaliation
in violation of Gov. Code § 12940(m)(2), (5) violation of the California Family
Rights Act, (6) failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, (7)
violation of Labor Code section 233 and 234, (8) wrongful termination in
violation of public policy; (9) failure to pay overtime wages; (10) failure to
provide meal periods, (11) failure to authorize and permit rest periods, (12)
failure to pay all wages due upon separation, (13) failure to furnish accurate
itemized wage statements, (14) failure to maintain required records, and (15)
unfair and unlawful business practices.  
 
On November 15, 2023,
the Court sustained Honda’s demurrer with motion to strike to the first to
seventh and ninth through fifteenth cause of action with leave to amend. The
Court also sustained Manpower’s demurrer to the eighth cause of action with
leave to amend.  On December 15, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the Fourth Amended Complaint (4AC) alleging the same fifteen
causes of action as the TAC. On June 18, 2024, the court sustained Defendant
Honda’s demurrer and granted Plaintiff leave to amend.
 
Plaintiff has now
filed the the operative Fifth Amended Complaint (“5AC”) alleging the same
fifteen causes of action as the TAC and 4AC. 
 
Defendant Honda moves to strike
the 5AC’s request for punitive damages. Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The
matter is now before the court. 
 
LEGAL STANDARDS 
 
A.        Motion to Strike 
 
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
  
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿

I.         Discussion
 
Defendant Honda seeks to Plaintiff’s request for punitive
damages  in the 5AC as follows: 
 
1)     Page 40, Prayer for Relief, Paragraph 5;
2)     Pages 13-14, 16, 18-19, 21, 23-24, 25-26, 27-28,
30-31, and 32-33 at Paragraphs ¶¶ 66, 79, 93, 104, 117, 127, 136, 152, and 163;
3)     Pages 14, 16-17, 19, 21-22, 24, 26, and 28 at
Paragraphs ¶¶ 67, 80, 94, 105, 118, 128, and 137; and
4)     Pages 33-34, Paragraph ¶ 165.
 
To state a claim for punitive damages under Civ. Code § 3294, a
plaintiff must allege specific facts showing that the defendant has been guilty
of malice, oppression, or fraud. (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.
App. 4th 1033, 1042.)¿ The basis for punitive damages must be pled with
specificity; conclusory allegations devoid of any factual assertions are
insufficient. (Ibid.)¿¿“Malice” is defined in Civ. Code § 3294 (c)(1) as
“conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury” or “despicable conduct
which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of
the rights or safety of others.” “Oppression” is “despicable conduct subjecting
a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s
rights.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2).) The term “despicable” has been defined in
the case law as actions that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.”¿ (Shade
Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78
Cal.App.4th 847, 891.)¿ 
 
“In passing on the correctness of a ruling on a motion to strike,
judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole,
all parts in their context, and assume their truth.” (Clauson v. Superior
Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.) Taking Plaintiff’s allegations as
true, the court finds that the 5AC sufficiently alleges facts to support a
claim for punitive damages. The 5AC alleges that Defendants Masatsugu Endo
(“Endo”) and Pierre Descamps (“Descamps”) were Plaintiff’s supervisors and
Defendant Honda delegated to them the authority to engage in the interactive
process, grant accommodations, and make decisions about terminating employees
such as ending their contracts or declining to hire employees into
“direct-hire” positions. (5AC, ¶ 28.) 
 
Since early December 2021, Endo and Descamps were aware that
Plaintiff suffered from stomach ulcers and had requested a flexible start time
as an accommodation. (5AC, ¶¶ 30, 32.) On or about February 3, 2022,
Plaintiff’s symptoms became severe, and Plaintiff advised Defendants Endo,
Descamps, and Honda that he could not travel for work and took sick leave. (Id.,  ¶ 33.) “Plaintiff requested an accommodation
of not traveling and the opportunity to support offsite work from Defendant
Honda’s worksite or from home.” (Id., ¶ 34.) 
 
Rather than engage in the interactive process to see if the
request was reasonable or if there were alternatives, Endo and Descamps
immediately decided not to renew Plaintiff’s contract. (5AC, ¶¶ 34, 35.) On or
about April 27, 2022, Linda Palafox, Honda’s Human Resources contact, emailed
Joanne Aglubat, Honda’s Human Resources Manager, that Descamps and Endo were
upset by Plaintiff’s requested accommodations. (Id., ¶¶ 26, 40, 41.) The
5AC alleges that despite knowing about Descamps and Masatsugu’s conduct, Honda
did nothing and made no prompt corrective measures to protect Plaintiff from
discrimination, engage in the interactive process, or accommodate Plaintiff. (Id.,
¶ 41) On May 4, 2022, Aglubat reported that Descamps and Masatsugu called
Plaintiff “lazy” and had decided not to renew Plaintiff’s contract. (Id.,
¶ 42.) 
 
Defendant Endo told Plaintiff his contract was not renewed due to
budget reasons, but Plaintiff saw that Defendant Honda posted advertisements
for Plaintiff’s position. (5AC, ¶ 50.) For this reason, Plaintiff believes his
contract was not renewed due to illegal reasons, including, his disabilities
and/or perceived disability and/or Plaintiff's requested accommodations and/or
because he took sick leave. (Id., ¶ 49.) 
 
Based on the allegations above, the court finds that malice or
oppression may be found in the fact that Descamps and Endo acted with willful
and conscious disregard for Plaintiff’s employment rights by opting to not
renew Plaintiff’s contract rather than attempt to engage in the interactive
process or offer Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation. (5AC, ¶¶ 34, 35.)
Moreover, the 5AC alleges that Defendant Honda, through its human resources,
knew about Endo and Descamps conduct and derogatory comments about Plaintiff
being “lazy” due to his disabilities and requested accommodations, and instead
of correcting such conduct, ratified it by agreeing to not renew Plaintiff’s
contract. (5AC, ¶ 42.) 
 
Moreover, while the court agrees that Plaintiff cannot recover
both punitive damages and statutory penalties, Plaintiff may recover punitive
damages for FEHA violations. (See De Anza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates
Homeowners Assn. v. De Anza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
890, 912 [A “
plaintiff cannot recover both punitive damages and statutory
penalties, as this would constitute a prohibited double penalty for the same
act.”].) Here, the tenth to fifteenth causes of action based on Labor Code
violations and the UCL, do not seek punitive damages and there is no threat of
double recovery. 
 
Furthermore, in Commodore Home Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1982) 32 Cal.3d 211, the California Supreme Court held that “in a civil action
under the FEHA, all relief generally available in noncontractual actions,
including punitive damages, may be obtained.” (Id., p. 221.) As
Plaintiff brings FEHA-related causes of action, and Defendant Honda has failed
to allege that those causes of action are insufficiently pled, Plaintiff may
pursue a claim for punitive damages as to those claims. 


Therefore, Defendant Honda’s motion to strike is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Honda’s motion to strike is denied. Defendant to give
notice.
