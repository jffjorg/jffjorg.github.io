Summary:
The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Honda's motion to strike the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages in the Fifth Amended Complaint. The court finds that the 5AC sufficiently alleges facts to support a claim for punitive damages, including malice or oppression by Defendant Honda's supervisors and failure to engage in the interactive process or offer reasonable accommodations. The court also notes that Plaintiff may recover punitive damages for FEHA violations, and that there is no threat of double recovery.
