And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests. The defendant propounded the requests on March 18, 2024, and the plaintiff was given two extensions to respond, with the final deadline being May 24, 2024. Despite these extensions, the plaintiff has failed to provide any responses. The judge is granting the defendant's motion to compel responses to the discovery requests, citing California law that requires a party to respond to discovery requests in a timely manner. The judge is ordering the plaintiff to provide responses to the requests within 10 days of the order.
