  RE:
  DEFENDANT’S MOTIONS
  TO COMPEL 
  PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSES
  TO FORM

  SPECIAL
  INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE; 
  DEMAND FOR

BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from a car
accident.  Plaintiff Skylar Cronenweth
claims Defendant Jasmine Shira Beroukim made an unsafe turn, colliding with her
car, and causing severe injuries.
On March 18, 2024, Defendant propounded
Form Interrogatories (set one); Special Interrogatories (set one); and Demand
for Production (set one).  Responses were
due by April 19, 2024.  Defendant granted
Plaintiff two extensions to May 24, 2024. 
 
As of May 29, 2024, Defendant had not
received any responses, and although not required by the Code, Defendant sent a
meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel, requesting verified responses
without objections, within ten days.  To
date, no responses have been provided.  
This hearing is on Defendant’s three motions
to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) (“FROGs”), Special
Interrogatories (Set One) (“SROGs”), and Document Demands (Set One) (“RFPs”).  There was no opposition filed as of the
posting of this tentative ruling.  
LEGAL STANDARD
A motion to compel an initial response
can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a), § 2031 subd. (a)
and (b); see¿Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)  
Failing to timely respond waives any objections. (CCP § 2030.290(a).) 
To move to compel initial responses, a
movant must show: (1) proper service (see¿Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.080,
subd. (a)); (2) expiration of the deadline for the initial response, 30 days
after service or on date agreed to by the parties (see¿Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subds. (a),¿(b)); and (3) no timely response (see¿Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.90). 
There is no “meet and confer”
requirement where there is a total failure to respond to discovery.  (Sinaiko,
148 Cal.App.4th at 411.)  There is also no separate statement
requirement for a motion to compel initial responses.  (Cal. Rules of
Court Rule 3.1345(b).) 
DISCUSSION
Interrogatories
            Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2030.290(a) provides that if a party fails to serve a timely response to
served interrogatories, that party waives any objections, and the propounding party
may move for an order compelling responses thereto.  Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s FROGs
and SROGs were originally due by April 19, 2024, and the deadline was extended
twice to May 24, 2024.  As of the date of
filing the motion, no responses have been provided.  Accordingly, pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2030.290, this Court grants the motion to compel responses to the
interrogatories within 10 days of the Court’s Order.
Document Demands
            Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2031.300 (a) and (b) provides that if a party fails to serve a timely
response to a demand for production, that party waives any right to serve
objections to the demand, including ones based on privilege or work product
protection, and the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses thereto.  Plaintiff’s responses
to Defendant’s RFPs were originally due by April 19, 2024, and Defendant
granted two extensions, extending the deadline to May 24, 2024.  As of the date of this motion, no responses
have been provided.  Accordingly,
pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, this Court grants the motion to
compel responses to the RFPs within 10 days of this Court’s Order.                                                                         
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS
Defendant’s motions to compel.  
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
