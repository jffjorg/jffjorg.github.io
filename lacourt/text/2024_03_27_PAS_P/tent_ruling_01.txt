[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING IN PART GM’S MOTION TO TAX COSTS
 
Date:   March
  27, 2024
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



          I.
       INTRODUCTION
           This is a lemon law case.
Plaintiff Selvin Torres (Torres) alleges that he purchased a 2019 Chevrolet
Silverado 1500, VIN # 1GCPYCEF9KZ421901 in August of 2019. He alleges various
issues with the vehicle including: (1) defective tire pressure monitoring
system, (2) defective display system, (3) defective audio system, (4) defective
engine system; and (5) Defective electrical system. He
sues the manufacturer of the vehicle, General Motors LLC (GM).
The matter was resolved by way of settlement; the parties
filed a notice of settlement on October 18, 2023. Plaintiff’s counsel filed his
memorandum of costs on December 13, 2023. 
          GM filed this motion to tax costs on January 4, 2024.
Plaintiff filed an opposition on March 14, 2024. GM filed a reply on March 19,
2024. For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted in part.
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD 
          Civil Code Section 1794(d) provides for attorney fees and
costs if a buyer prevails on a lemon law claim. Specifically, “If the buyer
prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the
court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount
of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (CC §
1794(d), emphasis added.) 
          CCP Section 1032 provides that a prevailing party may
recover their costs. (CCP § 1032.) CCP Section 1033.5(a) itemizes allowable
costs; CCP Section 1033.5(b) itemizes costs that are not allowed. Subsection
(c) provides that costs shall be necessary to the litigation and reasonable in
amount, and that items of cost not mentioned in the statute are recoverable in
the court’s discretion.    
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          In this motion, GM urges that $1,491.41 of the $2,354.63
sought by Plaintiff in his memorandum of costs is not appropriate and should be
stricken.   
          First, GM urges that the Court should strike the entire
memorandum of costs as untimely. (Motion p. 4: 7-8.) Citing CRC 3.1700(a)(1),
GM urges that the memorandum of costs was due on the earlier of 15 days after
service of notice of entry of judgment by the clerk or date of service of
written notice of dismissal; OR within 180 days after entry of judgment. (CRC
3.1700(a)(1).) Here, dismissal has not yet been entered, and there is no   judgment. (1/2/24 Minute Order [noting that
parties represented that they were still attempting to draft a final dismissal
to file with the Court.])  Accordingly,
the Court declines to strike the memorandum of costs as untimely. 
          Second, GM urges that $1,491.41 of the costs sought were not
reasonably incurred. (Motion p. 6: 6.) Specifically, GM urges that because Plaintiff
lost multiple motions to compel, these motions were frivolous and that
Plaintiff “elected to pursue [these motions] knowing they would fail”. (Motion
p. 6: 12-16.) GM moves to strike the $304.95 Plaintiff’s counsel seeks for
filing fees for these motions and, $147.87 in process server fees for these
motions.[1] The
Court declines to strike these costs.  Regardless
of the outcome of the hearing on the motions, the Court cannot conclude that
they were unreasonable and unnecessary to the litigation.
          Next, GM seeks to strike the $167.10 sought for recovery of
jury fees. GM urges that as the case never went to trial, it should not be
responsible for Plaintiff’s payment of jury fees. The Court disagrees, as the
jury fees were reasonably incurred to preserve the Plaintiff’s right to jury
trial. 
          Next, GM seeks to tax $147.10 sought for courtesy copies as
“‘Courtesy’ copies, as the name implies, are not required and such expenses are
unreasonable and excessive.” (Motion p. 6: 21-22.) The Court disagrees, as
courtesy copies provided to the Court are helpful, and are not disallowed by
CCP Section 1033.5(b) or Civil Code Section 1794(d). Indeed, in opposition,
Plaintiff’s counsel declares he was told by the Court clerk that courtesy
copies were necessary. (Manno Decl. ¶ 4.)
          Next, GM seeks to tax $162.74 sought for service of process
on a dealership, as there is no dealership involved in this case. (Motion p. 6:
23-24.) However, in opposition, Plaintiff Torres clarifies that the Person Most
Qualified Subpoena issued and served to Allen Gwynn Chevrolet was in
anticipation of jury trial in this case. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that
repairs to plaintiff's vehicle were performed at the dealership. (Manno Decl. ¶
5.) Plaintiff urges that the subpoena was necessary because “of GM’s position
that it would not authenticate any dealership records, and because Defendant
waited until the eleventh hour to settle this case with Plaintiff.” (Opposition
p. 7: 9-10.) The Court declines to tax this cost, as it appears to be reasonably
necessary to the litigation.
          Next, GM seeks to tax two anticipated costs: $500 for a
court reporter to appear at the hearing on the motion for attorney fees and
$61.65 in filing fees for a motion for attorney fees. As of the time of this
hearing, March 27, 2024, the motion for attorney fees has been filed and
granted in part, so the Court declines to tax the filing fees for that motion.
However, the Court on its own investigation, discovered that no court reporter
is noted as appearing in the February 14, 2024, hearing on the motion for
attorney fees. Accordingly, the anticipated $500.00 cost for a reporter is
improper and should be taxed.
          In sum, the Court taxes $500.00 of the $2,354.63 sought by
Plaintiff. Accordingly, costs are awarded to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,854.63.
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          The Court hereby grants Defendant’s motion to tax costs in
part. Accordingly, costs are granted in the amount of $1,854.63.
          Counsel for Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
