Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on several motions filed by Wildflower Brands Inc. ("Wildflower") in its lawsuit against Maria Camaco and Juan Camaco and 6200 S. Wilton Place, LLC ("Wilton").

Wildflower has demurred to Wilton's cross-complaint, alleging that it fails to state a cause of action. The court has overruled the demurrer, finding that Wilton's cross-complaint is legally sufficient. Wildflower has also moved to strike Wilton's cross-complaint, which the court has denied.

Wildflower has further moved to strike the affirmative defenses in Wilton's answer to the complaint, which the court has denied. Finally, Wildflower has moved to recover the costs of service, which the court has denied due to a lack of evidence showing compliance with the requirements for service by notice and acknowledgement of receipt.

The court has ordered Wildflower to file an answer to Wilton's cross-complaint within 30 days and has continued the case management conference to May 13, 2024.
