And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of El Monte's application for default judgment against Zhao Gu Chen is denied without prejudice due to several defects. The court notes that the requested injunctive relief does not match the relief sought in the complaint, and that the plaintiff has not completed the "Declaration of nonmilitary status" on Judicial Council Form CIV-100. Additionally, the court requires further explanation of the law enforcement costs claimed by the plaintiff. The court also directs the plaintiff to provide clarification on references to an individual named Pham and to provide a revised default judgment packet addressing these issues.
