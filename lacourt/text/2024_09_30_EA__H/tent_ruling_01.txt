  Case Number:  20PSCV00884    Hearing Date:   September 30, 2024    Dept:  H City  of El Monte v. Chen, et al., Case No. 20PSCV00884   ORDER  ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION Plaintiff City of El  Monte’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without  prejudice.   Background Plaintiff City of El Monte  (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:  Defendants  Zhao Gu Chen (“Gu Chen”), Ping Chen (“P. Chen”) and James Wong (“Wong”) (collectively, “Defendants”) own,  inhabit, and/or operate the property located at 4491  Shasta Lane in El Monte (the “subject  property”). On December 20, 2016, members of the El Monte Police Department  (“Police”) executed a search warrant at the subject property. While  executing the warrant, the Police observed that the house had been converted  into marijuana cultivation facilities. The  Police observed several industrial lights, electrical modifications, and air  filtration systems commonly used for large-scale indoor marijuana cultivation. The Police seized numerous items which had  been used to cultivate, manufacture, store, and/or sell marijuana at the  subject property in violation of state and municipal law.  On  December 22, 2020, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action  against Gu Chen, P. Chen, Wong, and Does 1-100 for:1.       Violation of  Unfair Competition Law (Business & Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq.); and 2.       Violation of  MAUCRSA (Business & Professions Code §§ 26000 et seq.).  On  June 28, 2021, the Clerk entered default against Gu Chen. On  April 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a “Notice of Settlement as Between Plaintiff  City of El Monte and Defendants Ping Chen and James Wong.”  On  June 21, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed P. Chen and Wong, with prejudice.  Pending  before the Court is Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment.    Discussion  Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without  prejudice. The following defects are noted: 1.       Plaintiff  seeks, inter alia, to permanently restrain and enjoin Gu Chen “from unlawfully  storing, keeping, cultivating, or giving away marijuana or any other controlled  substances on the Property or anywhere else in the City.” (See Proposed  Judgment, ¶ 1). The above requested injunctive relief does not match the  requested injunctive relief sought in Plaintiff’s complaint.  (See Complaint, 7:19-22 and 8:9-12 [“That  Defendants Gu Chen, Chen, Wong, Does 1 through 100, and any agents, officers,  employees, and anyone acting on their behalf be perpetually enjoined from  transferring, conveying, or encumbering any portion of the Property for  consideration without first obtaining the Court’s prior approval”].) 2.       Plaintiff  is directed to brief the issue of the statute of limitations. 3.       Plaintiff’s Judicial Council Form CIV-100 identifies the  “[d]emand of complaint” as $2,877,420.00. This amount, however, is not set  forth anywhere in Plaintiff’s complaint. Plaintiff, in Paragraph 2 of his Prayer for  Relief on the first cause of action, seeks civil penalties of $2,235,000.00. (See  Complaint, 7:15-18 [“That Defendants each individually be  assessed a civil penalty of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per  day, per violation for each unlawful practice, for a total at least two  million, two hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars ($2,235,000.00) per  Defendant, pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq.”].)  Plaintiff seeks an additional $6,510.00 in  Paragraph 7 of his Prayer for Relief on the second cause of action. (Id.,  8:4-8 [“That Defendants each individually be  assessed a civil penalty of up to three times the amount of the license fee for  each unlawful violation, for a total of at least six thousand five hundred and  ten dollars ($6,510.00) pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 26000  et seq. The appropriate license application fee for the square footage of the  Property is $2,170.00. (See “Specialty Indoor/Type 1A, CA Code of Regulations,  Ch. 3, Division 8, Ch. 1, § 8101(f).)”].) These amounts together equal $2,241,510.00. No other  monetary figures are set forth in the complaint. “The relief granted to the  plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint,  in the statement required by Section 425.11, or in the statement provided by  for Section 425.115. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a).) “[I]n all  default judgments the demand sets a ceiling on recovery.” (Greenup v. Rodman  (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 825.) Plaintiff now appears to seek $2,877,420.00 in  penalties under Business and Professions Code section 26038(a) when it only  requested $6,510.00 in such penalties in its complaint. 4.       Plaintiff  has not completed the “Declaration of nonmilitary status” on Judicial Council  Form CIV-100. 5.       Plaintiff  seeks $1,737.00 in “[l]aw [e]nforcement [c]osts.” Plaintiff is directed to  provide the Court with a further explanation of these costs.  6.       Paragraph  24 of Plaintiff’s factual summary and Paragraph 24 of Detective Jacob Burse’s  declaration both reference an individual by the name of “Pham.” It is unclear  to the Court whether or not these references are typographical errors.  Plaintiff is directed to provide clarification in this regard. Accordingly,  the Court denies the default judgment application without prejudice. Plaintiff  is directed to submit a revised default judgment packet that addresses the  aforementioned issues.
