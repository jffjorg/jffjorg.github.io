And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motions for reconsideration filed by the plaintiffs (Aknine Group Inc., Key Ecommerce Inc., and Yizhong Chen) regarding the August 1, 2024 ruling on the accounting of funds obtained from the bank accounts subject to the preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs contended that new or different facts, circumstances, or law had arisen since the original hearing, but the judge found that the evidence presented at the hearing was sufficient and that the plaintiffs had failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the funds transferred by defendants were used in the normal course of business. The judge also ruled that the plaintiffs' dissatisfaction with the ruling did not constitute new or different facts, circumstances, or law, and that the court would not reweigh the evidence or consider new arguments raised for the first time in reply.
