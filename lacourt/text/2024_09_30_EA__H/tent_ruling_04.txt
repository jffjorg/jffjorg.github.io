[FN1] As an aside, the Court
disagrees that Plaintiffs were unaware until the time they received Wang’s
exhibits that Wang was going to assert a “fake sale” argument. As Wang points
out, Wang’s Second Amended Cros Complaint (SACC) filed June 21, 2024 (i.e.,
approximately three weeks before the parties were required to exchange exhibits
for the July 31, 2024 evidentiary hearing) alleged there were “fake sales” and
money being moved around. (See SACC, ¶¶ 19-23.) Additionally, the Court notes
that “Defendants’ Response to Plaintiffs’ Accounting of the Funds Obtained from
the Bank Accounts Subject to the Preliminary Injunction” filed June 26, 2024
also raised the “fake sales” argument.
