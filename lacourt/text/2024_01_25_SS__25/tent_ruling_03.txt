BACKGROUND
 
On September 07, 2022, Plaintiff Tabatha
Rene Fish (“Plaintiff” or “Fish”)
filed this action against Defendants Sunset Motors LLC (“Sunset Motors”) and Western
Surety Co. (“Western Surety”) (collectively “Defendants”) for (1) violation of
Consumers Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code § 1750 et seq.; (2) violation of
California Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq., Unlawful Acts or
Practices; and (3) Claim Against Surety. 
Defendant Western Surety filed an Answer on November 16, 2022. 
On November 16, 2022, Plaintiff moved for default to be entered
against Defendant Sunset Motors. The Clerk entered default on the same day. 
On June 14, 2023,
Defendant Western Surety was dismissed from the case with prejudice. 
On September 13, 2023, default judgment was entered for Plaintiff and
against Defendant Sunset Motors in the amount of $14,181.10. 
On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Attorney’s
Fees in the amount of $11,216.50. 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiff prays
for the Court to issue an award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $11,216.50
against Defendant Sunset Motors pursuant to Civil Code Section 1780(e). Plaintiff makes
this motion arguing that since she is the prevailing party in the litigation under
the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, she is entitled to reasonable and necessary attorney’s
fees under said Act. 
 
OPPOSITION
 
            No
opposition has been filed.  
 
REPLY
 
            No reply

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
 Pursuant to the Civil Code § 1780, “[t]he
court shall award court costs and attorney’s fees to a prevailing plaintiff in
litigation filed pursuant to this section.”
 
A prevailing party in a lawsuit includes “the party with a
net monetary recovery…If any party recovers other than monetary relief and
in situations other than as specified, the ‘prevailing party’ shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed,
may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant
to rules adopted under Section 1034.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 1032(a)(4).)
 
“A notice of
motion to claim attorney's fees for services up to and including the rendition
of judgment in the trial court . . . must be served and filed within the time
for filing a notice of appeal under . . . rules 8.822 and 8.823 in a limited
civil case.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1702(b)(1).)  In a limited civil case,
a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of 30 days after
service of a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or 90 days after
the entry of judgment.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 8.822(a)(1).)
 
The calculation of attorney’s
fees in California begins with the “lodestar” method – multiplying the number
of hours reasonably expended by the reasonable hourly rate.  A computation of time spent on a case and the
reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an
appropriate attorneys’ fee award.  The
lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.  (Serrano v. Priest
(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)  Such an
approach anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of
the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not
arbitrary.  (Ibid. at p. 48, fn.
23.)  After the trial court has performed
the lodestar calculations, it shall consider whether the total award so
calculated under all of the circumstances of the case is more than a reasonable
amount and, if so, shall reduce the section 1717 award so that it is a
reasonable figure.  (PLCM Group v.
Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096.)
 
As explained in Graciano v.
Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.:
 
“[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal
services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors
including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4)
the contingent nature of the fee award. [Citation.]  The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a
fee at the fair market value for the particular action. In effect, the court
determines, retrospectively, whether the litigation involved a contingent risk
or required extraordinary legal skill justifying augmentation of the unadorned
lodestar in order to approximate the fair market rate for such services. . . . This approach anchors the trial
court's analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney's
services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary.” [Internal
citations and internal quotation marks omitted.]
 
((2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  “It is well established that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence
of an abuse of discretion. 
[Citations.]  The value of legal
services performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has its own
expertise. . . . The trial court makes its determination after
consideration of a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty,
the amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the skill employed,
the attention given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the
case.  [Citations.]”  (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 618, 623624.)
 
No specific findings reflecting
the court’s calculations are required. 
The record need only show that the attorney fees were awarded according
to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” approach. 
The court’s focus in evaluating the facts should be to provide a fee
award reasonably designed to completely compensate attorneys for the services
provided.  The starting point for this
determination is the attorney’s time records. 
(Horsford v. Board of Trustees of Calif. State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395-397 [verified
time records entitled to credence absent clear indication they are
erroneous].)  However, California case
law permits fee awards in the absence of detailed time sheets.  (Sommers v. Erb (1992) 2
Cal.App.4th 1644, 1651; Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996)
48 Cal.App.4th 1794, 1810; Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America
(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 103.)  An
experienced trial judge is in a position to assess the value of the professional services rendered
in his or her court.  (Ibid.; Serrano,
20 Cal.3d 25 at 49.)
 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
As a preliminary matter, the Court
notes that Defendant Western Surety was dismissed from the case on June 14,
2023, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request. (06-14-23 Request for Dismissal.) On November
16, 2022, default was entered against Defendant Sunset Motors. (11-16-22 Request for Entry of
Default.) On September 13, 2023, default judgment was entered against Defendant
Sunset Motors. (9-13-23
Judgment.) Thus, the Court does not have jurisdiction over Defendant Western
Surety and, as no judgment was entered against Defendant Western Surety,
Plaintiff may not obtain attorney’s fees as to Western Surety.
 
With respect to Sunset Motors, however, Plaintiff is entitled
to attorney’s fees as it is the prevailing party given judgment was entered for
the Plaintiff and against Defendant Sunset Motors. (Id.)
 
            Plaintiff requests $11,216.50
in attorney’s fees.  (Mot. p. 7.)  Plaintiff submits the declaration of Kasra
Sadr who provides a copy of his fee bill for this matter and states that the
billing is “accurate and reasonable, and without duplicative or unnecessary
legal work having been performed.”  (Sadr
Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 1.) 
He also provides a copy of the Laffey Matrix.  (Id. ¶ 4, Ex. 2.)  Sadr declares that he has been practicing law
for 25 years and specializes in consumer protection litigation, exclusively
consumer related cases like this one.  (Id.
at ¶ 5.)  His hourly rate is $650 per
hour.  (Id. at ¶ 6.) Sadr’s
associate Nima Heydari (NH) is a ninth-year attorney who bills $375 per
hour.  (Id. at ¶ 10.)  Paralegal Liz Peralta (LP) has 20 years of
experience and bills at $135 per hour.  (Id.
at ¶9, 11.)  Sadr adds that the retainers
signed by his clients on automobile matters are on a contingency fee basis.  (Id. at ¶¶ 12.)
 
            Plaintiff
argues that the attorney’s fees requested are “fair and reasonable” because (1)
they represent the attorneys’ ordinary rates and are thus, presumptively
correct, (2) Plaintiff’s attorneys represent clients on a contingency basis,
(3) the hourly rate of other Los Angeles plaintiff’s attorneys practicing in a
similar area of law is generally higher, and (4) according to the Laffey
Matrix, the average attorney’s fees are greater than those requested by
Plaintiff’s attorneys. (Mot. p. 6.) 
 
            The
Court notes discrepancies with the fee bill. For example, on August 30, 2022, LP’s
work was billed at a rate of $350/hr. to scan and upload a client affidavit
rather than her stated rate of $135/hr. Based on the Court’s calculation, there
was a total of $857.50 billed for LP at a higher rate than what is purported in
Counsel’s declaration. (Sadr Decl., Ex. 1) Moreover, as the Court previously
indicated, Plaintiff cannot obtain attorney’s fees as to Western Surety since
they were dismissed from the action. In total, the Court calculates $576.00 in
charges which referenced Western Surety. Therefore, the Court is inclined to
award Plaintiff attorney’s fees incurred as to Sunset Motors minus $1,433.50 in
fees associated with the higher entry rates from LP and entries relating to
Western Surety and finds attorney’s fees in the amount of $9,783.00 to be
reasonable.
 
Accordingly,
the Court grants Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, in part, in the amount
of $9,783.00
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is
GRANTED in part in the amount of $9,783.00.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
