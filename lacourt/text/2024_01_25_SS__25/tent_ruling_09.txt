BACKGROUND
 
On
July 27, 2023, Plaintiff Joaquin Hernandez (“Plaintiff”) filed a cause of action
against Defendants Dolly Investments Inc., and Opal Roknipour aka Opal B. Roknipour
(“Roknipour, (collectively “Defendants”) for violations of the Unruh Civil
Rights Act, Civil Code § 51 seeking damages in the amount of $4,000.00. 
 
Defendants
filed answers on September 18, 2023. 
 
On
November 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Defendant
Roknipour’s Answers to Plaintiff’s Interrogatories (Set One). No opposition has
been filed.
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiff prays
for the Court to issue an order compelling Defendant Roknipour’s responses to Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff asserts that since Plaintiff
propounded its Special Interrogatories to Defendant Roknipour and Defendant Roknipour
did not provide verified responses, the Court’s order compelling responses is therefore
necessary. Plaintiff additionally requests sanctions in the amount of $500.00
for one (1) hour of attorney time billed at an hourly rate of $500.00. 
 
OPPOSITION
 
             No opposition has been filed. 
 
REPLY
 
             No reply has been filed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal Standard  
A party must respond to
interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or requests for production of
documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party
may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also
waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or
work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories or production of documents other than the cut-off
on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) No meet and confer
efforts are required before filing a motion to compel responses to the
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) 
 
II.        Discussion
 
A.
Motion to Compel Answers to Special Interrogatories 
 
Plaintiff
provides the court with the Declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, in which counsel
avers that on September 18, 2023, his office served Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One, upon Defendant Roknipour. (Morse Mehrban Decl. ¶ 3,
Exh. A.) Defendant Roknipour needed to have filed its responses by or before
October 18, 2023, to be considered timely. Upon not receiving a response to
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Plaintiff’s counsel issued a letter to
Defendant Roknipour requesting responses be made by November 16, 2023, to avoid
filing the instant motion. (Id. ¶ 5, Exh. B.) Plaintiff’s counsel
declares that since issuing the letter to Defendant Roknipour, his office
received no verified answers to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories. (Id. ¶
4.) Here, the court finds that more than thirty (30) days have lapsed since the
service of Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories. Thus, since more than thirty
(30) days has lapsed since service of Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, then
Plaintiff is entitled to pursue the instant motion. Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to an
issuance of an order to compel responses to its Special Interrogatories.
 
B.
Motion for Sanctions.
 
The Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(c) provides
in relevant part that the Court shall impose monetary sanctions against any
party, person, or attorney, “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c).) 
 
As discussed above, the Court
finds Plaintiff to have successfully made the motion and Defendant Roknipour to have unsuccessfully opposed
the motion. Without evidence to the contrary, the Court cannot find that
Defendant Roknipour acted with substantial justification in failing to respond
to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories or that other circumstances make the
imposition of sanctions unjust. Therefore, the Court must impose a monetary
sanction against Defendant Roknipour as specified under CCP § 2030.290(c). 
 
Here,
Plaintiff seeks $500.00 in attorney’s fees incurred for one (1) hour spent
pursuing the motion. (Mehrban Decl. ¶ 6.) The Court finds the amount reasonable given the simplicity
of this Motion and the lack of opposition and reply. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request
for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $500.00 against Defendant Roknipour.
 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiff Joaquin
Hernandez’s Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED. DEFENDANT ROKNIPOUR IS ORDERED TO RESPOND
TO PLAINTIFF’S SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, WITH CODE COMPLIANT, OBJECTION-FREE
VERIFIED RESPONSES WITHIN TWENTY (20) DAYS FROM NOTICE OF THIS ORDER. 
 
DEFENDANT ROKNIPOUR IS ORDERED TO PAY $500.00 TO
PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.    
 
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
