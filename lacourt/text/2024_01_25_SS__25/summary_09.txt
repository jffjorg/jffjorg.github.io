Summary in English:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to compel responses to interrogatories and a request for sanctions. The plaintiff, Joaquin Hernandez, filed a cause of action against defendants Dolly Investments Inc. and Opal Roknipour (aka Opal B. Roknipour) on July 27, 2023, seeking damages of $4,000.00. The defendants filed answers on September 18, 2023.

The plaintiff filed a motion to compel responses to special interrogatories on November 27, 2023, and a request for sanctions in the amount of $500.00 for one hour of attorney time. No opposition or reply was filed.

The court finds that more than 30 days have lapsed since service of the interrogatories, and therefore grants the motion to compel responses. The court also grants the request for sanctions against defendant Roknipour, ordering him to pay $500.00 to the plaintiff's counsel. The court orders defendant Roknipour to respond to the plaintiff's special interrogatories with code-compliant, objection-free, verified responses within 20 days from notice of this order.
