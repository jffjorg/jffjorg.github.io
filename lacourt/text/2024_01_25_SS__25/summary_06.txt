And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to set aside or vacate the default and default judgment. The defendant, Crow Design Build Inc., claimed that the service of summons and complaint was defective and that they did not have actual notice of the action. However, the judge found that the service was proper and that the defendant had actual notice of the action. The judge also found that the defendant's neglect in not responding to the complaint within the time allowed was not excusable and that the defendant did not meet their burden to show that the default was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. Therefore, the judge denied the defendant's motion.
