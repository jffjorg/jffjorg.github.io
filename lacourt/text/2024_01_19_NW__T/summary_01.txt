And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion for sanctions, which was filed against the plaintiff for failing to delay surgery. The judge finds that the defendant did not seek an earlier IME before November 22, 2023, and did not raise any objections when the IME was rescheduled to January 23, 2024. The judge also notes that the defendant did not seek an emergency order from the court to advance the IME, and that the plaintiff had already given six days' notice of the surgery. The judge grants monetary sanctions of $1,500 against the defendant and its counsel, payable by January 30, 2024, and finds that the motion was filed without substantial justification and constitutes discovery abuse.
