  Case Number:  23VECV00225    Hearing Date:   January 19, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV00225 CONNIE FITZGERALD vs WALMART Tentative ruling on defendant’s motion for sanctions:  Denied. On November 22, 2023, at 2:32 pm, plaintiff's counsel sent  an email to defense counsel stating, “Unfortunately, we have to reschedule our  client's IME set for 11/30. Mrs. Fitzgerald is scheduled for lower back surgery  next week,  and she will need time for her recovery. Please confirm  receipt of this email and please provide new dates of availability to  reschedule the IME with Dr. Nelson.”  At 11:13 am on November 27, 2023, Shraddha D. Friend,  identifying herself as the legal assistant to Sayyora Badalbaeva, Esq.,  attorney of record for Walmart, sent an email providing the response from Dr.  Nelson’s office: “To allow the patient time to recover from this surgery, I can  reset the IME for 1/23/24 at 2:00 pm.” (See Exhibit C.) About thirty minutes  later, the undersigned responded that “I have confirmed with our client. She is  available on 01/23/24 at 2:00 pm for her IME.” (Ibid.) One minute after that,  Ms. Friend responded, “Ok, I will send an amended notice shortly. Thank you.” On November 27, 2023, at 11:57 am, Defendant served its  “Amended Notice of Independent Medical Examination Of Plaintiff With Dr.  Russell Nelson.” A true and correct copy is attached as Exhibit D. This Amended  Notice  rescheduled the medical examination from November 30, 2023 to  January 23, 2024, at 2:00 p.m., as both parties agreed. At 12:16 pm, Plaintiff  confirmed the receipt of the Amended Notice. At 1:31 pm on November 27, 2023, Ms. Friend responded to the  email chain and stated that Dr. Nelson’s office needed to change the time from  2:00 pm to 2:30 pm on the same date of January 23, 2024 and asked for  Plaintiff’s agreement.  At 1:48 pm, the undersigned responded, “Yes.” Ms. Friend  responded, “Great, attached is another amended Notice of IME. Thank you.” On November 27, 2023, Defendant served another “Amended  Notice of Independent Medical Examination Of Plaintiff With Dr. Russell  Nelson.” This Amended Notice reflected the change of time from 2:00 p.m. to  2:30 p.m. on January 23, 2024, as both parties agreed.  On November 22, 2023, on the same day that she saw her  doctor, plaintiff made plans to have surgery on November 28, 2023.   Plaintiff’s defense medical examination was set for November 30, 2023.   Plaintiff’s counsel notified defense counsel that her surgery had been  scheduled for Nov. 28th on that same day and sought to move the medical exam to  a date after the exam so that she could recover. Plaintiff had already stated  at her deposition on Nov. 10th that she would be meeting with her doctor on  Nov. 22nd to schedule surgery.  Defendant could have sought an order for  an earlier medical exam before Nov. 22nd but did not do so. Defendant did not raise any objections.  Defendant did  not seek an ex parte order to advance the defense medical exam so it could be  done before the surgery.  Defendant argues that plaintiff should not have  had her surgery before the medical examination.  However, it was not  reasonable to have the court intervene to order plaintiff to delay her  surgery.   Defendant answered the complaint in March 2023.   Despite that, they waited 8 months before seeking the examination.  They  knew on Nov. 10th that plaintiff would be meeting with her doctor on Nov. 22nd  to schedule surgery.  Based upon their experience in the Turner case (see  below) which happened in July 2023, they knew that any surgery could  potentially be scheduled before an exam.  Despite that, they did not seek  an order for the exam to take place before the surgery (such as between Nov.  10th and Nov. 22nd.)  Additionally, they were told on Nov. 22nd that the  surgery was scheduled on Nov. 28th and took no action whatsoever.  They  agreed to move the exam and renoticed it for the new date.   There was no factual basis to support this motion.   Defendant's own delay in scheduling it to begin with was the primary cause for  the exam not taking place earlier.  Defense counsel agreed to move the  examination -- showing their acquiescence.  They did not seek an emergency  order from the court. Defendant argues it has already obtained a similar order in  another case.  Defendant having raised the issue of the order in  22AVCV00396 Turner v Walmart of which the court takes judicial notice, the  court notes there is a significant difference in that case.  There, the  defendant did not agree to move the exam; the defendant insisted that the exam  take place which was scheduled the day before the surgery.  Here,  defendant agreed to move the exam. This creates a completely different scenario.  Moreover, defendant in Turner had the exam scheduled before  the surgery and plaintiff's counsel did not disclose that surgery was scheduled  until the day before.  Here, there was  six days notice, which was enough time to ask the court for some type of  emergency relief.  (Defense knew here on Nov. 10th that a surgery was  going to be scheduled.) Finally, in Turner, that plaintiff had already been the  subject of multiple discovery orders and a previous motion for terminating  sanctions had been filed.  There is no such history here. The court reviews the Turner case only to show that because  of the significant differences in the facts, there was no reasonable basis to  bring this motion. The defendant’s motion for sanctions is denied. The court considers the request for monetary sanctions in  the opposition by plaintiff in having to oppose this motion.  Perhaps  emboldened by the result in the Turner case, this motion was filed but the  circumstances are substantially different.  Here, there is no explanation  why having been advised of the need to move the Nov. 30th exam on Nov. 22nd  because surgery was scheduled for Nov. 28th, nothing was done to get the exam  before the surgery.  Moreover, there was no objection or problem raised  when the matter was discussed between the offices on Nov. 27th to move the exam  into January and the defendant renoticed the exam for the new date, and then  amended the date again to accommodate its expert. The court finds that the motion was filed without  substantial justification and constitutes discovery abuse.  The court  grants monetary sanctions jointly and severally against defendant Walmart and  its counsel of record, PETTIT KOHN INGRASSIA LUTZ & DOLIN PC in the sum of  $1,500 pursuant to CCP section 2032.250 payable by 1/30/2024 to the Client  Trust Account of LAW OFFICES OF RAMTIN SADIGHIM, APC 16027 Ventura Blvd., Suite  102 Encino, CA 91436. IT IS SO ORDERED.  CLERK OF THE COURT TO GIVE NOTICE.
