```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the complaint is partially sustained and partially overruled. The demurrer to the fourth cause of action for fraud is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend, as the plaintiff failed to plead specific facts to plead a contemporaneous intent not to perform. The demurrer to the fifth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation is overruled, as the plaintiff alleged that the damage to their unit was caused by failures in maintaining the HOA's common area and that they were ignorant of the true facts and could justifiably rely upon the representations made by the defendants. The defendants' motion to strike is taken off-calendar due to their failure to resubmit the motion for filing.
