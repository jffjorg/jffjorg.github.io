BACKGROUND
 
On June 9, 2023, Plaintiffs Stephanie Michelle Najar and
Edgar Jose Najar (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed their Complaint against
Defendant Linda Blair/Worldheart Foundation (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 10,
alleging one cause of action for General Negligence. (Compl. ¶ 10.) The
Complaint alleges that Defendant’s two pitbull dogs entered Plaintiffs’
property and caused personal injuries to them on November 11, 2022. (Compl. ¶ Att.
“Cause of Action.”) Subsequently, Defendant filed its Answer to the Complaint
on August 4, 2023.
 
On June 28, 2024, Defendant’s Counsel filed the instant
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the “Motion”).
 
            No Opposition papers have been
received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
The court may
order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after
judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and
after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within
the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) An
application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council Forms
MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)
            In
addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subsection (d) requires that
the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on
the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal
service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must
be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either:
            (A) The service address is the current residence or
business address of the client; or
(B)
The service address is the last known residence or business address of the
client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after
making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the
motion to be relieved.
 
            (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(1)(A) & (2).)
 
Here, Defendant’s Counsel has filed Judicial Council Forms
MC-051 and MC-052. Counsel has also lodged Judicial Council Form MC-053 with
the Court. 
 
However, Counsel has not specified all hearing dates
scheduled in the action on the submitted Judicial Council Form MC-053, thereby
failing to meet the requirement under California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e).
 
Counsel has provided a declaration stating that the Motion
is necessitated by “a breakdown of the working relationship” between Counsel
and Defendant. (MC-025, p. 1.) Additionally, Counsel claims that “additional
facts regarding the cause of the breakdown and which also give rise to this
motion are confidential and required to be kept confidential pursuant to
Business & Professions Code section 6068(e)(1), Rule 1.6(a) of the RPC, and
by the attorney-client privilege.” (Ibid.) 
 
The Court finds Counsel’s reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory.
Counsel states in his declaration that the Motion was served by personal
service and by certified mail, return receipt requested, at Defendant’s last
known address. (MC-052, ¶ 3(a)(2), Davis Decl. at p. 1.) Additionally, Counsel
has confirmed that this address is current verifying it with Defendant’s latest
Statement of Information filed with the California Secretary of State. (MC-052,
¶ 3(b).) Proof of Service has been filed separately with the Motion papers,
demonstrating proper service on Defendant and all other parties who have
appeared in the case.
 
The next hearing scheduled for this action is a Final
Status Conference set for October 10, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department F49 at
9425 Penfield Ave., Chatsworth, CA 91311. (MC-052, ¶ 4.) A jury trial is set
for October 21, 2024. (Id. ¶ 6.))
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court CONTINUES the Motion to
be Relieved as Counsel to allow additional time for Counsel to file the prepared
Judicial Council Form MC-053, mandated by California Rules of Court rule
3.1362(e).
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Linda
Blair/Worldheart Foundation’s Counsel Lindsay Weiss, Robert L. Davis of
Manning Gross & Massenburg, LLP’s Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel is CONTINUED.
 
Moving counsel to give notice.
