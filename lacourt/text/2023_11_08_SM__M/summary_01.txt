And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to the second amended complaint (SAC) brought by Defendants Untouchable J Productions, Ryder Resorts, and JoJo Ryder. The SAC alleges three causes of action: money had and received, fraud, and accounting.

For the first cause of action, the judge overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations are sufficient for a common count of money had and received. The allegations show that the defendants were indebted to the plaintiff in a sum certain and failed to return the payment by the agreed-upon date.

For the second cause of action, the judge sustained the demurrer, finding that the allegations fail to state a cause of action for fraud. The allegations do not specifically assert the facts of the representation, and the representations relate generally to the guarantees without any specificity as to the communication itself.

For the third cause of action, the judge overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations support an accounting as an appropriate measure in the circumstances of this transaction. The allegations show that the defendants agreed to fully account for the expenditures made regarding the production of the TV show and/or the monies it provided to the defendants exceeding $500,000.

The judge granted leave to amend for the second cause of action and extended leave to include the statement of two additional claims of conversion and breach of oral contract.
