MOTION:                  Demurrer
to the Second Amended Complaint 
HEARING DATE:   11/8/23
Legal
Standard
 
            A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (CCP §§
430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate
facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim
against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie
(1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading,
or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen
(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations omitted.)
 
            A
special demurrer for uncertainty is disfavored and will only be sustained where
the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s
of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if
the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)

 
            Any party, within the time allowed
to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and
upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper
matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court
rule, or an order of the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a
pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)
 
            “Liberality in permitting amendment
is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to
show in what manner plaintiff can amend the complaint,
and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the
pleading. (Id.)
 
Analysis
 
            Defendants Untouchable J
Productions, Ryder Resorts and JoJo Ryder demur to each cause of action of the
Second Amended Complaint (SAC).
 
First
Cause of Action for Money Had and Received
 
“In California, it has long been settled the allegation of claims using
common counts is good against special or general demurrers.” (Farmers
Insurance Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460.) “The action
for money had and received is based upon an implied promise which the law
creates to restore money which the defendant in equity and good conscience
should not retain. The law implies the promise from the receipt of the money to
prevent unjust enrichment. The measure of the liability is the amount
received.’ ” (Rotea v. Izuel (1939) 14 Cal.2d 605, 611, internal
citations omitted.) “The only essential allegations of a common count are ‘(1)
the statement of indebtedness in a certain sum, (2) the consideration, i.e.,
goods sold, work done, etc., and (3) nonpayment.’” (Zerin, supra, 53
Cal.App.4th at 460.) 
 
The statute of limitations for a money had and received claim depends on
the gravamen of the cause of action. For example, if plaintiff is recovering
money obtained through fraud, the claim is subject to the three-year statute of
limitations. (First Nationwide Savings v. Perry (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th
1657, 1670.) Otherwise, the two-year statute of limitations would apply. (CCP
§339(1).) 
 
“Generally, a cause of action accrues and the statute of limitation begins to run when a suit may
be maintained. Ordinarily this is when the wrongful act is done and the
obligation or the liability arises . . .. In other words, a cause of action accrues upon the
occurrence of the last element essential to the cause of action. [Citation.]” (Cobb
v. City of Stockton (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 65, 72-73, alterations
and internal quotation marks omitted.)  Unless a complaint affirmatively
discloses on its face that the statute of limitations has run, demurrer must be
overruled. (Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz &
McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 881 [“It must appear clearly and
affirmatively that, upon the face of the complaint, the right of action is
necessarily barred”].)
 
Defendant argues that the allegations are ambiguous and uncertain as to
the alleged dates. Defendant further asserts that these ambiguities demonstrate
that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations. However, the allegations
and dates alleged do not create any ambiguity or demonstrate the application of
the 2-year statute of limitations.
 
The SAC alleges that starting in “October 2015, and continuing and
concluding prior to 2019,” Defendant JoJo Ryder, individually and as an agent
and representative of the other Defendants, received money in the total sum of
$518,000 from Plaintiff. (SAC ¶ 10.) Defendants were to use this capital to
produce and distribute at least 10 episodes in one season of a real estate
oriented “Fix & Flip” show. (Id.) There were also multiple guarantees that
each episode would generate a minimum of $100,000.00 in profit because
Defendants had a guaranteed output deal. (¶ 11.) The parties agreed that this
would be accomplished before October 1, 2019. (Id.) Despite this agreement,
Defendants did not deliver an acceptable TV show and did not substantially work
on the TV show. (¶¶ 11-12.) Defendants also denied all guarantees. (¶ 12.) Plaintiff
alleged damages in a sum exceeding $518,000, plus interest. (¶ 13.) 
 
These allegations are sufficient
for a common count of money had and received. The above allegations show that
Defendants were indebted to Plaintiff in a sum certain. To wit, Plaintiff
invested $518,000.00 to be used for the creation of the TV show. Defendants failed to perform and failed to
return payment by the agreed upon date of October 1, 2019.  This action commenced within two years of that
date -- on October 22, 2020. Thus, the SAC does not demonstrate on its face that
the cause of action is barred by the two-year statute of limitations.
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is
OVERRULED as to the first cause of action.
 
Second Cause of Action for Fraud
 
Defendants argue that the fraud
cause of action fails to state who/how/by what means any representation(s)
was/were made prior to the investment. 
 
The elements of fraud are: “(a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v.
Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) In California, fraud must be pled
with specificity. (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167,
184.) “The particularity demands that a plaintiff plead facts which show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino
v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)  
 
The SAC fails to allege the fraud
with the requisite specificity. The SAC now provides specifics as to when,
where and to whom the representations were made. The SAC includes a list of
specific dates and meetings between certain persons. (SAC ¶ 18.) The SAC
alleges that from “early 2015 thru about October 1, 2019, Defendants, by and
through JR, met with Plaintiff on a regular basis. During those meetings, the
same summary set of misrepresentations asserted in Paragraphs 15 & 16 above
were repeated.” (Id.) The list also includes the means of some of the meetings,
such as a conference call or a personal meeting. (Id.) However, the SAC does
not present specific misrepresentations in paragraphs 15 or 16.
 
Regarding the representations,
paragraph 15 alleges that Ryder “represented He had a guaranteed output
agreement and could guarantee and would guarantee the production and
distribution of a minimum of 10 episodes of Plaintiff's Real Estate oriented
Fix and Flip television show… Defendants would fully and acceptably produce,
also guaranteed distribution in a reasonable period but certainly and no later
than Fall 2019, and …[he] guaranteed that on top of the $518,000 or so that
Plaintiff would invest, that Plaintiff would receive in return a net minimum of
$ 100,000 per episode (minimum of 10 episodes guaranteed in first season) and
up to $350,000 per episode in just the first season alone… and that there would
be a minimum $1,000,000 net profit in the 1st year to Plaintiff and that it
could exceed $3,000,000.” (¶ 15.) He also “expressly guaranteed the return and
distribution deal and all related elements on multiple occasions up to approximately
October 1, 2019.” (¶ 15.) Paragraph 16 alleges that Ryder not only guaranteed
“the distribution and profit along with his guaranteed output deal, but he also
represented that he would immediately account for how monies were spent if
asked… [he] also indicated he had a close business relationships with Hollywood
celebrities like Kevin Hart, Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga, Akon, Katy Perry, Niki
Minaj, Brandy, Lawrence Fishbume and others and that he would cause thein to be
part of this project and they would appear.” (¶ 16.)
 
These allegations remain too general
to satisfy the pleading requirements for fraud. The allegations do not
specifically assert the facts of the representation, i.e., what was actually
said. The representations relate generally to the guarantees, without any
specificity as to the communication itself. These allegations merely appear
to be summaries of multiple representations which occurred both before
and after Plaintiff’s investment. Plaintiff needs to tie a specific
misrepresentation to a specific meeting, for example, the January 14, 2015,
meeting between Plaintiff, Ryder and Richard Herron. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is
SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
Third Cause of
Action for Accounting
 
“An accounting is an equitable proceeding
which is proper where there is an unliquidated and unascertained amount owing
that cannot be determined without an examination of the debits and credits on
the books to determine what is due and owing. [Citations.] Equitable principles
govern, and the plaintiff must show the legal remedy is inadequate. . . . Generally, an underlying fiduciary relationship, such as a
partnership, will support an accounting, but the action does not lie merely
because the books and records are complex. [Citations.] Some underlying
misconduct on the part of the defendant must be shown to invoke the right to
this equitable remedy.” (Prakashpalan v. Engstrom,
Lipscomb & Lack
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1136-1137.) Courts have observed that a breach of
fiduciary duty, fraud, and the fact that the accounts were complicated are recognized
as grounds for an accounting. (Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995)
31 Cal.App.4th 573, 593.) 
 
“‘[B]efore a person can be
charged with a fiduciary obligation, he must either knowingly undertake to act
on behalf and for the benefit of another, or must enter into a relationship which imposes that
undertaking as a matter of law.’” (City of Hope Nat'l Med. Ctr. v. Genentech
(2008) 43 Cal.4th 375, 386.) Facts giving rise to a confidential, fiduciary or
trustee relationship must be pled, and a “bare allegation that defendants
assumed a fiduciary relationship” is a conclusion. (Zumbrun v. Univ. of So.
Cal. (1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 1, 13.)  
 
“A
¿duciary relationship is any relation existing between parties to a transaction
wherein one of the parties is duty bound to act with the utmost good faith for
the bene¿t of the other party. Such a relation ordinarily arises where a
con¿dence is reposed by one person in the integrity of another, and in such a
relation the party in whom the con¿dence is reposed, if he voluntarily accepts
or assumes to accept the con¿dence, can take no advantage from his acts
relating to the interest of the other party without the latter’s knowledge or
consent…” (Wolf v. Superior Court (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 25, 29
[internal citations and quotations omitted].)) “Before a person can be charged
with a ¿duciary obligation, he must either knowingly undertake to act on behalf
and for the bene¿t of another, or must enter into a relationship
which imposes that undertaking as a matter of law.” (Cleveland v. Johnson
(2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1338.) “[E]xamples of relationships that impose a
¿duciary obligation to act on behalf of and for the bene¿t of another are ‘a
joint venture, a partnership, or an agency.’ But, ‘[t]hose categories are
merely illustrative of ¿duciary relationships in which ¿duciary duties are
imposed by law.’ ” (Id. 1339, internal citation omitted.) 
 
Defendants argue that there is no
relationship requiring an accounting. Defendants note that the written agreement may have provided
for an accounting, but Plaintiff is no longer proceeding on that theory.
Defendants further contend that the parties merely had a standard
business arrangement, where Plaintiff put money into the Project, and were not
partners, joint venturers, shareholders, trustees, attorneys, or acting in any
other capacity imposing a fiduciary duty. 
 
As an initial matter, the SAC still
requests an accounting based on contract. The SAC alleges that Defendants
agreed to fully account for the expenditures made regarding the production of
the TV show, and/or the monies it provided to Defendants exceeding $500,000. (SAC
¶ 28.) Defendants spent the monies provided by Plaintiff but did not spend the
monies on the project. (Id.) Defendants now refuse to provide Plaintiff with
any accounting as to how Plaintiff's monies were spent. (Id.) These facts support
an accounting as an appropriate measure in the circumstances of this
transaction.
 
Second, Plaintiff alleges a fiduciary relationship between
the parties regarding the funds. The SAC alleges that pursuant
to the parties’ agreement and the fiduciary relationship between the parties,
Defendants were to hold, use and account for the monies Plaintiff provided to
Defendants in trust for Plaintiff. (¶ 27.) Defendants do not explain why the allegations do not show a fiduciary
relationship, beyond offering their competing characterization of the
relationship.
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is OVERRULED as to this cause of
action.
 
Leave to Amend
 
The Court will grant leave to amend for the
second cause of action. Plaintiff also requests leave to add two additional
theories based on the same set of facts. Specifically, Plaintiff
seeks leave to add two additional claims of conversion and breach of oral contract.
The Court will extend leave to include the statement of these two additional
claims. Accordingly, 20 days leave to amend is GRANTED.
