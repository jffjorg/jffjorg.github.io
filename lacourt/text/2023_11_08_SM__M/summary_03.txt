And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Bueno v. Cannon, et al., denying the defendants' motion to quash service of process. The defendants, Mark Cannon and Amandeep Dhillon MD, argued that they do not reside at the address where the summons was served, but did not provide competent evidence to support this claim. The plaintiff filed a proof of service showing service on both defendants on August 30, 2023, and the judge found that this created a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper. Since the defendants did not provide sufficient evidence to rebut this presumption, the judge denied their motion to quash.
