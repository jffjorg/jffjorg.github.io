MOTION:                  Motion
to Quash Service of Process
HEARING DATE:   11/8/2023

 
Legal
Standard
 

“A defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of
motion for one or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her . . ..” (CCP § 418.10(a).)
A court lacks jurisdiction over a party if there has not been proper service of
process. (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 801, 808.)
“When a motion to quash is properly brought,
the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish the facts of
jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.)  The plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did
give the court jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective
service.”  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868;
see also Elkman v. National States Ins. Co. (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 1305, 1312-13 [“Where a nonresident defendant challenges
jurisdiction by way of a motion to quash, the plaintiff bears the burden of
establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that minimum contacts exist
between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of personal
jurisdiction.”].)  
 
Analysis
 
Defendants Mark Cannon and Amandeep Dhillon MD specially appear and
move to quash service of summons.
 
              “[C]ompliance
with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish
personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994)
24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) “[T]he filing of a proof of service creates a
rebuttable presumption that the service was proper” but only if it “complies
with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.” (Id. at
1441-1442.)
 
Plaintiff
filed a Proof of Service (POS) showing service upon both Defendants on August
30, 2023. The POS indicates that the registered process server left the packet
with a co-occupant named “Melissa” at 11348 Sinclair Avenue, Porter Ranch. The
POS indicates that this address is the dwelling house or usual place of abode
of Defendants. The process server also provided a declaration of diligence and
a declaration of mailing. This creates a rebuttable presumption that the
service was proper on both Defendants.
 
Defendants
argue that neither defendant resides at this address. However, Defendants do
not provide competent evidence that this is the case. Instead, Defendants
provide the declaration of their Counsel, who offers Defendants’ hearsay
statements that they do not know anyone who lives at the address and do not
reside at that address. Since Defendants do not provide competent evidence of
these facts, their motion to quash cannot be granted as they have not rebutted the
presumption of service.  Accordingly, the
motion to quash is DENIED.
