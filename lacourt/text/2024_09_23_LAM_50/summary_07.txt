Judge Beaudet discloses that 24 years ago, she and her husband purchased a pickup truck that developed electrical problems. Despite taking the truck to the dealer many times, the manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. Judge Beaudet does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased in this case. However, she has given the parties until November 6, 2024, to file and serve a verified statement of disqualification if they believe otherwise. The case management conference will be continued to November 22, 2024, unless both parties waive their right to file such a statement.
