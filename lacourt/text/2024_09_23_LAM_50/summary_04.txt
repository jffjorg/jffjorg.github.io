And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Planet Home Lending, LLC (the plaintiff) and Rudy Ramiro De Leon Jr. (the defendant). The plaintiff is seeking a default judgment to reform a Grant Deed and Deed of Trust that were recorded on July 14, 2022. The court previously granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice, but noted that the submitted default judgment package had some defects. The plaintiff has since filed a revised proposed judgment, but the court is concerned that the recorder's office will not accept a judgment with a handwritten change. As a result, the court is ordering the plaintiff to file a revised proposed judgment with the correction noted above and to deliver a courtesy copy to the court by 4 p.m. on September 24, 2024.
