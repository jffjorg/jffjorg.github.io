Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has continued the hearing on the Freibergers' motion to quash the service of the Summons and Complaint. The judge found that Plaintiff's opposition was filed late and exceeded the page limit set by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subdivision (d). The judge also noted that Plaintiff included a withdrawn motion to strike in their opposition, which was improper. The judge ordered Plaintiff to file an amended opposition that complies with the page limit and does not include new evidence or arguments. The Freibergers are allowed to file a new reply brief that supersedes their previously filed reply. The hearing on the motion to quash is continued to a date to be determined.
