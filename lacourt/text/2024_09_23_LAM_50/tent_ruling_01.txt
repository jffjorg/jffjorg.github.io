[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANTS’
  MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL AND RELATED DATES
 



 
Background
On October 25, 2022, Plaintiffs Kristina Sanders, Cassandra Robinson,
Sarah Sims, Giselle Moreno, and Tiannah Jojola filed this action against
Defendants 38551 and 38661 11th Street East LLC, Pinkal Jogani, and Ariel
Ramirez (collectively, “Defendants”). The Complaint alleges ten causes of
action.  
Defendants now move for a trial continuance “on the grounds that defense
counsel is not available for trial on October 16, 2024 due to conflicts, the
current trial date and related cut-offs are rapidly approaching and defendants
desire to continue trial in order to participate in mediation/engage in
settlement discussions, to complete necessary discovery including the
depositions of parties and witnesses, or alternatively have sufficient time to
prepare for trial prior to the discovery cut-off.” Defendants “request the
trial date and all discovery, motion and other deadlines related to the trial
be continued from October 16, 2024 to February 17, 2025 or a date thereafter
convenient for the Court.” The motion is unopposed.  
Discussion
            As an initial matter,
the Court notes that on September 4, 2024 the Court issued a minute order in
this matter providing, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“The Ex Parte Application TO CONTINUE TRIAL AND RELATED DATES OR
ALTERNATIVELY ADVANCE THE HEARING ON DEFENDANTS’ MOTION filed by 38551 AND
38661 11th STREET EAST LLC, Pinkal Jogani, Ariel Ramirez on 08/15/2024 is
Granted. 
 
Pursuant to the request of moving party, the Non-Appearance Case Review
trial readiness and exhibit binders must be lodged in Department 50 by 4:00p.m.
scheduled for 09/30/2024 is continued to 04/03/25 at 04:00 PM in Department 50
at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. 
 
Pursuant to the request of moving party, the Final Status Conference
scheduled for 10/04/2024 is continued to 04/04/25 at 02:00 PM in Department 50
at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. 
 
Pursuant to the request of moving party, the Jury Trial scheduled for
10/16/2024 is continued to 04/16/25 at 09:30 AM in Department 50 at Stanley
Mosk Courthouse. 
 
All dates and deadlines to be based off the new trial date.” 
In light of the foregoing, Defendants’ instant motion to continue trial
and related dates is moot.  
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to continue
trial and related dates is denied
as moot. 
Defendants are
ordered to give notice of this ruling.
