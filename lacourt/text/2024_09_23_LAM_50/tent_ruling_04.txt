[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Planet Home Lending, LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment
against Defendant Rudy Ramiro De Leon Jr. Plaintiff seeks judgment set forth in
Plaintiff’s proposed judgment for reformation of instrument. 
The
Court previously granted Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice. However, the
Court noted a few defects with the submitted default judgment package. The previously
proposed judgment provided, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“3.       That certain Grant Deed recorded on July
14, 2022, as Document No. 20220722663 in the Official Records of Los Angeles is
hereby reformed to reflect the true intention of the parties thereto; 
 
4. That certain
Deed of Trust recorded on July 14, 2022, as Document No. 20220722664 in the
Official Records of Los Angeles is hereby reformed to reflect the true
intention of the parties thereto…”  
The newly proposed judgment now states how
the subject Grant Deed and Deed of Trust are being reformed. 
However, the legal description of “Parcel
2” in paragraph 2 of the newly proposed judgment still references a “so
foot wide road” while the legal descriptions contained in the subject Grant
Deed and Deed of Trust reference a “60 FOOT WIDE ROAD.” (O’Connell Decl., ¶¶
5-6, Exs. 1-2.)  
The
Court would make this change but the Court is concerned that the recorder’s
office will not accept a judgment with a handwritten change. Therefore,
Plaintiff is ordered to file a revised proposed judgment with the correction
noted above and to deliver a courtesy copy thereof to Department 50 by 4 p.m.
on September 24, 2024.
