[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
 
SPECIALLY
  APPEARING DEFENDANTS’ AMENDED MOTION TO QUASH SUMMONS
 




Background
Plaintiff
Shiloh Parker (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on March 27, 2024 against
Defendants Haley Freiberger and Kyle Freiberger. The Complaint alleges causes
of action for 
(1) “fraud by
intentional misrepresentation,” (2) “fraud by negligent misrepresentation,” 
(3) “breach of
good faith and fair dealing covenant,” (4) violation of Business
and Professions Code section 17200, et seq., and (5) breach of oral contract.[1]
“Specially Appearing
Defendants” Haley Freiberger and Kyle Freiberger (jointly, the “Freibergers”)
now move for an order quashing the service of the Summons and Complaint. Plaintiff
opposes. 
            Discussion
A.             Procedural Issues 
As an
initial matter, in the reply, the Freibergers assert that Plaintiff’s opposition is procedurally
defective in multiple ways.   
First, the Freibergers note that the opposition was
untimely filed and served. Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), “[a]ll papers opposing a motion so
noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy served on each party at least
nine court days, and all reply papers at least five court days before the
hearing.” In addition, “[a]ny period of
notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make any response within any
period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which time
period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be extended
after service by electronic means by two court days…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd.
(a)(3)(B).)
Here, Plaintiff’s opposition
to the instant motion was filed on September 12, 2024. The proof of service filed
with Plaintiff’s opposition indicates that the opposition was served by facsimile,
e-mail, and mail on September 12, 2024. However, the hearing on the instant motion
was set for September 23, 2024.[2]
Nine court days prior to September 23, 2024 is September 10, 2024. Two court days prior to September 10, 2024
is September 6, 2024. As set forth
above, Plaintiff’s opposition was served by, inter alia, electronic
transmission after September 6, 2024, on September 12, 2024. The Freibergers note
that they were accordingly “left…with two court days to respond to [Plaintiff’s]
lengthy Opposition.” (Reply at p. 3:10-11.) The Court notes that five court
days prior to the September 23, 2024 hearing is September 16, 2024 (the
deadline to file a reply under Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b)).  
Moreover, the Freibergers
note that Plaintiff’s opposition well exceeds the applicable page limit. Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subdivision (d), “[e]xcept
in a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding
memorandum may exceed 15 pages. In a
summary judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding
memorandum may exceed 20 pages. No reply or closing memorandum may exceed 10
pages. The page limit does not include the caption page, the notice of motion
and motion, exhibits, declarations, attachments, the table of contents, the
table of authorities, or the proof of service.” (Emphasis added.) Here, Plaintiff’s
memorandum of points and authorities in support of the opposition consists of 24
pages. The Freibergers assert that this is “unfair
to the Specially Appearing Defendants who are left with only ten (10) pages on
Reply to respond to Plaintiff’s improperly lengthy Opposition.” (Reply at p.
3:16-18.) Moreover, Plaintiff does not appear to cite any Court order
authorizing her to include additional pages in her opposition.  
The Freibergers also assert
that “in her Opposition, Plaintiff includes the…Motion to Strike that she
withdrew and…that was vacated and asks the Court to grant it. See Opposition,
pgs. 10-20, 30. Plaintiff’s inclusion of the previously vacated Motion to
Strike is improper and in direct contradiction to the Court’s orders at the
August 12, 2024, hearing.” (Reply at p. 3:22-25.) However, the Court’s August
12, 2024 minute order in this matter provides, inter alia, that “Plaintiff
withdraws the Motion to Strike and will address the issues raised therein via
the opposition to the Motion to Quash.” 
In any event, in light of the
untimeliness of Plaintiff’s opposition and the fact that the opposition well
exceeds the page limit set forth in California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1113,
subdivision (d), the Court continues the hearing on the instant motion. 
Conclusion 
In light of the foregoing issues, the Court continues the hearing on the
Freibergers’ motion to quash to
____________,
2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Dept. 50. 
On
or before ____________, 2024, Plaintiff is to file amended opposition papers
that comply with the page number requirement set forth in California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subdivision (d). Courtesy copies shall be
delivered to Dept. 50. No new evidence or new argument is to be
submitted in Plaintiff’s amended opposition papers.
On
or before ____________, 2024, the Freibergers may file a new reply brief that will supersede the previously filed reply. Courtesy copies of any
new reply brief shall be delivered to Dept. 50.

The Freibergers are ordered to give notice of this Order.¿¿
