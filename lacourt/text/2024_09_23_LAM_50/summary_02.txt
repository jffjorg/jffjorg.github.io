And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by defendants Donald Orval Shaw and Advanced Tactics, Inc. to set aside defaults entered against them. The defendants argue that they were unaware that the deadline to file a response to the lawsuit had passed and that they were negotiating with the plaintiff to reach a settlement. The defendants claim that they did not intend to allow the defaults to be entered and that they were surprised when they learned of the defaults. The Judge has found that the defendants have shown good cause to set aside the defaults and has granted their motion. The Judge has ordered the defendants to file their answer to the complaint within 10 days and has set a case management conference for December 4, 2024.
