Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension Construction Authority, Kiewit Corporation, Kiewit-Parsons, Kiewit Infrastructure West Co., and Parsons Construction Group, Inc. The ruling continues the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike to a date to be determined and orders the parties to meet and confer regarding the demurrer and motion to strike.

The court sustains the Kiewit-Parsons Defendants' demurrer to the Gutierrez Plaintiffs' fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action, which allege loss of consortium, wrongful death, and survival. The court finds that the pleadings do not adequately state a cause of action and that the defendants' demurrers and motions to strike should be sustained.

The court also deems the Kiewit-Parsons Defendants' motion to strike punitive damages moot, as the demurrer has been sustained.

The ruling does not address the LACMTA and Foothill Gold Line's demurrer and motion to strike, which are continued to a date to be determined.
