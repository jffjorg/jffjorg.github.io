BACKGROUND
 
On January 22, 2021, Plaintiff Iuliia Wright (“Plaintiff” or
“Iuliia”) initiated current proceedings by filing her Complaint against
Defendant Philip Wright (“Defendant” or “Philip.”) The personal injury lawsuit
arises from alleged spousal abuse incidents. Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint on July 28, 2023 for 1. Battery; 2. Assault; 3. False
Imprisonment; 4. Intrusion of Privacy; 5. Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress; 6. Negligence; and 7. Unlawful Eviction. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Correct Clerical Mistakes in the Orders of
December 20, 2023 under CCP § 473; and Informal Suggestion to Amend Order of
December 20, 2023 upon Court’s Own Motion under Le Francois v. Goel (2005)
in part of Court’s Denial to Impose Sanctions and/or Attorney Fees on Philip
and his Legal Team is DENIED.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff Iuliia Wright moves to make an informal suggestion that
the court set aside or amend Orders of December 20, 2023 (“December 20 Order”)
upon her own motion under Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal. 4th
1094, 1108 to the extent of awarding prevailing party fees or/and imposing sanctions
on Philip and his legal team and/or to the extent of clarification and/or
corrections of certain factual and legal inaccuracies. 
 
The court has broad powers to amend its own orders. Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 473: “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on
any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding
by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in
the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect. . . . The court may
likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any
terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars . . .” (CCP § 473(a)(1).) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473 is typically used to amend
pleadings and other party filings, rather than orders, but “proceeding,” in the
context of § 473 seems to include Court orders as well as party filings. (See CCP
§ 473(b) [“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his
or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect.”] [emphasis added].)
 
Whereas Code of Civil Procedure section 473 deals with mistakes in
filings and proceedings, Code of Civil Procedure section 1008(b) concerns
reconsideration of orders based on new or different facts or law. Unlike Section
473, Section 1008 has a 10-day time limit, as well as a “strict requirement of
diligence” for a party to explain the new or different facts or law. (See Garcia
v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690 and Baldwin v. Home Sav. of
America (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1199-200. However, until final
judgement is entered, the Court has an inherent power to reconsider any of its
own orders at any point in time. (See, e.g., Nieto v. Blue Shield of
California (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 60, 73 and Le Francois v. Goel
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1104-05.) Once final judgement is entered, however, the
court lacks jurisdiction to consider a motion for reconsideration, even if the
motion was filed before judgement was entered. (See APRI Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 176, 180-182.)
 
Plaintiff states Iuliia’s “suggestion” should not be considered a
motion for reconsideration or any other motion because the court has discretion
not to set the hearing for Plaintiff’s informal suggestion, Defendant Philip is
not required to answer to the said suggestion, and the court may ignore or deny
Iuliia’s informal suggestion. As such, the court finds Plaintiff is asking the
court to reconsider its prior ruling, which is untimely. 
 
Regardless, the court finds it properly denied Plaintiff’s request
for monetary sanctions. Plaintiff reiterates her claim that her request for
sanctions is warranted “to ‘even the field’ that Philip deepened [] on his side
by throwing more than $ 100,000 at his notoriously unethical lawyers to delay
the proceedings and over-litigate current proceedings so that Iuliia would not
be able to further maintain her claim and/or her lawyer would be forced to
withdraw from the case.” (Mtn, p. 2:14-17.) This court’s finding “it will not sanction
defense counsel for complying with a court order in another matter relating to
service of documents, especially where that court had found it necessary to enter
a civil harassment restraining order against plaintiff’s counsel[]” is not
erroneous. Similarly, the court’s finding defendant did not bring their motion
based on res judicata for an improper purpose is not erroneous. “If a court
believes one of its prior interim orders was erroneous, it should be able to
correct that error no matter how it came to acquire that belief. For example,
nothing would prevent the losing party from asking the court at a status
conference to reconsider a ruling. (See Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial,¿supra,¿§ 9:327.8, p. 9(1)–107.) But
a party may not file a written¿motion¿to reconsider that has procedural
significance if it does not satisfy the requirements of¿section 437c,
subdivision (f)(2), or¿1008. The¿court need not rule on any suggestion that it
should reconsider a previous ruling and, without more, another party would not
be expected to respond to such a suggestion.”  (Le Francois v. Goel¿(2005)
35 Cal.4th 1094, 1108,¿as modified (June 10, 2005).)  Plaintiff
makes several other arguments mainly regarding arguments it states this court
did not address in its prior rulings. As noted by Defendant, the court does not
need to address every argument. (See Natter v. Palm Desert Rent Review Com.
(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 994, 1001.) 
 
As for Plaintiff’s contention there are two possible clerical
issues, the court will correct any typographical error that exists. Plaintiff
is to provide the proper documentation at the hearing in support of their claim
of the possible clerical issues. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Correct Clerical Mistakes in the
Orders of December 20, 2023 under CCP § 473; and Informal Suggestion to Amend
Order of December 20, 2023 upon Court’s Own Motion under Le Francois v. Goel
(2005) in part of Court’s Denial to Impose Sanctions and/or Attorney Fees
on Philip and his Legal Team is DENIED.
