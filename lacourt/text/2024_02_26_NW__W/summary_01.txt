Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to correct clerical mistakes in the orders of December 20, 2023 and to amend the order of December 20, 2023. The plaintiff had sought to correct clerical mistakes and to amend the order to award prevailing party fees or impose sanctions on the defendant and his legal team. The judge found that the plaintiff's motion was untimely and that the court lacked jurisdiction to reconsider its prior orders. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the defendant's actions were not improper. The judge noted that the court has broad powers to amend its own orders, but that the plaintiff's motion was not properly presented. The judge also rejected the plaintiff's arguments that the court had erred in its prior rulings, finding that the court's findings were not erroneous.
