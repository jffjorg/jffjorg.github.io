Here is a summary of the tentative ruling:

**Case Information:**

* Case Number: 22STCV38966
* Hearing Date: June 7, 2024
* Department: 73

**Plaintiff/Defendant:** Gonzalez v. Regents of the University of California et al.

**Tentative Ruling:**

1. The court grants summary adjudication as to the third cause of action for harassment based on gender, finding that the alleged conduct by Bush did not rise to the level of severity or pervasiveness.
2. The court grants summary adjudication as to the fourth cause of action for harassment based on race, finding that the alleged comments made by Bush were not severe or pervasive.
3. The court grants summary adjudication as to the first and second causes of action for discrimination based on gender and race, finding that Plaintiff did not suffer an adverse employment action.

**Key Points:**

* The court found that Plaintiff failed to show that Bush's conduct was severe or pervasive to constitute harassment based on gender or race.
* The court found that the alleged comments made by Bush were not ethnic slurs or other abusive language, and therefore did not raise a triable issue of fact.
* The court found that Plaintiff did not suffer an adverse employment action, and therefore did not prevail on the first and second causes of action for discrimination based on gender and race.
