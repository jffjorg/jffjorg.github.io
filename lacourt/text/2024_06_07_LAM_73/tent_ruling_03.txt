Here,
Plaintiff has complied with all requirements for a default judgment.  
 
Plaintiff
submitted the declaration of James Buller, the Vice
President of Cash Operations for AmTrust North America, Inc., the operating
company for Technology Insurance Company Inc. (Buller Decl., ¶ 2.) Buller provided a summary of the case, attached the
invoices showing the payments due and provided a computation of interest. For Policy
No. TWC3925335 for the period of 11/11/2020 through 11/11/2021 (the
"2020 Policy"), Plaintiff seeks the principal sum of $20,600.00,
together with prejudgment interest of $4,382.28 (based on $5.64 per day from
March 16, 2022 through May 1, 2024 [777 days] using the legal rate of 10% per
annum). (Buller Decl., ¶ 5.) For Policy No.
TWC4029241 for the period of 11/11/2021 through 11/11/2022 (but canceled
3/4/2022) (the "2021 Policy"), Plaintiff seeks the principal sum of
$6,483.00, together with prejudgment interest of $1,223.07 (based on $1.77 per
day from June 10, 2022 through May 1,2024 [691 days] using the legal rate of
10% per annum). (Ibid.) Thus, in addition to the $560.00 costs of suit,
Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount of $33,248.35. (Buller Decl., ¶ 13.)
 
Since
Plaintiff has complied with the requirements, Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment is GRANTED.
 
III.

Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is GRANTED.
