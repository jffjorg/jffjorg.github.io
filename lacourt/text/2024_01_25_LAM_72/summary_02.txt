Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Dermalogica's motion to compel arbitration and stays the non-individual PAGA claims pending arbitration. The court finds that Dermalogica has not waived its right to arbitrate, as it has not substantially engaged in the litigation machinery and has provided a reasonable explanation for its delay. The court also finds that Plaintiff maintains standing to litigate his non-individual PAGA claims in court, but the issue of whether he is an aggrieved employee must be determined in arbitration. The court stays the non-individual PAGA claims pending arbitration, as required by the California Supreme Court's decision in Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. A status conference regarding arbitration is set for October 2, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
