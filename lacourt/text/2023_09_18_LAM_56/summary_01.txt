**English Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

Judge Fujie is inclined to grant Adelphia Properties, LLC's motion to set aside the default and default judgment against them in the case brought by Luis Calderon. The Judge finds that Adelphia Properties, LLC has shown they did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit until May 2023.  The evidence suggests that the substitute service on Antonio Munoz, Adelphia's registered agent, was ineffective because Munoz's law license was suspended, and he no longer maintained an office at the address where service was attempted.  The court believes the lack of notice was not due to avoidance or inexcusable neglect on the part of Adelphia Properties, LLC. Therefore, the motion to set aside the default will be granted. The moving party (Adelphia Properties) is ordered to give notice of the ruling.

Summary of Tentative Ruling:

The tentative ruling, issued by Judge Holly J. Fujie on September 18, 2023, addresses a motion by Defendant Adelphia Properties, LLC to set aside a default and default judgment in a case brought by Plaintiff Luis Calderon for alleged violations of the Unruh Act.  The Defendant argued they did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit due to issues with their registered agent, Antonio Munoz, who was disbarred and no longer at the listed address.  Substitute service had been made on a receptionist ("Jane Doe") at that address. The Court found that the Defendant had sufficiently demonstrated a lack of actual notice and that this was not due to avoidance or inexcusable neglect. Therefore, Judge Fujie *granted* the Defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The moving party (Defendant) is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  The hearing is scheduled for September 18, 2023, but the tentative ruling will stand if no party appears and the court receives email notification of intent to submit. If no email is received and no one appears, the motion will be taken off the calendar.

Case Number: 21STCV27752
Hearing Date: September 18, 2023
Dept: 56

**Parties:**

- Plaintiff: Luis Calderon
- Defendants: Adelphia Properties, LLC, et al.

**Facts:**

- On July 28, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging violations of the Unruh Act.
- On July 26, 2022, Defendant Adelphia Properties, LLC's default was taken.
- On January 26, 2023, the Court entered default judgment against Adelphia Properties, LLC.
- On June 29, 2023, Adelphia Properties, LLC filed a motion to set aside the default and default judgment.

**Disputes:**

- Whether Adelphia Properties, LLC received actual notice of the lawsuit.

**Laws:**

- California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 473.5

**Ruling:**

- The Court grants the motion to set aside the default and default judgment, as Adelphia Properties, LLC has demonstrated it did not have actual notice of the Complaint before May 2023.

**Significant Statements:**

- "There is no evidence that Moving Defendant was aware that Munoz was no longer serving as its registered agent or that the unknown individual who accepted service on June 10, 2022 informed Moving Defendant of the service."
- "The Court therefore GRANTS the Motion in its entirety."
