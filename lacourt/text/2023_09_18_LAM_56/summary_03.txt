* Young disputes Hoffman's narrative of the MSA execution and claims he did not see or understand the arbitration clauses.

**Legal Arguments:**

* **Arbitration Agreement:** Hoffman argues he fulfilled his burden to establish the existence of an agreement to arbitrate, citing the explicit acknowledgements of the arbitration clauses on the signed documents.
* **Enforcement by Nonsignatory:** Hoffman argues he is entitled to enforce the arbitration clauses as a non-signatory because the cross-complaint relies on his employment with RBC, making him a third-party beneficiary of the agreements.

**English-text Summary:**

Judge Holly J. Fujie intends to grant Arch Hoffman's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings in the case between Jane Doe and Kevin Young, et al.  The ruling stems from a cross-complaint filed by Young and GB7 LLC against Hoffman, alleging various financial wrongdoings. Hoffman argues that the claims are subject to arbitration based on clauses within a Master Services Agreement (MSA) and a Client Account Agreement (CAA) signed by Young with RBC Capital Markets, where Hoffman was employed.  The Judge finds that Hoffman has demonstrated the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, and that Hoffman, even as a non-signatory to the agreement in his individual capacity, can enforce the arbitration clause. The Court found that the issues related to the access Hoffman had to Young's information came about due to Hoffman's employment at RBC. The Judge also determined that the agreement was not unconscionable.  The court has scheduled a status conference regarding the arbitration for March 6, 2024, and ordered the parties to file a joint status report beforehand. The action is stayed pending the arbitration's conclusion.

English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:

Judge Holly J. Fujie tentatively GRANTS Arch Hoffman's Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings.  The Judge found that Kevin Young and GB7 LLC are bound by the arbitration clauses in the Master Services Agreement (MSA) and Client Account Agreement (CAA) they signed with RBC Capital Markets, LLC, even though Young claims he didn't fully read the documents or that arbitration wasn't explained to him.  The court determined these claims insufficient to invalidate the agreements.  The judge also found that Hoffman, even though he wasn't a direct signatory to the agreements, could enforce the arbitration clauses because the claims against him are directly related to his employment with RBC and the management of Young's accounts, as described in those agreements. The Judge rejected the argument that the arbitration agreements were unconscionable, finding no evidence of procedural unfairness.  As a result, the court case is STAYED (paused) pending the outcome of the arbitration proceedings. A status conference regarding the arbitration is scheduled for March 6, 2024. The parties must submit a joint report on the status of arbitration by February 28, 2024.
