* Young disputes Hoffman's narrative of the MSA execution and claims he did not see or understand the arbitration clauses.

**Legal Arguments:**

* **Arbitration Agreement:** Hoffman argues he fulfilled his burden to establish the existence of an agreement to arbitrate, citing the explicit acknowledgements of the arbitration clauses on the signed documents.
* **Enforcement by Nonsignatory:** Hoffman argues he is entitled to enforce the arbitration clauses as a non-signatory because the cross-complaint relies on his employment with RBC, making him a third-party beneficiary of the agreements.
