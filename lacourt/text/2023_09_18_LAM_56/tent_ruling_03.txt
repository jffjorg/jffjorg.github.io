AND
RELATED CROSS-ACTION
 
MOVING
PARTY: Cross-Defendant Arch Hoffman (“Hoffman”)
 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendants/Cross-Complainants Kevin Young (“Young”) and GB7 LLC (“GB7”)
(collectively, “Cross-Complainants”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply
papers.
 
BACKGROUND
This action
arises out of an employment relationship. 
The currently operative first amended complaint (the “FAC”) alleges: (1)
sexual battery; (2) sexual assault; (3) gender violence; (4) sexual harassment
and harassment based on sex, gender, national origin, and race in violation of
the Fair Employment and Housing Act; (5) constructive discharge in violation of
public policy; and (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress.  
 
Cross-Complainants’
cross-complaint (the “XC”), filed on May 8, 2023 alleges: (1) conspiracy to
defraud; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3) breach of contract; (4) conversion;
(5) money had and received; and (6) money paid. 
The XC details alleged wrongful conduct undertaken by Hoffman, an
employee of RBC Capital Markets, LLC (“RBC”), while he worked with Cross-Defendants
as Young’s wealth manager.  
 
On August 18,
2023, Hoffman filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay action (the
“Motion”) on the grounds that the claims asserted against him in the XC must be
adjudicated in binding arbitration pursuant to arbitration clauses contained in
written contracts signed by Young.  
 
DISCUSSION 
The
purpose of the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) is to move the parties in an
arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as
possible.  (Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp. (1983) 460
U.S. 1, 23.)  The FAA is consistent with
the federal policy to ensure the enforceability, according to their terms, of
private agreements to arbitrate.  (Mastrobuono v.
Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc. (1995) 514 U.S. 52, 57.)  
 
 
California
law, like federal law, favors enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.  (Armendariz
v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97 (“Armendariz”).)  Under California Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) section 1281, a written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing
controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid, enforceable, and
irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any
contract.  (CCP § 1281.)  On petition of a party to an arbitration
agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a
controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy unless grounds exist not to compel arbitration.  (CCP § 1281.2.)  
 
In
ruling on a petition to compel arbitration, the trial court first decides
whether an enforceable arbitration agreement exists between the parties, and
then determines whether the plaintiff’s claims are covered by the agreement.  (Omar
v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.)  The party seeking arbitration bears the
burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement, and the party
opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any defense, such as
unconscionability.  (Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC
(2012) 55 Cal.4th 223, 236.)  The trial
court may resolve a motion to compel arbitration in summary proceedings.  (Gamma Eta Chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha v.
Helvey (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 1090, 1097.) 
Factual issues may be submitted on declarations and affidavits, or by
oral testimony in the court’s discretion. 
(Juen v. Alain Pinel Realtors, Inc.  (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 972, 978.)  When the enforceability of an arbitration
clause may depend upon which of two sharply conflicting factual accounts is to
be believed, the better course would normally be for the trial court to hear
oral testimony and allow the parties the opportunity for
cross-examination.  (See Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin. Securities
Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 414.) 
 
Existence of Agreement to
Arbitrate
In
support of the Motion, Hoffman provides evidence that he has been employed by
RBC since March 2019.  (Declaration of
Arch Hoffman (“Hoffman Decl.”) ¶ 2.) 
On March 22, 2019, in Hoffman’s presence, Young entered into a Master
Services Agreement (the “MSA”) with RBC. 
(Hoffman Decl. ¶ 13, 19, Exhibit D.) 
In accordance with RBC’s policies, Hoffman provided Young with the
entire MSA, which consists of three parts. 
(See Hoffman Decl. ¶¶ 8, 15, 18.) 
Hoffman retained the signature page and left the remainder of the MSA
documents with Young.  (Hoffman Decl. ¶
13.) 
 
Part
I of the MSA includes a section entitled “Arbitration Agreement,” which
provides, in part: 
“YOU
AGREE THAT ANY CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO
THE MASTER AGREEMENT, OR ANY INVESTMENT BY OR ON BEHALF OF YOU HEREUNDER, OR
WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTIONS OF ANY KIND EXECUTED BY OR WITH RBC WM, ITS
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES OR AFFILIATES, OR WITH RESPECT TO THE
MASTER AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO WITH RBC WM RELATING TO
THE ACCOUNTS WITH RBC WM OR THE BREACH THEREOF, SHALL BE SETTLED BY ARBITRATION
PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES, THEN
IN EFFECT, OF THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY (“FINRA”). JUDGMENT
UPON ANY AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATORS MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING
JURISDICTION THEREOF.”  (Hoffman Decl. ¶
18, Exhibit E 15 at 12.)
 
 
The
signature line signed by Young is immediately beneath an “Acknowledgements”
provision that provides that the signatory acknowledges that they have read and
agreed to the terms of the MSA.  (See Hoffman
Decl., Exhibit D at 2.)  The final
acknowledgement directly above the signature line states, in bold font: “THE
MASTER AGREEMENT INCLUDES A PRE-DISPUTE ARBITRATION CLAUSE ON PAGE 12 OF THIS
MASTER AGREEMENT UNDER THE HEADING ‘ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.’”  (Id.) 

 
On
March 22, 2019, Young also entered into a Client Account Agreement (the “CAA”)
on behalf of GB7.  (Hoffman Decl. ¶ 21,
Exhibit G.)  The signature line of the
CAA is directly below an acknowledgement that states “By signing below, I
certify that the information provided on this form is true, correct and
complete.  I understand that this account
is governed by the Client Account Agreement which contains a pre-dispute
arbitration provision in Section 18 on Page 5.” 
(Hoffman Decl., Exhibit G at 4.)
 
The
arbitration provision in the CAA provides, in part:
“I
AGREE THAT ALL CONTROVERSIES OR DISPUTES THAT MAY ARISE BETWEEN ME AND RBC WM,
OR ANY OF RBC WM’S AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS, CONCERNING ANY
TRANSACTION(S), OR THE CONSTRUCTION, PERFORMANCE OR BREACH OF THIS OR ANY OTHER
AGREEMENT BETWEEEN ME AND RBC WM PERTAINING TO SECURITIES AND OTHER PROPERTY,
WHETHER ENTERED INTO PRIOR, ON OR SUBSEQUENT TO THE DATE HEREOF, SHALL BE
DETERMINED BY ARBITRATION.”  (Hoffman
Decl., Exhibit F at 9.)
 
Hoffman
declares that has never entered into any oral or written contractual
relationships with Cross-Complainants aside from the MSA and CAA.  (See Hoffman Decl. ¶ 17.) 
 
In
support of the opposition (the “Opposition”), Young disputes Hoffman’s
narrative of the MSA’s execution.  Young
declares that he initially retained Hoffman as his personal wealth manager in
2006 and that Hoffman orally agreed to keep Young’s financial information
private.  (Declaration of Kevin Young
(“Young Decl.”) ¶ 3.)  Young declares
that he had never seen Parts I and II of the MSA when he signed the document
and has neither physical nor electronic copies of the documents in his
records.  (Young Decl. ¶ 5.)  Young further declares that Hoffman failed to
review the terms of the Acknowledgements section on the signature page or
otherwise mention arbitration before he entered into the MSA.  (See Young Decl. ¶¶ 8-9.)
 
The
Court finds that Hoffman has met his burden to establish the existence of an
agreement to arbitrate. The signature forms explicitly acknowledge the
existence of binding arbitration provisions. 
Cross-Complainants’ failure to read the arbitration provisions or
acknowledgements of the provisions on their corresponding signature forms is
insufficient to refute their existence and validity.  (See Desert Outdoor Advertising v.
Superior Court (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 86, 872-73.)
 
Enforcement
by Nonsignatories
An entity seeking to compel arbitration must
generally establish it was a party to an arbitration agreement.  (JSM Tuscany, LLC v. Superior Court (2011)
193 Cal.App.4th 1222, 1236.)  Only in
limited circumstances may an arbitration agreement be enforced by a
nonsignatory.  (See id.)  One such circumstance is where a benefit is
conferred on the nonsignatory as a result of the agreement, making the
nonsignatory a third party beneficiary of the arbitration agreement.  (Jensen v. U-Haul Co. of California (2017)
18 Cal.App.5th 295, 301.)  Another is
when the equitable estoppel doctrine applies and a nonsignatory is allowed to
enforce an arbitration clause because the claims against the nonsignatory are
dependent on, or inextricably intertwined with, the contractual obligations of
the agreement containing the arbitration clause.  (Jarboe v. Hanlees Auto Group (2020)
53 Cal.App.5th 539, 549.) 
 
By relying on contract terms in a claim against a
nonsignatory defendant, even if not exclusively, a plaintiff may be equitably
estopped from repudiating the arbitration clause contained in that
agreement.  (Boucher v. Alliance Title
Company, Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 262, 272.)  That the claims are cast in tort rather than
contract does not avoid the arbitration clause. 
(Id.)  When asserting
claims against two defendants that “rely on, make reference to, and presume the
existence of” an employment agreement, the Plaintiff is estopped from avoiding
arbitration of his causes of action against the nonsignatory defendant.  (Id.) 

 
Here, although the XC alleges that Hoffman and Young
began a business relationship in around 2006 and that at all relevant times,
Hoffman worked as Young’s wealth manager, the thrust of XC’s allegations relate
to the time period during which Hoffman worked for RBC, and the XC explicitly
cites Hoffman’s employment with RBC as a basis for liability.  (See XC ¶¶ 11, 33.)  Young has offered little
evidence to refute Hoffman’s position that the allegations in the XC do not
flow from the access to information and knowledge of his affairs that were
gained as a result of Hoffman’s employment with RBC.  Moreover, the terms of the arbitration
provisions in both the MSA and CAA extend to any disputes relating to RBC’s,
its agents’, or its employees’ management of the accounts.  The Court therefore finds that Hoffman is entitled
to enforce the arbitration provisions as a non-signatory.
Unconscionability
Unconscionability
has both a procedural and a substantive element, with the former focusing on
oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power and the latter on overly
harsh or one-sided results.  (Sanchez
v. Valencia Holding Company, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 899, 910.)  Though both procedural and substantive
unconscionability need to be shown, they need not be present to the same
degree; the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of
procedural unconscionability is required to come to the
conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.  (Armendariz, supra, 24 Cal.4th at
114.)
 
1.    
Procedural Unconscionability
Procedural
unconscionability “pertains to the making of the agreement.”  (Ajamian v. CantorCO2e, L.P. (2012)
203 Cal.App.4th 771, 795.)  Procedural
unconscionability focuses on two factors: “oppression” and “surprise.”  (Zullo v. Superior Court (2011) 197
Cal.App.4th 477, 484.)  Oppression arises
from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and
an absence of meaningful choice.  (Id.)
 Surprise involves the extent to which
the supposedly agreed-upon terms of the bargain are hidden in the prolix
printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.  (Id.)
 
Here,
notwithstanding the dispute over whether Young reviewed the underlying
contracts in their entirety, it is undisputed that the signed signature pages
of both the MSA and CAA make explicit reference to the existence of binding
arbitration agreements.  Young’s failure
to read the disclosures before signing does not constitute surprise.  The Opposition does not present other
evidence of circumstances that constitute the oppression or surprise required
to support a finding of procedural unconscionability—rather, the evidence
demonstrates that Young agreed to enter the MSA during his second meeting with
Hoffman regarding the subject.  The
contracts were thus not offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis and there is no
evidence of uneven bargaining power.  The
Court therefore finds that the arbitration provisions are not procedurally
unconscionable, and as a result, the Court need not analyze substantive
unconscionability.
 
            Based on the foregoing, the Court
GRANTS the Motion.  The Court sets a status
conference regarding the arbitration on March 6, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in this
department.  The parties are ordered to file a joint status report regarding
the status of the arbitration by February 28, 2024.  This action is STAYED pending the conclusion
of the arbitration proceedings.
 
 
 
 Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
