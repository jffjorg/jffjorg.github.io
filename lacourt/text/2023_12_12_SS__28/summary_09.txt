And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling states that the court denies as moot Plaintiff Lucia Castano's motion to compel the deposition of Paul Kaloostian, M.D. The court also denies both parties' requests for sanctions. The motion was filed after the defense medical examination of the plaintiff was conducted and the parties had exchanged objections to the deposition notice. The court notes that the defendants did not cite legal authority supporting their assertion that they were not required to produce the examining physician for deposition until they designated him as an expert witness. The court concludes that the motion is moot and denies both parties' requests for sanctions, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480.
