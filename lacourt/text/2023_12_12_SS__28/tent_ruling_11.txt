PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
555 Holdings
LLC requests that the Court compel Plaintiff to serve full and complete
verified responses, without objections, to its demand for inspection and production
of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories, and award
sanctions. 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court deny the motions as moot and deny the requests for sanctions.
LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Inspection demand 
        “If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response
to it, the following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter
4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order
compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition
to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then
fails to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that
are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction,
or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
C.      Discovery sanctions 
“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may
also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has
engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised
that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
“Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not
limited to, the following: 
* * * 
“(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
On
July 25, 2023, 555 Holdings LLC served a demand for inspection and production
of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories on Plaintiff.  Responses were due August 28, 2023.  555 Holdings LLC did not receive timely
discovery responses and had not received responses by the time it filed these
motions on October 12, 2023. 
On
October 27, 2023, after retaining counsel, Plaintiff served verified discovery responses.  Plaintiff argues that, as a result, 555 Holdings
LLC’s motions are moot and the Court should deny the requests for sanctions. 
The
statutes at issue (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300) do not support Plaintiff’s assertion that the motions are moot.  The statutes provide that the failure to
serve timely discovery responses waives any objections to the discovery requests.  A party may file a motion asking the Court to
relieve the party from the waiver, but Plaintiff has not filed any motions
seeking relief from waiver. Therefore, because it is undisputed that Plaintiff did not serve timely discovery responses, the Court is required to grant the
motions. 
The
Court is also required to impose sanctions against a party who fails to serve
timely discovery responses unless the Court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
Although
Plaintiff eventually retained counsel and served discovery responses, she took
these steps only after 555 Holdings LLC filed these motions to compel.  Under these circumstances, it is not unjust
to impose sanctions. 
555 Holdings
LLC requests $652.50 in sanctions for each motion, based on 4.5 hours of
attorney’s work at a rate of $145.00 per hour. 
 Counsel spent 0.5 hours in
informal resolution efforts, two hours to draft each motion, and anticipated
spending two hours to attend the hearing.  The motions are substantially similar
and will be heard together.  The Court
awards sanctions of $580 for all three motions based on four hours of
attorney’s work. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court GRANTS the motion of Defendant 555 Holdings LLC to compel Plaintiff
Yolanda Amador to respond to the demand for inspection and
production of documents, set one, and orders Plaintiff Yolanda Amador to provide
verified, code-compliant responses to Defendant 555 Holdings LLC’s demand for
inspection and production of documents and to produce the documents,
electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without
objections by January 11, 2024. 
The Court GRANTS the motion of
Defendant 555 Holdings LLC to compel Plaintiff Yolanda Amador to respond to special
interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff Yolanda Amador to provide
verified, code-compliant responses to Defendant 555 Holdings LLC’s special
interrogatories without objections by January 11, 2024.
