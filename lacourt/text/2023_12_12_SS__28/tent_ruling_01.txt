considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On
September 15, 2020, Plaintiff Katheryn Drexler (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Jeannine Rosete (“Rosete”), Shay
Rose Bolton (“Bolton”), and Does 1-50 for negligence. 
On
June 17, 2022, Bolton filed an answer. 
On
August 8, 2022, Rosete filed an answer. 
On
September 21, 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part Bolton’s ex
parte application to continue the trial and related dates.  The Court continued the trial to April 15,
2024.  The Court denied the request to continue
or reopen discovery without prejudice. 
On
October 10, 2023, Bolton filed a motion to extend the discovery and expert
discovery cut-off dates.  The motion was
set for hearing on December 12, 2023. 
Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for April 15, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Bolton
requests that the Court re-open discovery and expert discovery to follow the
current trial date. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.020 provides: 
“(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any
party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings
on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action. 
“(b) Except as provided in Section 2024.050, a
continuance or postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen
discovery proceedings.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 provides: 
“(a) On motion of any party, the court may grant leave
to complete discovery proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery
heard, closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new
trial date has been set. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(b) In exercising its discretion to grant or deny
this motion, the court shall take into consideration any matter relevant to the
leave requested, including, but not limited to, the following: 
“(1) The necessity and the reasons for the discovery. 
“(2) The diligence or lack of diligence of the party
seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons
that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was not heard
earlier. 
“(3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or
hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the
date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in
prejudice to any other party. 
“(4) The length of time that has elapsed between any
date previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to extend or to reopen
discovery, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.050.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2016.040 provides: “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” 

DISCUSSION 
Despite
diligent efforts, Bolton did not obtain testimony,
documents, and other evidence needed to defend the case before the discovery
cut-off dates. 
The
Court has weighed the factors listed in Code of Civil Procedure section
2024.050 and finds that it is appropriate to reopen discovery. 
The
Court grants the motion and reopens discovery and expert discovery, which will
be based on the new April 15, 2024 trial date. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Shay Rose Bolton’s motion to reopen discovery.  Discovery, expert discovery, and related
dates now are based on the April 15, 2024 trial date. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
