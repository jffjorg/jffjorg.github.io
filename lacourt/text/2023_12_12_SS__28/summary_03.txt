```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion by Quixote Studios, LLC to file amended answers to the complaint and cross-complaint. Quixote seeks to add an affirmative defense based on the Graves Amendment, which eliminates vicarious liability for non-negligent vehicle rental companies based solely on ownership. The Judge notes that Quixote's failure to assert this defense in its original answers was an inadvertent error and that allowing Quixote to amend its answers will not prejudice Plaintiff or LACMTA because they have ample time to conduct discovery before the trial date.

The Judge finds that Quixote has not misled or prejudiced Plaintiff or LACMTA, and therefore grants the motion. The Judge orders Quixote to file and serve the amended answers within 30 days of the hearing on this motion.
