 Case Number:  22STCV32763    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. BACKGROUND On
October 6, 2022, Plaintiffs Alma Perez (“Perez”) and Eduardo De Leon Chavez
(“Chavez”) filed this action against Defendants Alexandra Mora Segura
(“Segura”), Anthony Luis Duchesne (“Duchesne”), and Does 1-25 for motor vehicle
tort and general negligence. On
June 9, 2023, Segura and Luis Duchesne filed an answer and a cross-complaint
against Cross-Defendants Chavez and Roes 1-5 for contribution, indemnity, and
declaratory relief. On
September 7, 2023, the clerk entered Chavez’s default on the cross-complaint. On
October 6, 2023, Segura filed motions (1) to compel
Perez’s further responses to specially prepared interrogatories, set one, and
for sanctions and (2) to compel Chavez’s further responses to specially
prepared interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions.  The motions were set to be heard on December
8, 2023.  The Court continued the
hearings to December 12, 2023.  Perez and
Chavez did not file oppositions. Also
on October 6, 2023, Segura filed motions (1) to compel Perez’s further
responses to form interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions and (2) to compel
Chavez’s further responses to form interrogatories, set one, and for
sanctions.  The motions were set to be
heard on December 12, 2023.  Perez and
Chavez did not file oppositions. Trial
is currently scheduled for April 4, 2024. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS A.      Informal Discovery Conference The
Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts
Effective October 10, 2022 (Filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub
Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery
until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and
complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Discovery.” Segura’s
counsel scheduled and appeared at an IDC on October 17, 2023.  On October 17, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
stated that she was not prepared to go forward with the IDC.  The Court finds that Segura has complied with
her IDC obligations. B.       Timeliness of motions A
notice of motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of
the service of the responses, or any supplemental responses, or on or before
any specific later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.290, subd, (c).) Failure to file a motion within this time period
constitutes a waiver of any right to compel further responses to requests for
admission. Segura
filed the motions on October 6, 2023. 
Perez and Chavez do not contest the timeliness of the motions. C.   Meet and confer “A
motion to compel must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)  “A meet and confer declaration must state
facts showing a reasonable and good-faith attempt at an informal resolution of
each issue presented by the motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  Perez
and Chavez do not contest the adequacy of Segura’s meet and confer efforts. D.      Separate statement With
exceptions that do not apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,
requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is
warranted.  Segura
has filed separate statements. APPLICABLE LAW A.      Interrogatories          Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides in part: “(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete. “(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate. “(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit
or too general. “(b) (1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. “(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under
the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. “(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories. “(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subds. (a), (b), (c), (d).) B.    Discovery sanctions “The
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. The court may also impose this sanction on one
unsuccessfully asserting that another has engaged in the misuse of the
discovery process, or on any attorney who advised that assertion, or on both.
If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court
shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) “Misuses
of the discovery process include . . .                                                   *
* * “(d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.) DISCUSSION I.               Motion to compel Perez’s further

filed: October 6, 2023 Granted: All (1-8) The
