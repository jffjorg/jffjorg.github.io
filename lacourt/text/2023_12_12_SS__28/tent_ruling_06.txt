considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
September 17, 2021, Plaintiff Alexander Lockett
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“LACMTA”), City of Los Angele (“City”),
County of Los Angeles (“County”), California Department of Transportation, and
Does 1-50 for premises liability—dangerous condition of public property. 
On
September 9, 2022, the County filed an answer. On January 4, 2023, the Court
dismissed the County without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
September 14, 2022, The People of the
State of California, acting by and through the Department of Transportation,
erroneously sued as “California Department of Transportation, a public entity,”
filed an answer.  On October 31, 2022,
the Court dismissed the California Department of Transportation without
prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
September 16, 2022, the Court dismissed the City without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
September 26, 2022, LACMTA filed an answer. 
On
May 30, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as
counsel. 
On
November 9, 2023, LACMTA filed a motion for terminating sanctions to be heard
on December 12, 2023.  Plaintiff has not
filed an opposition. 
The
trial is currently set for March 27, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
LACMTA
requests that the Court issue terminating sanctions against Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part: 
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,
after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity
for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: 
“(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may
also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has
engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised
that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
* * * 
“(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by
one of the following orders: 
“(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of
the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. 
“(2) An order staying further proceedings by that
party until an order for discovery is obeyed. 
“(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of
the action, of that party. 
“(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against
that party.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subds. (a), (d).) 
A
violation of a discovery order supports the imposition of terminating
sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in
disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 795-796 (Deyo).) 
A terminating
sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with
caution." (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A
decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 
DISCUSSION 
On
September 26, 2023, the Court granted LACMTA’s motion to compel responses to
request for production and identification of documents and ordered Plaintiff to
provide verified code-compliant responses and to produce the documents,
electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without
objections by October 20, 2023. The Court also granted LACMTA’s motions to
compel responses to form and special interrogatories and ordered Plaintiff to
provide verified code-compliant responses to the interrogatories without
objections by October 20, 2023.  The
Court ordered Plaintiff to pay $980 in monetary sanctions to LACMTA by October
20, 2023. 
Plaintiff
has not provided the discovery responses or paid the sanctions specified in the
Court’s September 26, 2023 order. 
The
Court grants LACMTA’s motion, imposes terminating sanctions, and dismisses the
case. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s
motion for terminating sanctions.  The
Court dismisses the complaint filed by Plaintiff Alexander Lockett with
prejudice under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (d)(3). 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
