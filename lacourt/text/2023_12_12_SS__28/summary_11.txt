And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff, Yolanda Amador, failed to serve timely discovery responses, including documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories, despite repeated requests from the defendant, 555 Holdings LLC. As a result, the court grants the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff to serve full and complete verified responses to the discovery requests. The court also awards sanctions of $580 against the plaintiff for failing to serve timely discovery responses. The plaintiff had initially argued that the motions were moot because she eventually retained counsel and served discovery responses, but the court finds that the plaintiff's delay in responding to the discovery requests was unjust and that the defendant is entitled to sanctions.
