LEGAL STANDARDCalifornia Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800 sets forth the requirements for default judgments. In pertinent part, the rule dictates that a party must use form CIV-100 and file the following documents with the clerk: (1) except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's claim; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3)¿interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5)¿a declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8)¿exhibits as necessary; and (9)¿a request for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800(a)(1)-(9).)IV. DISCUSSIONThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800 to obtain entry of default judgment against Defendant. Plaintiffs have failed to: (1) provide interest computations and (3) support the request for attorneys’ fees by attaching the relevant contract and accounting for counsel’s time.V. CONCLUSIONBased on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ default judgment application is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.Plaintiffs to give notice.
