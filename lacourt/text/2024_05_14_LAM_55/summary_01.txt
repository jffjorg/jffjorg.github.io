And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendant Joseph Rubin to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The plaintiff, Gary Stiffelman, alleges that Rubin and other defendants improperly withheld rent payments and induced and interfered with a sublease. The judge has overruled the demurrer in its entirety.

The judge found that the plaintiff's factual allegations are sufficient to state causes of action for conversion, inducing breach of contract, and intentional interference with contractual relations. The judge also found that the plaintiff has adequately alleged that Rubin, in his individual capacity, exercised control over SGE and Lighthouse, and that Rubin's actions were intentional and caused harm to the plaintiff.

The judge rejected Rubin's arguments that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the economic loss rule and that the plaintiff's conversion claim is time-barred. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claims are not duplicative, and that the plaintiff has adequately alleged that Rubin's actions caused him to suffer damages.

The judge has granted Rubin's request for judicial notice and has ordered the parties to file a joint statement regarding the issues in the case. The parties have 20 days to answer the demurrer.
