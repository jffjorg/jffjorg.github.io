Summary in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the request for entry of default judgment filed by Arvest Bank dba Arvest Equipment Finance against Little Fat Trucking and Xing Wang. The Court finds that the request contains some issues that need to be addressed, including the calculation of damages and interest, and compliance with court rules.
