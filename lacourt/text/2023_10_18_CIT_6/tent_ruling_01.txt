Judgment
Defendants: Little Fat Trucking, Xing Wang 
TENTATIVE RULING
The Court DENIES the request for entry of default judgment without prejudice.
BACKGROUND
This is a breach of contract case. On February
16, 2023, Plaintiff Arvest Bank dba Arvest Equipment Finance (Plaintiff) filed
this action against Defendants Little Fat Trucking and Xing Wang (collectively,
Defendants), alleging causes of action for breach of contract x 2, claim and
delivery, conversion, breach of guaranty x 2, and money lent x 2. Default was
entered against Little Fat Trucking on April 19, 2023 and against Xing Wang on
June 30, 2023.
LEGAL
STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure section 585
permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond
or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the default by
the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of
the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the
judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of
costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff seeks
default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $224,858.42,
including $167,666.10 in damages, $17,299.28 in interest, $3,920.30 in attorney
fees, and $35,972.74 in costs. The Court finds Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment contains some issues that need to be addressed. First, the subject
loan agreements are governed by the laws of the State of Arkansas. (Dorsey
Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 15; Id., Ex. G, ¶ 15.) It is unclear to the Court how
this may affect the Court’s ability to enter judgment for the amounts requested,
such as prejudgment interest and costs. 
Second, some of
the calculations do not add up. More specifically, it is unclear why Plaintiff
has included $35,364.24 in unpaid loan fees as an item of costs on Form CIV-100
but then includes it under the “other” category of Form JUD-100. (Form CIV-100,
¶ 2, subd. (d); Id., ¶ 7, subds. (c), (d); Form JUD-100, ¶ 6, subd.
(a)(5).) These unpaid loan fees would otherwise appear to be part of
Plaintiff’s principal damages as amounts due under the loan agreements, not as
items of costs under California law. (See generally, Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5.) 
Moreover, Plaintiff
has calculated its prejudgment interest by including the unpaid loan fees in
addition to the unpaid loans, which would be improper if they were items of
costs since, under California law, prejudgment interest is based on the
principal damages, not costs. (See generally, Id.; see Civ. Code § 3287;
Decl. re Interest Calculations and Attorney’s Fees., 3:7-20.) It is also unclear
how these amounts were calculated, as they seem to differ from the amounts
Plaintiff is seeking. (See Id.; Dorsey Decl., Exs. G, M.) Further, the
dates stated in the declaration regarding interest calculations and attorney’s
fees do not add up (e.g., Interest calculated from July 19, 2023 through July
31, 2023 does not equal 377 days). In addition, it is unclear how Plaintiff
calculated interest on the unpaid loan fees from the date of default rather
than from the date the fees were incurred and due. (Decl. In Support of Entry
of Default Judgment, ¶¶ 19, 40.)
Furthermore,
the default judgment package does not comply with Rule 3.1806, which provides
that, “[i]n all cases
in which judgment is rendered upon a written obligation to pay money, the clerk
must, at the time of entry of judgment, unless otherwise ordered, note over the
clerk's official signature and across the face of the writing the fact of
rendition of judgment with the date of the judgment and the title of the court
and the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1806; see HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A.
v. Aguilar (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th Supp. 6, 10.) Plaintiff has not provided
an original copy of the loans at issue, nor has Plaintiff provided a
declaration in lieu of the original.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES
the request for entry of default judgment without prejudice.
