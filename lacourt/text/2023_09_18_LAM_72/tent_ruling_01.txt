COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES
 
DEPARTMENT 72
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 



LW ACQUISITIONS, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company,
 
                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
7080 HOLLYWOOD, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company;
  and DOES 1 through 50, inclusive,
 
                                  Defendant.
 


 Case No:  21STCV04671
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 18, 2023
 Calendar No. 1



 
The Court decides several motions
relating to appraisals and related documents that LW
Acquisitions, LLC (“Plaintiff”) maintains are covered by the attorney
work product doctrine.  Defendant 7080
Hollywood (“Defendant”) maintains, by contrast, that the appraisals and related
documents are not covered by this doctrine. 

 
1.     Defendant challenges Plaintiff’s
“clawback” and seeks an order that the documents with Bates numbers LW00002501
and LW00001114-1115 are not subject to the attorney-client privilege or the
attorney work product doctrine.  The
Court grants Defendant’s motion.   
2.     Defendant seeks to compel
production of the 2017 appraisal, previously produced as LW0000324-382. The
Court denies Defendant’s motion.
3.     Plaintiff seeks to disqualify
Defendant’s counsel.  The Court denies
Plaintiff’s motion.
4.     Defendant seeks to compel production
of Mr. Zoraster’s 2020 appraisal files. 
The Court grants the motion except with respect to the actual
communications in 2020 between Mr. Zoraster and counsel.  Plaintiff must produce the 2020 appraisal
files and a privilege log under the terms of this order within 30 days.
5.    
There are four motions to seal on calendar, all filed by Plaintiff:  (a) The 5/6/2023 motion to seal documents
submitted in opposition to Defendant’s motion to compel production of the 2017
appraisal; (b) the 5/9/2023 motion to seal documents submitted by Defendant in
support of its motion to challenge privilege claw-back and motion to compel; (c)
The 5/16/2023 motion to seal document submitted in opposition to 7080
Hollywood, LLCs Motion To Compel Production of the 2017 Appraisal; and (d) The 5/26/2023
motion to seal documents submitted by Defendant in opposition to the motion to
disqualify.  The Court denies these
motions except in one respect.  To the
extent that any of the papers or documents specifically consist of or reference
the documents listed in the January 2022 clawback e-mail, the Court will permit
those portions to be redacted.  Those
documents have been clawed back and are not ordered returned.  To the extent that the papers consist of or reference
the content of the documents in the 2023 clawback letter, the Court is ordering
those documents produced and they may not be filed under seal.  Plaintiff must file a single motion to seal within
30 days, along with revised public documents that redact only that small
portion.  If Plaintiff does not do so,
the documents will be unsealed. 
 
I.               
 DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO
CHALLENGE PLAINTIFF’S CLAWBACK (filed on 4/3/2023)
 
Background
 
This suit concerns a
dispute regarding the value of land in the Hollywood area of the City of Los
Angeles. (Complaint, ¶ 1.) Plaintiff filed the operative Complaint on February
5, 2021 against 7080 Hollywood, LLC alleging three causes of action:
 
1.    
Declaratory Relief Re: Fair Market Value of Site;
2.    
Declaratory Relief Re: Exclusion of Parking Covenants; and 
3.    
Declaratory Relief Re: Appraisal Valuation Date.
 
These causes of action
stem from the dispute of the valuation of the subject property, located at 7081-7083 Hawthorn
Avenue and 1638 N. La Brea Avenue. The Motion to Challenge LW
Acquisitions LLC’s Privilege Clawback (“Motion”) was filed on March 31, 2023.
It is one of three related motions surrounding a 2017 Appraisal document that
Plaintiff inadvertently produced to Defendant during the initial discovery
period in November of 2021. Plaintiff realized the inadvertent disclosure on
January 7, 2022 and sent an email to that effect (“January 2022 Clawback”),
explicitly stating that the documents were being clawed back and listing the
bates-numbers of the clawed back documents. (Declaration of Andrea Feathers ISO
Opposition to Clawback Motion, hereinafter, “Feathers Dec.”, Ex. A.) The bates
numbers on the documents from the January 2022 Clawback are as follows:
 
1.
LW00000287-LW00000302
2.
LW00000324-LW00000382
3.
LW00000772-LW00000773
4.
LW00000774-LW00000790
5. LW00000791-LW00000792
6.
LW00000793-LW00000851
7.
LW00000916-LW00000931
8.
LW00001027-LW00001042
9.
LW00001047-LW00001105.
 
Defendant states the
January 2022 Clawback email went inadvertently overlooked and was not noticed
until 13 months later. (See Defendant’s Motion to Compel Production of 2017
Appraisal, hereinafter, “MTCP – 2017 App.”, 8:8-12.) No follow-up email by
Plaintiff was ever sent regarding the request to destroy the designated
documents. (MTCP – 2017 App., 8:8.) 
 
On March 1, 2023,
Plaintiff sent a second Clawback email (the “March 2023 Clawback”) regarding
two documents with the following bates numbers:
 
1.    
LW0002501
2.    
LW0001114-1115
 
(Motion, 8:12-14.)
 
These two documents are at issue in this Motion.  Plaintiff filed Opposition Papers  on May 16, 2023. Defendant filed Reply Papers
on May 22, 2023.  Plaintiff filed an
unauthorized sur-reply brief on May 30, 2023. Defendant filed objections to the
sur-reply on June 8, 2023.  
 
Evidentiary Objections 
 
Plaintiff filed a Surreply and
Supplemental Declaration of Laura Worchell in Support of Opposition to the
instant Motion to Compel Production of the 2017 Appraisal on May 30, 2023.
Defendant filed objections on June 8, 2023, and Defendant filed the subsequent
objections on June 8, 2023.  
 
The briefing on the instant motion
is governed by Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1005(b)-(c). These provisions refer to
“moving papers,” “papers opposing a motion,” and “reply papers,” and set
certain deadlines for filing and serving such papers. 
 
There is no statutory authority for
filing and serving papers after the moving party’s reply papers have been filed
and served, that is, there is no provision for surreply papers. Accordingly,
the Court may disregard Plaintiff’s surreply. (See, e.g., Guimei v. General
Electric Co. (2009) 172 Cal. App. 4th 689, 703; City of Arcadia v. State
Water Resources Control Bd. (2010) 191 Cal. App. 4th 156, 180.) 
 
Additionally, “[P]oints raised for
the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be considered, because such
consideration would deprive respondent of an opportunity to counter the
argument. [Citations.]” (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 128 Cal.App.4th 1522,
1538.) This is the situation presented here, as Plaintiff has no mechanism by
which they can respond to the arguments raised for the first time in Defendant’s
Reply Papers.
 
For these reasons, the Court will
disregard any new arguments Defendant presents in their Reply Papers filed on
May 22, 2023, the Court will disregard the surreply, and declaration filed by
Plaintiff on May 30, 2023, and the Court will disregard the subsequent
objections filed by Defendant on June 8, 2023. 

 
          Legal
Standard 
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.285, subdivision (d)(1), a party that has received electronically
stored information produced in discovery that is later claimed to be subject to
a claim of privilege or of protection as attorney work product, “may seek a determination
of the claim from the court by making a motion within 30 days of receiving the claim
and presenting the information to the court conditionally under seal.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.285, subd. (d)(1).)
 
The objecting party has the burden
to file evidence of the preliminary facts establishing a privilege exists. (HLC
Properties, Limited v. Super. Ct. (2005) 35 Cal. 4th 54, 59.)  “The party asserting the privilege only needs
to present facts which ‘support a prima facie claim of privilege.’ ” (OXY
Resources California LLC v. Super. Ct. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 874, 894.) 
 
After the objecting party meets the
burden to show preliminary facts in support of an attorney-client privilege,
“the burden shifts to the party opposing the privilege to show either the
claimed privilege does not apply, an exception exists, or there has been an
express or implied waiver.” (Venture Law Group v. Super. Ct. (2004) 118
Cal. App. 4th 96, 102.)
 
Discussion
 
“The
attorney-client privilege, set forth at Evidence Code section 954, confers a
privilege on the client ‘to refuse to disclose, and to prevent another from
disclosing, a confidential communication between client and lawyer....’” (Costco
Wholesale Corp. v. Super. Ct., (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 740.) Attorney-client
privilege applies where “…a communication is made in the course of an attorney-client
relationship.” (Id. at 733.) The client is the holder of attorney-client
privilege. “Work produced by an attorney's agents and consultants, as well as
the attorney's own work product, is protected by the attorney work-product
doctrine.” The attorney is the holder of the work-product privilege. (Citizens
for Ceres v. Super. Ct., (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 889, 911.) Code of Civil Procedure
section 2018.030, subdivision (a) further defines attorney work product as “A
writing that reflects an attorney's impressions, conclusions, opinions, or
legal research or theories...” 
                    
First the
Court will address whether the documents at issue are protected by
attorney-client privilege. Defendant contends, and Plaintiff does not contest
that the documents at issue are email communications between Chris St. Denis,
LW Acquisitions’ director of property management and Laura Worchell, one of LW
Acquisitions’ members. (Motion, 10:27-28 and 11:1-2.) Neither party to the
email is an attorney nor a client communicating to an attorney. Therefore, the
documents are not protected by attorney-client privilege.  
 
Second,
the Court will address whether the documents are protected by attorney
work-product privilege. Plaintiff argues that the two documents that are subject
of the March 2023 Clawback are protected by the work product doctrine. The
Opposition Papers argue that the topic of the emails concerns the 2017
Appraisal, which was prepared by a consultant, at the request and direction of
an attorney, Bryan Kravetz, commissioning it to aid him in providing legal
services. (Opposition Papers, 11:6-13.) 
 
Plaintiff,
as the party asserting work product, has the burden of making a preliminary showing
that the work product doctrine applies. 
(League of California Cities v. Super. Ct. (2014) 241 Cal.App.4th
976, 993.)  Plaintiff has not met that
burden.  Its sole evidence on this issue
is the following statement in the declaration of Laura Worchell, a member of
Plaintiff who is not herself an attorney. 
She declares:  “Bryan Kravetz was
an attorney licensed to practice in California. 
He has provided legal services to [Plaintiff] on real estate
matters.  I also have hired Mr. Kravetz to
provide me with legal services and advice relating to business, real estate,
trusts and estates, and tax matters over the past several years.  I understand that, in or about 2017, as part
of the legal services and advice Mr. Kravetz was providing, he hired
Curtis-Rosenthal to prepare an appraisal of the real property located at 7083
Hawthorn Avenue in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles.”  (Worchell Decl. ¶ 2.)  The language “I understand that . . .”
provides no appropriate evidentiary support to the assertion that the appraisal
was part of legal services.  There is no
explanation of how Ms. Worchell knows this or what it means.  
 
It is
entirely unclear from Plaintiff’s submission how the appraisal supposedly
related to legal services at all.  The
appraisal pre-dates this litigation.  These
documents are not even the appraisal, but documents concerning the
appraisal.  Without further evidentiary
explanation, an appraisal would relate to business issues, not legal
issues.  And while it is conceivable that
an appraisal could be commissioned in connection with a non-litigation legal
matter, there is not even an attempt to support or explain how that is the case
currently.  This is different from Mack
v. Super. Ct. (1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 7, at p. 9, where the privilege holder
created the appraisal confidentially to help it litigate a case.  
 
Thus,
Defendant’s Motion to Challenge LW Acquisitions LLC’s
Privilege Clawback related to the March 2023 Clawback is granted. 
 
II. DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO COMPEL
PRODUCTION OF THE 2017 APPRAISAL (filed on 5/3/2023)
 
          Background
 
Plaintiff
inadvertently produced an appraisal to Defendant in November 2021. Plaintiff
realized the inadvertent disclosure on January 7, 2022, and sent an email to
that effect—the January 2022 Clawback.  The
January 2022 Clawback explicitly stated that the documents were being clawed
back and listed the bates-numbers of the clawed back documents. (Declaration of
Andrea Feathers ISO Opposition to Motion to Compel Production of the 2017
Appraisal, hereinafter, “Feathers Dec.”, Ex. A.) The bates numbers on the
documents from the January 2022 Clawback Email are as follows:
 
1.
LW00000287-LW00000302
2.
LW00000324-LW00000382
3.
LW00000772-LW00000773
4.
LW00000774-LW00000790
5.
LW00000791-LW00000792
6.
LW00000793-LW00000851
7.
LW00000916-LW00000931
8.
LW00001027-LW00001042
9.
LW00001047-LW00001105.
 
“LW00000324 –
LW00000382” is the 2017 Appraisal. 
 
Defendant’s counsel
states that he inadvertently overlooked the January 2022 Clawback Email.
(Motion, 8:8-12.) Plaintiff did not send a follow-up email regarding the
request to destroy the designated documents. (Motion, 8:8.) 
 
On February 23, 2023,
Defendant deposed Laura Worchell, Plaintiff’s Person Most Knowledgeable.
(Opposition, 9: 13-15.) When Defendant’s counsel asked, “Did you review a 2017
appraisal?” Worchell answered, “I believe so. But I think that was not part of
this case because it was done by a different attorney, and I think we clawed it
back out.” (Opposition, 9:16-18.)  During
the deposition, Plaintiff’s counsel forwarded a copy of the January 2022
Clawback Email to Defendant’s counsel. (Opposition, 9:25-26.)
 
On March 1, 2023,
Plaintiff’s counsel sent a letter to Defendant’s counsel requesting
confirmation that the clawed-back records were destroyed. (Motion, 10:1-5.) On
March 10, 2023, Defendant’s counsel responded by letter, confirming that the
documents, including the 2017 Appraisal, had been destroyed. (Motion, 10:
9-11.) 
 
Defendant filed the current
Motion to Compel Production of the 2017 Appraisal (“Motion”) on May 3, 2023.
Opposition Papers were filed on May 16, 2023. Defendant replied on May 22,
2023. Plaintiff filed an unauthorized Surreply on May 30, 2023. Defendant filed
objections to the Surreply and the
supplemental declaration within it on June 8, 2023.  
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
Plaintiff filed a Surreply and
Supplemental Declaration of Laura Worchell in Support of Opposition to the
instant Motion to Compel Production of the 2017 Appraisal on May 30, 2023.
Defendant filed objections on June 8, 2023, and Defendant filed the subsequent
objections on June 8, 2023.  
 
The briefing on the instant motion
is governed by Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1005(b)-(c). These provisions refer to
“moving papers,” “papers opposing a motion,” and “reply papers,” and set
certain deadlines for filing and serving such papers. 
 
There is no statutory authority for
filing and serving papers after the moving party’s reply papers have been filed
and served, that is, there is no provision for surreply papers. Accordingly,
the Court may disregard Plaintiff’s surreply. (See, e.g., Guimei v. General
Electric Co. (2009) 172 Cal. App. 4th 689, 703; City of Arcadia v. State
Water Resources Control Bd. (2010) 191 Cal. App. 4th 156, 180.) 
 
Additionally, “[P]oints raised for
the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be considered, because such
consideration would deprive respondent of an opportunity to counter the
argument. [Citations.]” (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 128 Cal.App.4th 1522,
1538.) This is the situation presented here, as Plaintiff has no mechanism by
which they can respond to the arguments raised for the first time in Defendant’s
Reply Papers.
 
For these reasons, the Court will
disregard any new arguments Defendant presents in their Reply Papers filed on
May 22, 2023, the Court will disregard the surreply, and declaration filed by
Plaintiff on May 30, 2023, and the Court will disregard the subsequent
objections filed by Defendant on June 8, 2023. 

 
Legal Standard
 
Any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in
that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. (Code Civ.
Pro., § 2017.010.) 
 
A party claiming
privilege or work product protection may notify any party that received the
information of the claim and of the basis for the claim. (Code Civ. Pro., §
2031.285(a).) Then, the receiving party must “immediately sequester the
information” and either return it and all copies or present the information to
the court “conditionally under seal” for judicial determination of the
privilege or work product claim. (Code Civ. Pro., § 2031.285(b).) Any motion
for judicial determination that challenges the privilege or work product claim
must be made within 30 days after the party received notice of the claim. (Code
Civ. Pro., § 2031.285(d)). 
 
Discussion
 
The
current motion is untimely under the 30 day deadline set by California Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.285(d). Plaintiff’s counsel
sent the January 2022 Clawback on January 7, 2022. (Declaration of Andrea
Feathers ISO Opposition to Motion to Compel Production of the 2017 Appraisal,
hereinafter, “Feathers Dec.”, ¶ 7, Ex. A.)  The filing of this motion by Defendant on May
3, 2023 comes almost four months later, far after the 30-day cutoff.  While Defendant’s counsel states that they
did not notice the January 2022 Clawback, that does not change the fact that
they received notice of the claim, starting the 30-day clock running. 
 
In addition, on February 23, 2023, during
the deposition of Plaintiff’s Most Knowledgeable Witness, after Defendant’s
counsel stated that he was not aware of the January 2022 Clawback, Plaintiff’s
counsel forwarded a copy of the January 2022 Clawback to Defendant’s counsel.
(Feathers Dec. ¶ 7.) Thus, Defendant was on notice of Plaintiff’s work
production protection claim no later than February 23, 2023.  The filing date of this motion comes more
than two months later, even considering this later date.  Thus, under any analysis, the motion is
untimely.  
Defendant attempts to avoid this
timeliness problem by arguing that it is relying on waiver that happened after
the January 2022 clawback.  Most of what
Defendant relies on, however, relates to its own failure to comply with the January
2022 clawback.  Thus, its questioning of
Ms. Worchell stemmed from Defendant’s inappropriate failure to comply with the
clawback.  The Court also does not find
persuasive Defendant’s argument that Plaintiff waived protection by failing to
ensure that Defendant met its responsibility to comply with the January 2022
clawback—that argument attempts to blame Plaintiff for Defendant’s own conduct.  Moreover, Defendant’s waiver argument based
on Ms. Worchell’s pre-deposition review is weak given Ms. Worchell’s errata
explaining why she reviewed it.  Finally,
Defendant specifically attempts to raise in its reply an argument that the
documents are subject to discovery in their own right—an argument that should
have been made within thirty days of the January 2022 clawback.  Couching the argument in terms of “waiver”
appears to be an attempted end-run around the 30-day deadline, rather than a
substantive ground to ignore that deadline. 
 
          
For these reasons, the Court denies
Defendant’s motion. 

 
III.         
PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO DISQUALIFY (filed on 5/5/2023)
 
Background
 
In November 2021,
Plaintiff inadvertently produced an appraisal and related documents to
Defendant. (Motion, 8:4-8.) As discussed above, Plaintiff realized the
inadvertent disclosure on January 7, 2022, and sent the January 2022 Clawback,
explicitly stating that the documents were being clawed back and listing the
bates-numbers of the clawed back documents. (Motion, 8:16-19.) 
 
On February 23, 2023,
Defendant deposed Laura Worchell, Plaintiff’s Person Most Knowledgeable and questioned
her about the 2017 Appraisal. (Motion, 8-9: 24-25; 1-2.) Plaintiff’s counsel
objected to some of the questions based on work product and privilege and
stated that the 2017 Appraisal had been clawed back. (Motion, 9: 2-3.)  Plaintiff’s counsel forwarded a copy of the
January 2022 Clawback Email to Defendant’s counsel. (Motion, 9:4.) Later in the
deposition, Defendant’s counsel marked as exhibits and began asking questions
about two different emails between the deponent and one of her employees that
discussed the 2017 appraisal. (Motion, 9: 7-9.) Plaintiff’s counsel objected,
stating that one of the emails had been part of the January 2022 clawback.
(Motion, 9:9-11.) On March 1, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a letter to
Defendant’s counsel clawing back the other email used in the deposition and
another email in the same email chain—the March 2023 Clawback. (Motion, 9:12-15.)

 
On March 22, 2023,
Defendant’s counsel sent Defendant’s expert a full copy of the deposition,
including one document clawed back in January 2022 and another on March 1,
2023. (Motion, 9:25-27; 10:1-2.) 
 
On May 5, 2023,
Plaintiff filed this motion. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
“‘A trial
court’s authority to disqualify an attorney derives from the power inherent in
every court [t]o control in furtherance of justice, the conduct of its
ministerial officers, and of all other persons in any manner connected with a
judicial proceeding before it, in every matter pertaining thereto.
[Citations.]’ [citation] ‘. . . The paramount concern must be to preserve
public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of
the bar. The important right to counsel of one’s choice must yield to ethical
considerations that affect the fundamental principles of our judicial process.’
[citation]” (Kirk v. First American Title Ins. Co.¿(2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 776, 791-792; citing Code Civ. Pro., §128, subd. (a)(5).)   
 
In ruling on a
motion to disqualify, the court should weigh: (1) the party’s right to counsel
of choice; (2) the attorney’s interest in representing a client; (3) the
financial burden on a client of change of counsel; (4) any tactical abuse
underlying a disqualification motion; and (5) the principal that the fair
resolution of disputes requires vigorous representation of parties by
independent counsel. (Mills Land & Water Co. v. Golden West Refining Co.
¿(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 116, 126.) Whether an attorney should be disqualified is
a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. (Henriksen v.
Great American Savings & Loan¿(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 109, 113.) 
 
Discussion 
 
Disqualification is the proper remedy
when damage that cannot be mitigated is caused by dissemination and use of a
protected or privileged document. (See Rico v. Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 807, 819.) Courts must consider whether reasonably competent
counsel, knowing the circumstances of the litigation, would have concluded the
materials were privileged, how much review was reasonably necessary to draw
that conclusion, and when counsel's examination should have ended. (State
Compensation Ins. Fund v. WPS, Inc. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 644, 656-657.) 
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s counsel Nossaman should be
disqualified because it reviewed protected documents, used them in deposition,
and sent them to an expert. (Motion, 15-17.)  There are no grounds for disqualification of
counsel.  Unlike in Rico v. Mitsubishi,
there was nothing on the face of the documents that told counsel these
documents are work product protection. 
Defendant inadvertently missed a clawback letter, and then promptly
complied with the clawback request when it was brought to Defendant’s attention.  Moreover, the claim of work product for the documents
at issue is dubious at best.   Indeed, the Court has ruled that documents
referring to those earlier documents must be produced in this case because they
are not subject to work product protection. 
The Court does not reach the underlying question on the earlier-produced
documents only because of a timeliness issue. 

 
None of this supports disqualifying Defendant’s counsel, an
extreme remedy.  Plaintiff has not shown
any prejudice.  Accordingly, the Court
denies Plaintiff’s motion. 
 
IV.         
DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF MR. ZORASTER’S 2020 APPRAISAL (filed 5/18/2023)
 
Background 
 
On September 8, 2022, Plaintiff designated David Zoraster (“Zoraster”) as
an expert expected to testify regarding the fair market of the Property.  (Motion, 10:15-17.)  Mr. Zoraster conducted a 2022 appraisal of
the Property that Plaintiff is using to support a fair market value of over $22
million. (Motion, 7:19-20.) 
 
Zoraster also had prepared two 2020 appraisals (the “2020 appraisal”) of
the same Property before there was litigation. 
Defendant already had already been given the 2020 appraisal in the
normal course of negotiations.  (Motion,
10:20-25.)  The issue presented by this
motion is whether Plaintiff must also produce the full file relating to the
2020 appraisal, or whether all or some of it is covered by attorney-client or
work product protection.  
 
Defendant filed the Motion to Compel Production of David Zoraster’s 2020
Appraisal Files (“Motion”) on May 18, 2023. Plaintiff filed its opposition
papers on June 2, 2023. Defendant filed the reply papers on June 8, 2023. 
 
Legal Standard 
 
 “Unless otherwise limited by order of the
court in accordance with this title, any party may obtain discovery regarding
any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in
the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in that action,
if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code Civ. Pro., §
2017.010.) 
 
The work product of an
attorney is not discoverable unless the court determines that denial of
discovery will unfairly prejudice the party seeking discovery in preparing that
party's claim or defense or will result in an injustice. (Code Civ. Pro., § 2018.030 (a), (b).) A writing that
reflects an attorney's impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or
theories is not discoverable under any circumstances. (Code Civ. Pro., § 2018.030(a).) 
 
The attorney is the holder of the work-product
privilege. (Citizens for Ceres v. Super. Ct., (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th
889, 911.)
 


 
Discussion 
 
Defendant
seeks the court to compel production of the complete file relating to two
appraisals performed by Zoraster in April 2020 with respect to the subject
property in this case – the real property located at 7081-7083 Hawthorn Avenue
and 1638 N. La Brea Avenue, in the Hollywood area of the City of Los Angeles –
including, without limitation, draft reports, communications with counsel and
third parties, invoices, time logs, notes, and underlying facts, data, and
records considered to prepare the April 2020 Appraisals.
 
Plaintiff
claims that the April 2020 appraisal and related communications fall under the
attorney work-product protection. The person claiming protection under the
attorney work product doctrine bears the burden of proving the preliminary
facts to show the doctrine applies. (League of Cal. Cities v. Super.
Ct. (2015) 241 Cal. App. 4th 976, 993.)
 
Generally, material of a
derivative character, such as diagrams prepared for trial, audit reports,
appraisals, and other expert opinions, developed because of the initiative of
counsel in preparing for trial, are to be protected as work product. (Mack v. Super. Ct. In & For
Sacramento Cnty.
(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 7, 10.) In contrast, work product protection does not
cover nonderivative materials, which are only evidentiary in character. (Ibid.)
Information regarding
events provable at trial, or the identity and location of physical evidence,
cannot be brought within the work product privilege simply by transmitting it
to the attorney. (Ibid.)
 
1.     2020
Appraisal File Apart From Communications with Counsel
 
Assuming for the sake of argument
that the 2020 appraisal files (apart from communications with counsel) are
entitled to work product protection, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has
waived the work product protection.  Defendant
advances three separate waiver arguments. First, Defendant contends that
because Zoraster used the file to refresh his memory for his April 24, 2023,
deposition, that the documents are no longer privileged per Evidence Code §
771. Second, a waiver of privilege may occur if any holder of the privilege
discloses a significant part of the communication per Evidence Code § 912, and
Defendant contends that the disclosure of the April 2020 Appraisal by Plaintiff
is inconsistent with claiming any protection per Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.
Super. Ct. (2008) 165 Cal.App. 4th 672. Finally, Defendant
argues that injustice will result if denied the file. 
 
Defendant’s arguments
are meritorious.  Work product loses
statutory protection when used as an offensive weapon for cross-examination or
to refresh the recollection of a witness. (Kadelbach v. Amaral (1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 814, 821–22.) Plaintiff,
who chose to designate Zoraster as its testifying expert on an appraisal of
this very Property, is attempting to cut matters too finely under the facts of
the case by withholding Zoraster’s 2020 appraisal files for the same Property.  Here,
Zoraster testified that he reviewed and relied on his April 2020 appraisals to
prepare for and refresh his recollection for his deposition. (Reply, 12: 17-19;
Zoraster Dep. at 20:6-15.)  Moreover,
Plaintiff chose to give the actual 2020 Appraisal to Defendant a long time ago,
and to designate Zoraster as a testifying expert, conduct that is not
consistent with maintaining the confidentiality of the 2020 appraisal files.
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff has
not met its burden of showing that attorney work production protection applies
to the other parts of the file, e.g., the draft reports, invoices,
time logs, notes, and underlying facts, data, and records considered to prepare
the April 2020 appraisal. 
 
Accordingly, apart from communications
with counsel, the 2020 appraisal files must be produced.
 
2.    
Communications
with Counsel 
 
Regarding the communications with
legal counsel, Plaintiff has met its burden of showing that they fall within
the scope of attorney work production protection; further, the Court finds that
they are protected by the attorney work product protection. Per Plaintiff’s
Opposition Papers, Zoraster was hired on February 14, 2020, to prepare two
appraisals for the purpose of assisting counsel with the provision of legal
services, and nearly a year before the current litigation. (Opposition Papers,
9:23-27.) Zoraster was separately retained as a testifying expert in April of
2022; however, in the course of his work as a consultant in 2020, he exchanged
numerous emails with attorneys at Sheppard Mullin. (Opposition Papers, 10:2.)
Plaintiff contends that these emails contain impressions, analysis, and legal
opinions. These are the types of communications and documents that the
work-product privilege aims to protect. “At its core, attorney work product
doctrine shelters mental processes of attorney, providing privileged area
within which he can analyze and prepare his client's case.” (Box v. Super.
Ct. (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 60, 80.)  
 
Moreover, Defendant’s waiver
arguments do not apply with the same force to Zoraster’s actual communications
with counsel as to the 2020 appraisal. 
Those communications also do not have evidentiary value that the actual
appraisal file does.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff may withhold the communications between Zoraster and counsel but must
provide a privilege log showing what documents were withheld.

PLAINTIFF’S
MOTIONS TO SEAL (filed 5/6/2023, 5/9/2023, 5/16/2023 and 5/26/2023)
 
Legal
Standard
 
To seal a document, the
Court must expressly find (1) an overriding interest exists that overcomes the
right of public access to the record; (2) the overriding interest supports
sealing the record; (3) a substantial probability exists that the overriding
interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) the proposed
sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) no less restrictive means exist to
achieve the overriding interest. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d).) An
application to seal must be accompanied by a declaration containing facts
sufficient to justify sealing.  (Cal.
Rule of Court, Rule 2.551(b)(1).)
Further, the party seeking the sealing of documents must identify specific
enumeration of the facts sought to be withheld and specific reasons for withholding
them. (H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe
(2007) 151 Cal. App. 4th 879, 894.)
 
A court must not
permit a record to be filed under seal based solely on the agreement or
stipulation of the parties.   (In re
Marriage of Nicholas (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1566, 1578.)

LLC’s Opposition to LW Acquisitions, LLC’s Motion to Disqualify Nossaman as
Counsel of Record for Defendant 7080 Hollywood, LLC, Plaintiff seeks to seal

LW00002501, which LW Acquisitions’ counsel marked as part of Exhibit 31 to the
April 21, 2023, Deposition of Brad Thompson); and (5) Exhibit D to the
Declaration of David Graeler (Document with the Bates numbers LW0001114-1115,
which contains an email dated June 3, 2019, from Chrisoula St. Dennis).
 
Given
the Court’s rulings of this date, the sealing requests are too broad.  The only items that may be sealed are the
documents contained in the January 2022 Clawback, and not the documents
referenced in the March 2023 Clawback.  To the
extent that any of the papers or documents contain or specifically reference
the documents listed in the January 2022 Clawback, the Court will permit those
portions to be redacted as they have been clawed back and are not ordered
returned.  However, to the extent that
the papers reference the content of the documents in the March 2023 Clawback,
the Court is ordering those documents produced and they may not be filed under
seal.  
Within 30
days, Plaintiff shall file a single motion to seal in accordance with the
guidance above, along with that redact only that small portion.  If Plaintiff does not do so, all the
documents will be unsealed.
