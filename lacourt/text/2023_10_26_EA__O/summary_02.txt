Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Foothill Transit to the complaint filed by Eric Lutz. The complaint alleges that Foothill Transit is vicariously liable for the negligence of the Driver, who struck Mr. Lutz while he was walking and had the right-of-way.

The court finds that the demurrer is OVERRULED in part and SUSTAINED in part. The court agrees that the complaint adequately alleges a cause of action for negligence, but finds that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to support a cause of action for negligent hiring, retention, supervision, and training.

The court notes that the complaint does not allege any statutory basis for the cause of action for negligent hiring, retention, supervision, and training, and that the plaintiff will need to amend the complaint to include such allegations in order to proceed with this cause of action.
