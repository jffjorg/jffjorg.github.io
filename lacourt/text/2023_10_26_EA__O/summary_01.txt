And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Based on the information presented, the judge has tentatively ruled that the petition for a release order is granted, releasing the property from the mechanics' lien of Defendant Pool Logic Design and Construction. However, the judge has denied the plaintiff's request for attorney fees, citing the lack of sufficient evidence to support the claimed $1,500 in fees. The judge notes that an attorney who represents himself is not entitled to recover "reasonable attorney's fees" and that the plaintiff has not provided a declaration from the counsel who helped with the petition, nor has the plaintiff provided the parties' formal, written agreement, which is necessary to establish whether the claimed fees are reasonable.
