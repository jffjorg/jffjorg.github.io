And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case where the plaintiff is seeking to hold Foothill Transit liable for a vehicle accident caused by an employee. Foothill Transit argues that the facts of the case are different from a previous case, Lopez, but the judge notes that it is not the facts that are significant, but rather the legal standard regarding claims against governmental entities. The judge also notes that the issue of whether there exists a statutory provision declaring or defining a public entity's duty of care with respect to the hiring, retention, supervision, or training of employees is not relevant to this case. The judge is reviewing the Vehicle Code and Civil Code sections that relate to liability for public entities and will issue a final ruling after considering all the evidence.
