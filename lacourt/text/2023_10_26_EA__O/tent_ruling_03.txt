[1] Vehicle Code § 17001
provides that a public entity is liable for injury to a person proximately
caused by a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the operation of any motor
vehicle by an employee of the public entity acting within the scope of his or
her employment. 
 


[2] Plaintiff argues
that Lopez is inapposite as the facts are different. As noted by
Foothill Transit in reply, it is less the facts of the case and rather the
legal standard regarding claims against governmental entities that bears
significance.  
 


[3] Foothill Transit
cites to Lopez, but Lopez discussed Civil Code section 2100’s (duty to protect passengers from assaults by fellow
passengers) requirement that the carrier’s
knowledge of conditions from which it may reasonably be apprehended that an
assault on a passenger may occur. Here, however, the duties of carriers is not
at issue. 


[4] And the court need
not reach the issue of whether there exists no statutory provision declaring or
defining a public entity’s duty of care with respect to the hiring, retention,
supervision, or training of employees. (Demurrer p. 7, citing de Villers v.
Cnty. of San Diego (2007) 156 Cal. App. 4th 238, 253.)
