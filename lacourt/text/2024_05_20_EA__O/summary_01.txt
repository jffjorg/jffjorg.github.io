And here is the English-language summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the City of Pomona. The City of Pomona argued that the complaint fails to state a cause of action, citing Vehicle Code section 17004.7(b)(1), which provides immunity from liability for civil damages resulting from the collision of a vehicle being operated by an actual or suspected violator of the law who is being, has been, or believes he or she is being, pursued in a motor vehicle by a peace officer employed by the public entity.

The Court sustained the demurrer on the grounds of immunity, noting that the complaint fails to plead specific facts about the City of Pomona's alleged negligence or omission. The Court also noted that the complaint fails to identify a statute that imposes liability on the City of Pomona.

The Court granted leave to amend, allowing the Plaintiffs to re-file their complaint with specific facts that overcome the immunity afforded by Vehicle Code section 17004.7(b)(1).
