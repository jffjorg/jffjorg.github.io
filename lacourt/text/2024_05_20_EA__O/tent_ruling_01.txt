negligence case. Plaintiffs JUAN ALVARRAN, an individual; AMANDA DOW, an individual;
and LILAH ALVARRAN, a minor through her Guardian Ad Litem JUAN ALVARRAN allege
the following against Defendants CITY OF MONTCLAIR, a public entity and ANTHONY
ALMEDA: On 1/14/2023, Defendant Almeda was being pursued by Police Officer Sean

Legal
Standard[1]
 
The City of
Pomona brings forth the motion pursuant to CCP section 430.10 subdivisions (e)
(failure to state sufficient facts to constitute a COA) and subdivision (f)
(uncertainty). 
 
Discussion
 
The City of
Pomona brings forth the demurrer on the following grounds: 
 
1.     The City of Pomona is immune pursuant
to Vehicle Code section 17004.7(b)(1), see also Ramirez v. City of Gardena (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 811, 818. 
2.     Complaint fails to plead particular
facts about the City of Pomona’s alleged negligence/omission
3.     The complaint fails to identity a
statute that imposes liability on the City of Pomona
4.     The complaint fails to allege
compliance with the Tort Claims Act 
 
1.     Immunity 
 
Vehicle Code
§ 17004.7(b)(1) provides as follows: 
 
(a)  
The
immunity provided by this section is in addition to any other immunity provided
by law. … (b)(1) A public agency employing peace officers that adopts and
promulgates a written policy on, and provides regular and periodic training on
an annual basis for, vehicular pursuits complying with subdivisions (c) and (d)
is immune from liability for civil damages for personal injury to or death of
any person or damage to property resulting from the collision of a vehicle
being operated by an actual or suspected violator of the law who is being, has
been, or believes he or she is being or has been, pursued in a motor vehicle by
a peace officer employed by the public entity. (Veh. Code, § 17004.7(b)(1).)
 
The opposition does not address the statute. To the
extent that Plaintiffs focus on CACI 730, which is used to guide jurors in
determining whether a law enforcement officer's pursuit of a suspect was
conducted with reasonable care, that but supports the City of Pomona’s ultimate
point: the complaint fails to specific facts as to the accident to determine
whether any such action on behalf of the City of Pomona was reasonable. Mere
pursuit of vehicles does not implicate Vehicle Code §17001 as mere pursuit is not
negligent operation of a vehicle. (Reply p. 4, citing Reenders v. City of
Ontario (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1052.) 
 
Thus, absent facts that indicate any negligent operation
of the police vehicle by the police officer, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer on
the grounds of immunity with leave to amend.[2]

 
Though the court need not necessarily address the other
arguments, for the sake of judicial economy/purposes of amendment, the court
will address the other arguments. 
 
2.     Specific Facts as to the City of
Pomona
 
The original complaint is directed at the City of
Montclair. To the extent that Plaintiffs argue that the City of Pomona was
named as a Doe defendant such that the pleading is proper, not so. First, it is
improper to lump allegations against multiple defendants. (See, e.g., Moore v. Regents of Univ. of Cal.
(1990) 51 Cal. 3d 120, 125 n.1 & 134 n.12; Wilson v. Household Fin. Corp.
(1982) 131 Cal. App. 3d 649, 653 [noting that plaintiff cannot allege claim
against defendant HFC by merely lumping it together with the other defendant, as HFC
did not have duties of an insurer].) Pleadings like this that assert
claims against multiple defendants without specifying which defendants are
liable for which acts or omissions make it difficult for Defendants to make
informed responses to a plaintiff's allegations. (See e.g., Harman v. City
and County of San Francisco (1972) 7 Cal.3d 150, 156-57; Semole v.
Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721 [complaint should state the
essential and substantial facts to apprise defendant of the nature of the cause
of action.].)
 
Therefore, as the four corners of the complaint do not
state what the City of Pomona has allegedly done (notably when the City of
Montclair was engaged in the pursuit), the demurrer is also sustained on this
ground with leave to amend. 
 
3.     Statute
 
Plaintiffs assert that the City of Pomona is liable under
Government Code sections 815.2(a) and 820 (vicarious liability), but, as noted
by the City of Pomona, it is unclear how this statute applies when no City of
Pomona employee has even been identified. The opposition does not address this
point. 
 
Therefore, the court sustains the demurrer with leave to
amend for the failure to identify a statute that imposes liability on the City
of Pomona. 
 
4.     Claims Presentation Requirement 
 
Another of the City of Pomona’s arguments is that
Plaintiff’s complaint fails to plead compliance with the tort claims act.
(Demurrer p. 7, citing Gurrola v. County of Los Angeles (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 145, 153; Dujardin v. Ventura County General Hospital (1977)
69 Cal.App.3d 350, 355.) That is true; the four corners of the complaint only
reference a timely Tort Claim filed with the City of Montclair on
February 15, 2023. (Complaint P20.) In Reply, the City of Pomona argues that it
‘never received these claims.” (Reply p. 2:26-27.) But the City of Pomona, by its own concession, has
received the claim. (See Demurrer, Ex. G [email between counsel
dated 4/19/24 at 11:48 PM] [“As discussed, we will be withdrawing our demurrer
based on your office providing copies of the claim forms plaintiffs claim were
mailed to the City of Pomona.”].) 
 
Thus, while leave to amend should be used to allege
that Plaintiffs have complied with the claims act presentation requirement, the
court finds the issue of the filing of the presentation itself to be
moot. 
 
Conclusion
 
All in all, the liability of the City of Pomona is
unclear based upon the lack of facts and should specific facts later be
alleged, they need be enough to overcome the immunity afforded by Vehicle Code
section 17004.7(b)(1). Leave to amend is granted.
