LEGAL STANDARD 
¿¿             
Under both the Federal Arbitration Act and California law,
arbitration agreements are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except on such
grounds that exist at law or equity for voiding a contract. (Winter v.
Window Fashions Professions, Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 943, 947.) The
party moving to compel arbitration must establish the existence of a written
arbitration agreement between the parties. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.) In
ruling on a motion to compel arbitration, the court must first determine
whether the parties actually agreed to arbitrate the dispute, and general
principles of California contract law help guide the court in making this
determination. (Mendez v. Mid-Wilshire Health Care Center (2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 534, 541.) 
 
Once petitioners allege that an arbitration agreement
exists, the burden shifts to respondents to prove the falsity of the purported
agreement, and no evidence or authentication is required to find the
arbitration agreement exists. (See Condee v. Longwood Mgt. Corp. (2001)
88 Cal.App.4th 215, 219.) However, if the existence of the agreement is
challenged, "petitioner bears the burden of proving [the arbitration
agreement's] existence by a preponderance of the evidence." (Rosenthal
v. Great Western Fin. Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413. See also
Espejo v. Southern California Permanente Medical Group (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 1047, 1058-1060.)   
 
 
DISCUSSION¿  
 
Defendant moves to compel arbitration and stay the
proceedings in this matter.
            
I.                  
Existence of Arbitration Agreement
 
“With respect to the moving party's burden to provide
evidence of the¿existence¿of an agreement to arbitrate, it is generally
sufficient for that party to present a copy of the contract to the court. (See¿Condee
v. Longwood Management Corp.¿(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 218, 105
Cal.Rptr.2d 597 (Condee¿); see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1330 [“A
petition to compel arbitration or to stay proceedings pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1281.2 and 1281.4 must state, in addition to other required
allegations, the provisions of the written agreement and the paragraph that
provides for arbitration. The provisions must be stated verbatim or a copy must
be physically or electronically attached to the petition and incorporated by
reference”].) Once such a document is presented to the court, the burden shifts
to the party opposing the motion to compel, who may present any challenges to
the enforcement of the agreement and evidence in support of those challenges.
[Citation]” (Baker v. Italian Maple Holdings, LLC¿(2017) 13 Cal.App.5th
1152, 1160.) 
Defendant
presents evidence that Plaintiff began his employment with Quixote on or about
January 10, 2012. (Nye Decl., ¶ 3.) On June 14, 2019, as a condition of his
continued employment, Plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement (the
“Agreement”). (Id., ¶ 4, Ex. A.) The Agreement provides, in pertinent part,
that: (1) it is a mutual agreement to arbitrate claims arising out of
Plaintiff’s employment (to the extent permitted by law) between Quixote and Plaintiff.
(Nye Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. A.)
As such,
Defendant has shown that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists. 
II.               
Federal Arbitration Act
The¿FAA¿applies
to contracts that involve interstate commerce (9 U.S.C. §§ 1,¿2), but since
arbitration is a matter of contract, the¿FAA¿also applies if it is so stated in
the agreement.¿(See¿Victrola 89, LLC v. Jaman Properties 8 LLC¿(2020) 46
Cal.App.5th 337, 355 [260 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1]¿(“[T]he presence of interstate
commerce is not the only manner under which the¿FAA¿may apply. … [T]he parties
may also voluntarily elect to have the¿FAA¿govern enforcement of the
Agreement”].) 
Here,
Plaintiff's Agreement expressly states it is governed by the FAA. (Nye Decl.,
Ex. A at Sect. 10.) 
As such, the FAA
applies to this matter. 
III.            
Plaintiff’s Claims Are Encompassed by
Arbitration Agreement
Once the Court concludes an
arbitration agreement exists, it must then consider whether the agreement
covers the claims at issue.  (Omar v. Ralphs Grocery (2004) 118
Cal.App.4th
966, 960.) 
Under
the Agreement, Plaintiff agreed to final and binding arbitration of “any
dispute arising out of or related to [Plaintiff’s] application or selection for
employment, employment, and/or termination of employment with [Quixote].” (Nye
Decl., Ex. A at Sect. 1.) The Agreement defines “any dispute” to include, in
part, “disputes arising out of or relating to the application for employment,
background checks, privacy, employment relationship, or the termination of that
relationship (including post-employment defamation or retaliation), trade
secrets, unfair competition, compensation, classification, minimum wage,
expense reimbursement, overtime, breaks and rest periods, or retaliation,
discrimination or harassment.” (Id.) Further, Plaintiff agreed to arbitrate
claims against Quixote’s “affiliates, subsidiaries, or parent companies” and
employees. (Id.) These are the claims that
Plaintiff has made here – all stemming from alleged discrimination, harassment,
defamation, and wrongful termination arising from his employment with Quixote.
(See FAC.)             
Thus, the agreement encompasses
Plaintiff’s claims. As a result, Defendant’s
unopposed motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED. Defendants’
joinder is also granted as Plaintiff agreed to arbitrate claims
against Quixote’s “affiliates, subsidiaries, or parent companies” and
employees. (Nye Decl., Ex. A at Sect. 1.)
Defendant seeks a stay of
the proceedings.  
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.4 provides that if arbitration “of a controversy which is an issue
involved in an action or proceeding pending before a court of this State” is
ordered, the court in which the action or proceeding is pending “shall, upon
motion of a party to such action or proceeding, stay the action or proceeding
until an arbitration is had in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until
such earlier time as the court specifies.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
1281.4.)   
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
request for a stay of the proceedings is GRANTED.  All proceedings are
STAYED pending binding arbitration. 
 
 
CONCLUSION¿ 
 
Accordingly, the motion to compel
arbitration is GRANTED. Defendants’ Joinder is GRANTED. The proceedings of this action are STAYED pending the outcome
of the parties’ arbitration. 
 
Defendant shall give notice.
