  Case Number:  22STCV02689    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  T Motion to Compel DepositionInger Lorre-Wening vs Ryder Truck Rental Inc., et al.Moving Party: Defendants Ryder Truck Rental Inc.; Vitco Distributors Inc.; and Vladimir GonzalezResponding Party: N/ATentative Ruling: GRANTBACKGROUNDThis is a car accident case arising from a March 10, 2020 collision, for which Plaintiff Inger Lorre-Wening (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint seeking damages against Defendants. On July 28, 2023, Defendants filed an answer and initiated discovery, setting Plaintiff’s deposition for November 29, 2023. (Declaration of Robert Thacker, ¶ 2.) Defendants then voluntarily took the November 29, 2023 deposition off calendar and noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for March 13, 2024; Plaintiff failed to appear at the scheduled deposition, and a certificate of non-appearance was taken. (Declaration of Robert Thacker, ¶ 3; Exhibit A.) Defendants re-noticed the deposition for September 17, 2024, but rescheduled Plaintiff’s deposition to October 18, 2024, after Defendants’ counsel were advised that the date was available for Plaintiff. However, Plaintiff failed to appear, and another certificate of non-appearance was taken. (Declaration of Robert Thacker, ¶ 3; Exhibit A.)Defendants have met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel, but Defendants’ counsel have not received any available dates for Plaintiff’s deposition. (Declaration of Robert Thacker, ¶¶ 4-5.) Defendants additionally sent a meet and confer letter on October 29, 2024, but have yet to receive a response. (Declaration of Robert Thacker, ¶ 2.)MOVING PARTY POSITIONDefendants argue the instant motion should be granted on the basis that Defendants are prejudiced by Plaintiff’s failure and refusal to cooperate in the discovery process, and that Defendants are entitled to take Plaintiff’s deposition. (Motion to Compel, p. 2.) Defendants further request monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,050.00 against Plaintiff for the reasonable costs and fees incurred as a result of having to bring this motion. (Id.)OPPOSITIONNo opposition has been filed to this motion.ANALYSISI. Motion to Compel Deposition The Discovery Act allows “[a]ny party [to] obtain discovery . . . by taking in California the oral deposition of any person, including any party to the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) Service of a deposition notice makes attendance by a party deponent and production of requested document mandatory. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) “[T]he deposition proceeding is initiated by notice alone. The statutes confer upon litigants the right to take the deposition in a pending case . . . without prior court order and without a showing of good cause.” (Snyder v. Superior Court (1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 579, 585, see also, Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 388.) If, after receiving notice, a party fails to appear, to answer any question, or to produce any document or tangible thing specified in the deposition notice, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling attendance and production. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) The moving party must show a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution. (Code of Civil Procedure §2025.450(b).) “A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the motion.” (Code of Civil Procedure §2016.040.) Defendants’ motion to compel is justified in this case. Here, Defendants’ conduct reflects good faith efforts to meet and confer with Plaintiff to schedule Plaintiff’s deposition — including rescheduling Plaintiff’s deposition to accommodate days Defendants’ counsel were informed Plaintiff was available. Despite Defendants’ efforts, Plaintiff has failed to appear at her depositions scheduled on March 13, 2024 and October 18, 2024, and continues to fail to respond to Defendants’ communications seeking potential deposition dates. Based on the circumstances presented, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s continued failure to cooperate in the discovery process inhibits Defendants from engaging in discovery they are entitled to, and justifies the Court’s intervention. The Court therefore concludes Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff’s attendance at her deposition is appropriate, and should be granted.II. SanctionsIf the court grants a motion to compel deposition and produce documents, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) Defendants request sanctions, fees and expenses in the amount of $1,050.00 based on three hours preparing and appearing for the instant motion at a $200.00 hourly rate, in addition to $450.00 for the cost incurred for the certificate of non-appearance. (Declaration of Robert Thacker, ¶ 7.) The Court finds Defendants’ hourly rate and number of hours spent with respect to the instant motion are reasonable. Additionally, Defendants are entitled to recover for the $450.00 cost of the certificate of non-appearance. The Court therefore concludes that Defendants may recover sanctions in the amount of $1,050.00.RULINGDefendants’ motion to compel deposition is GRANTED. Deposition is to be completed within 30 days.  Defendants’ request for sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel is GRANTED in the amount of $1,050.00.  Sanctions to be paid within 30 days.
