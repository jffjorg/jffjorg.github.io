  Case Number:  23PSCV01289    Hearing Date:   December 20, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE NAME:  Alexis  Mena, a minor by and through her Guardian Ad Litem, Raymond Mena v. Jesus  Romero, et al.  Petitioner Raymond Mena’s Amended Petition  for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or  Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with a Disability  TENTATIVE RULING  The Court GRANTS Petitioner Raymond Mena’s amended petition for minor’s compromise. The Court  will sign the amended proposed order submitted with the amended petition.  Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s  ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order.  BACKGROUND  This is a dog bite case. On April 28, 2023, plaintiff  Alexis Mena (Claimant), a minor by and through her Guardian Ad Litem, Raymond  Mena (Petitioner), filed this action against defendants Jesus Romero, Maria  Romero (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 to 25, alleging causes of action  for general negligence and strict liability.  On December 21, 2023, Claimant filed a notice of  settlement. On October 11, 2024, Petitioner filed a petition for minor’s  compromise. On December 12, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on the  petition to and directed Petitioner to file an amended petition and new  proposed order by December 13, 2024. On December 13, 2024, Petitioner filed the  amended petition, amended proposed order, and amended order to deposit funds in  blocked account. The amended petition is unopposed.  LEGAL STANDARD Court approval is required for all settlements of a  minor's claim or that of a person lacking the capacity to make decisions.  (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson  v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.) "[T]he  protective role the court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a  role to assure that whatever is done is in the minor's best interests . . . .  [I]ts primary concern is whether the compromise is sufficient to provide for  the minor's injuries, care and treatment." (Goldberg v. Superior Court  (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.) A petition for court approval of a compromise under  Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court  Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner  and contain a full disclosure of all information that has "any bearing  upon the reasonableness" of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of  Court, rule 7.950.) The person compromising the claim on behalf of the person  who lacks capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise  of the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal  appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952(a).) An order for deposit of funds  of a minor or person lacking decision-making capacity and a petition for the  withdrawal of such funds must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.953  and 7.954. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1384; see also Super. Ct. L.A. County,  Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.) DISCUSSION Form MC-350 (Rev. January 1, 2021) The Petition has been verified by Petitioner and  presented on a fully completed mandatory Judicial Council Form MC-350, using  the current January 1, 2021 revision. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  Settlement  Claimant has agreed  to settle this action against Defendants in exchange for $100,000.00, $54,848.73 of which  will go to Claimant. If approved, $33,333.33 will be paid in attorney’s fees, $5,274.98  will be paid for reimbursement of litigation costs advanced by Claimant’s  attorneys, and $6,542.96 will paid for medical expenses, leaving a balance of $54,848.73  for Claimant, to be deposited into a blocked account at Chase Bank.  The Court has reviewed the  proposed settlement and finds the Petition contains a full disclosure of all  information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the settlement  amount to Claimant.  Attorney's Fees  The retained attorney's  information has been disclosed as required by Rule of Court 7.951. (Amended Petition,  ¶ 17, subd. (b).) There is an agreement for services provided in connection  with the underlying claim. (Amended Petition, ¶ 17, subd. (a)(2).) A copy of  the agreement was submitted with the Amended Petition as strictly required by  Rule of Court 7.951(6). (Attach. 17a.)  Petitioner’s counsel seeks to  recover $33,333.33 in attorney's fees. (Amended Petition, ¶ 13, subd. (a),  Attach. 13a.) Counsel has provided a declaration addressing the reasonableness  of the fee request, as required by Rule 7.995, subdivision (c), of the  California Rules of Court, accounting for the factors specified in Rule 7.995,  subdivision (b), of the California Rules of Court. Rule 7.955, subdivision (b),  provides:  (b) Factors the court may  consider in determining a reasonable attorney's fee. In determining a  reasonable attorney's fee, the court may consider the following nonexclusive  factors:  (1) The fact that a minor or  person with a disability is involved and the circumstances of that minor or  person with a disability.  (2) The amount of the fee in  proportion to the value of the services performed.  (3) The novelty and difficulty of  the questions involved and the skill required to perform the legal services  properly.  (4) The amount involved and the  results obtained.  (5) The time limitations or  constraints imposed by the representative of the minor or person with a  disability or by the circumstances.  (6) The nature and length of the  professional relationship between the attorney and the representative of the  minor or person with a disability.  (7) The experience, reputation,  and ability of the attorney or attorneys performing the legal services.  (8) The time and labor required.  (9) The informed consent of the  representative of the minor or person with a disability to the fee.  (10) The relative sophistication  of the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a  disability.  (11) The likelihood, if apparent  to the representative of the minor or person with a disability when the  representation agreement was made, that the attorney's acceptance of the  particular employment would preclude other employment.  (12) Whether the fee is fixed,  hourly, or contingent.  (13) If the fee is contingent:  (A) The risk of loss borne by the  attorney;  (B) The amount of costs advanced  by the attorney; and  (C) The delay in payment of fees  and reimbursement of costs paid by the attorney.  (14) Statutory requirements for  representation agreements applicable to particular cases or claims.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955, subd. (b).)  The Court addresses these factors below.  Amount of Fee in Proportion to  Value of Services Performed  Claimant's counsel contends that  a contingency fee of 33.3% of the sum recovered on behalf of the Claimant is  reasonable based on the amount of work performed in this case, and estimates  having performed more than 40 hours doing that work. (Amended Petition, Attach.  13a, ¶¶ 5-6,  8.)  Novelty and Difficulty  Claimant’s counsel does not  address the novelty or difficulty of this case. (See generally, Amended  Petition, Attach. 13a.)  Amount Involved and Results  Obtained  Claimant’s counsel states that  Defendants will pay a total of $100,000.00. (Amended Petition, Attach. 13a, ¶  3.)  Nature and Length of Professional  Relationship  Claimant’s counsel does not mention  the nature and length of the professional relationship with Claimant. (See  generally, Amended Petition, Attach. 13a.)  Experience, Reputation, and  Ability of Counsel  Claimant’s counsel does not explain  his experience, reputation, or ability. (See generally, Amended Petition, Attach.  13a.)  Time and Labor Required  Claimant’s counsel indicates  having spent more than 40 hours working on this case. (Amended Petition, Attach.  13a, ¶ 6.)  Acceptance of Case Precluding  Other Employment  Claimant’s counsel does not  mention whether acceptance of this case precluded other employment. (See  generally, Amended Petition, Attach. 13a.)  Contingent Fee  Claimant’s counsel states this  case was taken on a contingency basis. (Amended Petition, Attach. 13a, ¶ 2.) The  legal services agreement provides for recovery of a 40% contingency fee, but  Claimant’s counsel reduced the total contingency fee recovery to 33.3% to allow  a larger net recovery, for a total of $33,333.33. (Amended Petition, Attach.  13a, ¶¶ 4-6, 8.)  “California  Rules of Court, rule 7.955 requires a trial court, in determining  reasonable attorney fees, to balance an attorney's interest in fair compensation  with the protection of the interests of a minor client. Thus, a trial court ‘must give  consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made between  the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability  and must evaluate  the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the  agreement was made.’ [Citation.]” (Schulz v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. (2018)  27 Cal.App.5th 1167, 1176-1177, italics in original.)  The Court finds that Claimant’s  counsel has adequately demonstrated the reasonableness of the fee award in  light of the factors and circumstances in this case.  Medical Bills  Claimant has incurred $10,172.28 in  medical expenses, but the medical service providers have agreed to reduce their  liens to a total of $6,542.96. (Amended Petition, ¶ 12, subds. (a)(1), (a)(5).)  Costs  Claimant’s counsel seeks to  recover $5,274.98 in costs that it advanced. (Petition, ¶ 13, subd. (b),  Attach. 13b.)  Amount to Be Paid to Claimant  The net amount to be paid to Claimant  is $54,848.73. (Amended Petition, ¶ 15.)  Disposition of Balance of  Proceeds  Petitioner requests that the net  proceeds, $54,848.73, be deposited into a blocked account at Chase Bank. (Amended  Petition, ¶ 18, subd. (b)(2), Attach. 18b(2).)  Court Appearance  California Rule of Court 7.952  requires attendance by the petitioner and claimant unless the court for good  cause dispenses with their personal appearance. The Court finds that the  appearance of Claimant is not required due to Claimant’s status as a minor.  Petitioner must still appear for the hearing.  Prognosis  Claimant has not recovered  completely from the effects of the injuries, which left scarring. (Amended Petition,  ¶ 8, subd. (c).)  Order Approving Compromise of  Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person with  a Disability (MC-351) & Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account (MC-355)  Petitioner has filed an amended proposed  order for approving the Amended Petition (Form MC-351) and an amended proposed  order to deposit funds in a blocked account (Form MC-355).  Based on the foregoing, the Court finds the settlement to  be fair and adequate, and the Court GRANTS the Amended Petition for Minor’s  Compromise.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Petitioner Raymond Mena’s amended petition for minor’s compromise. The  Court will sign the amended proposed order submitted with the amended petition.  Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s  ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order.
