  Case Number:  23STCV29224    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling: 
Petitions for Approval of Compromise of
Claim or Action for Minors Jayden Robinson, Jaylen Owens, and Logan Johnson 
Petitioner
Jeanne Poole petitions for approval of the compromise of this action on behalf
of her minor children, Jayden Robinson, Jaylen Owens, and Logan Johnson.  Petitioner shows a reasonable compromise of
the action on behalf of the minors.
The
proposed orders, however, do not match the petitions as to the method of disbursing
payments.  On each petition, petitioner
checked box 18.b(5) for payment to a parent of the minor on the terms and
conditions specified in Probate Code sections 3401-3402.  On each proposed order, petitioner checked
box 8.b(1) for checks to be deposited in interest-bearing, federally insured blocked
accounts.  Disbursing the balance via
deposit in blocked accounts requires also filling out section 9 on the proposed
order on Judicial Council form MC-351 and submitting separate proposed orders to
deposit funds in blocked accounts on form MC-355.  
Petitioner
must either submit: (A) amended proposed orders stating in section 8.b(2) that the
balance will be disbursed by check (or other method) directly to petitioner
Jeanne Poole or to plaintiffs’ counsel, or (B) amended petitions with box
18.b(2) checked for payment via deposit to blocked accounts, amended proposed
orders on form MC-351 with section 9 regarding blocked accounts filled out, and
proposed orders on form MC-355.
Petitioner
Jeanne Poole’s petitions for approval of minor’s compromises are denied
without prejudice.
