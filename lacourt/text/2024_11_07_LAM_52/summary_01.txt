And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition for approval of a compromise of a claim or action on behalf of three minor children, Jayden Robinson, Jaylen Owens, and Logan Johnson. The petitioner, Jeanne Poole, has sought approval of the compromise, but the proposed orders do not match the petitions as to the method of disbursing payments. The proposed orders checked box 8.b(1) for deposit in interest-bearing, federally insured blocked accounts, but the petitions checked box 18.b(5) for payment to a parent of the minor on the terms and conditions specified in Probate Code sections 3401-3402. The judge has ordered the petitioner to either submit amended proposed orders stating that the balance will be disbursed by check directly to the petitioner or to plaintiffs' counsel, or to submit amended petitions with box 18.b(2) checked for payment via deposit to blocked accounts, and amended proposed orders on form MC-351 with section 9 regarding blocked accounts filled out, and proposed orders on form MC-355. The petitioner's petitions for approval of minor's compromises are denied without prejudice.
