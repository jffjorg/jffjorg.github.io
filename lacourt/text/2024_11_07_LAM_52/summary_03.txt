And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Jacob David Smith's demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint filed by Chancie Elizabeth Ann Meehan. Smith demurred to the fourth cause of action, which alleges a prescriptive easement to maintain various improvements built on a disputed area of the property. The judge found that Meehan's allegations did not show that the easement would be exclusive or deprive Smith of all or most practical uses of the disputed area. The judge also noted that Meehan's allegations did not specify the size of the disputed area or the improvements, and therefore could not conclude that the easement would be so extensive as to constitute exclusive possession or ownership. The judge overruled Smith's demurrer and ordered him to answer the first amended cross-complaint within 20 days.
