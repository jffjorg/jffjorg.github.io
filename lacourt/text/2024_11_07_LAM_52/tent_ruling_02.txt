 Case Number:  23STCV30656    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative
Ruling: 
            Defendants Ryan Sedghi Horton and
Shoreh Sedghi’s 4 Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses
(1) Requests for Admission
Defendants Ryan Sedghi Horton and Shoreh Sedghi move
to compel plaintiff Donna Morgan to serve further responses to requests for
admission.  After defendants filed this
motion, plaintiff served supplemental responses.  The motion is therefore moot as to compelling
further responses.
Defendants further move for impose $1,780 in
sanctions against plaintiff and her counsel of record.  “The court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though … the requested discovery was provided to the
moving party after the motion was filed.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
Defendants show good cause for monetary sanctions.  “Making, without substantial justification,
an unmeritorious objection to discovery” is a misuse of the discovery process
subject to monetary sanctions.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (e).)  
Plaintiff
made several meritless objections without substantial justification.  For example, request for admission No. 3
asked plaintiff to “Admit that YOU never entered into a written
residential lease agreement with either of these DEFENDANTS for the SUBJECT
PROPERTY at any time.”  Plaintiff initially
responded by objecting that the request “seeks information which is neither
relevant to the subject matter of this litigation nor reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” 
This case is a residential landlord/tenant dispute.  Asking plaintiff to admit she had no written
lease agreement with defendants is reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.
Similarly,
Nos. 35 and 36 asked plaintiff to admit she cashed a $2,075 check from Horton
and to admit the authenticity of a copy. 
Plaintiff again objected that the requests “seek[] information which is
neither relevant to the subject matter of this litigation nor reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  The requests are reasonably calculated to
lead to admissible evidence.  Plaintiff’s
third cause of action alleges defendants violated Civil Code section 1942.4,
which provides, “A landlord of a dwelling
may not demand rent, collect rent, issue a notice of a rent increase, or issue
a three-day notice to pay rent or quit” if the landlord fails to correct a
habitability violation after a notice of violation from a public agency that
enforces housing law.  Asking plaintiff
to admit defendant refunded some of her rent payments is reasonably calculated
to lead to admissible evidence.
The court finds plaintiff did not act with
substantial justification.  Sanctions are
just under the circumstances.  Defendants
reasonably incurred $1,780 in expenses bringing this motion.
(2)
Requests for Production
            Defendants move to compel plaintiff
to serve further responses to requests for production
Nos. 1-59.  A party propounding requests for production may move
to compel further responses if “[a] statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete,” “[a] representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive,” or “[a]n objection in the response is without merit or
too general.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a).)  Plaintiff served
further responses after defendants filed this motion.  In their reply brief, defendants argue all
supplemental responses are insufficient.
Incomplete Statements of Compliance
Plaintiff gave incomplete statements of compliance in
response to Nos. 1-31, 34, 37, 38, 40-43, 47-52, and 58.  “A statement that the party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has been directed will comply
with the particular demand shall state that the production, inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, and related activity demanded, will be allowed
either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the demanded
category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party and to
which no objection is being made will be included in the production.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.220.)
Substantively, plaintiff responded to these requests:
“Plaintiff will produce all responsive documents within her possession, custody
or control to which she makes no objection.” 
Though the response refers to objections, it is incomplete because it
does not clearly state whether she will allow the production in whole or in
part.  The response does not adequately
identify whether plaintiff is withholding any documents based on objections.  When objecting to part of a request for
production, the responding party must “[i]dentify with particularity any
document, tangible thing, land, or electronically stored information falling
within any category of item in the demand to which an objection is being made.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.240, subd. (b)(1).)  Plaintiff’s responses do not identify which
documents, if any, she is withholding.
Representations of Inability to Comply
Plaintiff made incomplete representations of
inability to comply in response to Nos. 33, 35-36, 53-57, and 59.  “A representation of inability to comply with
the particular demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall
affirm that a diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an
effort to comply with that demand.  This
statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is because the
particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been
lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party.  The statement shall set forth the name and
address of any natural person or organization known or believed by that party
to have possession, custody, or control of that item or category of item.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.)
            Substantively,
plaintiff’s responses to these requests state either “This is not applicable to
Plaintiff as no such documents ever existed” or “Plaintiff is unable to comply
as she has no documents as they have never existed to her knowledge, or [were] within
her possession, custody, or control.” 
Neither response includes the required statement that plaintiff made a
diligent search and reasonable inquiry in an effort to comply.  As to documents that were never in her
possession, plaintiff did not identify anyone believed to possess the
documents.  
Meritless Objections
            Plaintiff
made meritless objections in response to requests for production Nos. 32, 39,
and 44-46.  On a motion to compel further
responses, the responding party generally bears the burden of justifying its
objections.  (Fairmont Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) 
Plaintiff does not meet her burden. 
Plaintiff makes no effort to justify most of her objections, including
“attorney-client privilege,” “physician-patient privilege” or “governmental
information privilege.”  Those objections
plainly do not apply to, for example, documents regarding communications with
the property’s prior owner (No. 32) or documents supporting claims for lost
wages (No. 45).  Plaintiff does not
justify any other objections.  As to her
privacy objection, plaintiff does not meet her burden of showing “an objectively reasonable expectation of
privacy in the given circumstances” or “a threatened intrusion that is
serious.”  (Williams v. Superior
Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th
531, 552.)
            Plaintiff’s objections to requests for production Nos.
32, 39, and 44-46 are overruled.  
Sanctions
            Defendants move for $1,995 in sanctions against plaintiff
and her counsel of record.  Plaintiff
unsuccessfully opposed this motion.  She
did not act with substantial justification. 
Sanctions are just under the circumstances.  Defendants reasonably incurred the expenses
they claim.
(3) Form Interrogatories
Defendants move to compel
plaintiff to serve further responses to numerous form interrogatories,
general.  A party propounding
interrogatories may move to compel further responses when an answer “is evasive
or incomplete,” “[a]n exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate,” or “[a]n objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (a).)  Again, plaintiff supplemented
her responses.  Defendants’ reply brief
contends plaintiff must serve further responses to Nos. 2.5-2.7, 2.11, 8.2-8.8, 9.2, 10.1-10.2,
11.1-11.2, 14.2, 17.1, 50.1, and 50.5.
Plaintiff gave incomplete responses to several
interrogatories.  For example, she did
not answer the subparts to form interrogatory Nos. 14.2 and 50.1.
Plaintiff responded to several interrogatories by
referring to documents in her possession. 
She does not adequately show those interrogatories “would necessitate
the preparation or the making of a compilation, abstract, audit, or summary of or
from” documents.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.230.)  Moreover, her responses do
not adequately “specify the writings from which the answer may be derived or
ascertained.”  (Ibid.)  For example, to No. 12.4, plaintiff
responded, “Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.230, Plaintiff will provide any
and all videos relating or pertaining to this request.”
Finally, plaintiff made meritless objections to
numerous interrogatories.  For example,
No. 2.5 asked her to state her residence addresses for the past five
years.  Plaintiff made egregious
boilerplate objections such as that the interrogatory “asks for a legal
conclusion”, “seeks information which is attorney-client privileged,” and
“could call for information or documents protected by the
psychotherapist-patient privilege or physician-patient privilege.”  Plaintiff does not adequately justify any of
her objections.  
Plaintiff’s objections to form interrogatories Nos.
2.5-2.7, 2.11, 8.2-8.8, 9.2, 10.1-10.2, 11.1-11.2, 14.2, 17.1, 50.1, and 50.5
are overruled.  
Sanctions
            Defendants move for
$2,210 in sanctions against plaintiff and her counsel of record.  Plaintiff unsuccessfully opposed this
motion.  She did not act with substantial
justification.  Sanctions are just under
the circumstances.  Defendants reasonably
incurred the expenses they claim.
(4) Special
Interrogatories
            Defendants move to compel further responses to numerous
special interrogatories.  After plaintiff
served supplemental responses, defendants’ reply brief argues plaintiff must
serve further responses to Nos. 4-6, 8-9, 11-12, 14-15, 17-18, 20-21, 23, 28-31, 34-37, 40, 42-43,
45-46, 48-49, 52-54, 56-57, 59-60, 62-64, 74-75, 78, and 81-82. 
Like
the form interrogatories, plaintiff made evasive responses, improper exercise
of the option to produce documents, and meritless objections to these
interrogatories.  For example, special
interrogatory No. 31 asks plaintiff to “IDENTIFY each and every PERSON YOU had
a written residential lease agreement with for the SUBJECT PROPERTY from
January 1, 2019 to the present.”  Plaintiff’s
supplemental response again included objections based on “attorney-client
privilege”, “physician-patient privilege”, “the governmental information
privilege” (twice), “collateral source doctrine, tax privilege, [and]
governmental reporting privilege.”  Plaintiff
does not justify her objections.  
Plaintiff’s objections to special interrogatories
Nos. 4-6, 8-9, 11-12, 14-15, 17-18, 20-21, 23, 28-31, 34-37, 40, 42-43, 45-46,
48-49, 52-54, 56-57, 59-60, 62-64, 74-75, 78, and 81-82 are overruled.  
Sanctions
            Defendants move for
$2,425 in sanctions against plaintiff and her counsel of record.  Plaintiff unsuccessfully opposed this
motion.  She did not act with substantial
justification.  Sanctions are just under
the circumstances.  Defendants reasonably
incurred the expenses they claim.
