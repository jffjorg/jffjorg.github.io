And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Mario Mendoza, Jr. (Moving Defendant) without prejudice. The motion was filed on April 30, 2024, and seeks an order finding the settlement between Moving Defendant and the City of Los Angeles to be in good faith, as well as the dismissal of Toyota Motor North America, Inc.'s (Cross-Complainant) cross-complaint against Moving Defendant. The judge ruled that the motion is premature because Moving Defendant has failed to provide facts or evidence measuring the City of Los Angeles's damages in the underlying case, which is necessary to determine whether the proposed settlement is reasonably within the ballpark based on Moving Defendant's proportional liability. The judge also noted that Moving Defendant has failed to reply to Cross-Complainant's opposition to the motion.
