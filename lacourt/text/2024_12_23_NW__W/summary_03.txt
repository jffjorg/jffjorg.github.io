In English, the judge's tentative ruling is as follows:

The defendant, Kimiko Miller, demurred to the second and sixth causes of action in the plaintiffs' first amended complaint. The judge has reviewed the arguments presented and has made the following tentative rulings:

* The demurrer to the second cause of action for negligence per se is overruled. The plaintiffs are allowed to maintain this cause of action.
* The demurrer to the sixth cause of action for negligent hiring, training, and supervision is sustained, but with leave to amend. The plaintiffs must allege facts sufficient to constitute a claim against Miller for negligent hiring, training, and supervision, including that Miller had a special relationship with the decedent and that her negligence in hiring, training, or supervising Rising Roads employees was a substantial factor in causing the decedent's harm.

The judge notes that the doctrine of negligence per se is not a separate cause of action, but creates an evidentiary presumption that affects the standard of care in a cause of action for negligence. Additionally, a manager or supervisor generally cannot be held liable for negligently supervising an employee, absent a special protective relationship between the supervisor and the plaintiff.
