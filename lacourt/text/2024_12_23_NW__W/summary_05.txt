And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff, Moet Fawaz, alleges that the defendant, Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc., delayed his loan modification application and failed to provide a meaningful opportunity to resolve the loan arrears. The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the defendant violated California Civil Code sections 2923.55, 2923.6, and 2924.17. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient evidence of irreparable harm and a likelihood of prevailing on the merits. As a result, the judge denies the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.
