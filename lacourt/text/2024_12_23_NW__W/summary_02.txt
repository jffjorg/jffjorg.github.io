And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint without prejudice. The motion is denied due to procedural deficiencies. The plaintiff failed to comply with the requirements of the Rules of Court, including attaching the proposed amended pleading and providing adequate detail regarding the amendment. The declaration submitted by counsel was also deemed inadequate. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff has the opportunity to re-file the motion and address the deficiencies noted by the court.
