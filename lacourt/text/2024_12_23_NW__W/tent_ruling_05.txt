BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Moet Fawaz alleges that in late 2023, he
sought a loan modification because his income reduced sharply due to the
economic effects of COVID-19. He claims that Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc.
delayed his application, contradicted themselves, and did not provide
substantive responses, depriving him of a meaningful opportunity to resolve the
loan arrears.

On November 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Ex Parte
Application for the issuance of a TRO/Preliminary Injunction. The court granted
the TRO and set the hearing for preliminary injunction for December 23, 2024.  
 
[TENTATIVE]
RULING:
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Preliminary Injunction is DENIED. 
 
REQUESTS FOR
JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Defendant requests judicial notice of the following:
(1) Notice of Default, recorded on December 26, 2023, Instrument No.
20230905482; (2) Notice of Trustee’s Sale, recorded on May 29, 2024, Instrument
No. 20240349248. 
 
The Court grants the requests. A court may take judicial
notice of the fact of a document's recordation, the date the document was
recorded and executed, the parties to the transaction reflected in a recorded
document, and the document's legally operative language, assuming there is no
genuine dispute regarding the document's authenticity. (Fontenot v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal. App. 4th
256, 265.) From this, the court may deduce
and rely upon the legal effect of the recorded document, when that effect is clear
from its face. (Ibid.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Regarding preliminary injunctions,
both irreparable harm and the likelihood of prevailing on the merits must be
established. (Millennium Rock Mortg.,
Inc. v. T.D. Service Co. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 804, 812.) “The ultimate
questions on a motion for a preliminary injunction are (1) whether the
plaintiff is 'likely to suffer greater injury from a denial of the injunction
than the defendants are likely to suffer from its grant,’ and (2) whether there
is ‘a reasonable probability that the plaintiffs will prevail on the merits’” (Huong Que, Inc. v. Luu (2007) 150
Cal.App.4th 400, 408. Procedurally, an application for a preliminary
injunction, must be based upon sufficient evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc., §527(a); Bank of America v. Williams (1948) 89
Cal.App.2d 21, 29.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show all elements
necessary to support the issuance of a preliminary injunction. (O'Connell v.
Super. Ct. (Valenzuela) (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481.)
Likelihood of Success on the Merits
Plaintiff contends that Defendant did
not contact him to determine an option to avoid foreclosure in violation of
Civil Code section 2923.5. However, in his declaration, he states that he spoke
with an Elizabeth, who encouraged him to pursue an in-house loan modification.
(Decl. Fawaz, ¶ 6.) He further states that he submitted documents to Defendant.
(Decl. Fawaz, ¶¶ 7, 8.) 
Plaintiff also contends that he
submitted a completed loan modification before September 18, 2024, Defendant denied
it on September 18, 2024, Plaintiff then appealed, and Defendant recorded the
Notice of Trustee Sale without issuing an appeal decision. Plaintiff contends
that this violates Civil Code section 2923.6. However, the relevant sections of
Civil Code section 2923.6 apply when a borrower like plaintiff submits a
completed loan modification before a notice of default or notice of sale is
recorded. Here, the notice of default was recorded on December 26, 2023 and the
notice of sale occurred on May 29, 2024. (RJN, No. 1 and 2.) 
Plaintiff does not make a separate
argument regarding Civil Code section 2924.17, which is what Plaintiff alleges
Defendant violated as part of the fourth cause of action. 
Plaintiff has not demonstrated Defendant
violated the Civil Code section 2923.55, 2923.6, and 2924.17. 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff has failed to meet its burden of providing sufficient
evidence in establishing a likelihood of prevailing on the merits
Irreparable Harm
Plaintiff contends they will suffer irreparable harm
if their home is lost to foreclosure. Plaintiff fails to proffer any arguments
or admissible evidence to support its contentions. These averments, without
anything more, are insufficient in establishing irreparable harm. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff has failed to meet
its burden of providing sufficient evidence in establishing a likelihood of
prevailing on the merits and the suffering irreparable harm. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion is DENIED.
