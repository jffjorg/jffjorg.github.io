Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment or adjudication. The ruling is that the defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied, and their alternative motion for summary adjudication is granted in part.

The Judge found that the defendants failed to establish as a matter of law that the alleged oral agreement between Phuong and Diana is invalid under the statute of frauds. The Judge also found that the defendants failed to show that the claimed damages from the purchase of cemetery plots are not triable issues.

The Judge granted the defendants' motion for summary adjudication as to the third cause of action for adverse possession, finding that Phuong's possession of the Property was not adverse as a matter of law. The Judge also granted the defendants' motion for summary adjudication as to the damages claim related to the purchase of cemetery plots.

The Judge denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication as to the first, second, and fourth through ninth causes of action, finding that there are triable issues of fact.

The Judge ordered the defendants to serve notice of the action to Stearns, MERS, and FATC, as they have a secured mortgage lien on the Property.
