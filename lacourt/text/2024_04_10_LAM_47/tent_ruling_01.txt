STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an employment discrimination action. Plaintiff alleges that he
was subjected to extensive harassment by Defendant Gustavo Valencia while they
were both employees at California State University Northridge.
 
Defendant Board of Trustees of the
California State University moves to dismiss the action against individual
Defendant Gustavo Valencia for failure to serve within the three-year period
required by statute. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Defendant Board of Trustees of
the California State University moves to dismiss the action against individual
Defendant Gustavo Valencia for failure to serve within the three-year period
required by statute. 
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section
583.210, subdivision (a) provides that “[t]he summons and complaint shall be
served on a defendant within three years after the action is commenced against
the defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 583.210(a).) An action is “commenced” within
the meaning of the statute “at the time the complaint is filed.” (Id.) Where
service is not made within the time prescribed, “[t]he action shall
be dismissed by the court on its own motion or on motion of any person
interested in the action, whether named as a party or not, after notice to the
parties.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 583.250(a)(2).) The requirements of these statutes
“are mandatory and are not subject to extension, excuse, or exception except as
expressly provided by statute.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 583.250(b).)  
 
            This action
was commenced with the filing of the original complaint naming the Board of
Trustees and Gustavo Valencia as Defendants on September 21, 2020. (See
Complaint.) Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on April 1, 2022, naming
the same parties. (See FAC.) To date, the only proof of service in this action
was filed on November 9, 2022, stating that the Summons and First Amended
Complaint was personally served only on the Board of Trustees on that same
date. (See Proof of Personal Service.) No proof of service has ever been filed
as to Defendant Valencia, and Plaintiff has not responded to this motion
showing that Defendant Valencia was ever served. Because the three-year cutoff
passed on September 21, 2023, the Board of Trustees is entitled to seek
dismissal of this action as to Defendant Valencia as the other named Defendant
in this case. 
            
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss as to Defendant Gustavo Valencia is GRANTED. 
 
            Dismissal
is entered this date as to Defendant Gustavo Valencia. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
Dated:  April 10, 2024                                    ___________________________________

conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
