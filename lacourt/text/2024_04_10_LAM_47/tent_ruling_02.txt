STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an employment discrimination action. Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant failed to provide accommodations for her disability and wrongfully
terminated her for seeking accommodations. 
 
Attorney Greg Garbacz moves to be
relieved as counsel for Defendant. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Greg Garbacz moves to be
relieved as counsel for Defendant. 
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) separately and included a proof of service as required by
California Rules of Court rule 3.1362(d).  Moving
counsel’s declaration states that he served Plaintiff by mail and confirmed the
address was current by telephone and by email. (MC-052 ¶ 3.) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause so long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
Here, trial in this matter is set for July
23, 2024. (MC-052 ¶ 6.) There is a Post-Mediation Status Conference scheduled
for hearing at 8:30 AM on May 23, 2024. (Id. ¶ 5.) The risk of prejudice
to Plaintiff is therefore low due to the relative distance of trial. Moving
Counsel’s declaration states that Defendant has breached a material term of its
agreement with counsel by failing to timely pay for legal services. (MC-052 ¶
2.) In light of the evidence presented and the low risk of prejudice at this
juncture, the Court finds that these circumstances warrant withdrawal.
 
Accordingly, Attorney Greg
Garbacz’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant is GRANTED. 
 
This ruling is conditioned on Moving Counsel giving notice to
all parties of the Court’s ruling. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
