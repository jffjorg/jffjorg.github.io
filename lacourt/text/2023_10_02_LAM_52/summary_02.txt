And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by Equinox Holdings, Inc. (the defendant) to compel Joshua Canady (the plaintiff) to respond without objections to form interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The defendant is seeking an order compelling the plaintiff to respond to the interrogatories and requests for production, as well as monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel.

The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to timely respond to the interrogatories and requests for production, and therefore waived any objections. The defendant is entitled to an order compelling the plaintiff to respond to form interrogatories - general Nos. 1.0 and 2.1 through 2.10, and requests for production Nos. 41-73 without objections.

The judge also finds that the plaintiff did not act with substantial justification in failing to respond to the authorized discovery methods, and therefore sanctions are justified. The defendant is seeking $3,846 in sanctions for the failure to respond to the interrogatories, and $807.50 in sanctions for the failure to respond to the requests for production.

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel responses to both the form interrogatories and requests for production, and orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses without objections to the interrogatories and requests for production within 20 days. The judge also orders the plaintiff and his counsel to pay the defendant $2,518.50 and $807.50 in sanctions, respectively, within 20 days.
