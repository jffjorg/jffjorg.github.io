 Case Number:  22STCV33878    Hearing Date:   October 2, 2023    Dept:  52 Defendant Equinox Holdings, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Responses
Without Objections to Form Interrogatories and Motion to Compel Production of
Documents
            Defendant
Equinox Holdings, Inc. moves to compel plaintiff Joshua Canady to respond
without objections to form interrogatories and requests for production of
documents.  When the responding party
fails to timely respond to interrogatories or requests for production, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling responses.  (CCP §§ 2030.290(b) [interrogatories];
2031.300(b) [requests for production].)  Failing to timely respond waives any objections.  (CCP §§ 2030.290(a); 2031.300(a).)  
Form Interrogatories
            Defendant is
entitled to an order compelling plaintiff to respond to form interrogatories –
general Nos. 1.0 and 2.1 through 2.10 without objections.  On November 1, 2022, defendant served form
interrogatories - general, set one, on plaintiff.  (Tran Decl., ¶ 14, Ex. J.)  Defendant checked the boxes for numerous
interrogatories including Nos. 1.0 and 2.1 through 2.10.  (Ibid.)  
After several extensions, plaintiff
served verified responses to form interrogatories – general, set one on June 5,
2023.  (Tran Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. D.)  Plaintiff’s answers omitted interrogatories
Nos. 1.0 and 2.1 through 2.10.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff instead began with No. 2.11.  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff later served supplemental responses
to form interrogatories – general Nos. 8.8 and 12.4.  (Id., ¶ 10, Ex. H.)  When defendant filed this motion, plaintiff had
“yet to serve any verified responses to the Form Interrogatories – General nos.
1.0 and 2.1 through 2.10.”  (Id.,
p 13.)  
Plaintiff did not timely respond to
form interrogatories – general Nos. 1.0 and 2.0 through 2.10.  He therefore waived any objections to them.
Requests for Production
Defendant is entitled to an order
compelling plaintiff to respond to requests for production Nos. 41-73 without
objections.  On November 1, 2022,
defendant served requests for production, set one, on plaintiff.  (Schmidt Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.)  The request for production demands 73
categories of documents.  (Ibid.)  
After several extensions of the
deadline to respond, plaintiff served verified responses to requests for
production, set one on June 5, 2023.  (Tran Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. D.)  Plaintiff’s response, however, only responded
to request Nos. 1-40.  (Ibid.)  When defendant filed this motion, plaintiff
had “yet to serve any verified responses to Request for Production of Documents
nos. 41 through 73.”  (Id., ¶ 13.)
Plaintiff did not timely respond to
requests for production Nos. 41-73.  He
therefore waived any objections to them.
Sanctions
In
both motions, defendant moves for monetary sanctions against plaintiff and his
counsel.  Failing to respond to an authorized method of discovery is a misuse of
the discovery process subject to monetary sanctions.  (CCP § 2023.010(d).)  Plaintiff did not respond to authorized
discovery.  The court finds plaintiff did
not act with substantial justification and sanctions are just under the
circumstances.  
Defendant moves for $3,846 in sanctions in its
motion to compel responses to form interrogatories.  Defendant did not reasonably incur $3,846 in
expenses.  These expenses include 5 hours
of attorney fees at $295 per hour anticipated to review the opposition and
prepare the reply.  (Tran Decl., ¶
13.)  Plaintiff did not file any opposition.  Defendant filed only a notice of
non-opposition instead of a reply.  The
court therefore reduces the sanctions by 4.5 hours at $295 hourly, resulting in
a total of $2,518.50 in sanctions.
Defendant moves for $807.50 in sanctions in its
motion to compel responses to requests for production.  Defendant reasonably incurred those
expenses.
