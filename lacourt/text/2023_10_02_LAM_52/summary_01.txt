Here is a brief summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment brought by the City of Los Angeles (the "Defendant") against Rocio Moreno (the "Plaintiff"). The Plaintiff claims that she was subjected to whistleblower retaliation when she was reassigned from the Special Events Unit (SEU) to the Digital In-Car Video System Review Unit (DICVU) within the Los Angeles Police Department. The Defendant argues that the reassignment was based on legitimate, independent reasons and not due to the Plaintiff's protected activities. The court has denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of material fact on the elements of materiality, causation, and legitimate, independent reasons. The case will proceed to trial.

The judge has tentatively decided to deny the City of Los Angeles's motion for summary judgment, which sought to have Rocio Moreno's claims of whistleblower retaliation dismissed. The judge found that there are triable issues of fact on whether the City's reassignment of Moreno was an adverse employment action and whether the City's reasons for reassigning Moreno were legitimate and independent.

The judge also sealed certain records filed in support of the City's motion for summary judgment, as they contained confidential personnel records of peace officers. The judge found that the City had shown an overriding interest in sealing the records, as they were required to be kept confidential by law.

The judge's decision is based on the evidence presented by both sides, including testimony from various witnesses and documents submitted in support of the motion for summary judgment. The judge concluded that there are disputes of material fact that need to be resolved through further litigation.

English text:
The summary involves a tentative ruling regarding the Defendant City of Los Angeles’s motion to seal portions of records filed in support of its motion for summary judgment and its motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff’s sole cause of action for whistleblower retaliation under Labor Code section 1102.5. The dispute centers around whether certain records should be sealed, whether plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action, whether retaliation was a contributing factor in the adverse employment action, and whether defendant would have reassigned plaintiff even if she had made no protected disclosures. The court grants the motion to seal records and denies the motion for summary judgment, citing triable issues of material fact on all disputed elements.
