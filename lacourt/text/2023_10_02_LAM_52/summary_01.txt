Here is a brief summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment brought by the City of Los Angeles (the "Defendant") against Rocio Moreno (the "Plaintiff"). The Plaintiff claims that she was subjected to whistleblower retaliation when she was reassigned from the Special Events Unit (SEU) to the Digital In-Car Video System Review Unit (DICVU) within the Los Angeles Police Department. The Defendant argues that the reassignment was based on legitimate, independent reasons and not due to the Plaintiff's protected activities. The court has denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of material fact on the elements of materiality, causation, and legitimate, independent reasons. The case will proceed to trial.
