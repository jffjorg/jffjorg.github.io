And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, CDMY Investment, LLC, argues that the plaintiff, U&G Construction Group, Inc., cannot recover compensation for construction services because the plaintiff's mechanic's lien was extinguished by CDMY's foreclosure sale. The judge agrees with the defendant, finding that CDMY foreclosed on its senior lien and thereby eliminated the plaintiff's junior mechanic's lien. The judge also finds that the plaintiff did not allege sufficient facts to support its claims for quantum meruit and that the plaintiff was not licensed as a contractor at the time it performed the construction services. As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and grants the plaintiff 30 days to amend its complaint.

**English Text Summary:**

The Judge is recommending that the Court grant CDMY Investment, LLC's motion for judgment on the pleadings. This means CDMY would win the case because the Judge found that Plaintiff, U&G Construction Group, Inc., did not properly plead its case.

The Judge ruled that CDMY's foreclosure on its prior lien on the property extinguished U&G's mechanic's lien. Additionally, the Judge found that U&G was not licensed as a contractor during the time it performed the work and therefore cannot recover compensation for its services under California law. 

The Judge has given U&G 30 days to amend its complaint to try to address these issues.
