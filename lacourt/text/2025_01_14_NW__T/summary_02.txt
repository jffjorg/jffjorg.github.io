And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is tentatively ruling that the motion for approval of the Private Attorneys General Act Settlement Agreement is continued. The motion is unopposed, but the judge has identified several issues that need to be resolved before the motion can be approved. These issues include refiling the Settlement Agreement in a text searchable format, submitting the Settlement Agreement to the Labor & Workforce Development Agency (LWDA), providing a discussion of the maximum and realistic recovery figures for each claim asserted in the complaint, and preparing a proposed notice that includes all necessary information. The judge also notes that the Settlement Agreement is missing key information, such as the terms of the settlement, the proposed deductions, and the procedures and deadlines, and that the release in the Settlement Agreement is not verbatim to the releases in the operative complaint. The continued hearing date will be set at a later time, and counsel must file updated/corrected papers by then.
