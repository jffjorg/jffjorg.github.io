 Case Number:  23VECV01421    Hearing Date:   January 14, 2025    Dept:  T 23VECV01421
ZOMORODINIA V HANSOTIA
Ex parte application to continue trial is denied without prejudice.  Gweh v Art Med 25VECV00058 was dismissed on
1/10/2025.  Why the case was dismissed is
unknown to the court but it is presumed that there was no interference by
anyone in this case to cause the dismissal of the other case.  The court notes that the two year period is
coming up.  Because of court congestion,
the court cannot say that this case will start its trial before the two year statute
of limitation.
