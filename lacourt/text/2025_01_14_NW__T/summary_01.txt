Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Steven Romero's motion to tax costs incurred by Defendant Laseraway, LLC. The judge grants the motion in part and denies it in part. The judge grants the motion to tax costs in the following amounts: $4,176.05 from Item 1, $2,377.88 from Item 4, $16,235.22 from Item 5, $409,474.05 from Item 8.b., and $9,899.75 from Item 16. The judge denies the motion to tax costs in all other items.

The judge's ruling is based on several factors, including the fact that Plaintiff's financial condition is not a consideration in determining costs under California law, and that Defendant's 998 offer of $2 million was made in good faith. The judge also finds that certain costs were improperly calculated or duplicated, and that Plaintiff's arguments regarding the reasonableness of certain costs are unpersuasive.

The judge notes that the Court will hear argument on whether to consider the possibility that the Court of Appeal could reverse, order a new trial, and the result could end up in a verdict for plaintiff, or the case could be settled and plaintiff could obtain funds.
