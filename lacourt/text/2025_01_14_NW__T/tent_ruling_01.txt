  Case Number:  21STCV23492    Hearing Date:   January 14, 2025    Dept:  T 21STCV23492 ROMERO V UHAUL [TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Plaintiff Steven Romero’s Motion to Tax Costs is  GRANTED in Part and DENIED in Part.  The motion to tax is GRANTED as to:  $4,176.05 from Item 1; $2,377.88 from Item 4; $16,235.22 from Item 5;  $409,474.05 from Item 8.b.; and $9,899.75 from Item 16.  The motion to tax  costs is otherwise DENIED. Introduction Plaintiff Steven Romero (Plaintiff) moved to Defendant Laseraway, LLC’s  (Defendant) Amended Memorandum of Costs (Memo).  Plaintiff requested that  all costs be denied and/or sought to tax Item 1 (Filing and Motion Fees), Item  4 (Deposition Costs), Item 5 (Service of Process), Item 8 (Witness Fees), Item  12 (Models, Enlargements, and Photocopies), and Item 16 (Other). Discussion Plaintiff first argued that the entire Memo be stricken due to Plaintiff’s  financial condition.  (LAOSD Asbestos Cases (2018)  25 Cal.App.5th 1116, 1127 (LAOSD);   Villanueva v. City of Colton (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1204  (Villanueva).)  However, LAOSD directly contradicts Plaintiff’s contention  that the entire Memo can be stricken based upon Plaintiff’s financial  condition.  (LAOSD, supra, 25 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1124-1126.)   Plaintiff’s financial condition is not a consideration in determining costs  under Code of Civil Procedure, sections 1032 and 1033.5.  Further,  Villanueva is not applicable to the issues presented.  The Villanueva  Court opined that the non-prevailing party’s financial condition can be  considered when determining an award of attorneys’ fees to the prevailing  defendant in an action for violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act  (FEHA).  There is no issue as to any attorneys’ fees under a FEHA  claim.  Plaintiff’s reliance of Villanueva is unfounded.  Defendant  further presented legal authority to dispute Plaintiff’s unsupported  contention.  Because of Plaintiff’s failure to present legal authority to  support the striking of the entire Memo based upon Plaintiff’s financial  condition, the argument is not persuasive.  It is noted that LAOSD opined  that the financial condition of the non-prevailing party can be considered when  determining expert fees claimed under Code of Civil Procedure, section  998.  Review of the non-prevailing party’s financial condition is  expressly limited to determining post offer expert witness fees and is not  applicable to the entire Memo. Plaintiff’s request to strike the entire Memo is DENIED. Plaintiff argued that Defendant’s post offer expert witness fees should be  stricken because Defendant’s offer under Code of Civil Procedure section 998  (998 Offer) was unreasonable and not made in good faith.  (Code Civ.  Proc., sec. 998(c)(1).)  Plaintiff asserted that Defendant’s 998 Offer of  $2 million was nominal in light of the subsequent settlement offer of $6.5  million made during trial.  However, reasonableness of the 998 Offer is  determined at the time it was made.  (Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199  Cal.App.4th 1475, 1484.)  The Court cannot consider the fact that  Defendant made a subsequent and increased offer one year later.  Without  any other facts to show that the $2 million 998 Offer was unreasonable at the  time it was made, Plaintiff failed to show bad faith or unreasonableness.   Plaintiff’s argument to dispute the good faith nature of the $2 million offer  is unpersuasive. The Memo at Item 8.b. provided that post offer expert fees amounted to  $409,474.05.  However, Defendant’s Opposition amended the amount to  $407,527.27.  (Opposition, pg. 8, fn. 4.)  As reviewed above in the  LAOSD case, the non-prevailing party’s financial condition can be considered  when determining post offer 998 expert fees.  Plaintiff provided his  mother’s declaration to show that she is Plaintiff’s non-medical caregiver and  she provided that Plaintiff is a quadriplegic and under 24-hour care and has no  assets or income and reliant upon Medi-Cal.  (Mary Romero Decl. pars.  3-12.)  Defendant failed to address this argument and only disputed that  the Plaintiff’s financial condition cannot be considered in determining the  entirety of the Memo.  The Court agrees with Defendant’s contention, as  reviewed above.  But Defendant did not address specifically the issue of  considered Plaintiff’s financial condition when reviewing post offer 998 expert  fees.  The Court finds good cause in taxing the post offer 998 expert fees  requested in Item 8.b. based upon Plaintiff’s inability to pay the post offer  998 expert fees. While tentatively, the motion to tax Item 8.b. of $409,474.05 is GRANTED, the  court considers whether it should take into consideration the possibility that  the Court of Appeal could reverse, order a new trial, and the result could end  up in a verdict for plaintiff, or the case could be settled and plaintiff could  obtain funds. The court will hear argument on that issue.  The idea behind taking the expert fees is  that plaintiff will never be able to pay them.    Plaintiff argued that Item 8.a. the witness fees for Paul Cory (Cory) in the  amount of $3,053.22 is unrecoverable because he was a party litigant.   However, as argued by Defendant, Cory was dismissed from the action and was not  required to appear at trial.   Plaintiff’s argument as to the witness  fees for Cory is unpersuasive. The motion to tax Item 8.a. is DENIED. Plaintiff argued that Item 4 (Deposition Costs) are unrecoverable because  Defendant failed to provide explanation for the non-appearance fees for Jan  Roughan RN ($615.00) and Timothy Lanning, Ph.D. ($930.20.)  Defendant  argued that the non-appearance fees were for Plaintiff’s experts failure to  appear and was necessary to support Defendant’s motions in limine to exclude  their testimony at trial.  Defendant presented sufficient facts to show  that the fees were reasonable and necessary to support their motions in  limine.  Plaintiff failed to meet their burden to show the  unreasonableness of the cost item.  The request to tax these two costs is  unpersuasive. Plaintiff further argued that Item 4 is not calculated correctly.   Defendant requested $34,164.21.  The Court recalculated the amounts  identified and found Defendant’s calculations to be incorrect.  The  correct total amount is $31,786.33, which included the $615.00 and $930.20  amounts placed into issue above.  The motion to tax Item 4 is GRANTED in Part and the requested amount is  reduced by $2,377.88. Plaintiff argued that Item 5 (Service of Process) is incorrectly calculated  and contained duplicate entries and Plaintiff asserted that $16,235.22 should  be stricken from the amount requested.  (Christopher Bulone Decl. par. 4,  Exh. 2.)  The Memo asserted that Service of Process costs amounted to  $25,403.95 but Plaintiff argued that the amount should be $9,168.73.   Despite Defendant’s contention otherwise, the costs listed in Item 5 were  miscalculated and the correct amount of all asserted costs, including the  duplicated costs, is only $13,353.81. Defendant failed to present any  persuasive argument that $25,403.95, the amount listed in the Memo, is  correctly calculated.  Further, as identified by Plaintiff, the listed  costs contain duplicative entries, despite Defendant’s contention  otherwise.  Plaintiff’s argument as to Item 5 is persuasive. The motion to tax $16,235.22 from Item 5 is GRANTED.  Plaintiff argued that Item 12 (Models, Enlargements, and Photocopies of  Exhibits) requesting $10,775.90 is improper because it only describes the costs  as “Trial Rought Drafts” which were not ordered by the Court and “iPad” which  is vague.  However, as provided by Defendant, the Trial Transcripts were  ordered by the Court and were useful to the trier of fact.  Further, the  iPad provided a Real Time monitor of the proceedings.  The iPad monitor  was requested by the Court. (Scott Davis (Davis) Decl. par. 14.)  The  costs in Item 12 are proper. The motion to tax Item 12 is DENIED. Plaintiff argued that Item 16 (Other) for $9,899.75 is unreasonable because  the mediation fees are not supported by any invoices, trial travel and meal  costs are unrecoverable, and listing “supplies” is uncertain.  Defendant  asserted that travel expenses, meals and supplies were reasonable and necessary  for trial counsel traveling from San Diego.  (Davis Decl. par. 15.)   However, without more information, the costs do not appear proper “on their  face”.  Simply alleging that the costs were for mediation fees,  travel/lodging/meals, and supplies is insufficient for the Court to determine  that the costs are proper “on their face.”  Because the costs do not  appear proper “on their face,” the Memo is not prima facie evidence of their  propriety and the burden is on Defendant to show reasonableness and  necessity.  Without statements or invoices, Defendant failed to meet their  burden.  The motion to tax $9,899.75 from Item 16 is GRANTED.  Plaintiff then argued that there are miscalculations in Item 1 (Filing and  Motion Fees), Item 4 (Deposition Costs), and Item 5 (Service of Process).   In Item 1, the Memo requested $6,762.87 but Defendant’s Opposition submitted to  one improper charged and reduced the amount to $6,232.42.  Despite  Defendant’s contention otherwise, the calculations in Item 1 are found to be  incorrect.  The correct amount should be $3,117.27, without considering  Defendant’s admitted reduction of $530.45.  With the admitted reduction,  the correct calculation totals $2,586.82.  Plaintiff’s argument is  persuasive, and the amount should be reduced by $4,176.05. The motion to tax $4,176.05 from Item 1 is GRANTED. IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
