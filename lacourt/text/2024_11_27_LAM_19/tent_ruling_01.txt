  Case Number:  23STCV16300    Hearing Date:   November 27, 2024    Dept:  19 AXOS BANK v. 7040 VAN NUYS PARTNERSHIP 
TENTATIVE RULING 
Counsel for Defendant
7040 Van Nuys Partnership, LLC’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED. 
However, the
Court cannot sign the proposed order filed on October 29, 2024, because
Sections 2 through 9 are blank. 
Thus, within
five (5) court days, Counsel is ordered to file and serve a complete proposed
judgment that checks box 5(a). 
Counsel is not
relieved as counsel until the revised proposed order is signed by the Court and
proof of service of the signed order on Client is filed with the court. 
The Court sets a
Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Revised Proposed Order for December 6, 2024, at
10:30 A.M. in Department 19 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. 
In California, a
corporation or business entity, such as Defendant 7040 Van Nuys Partnership,
LLC, cannot represent itself (through an owner, corporate employee, director or
officer) and must retain the services of a licensed attorney in order to defend this action. (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141,
1145-1146 (citing Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage Control
Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101–1103).) 
As such, the
Court sets a Status Conference Re: Representation for Defendant 7040 Van Nuys
Partnership, LLC in Department 19 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse on February
26, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. 
Movant to give
notice to all parties.

breach of contract. In the Verified Complaint (the “Complaint”), Plaintiff Axos
Bank (“Plaintiff”) brings suit against Defendants 7040 Van Nuys Partnership, LLC, Jing Ning, Abraham Iny,
and National Glass, LLC (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging the following

Security Agreements Based On Breaches Thereof, And Determination And Recovery Of
Deficiency Under Contractual Guaranty Pursuant to C.C.P. § 726(b) and § 580a;

On February 13, 2024, in

of Receiver and for Preliminary Injunction and appointed a receiver. 
On October 29, 2024, Victor Sahn of Greenspoon Marder, LLP
(“Counsel” or “Movant”), Counsel for Defendant 7040 Van Nuys Partnership, LLC (hereafter,
“Client”), filed the
instant MC-051 “Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel” (the
“Motion”), MC-052 “Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel” (the “Declaration”) and MC-053 proposed order (the “Proposed
Order”). 
DISCUSSION 
A.   
Procedural Requirements 
California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362 prescribes the following requirements of a movant seeking to be relieved
as counsel:
1.    
The notice of motion and motion must be directed
to the client and must use form MC-051 (“Notice of Motion and Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel-Civil”);
2.    
The motion must be accompanied by a declaration
using form MC-052 (“Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved
as Counsel-Civil”) and “must state in general terms and without compromising
the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code
of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1).”;
3.    
A proposed order must be lodged with the court
along with the moving papers and must use form MC-053 (“Order Granting
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel-Civil”) and “must specify all
hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of
trial, if known. If no hearing date is presently scheduled, the court may set
one and specify the date in the order.”;
4.    
“The notice of motion and motion, the
declaration, and the proposed order must be served on the client and on all
other parties who have appeared in the case” either by personal service,
electronic service, or by mail. 
(Cal. R. Ct., 3.1362 (a) – (e).) 
“If the notice is
served on the client by mail under Code of Civil Procedure section 1013, it
must be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either: (A) The
service address is the current residence or business address of the client; or
(B)  The service address is the last
known residence or business address of the client and the attorney has been
unable to locate a more current address after making reasonable efforts to do
so within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved.
(Id. at
3.1362(d).) 
“Current” means that “the address
was confirmed within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved.” (Id.)
“Merely demonstrating that the notice was sent to the client's last known
address and was not returned or no electronic delivery failure message was
received is not, by itself, sufficient to demonstrate that the address is
current.” (Id.) “If the service is by mail, Code of Civil Procedure
section 1011(b) applies.” (Id.) 
Here, Counsel satisfies the
requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Counsel submits the
Motion, Declaration, and Proposed Order using the mandatory Judicial Council
forms. The attached proofs of service indicate that the papers were served on Client
and all parties who have appeared in the matter by mail and electronic mail and
in a manner that satisfies the relevant provisions found in Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1013 and 1011(b). (See Declaration, § 3b.) Counsel has
confirmed Client’s current address. (Id.) 
B.   
Merits 
There are two ways in which an
“attorney in an action or special proceeding may be changed at any time before
or after judgment or final determination:” (1) when both the client and
attorney consent; or (2) when the court orders it upon the client’s or attorney’s
application. (Code Civ. Proc., § 284.) The court has sound discretion to permit
the withdrawal of an attorney. (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court
(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) “The determination whether to grant or deny
a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial
court.” (Id.) 
Withdrawal is generally permitted
unless there is a compelling reason to continue the representation. (Heple
v. Kluge (1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461, 462.) There is a compelling reason
when the withdrawal would prejudice the client, the other parties in the
action, or a third party. (See, e.g., People v. Prince (1968) 268
Cal.App.2d 398, 406; Linn v. Superior Court in and for Los Angeles County (1926)
79 Cal.App. 721, 725.) “Where issues of confidentiality prevent ‘counsel from
further disclosure and the court accepts the good faith of counsel's
representations, the court should find the conflict sufficiently established
and permit withdrawal.’” (Id. (quoting Aceves v. Superior Court
(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 584, 592, citing Uhl v. Municipal Court (1974) 37
Cal.App.3d 526, 527 and Leversen v. Superior Court (1983) 34 Cal.3d 530,
539).) 
Here, Counsel attests that
withdrawal is warranted on the grounds that (1) Client has not communicated
with Counsel for more than one year; (2) the receiver has taken over operations
of the property owned by Client since July 2023 when the Receiver was
appointed; (3) Client's General Partner is Defendant Abraham Iny, who is
presently represented by the law firm of Beitchman & Zekian, P.C.; (4)
Client’s other General Partner is Defendant Jing Ning, who is presently
represented by James Hill and Priya Sopori of the law firm Greenberg Glusker;
(5) Client has not paid Greenspoon Marder's legal bills and has refused to do
so in spite of repeated requests and repeated transmission of the unpaid legal
bills; and (6) additional reasons which are the subject of the attorney-client
privilege. (Declaration at § 2.) 
Based on Counsel’s declaration,
the Court finds that good cause exists for Counsel’s withdrawal and that such
withdrawal will not prejudice Plaintiff or any other party. 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel and will sign the new proposed order
upon receipt.
