And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on a petition. The petition has been denied due to the lack of proof of publication. The Court has already continued the hearing once to give the Petitioner more time to file the proof of publication, but it has still not been done. The petition is dismissed without prejudice, meaning it can be re-filed with the necessary documents. Additionally, the birth certificate of the Petitioner has not been properly filed, and without this document, the Court is unable to determine the parents of the Petitioner. The petition is also dismissed without prejudice, and a new petition can be filed with the required birth certificate. The Court Clerk is to notify all parties of this decision.
