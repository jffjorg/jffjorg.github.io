And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition and dismissed it without prejudice on two grounds. Firstly, the petitioner failed to file proof of publication, despite being given additional time to do so. Secondly, the petitioner has an active outstanding warrant, which they failed to clear before the hearing. The judge has already continued the hearing once to allow the petitioner to file proof of publication, but the petitioner has still not done so. As a result, the petition is denied and dismissed without prejudice. The petitioner has the opportunity to file a new petition and provide proof of publication. The court clerk is instructed to give notice of the ruling.
