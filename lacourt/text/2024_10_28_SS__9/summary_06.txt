And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying and dismissing the petition without prejudice due to the Petitioner's failure to comply with the Court's order. On August 12, 2024, the Court ordered the Petitioner to contact the Name Change Clerk to obtain instructions on how to submit fingerprints for a California Record Review Live Scan and to send the results to the Court Clerk. Instead, the Petitioner filed information from the FBI indicating that they have no prior arrest data, which is insufficient. The Judge notes that the FBI report does not include criminal history from the State or Local level, which is necessary to determine if the Petitioner is a registered sex offender. The Petitioner also failed to submit the fingerprints on the required LASC CIV 226 form. As a result, the petition is denied and dismissed without prejudice.
