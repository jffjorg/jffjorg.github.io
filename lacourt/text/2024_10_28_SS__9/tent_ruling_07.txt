 Case Number:  24STCP01930    Hearing Date:   October 28, 2024    Dept:  9 The petition is denied on the ground
that no proof of publication has been filed. 
The Court has already continued the hearing once to allow Petitioner
additional time to file proof of publication, but Petitioner has nonetheless
failed to file proof of publication.  The
petition is dismissed without prejudice. 
Petitioner may file a new petition and file proof of publication.  
 
In addition, the criminal history
assessment that the Court’s Clerk’s Office has run through CLETS reveals that
Petitioner has an active outstanding warrant. 
Accordingly, on August 12, 2024, the Court continued the instant hearing
for Petitioner to clear the warrant and file proof of such before the continued
hearing.  However, Petitioner failed to
do so.  Accordingly, the petition is also
denied and dismissed without prejudice on this ground.  
 
Court Clerk to give notice.
