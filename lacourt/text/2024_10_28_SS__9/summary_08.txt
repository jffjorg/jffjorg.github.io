And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 24STCP02161. The petition is denied on two grounds: first, the petitioner failed to file proof of publication, despite being given additional time to do so; and second, the petitioner did not submit a criminal history assessment form. The petition is dismissed without prejudice, which means the petitioner can refile the petition and provide the required documentation. The Court Clerk is instructed to give notice of the ruling.
