 Case Number:  24STCP01804    Hearing Date:   October 28, 2024    Dept:  9 On August 12, 2024, the Court
continued the instant hearing and ordered Petitioner to contact the Name Change
Clerk in the Clerk’s Office, who can provide instructions on how Petitioner may
have fingerprints taken for a California Record Review Live Scan
and results sent to the Court Clerk.  Petitioner
did not do so.  Rather, Petitioner merely
filed information from the FBI indicating that Petitioner has no prior arrest
data at the FBI.  This is
insufficient.  The filed fingerprint
submission with the FBI expressly states that criminal history from the State
or Local level is not included.  Such
information is necessary for the Court to determine whether Petitioner is a
registered sex offender or not.  In
addition, the criminal history report was not submitted properly through the
Clerk’s Office on the required LASC CIV 226 form.  
 
Accordingly, the petition is denied
and dismissed without prejudice on this ground. 

 
Court Clerk to give notice.
