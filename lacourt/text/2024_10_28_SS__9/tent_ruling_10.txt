 Case Number:  24STCP02217    Hearing Date:   October 28, 2024    Dept:  9 The petition is denied on the ground
that no proof of publication has been filed. 
The Court has already continued the hearing once to allow Petitioner
additional time to file proof of publication, but Petitioner has nonetheless
failed to file proof of publication.  The
petition is dismissed without prejudice. 
Petitioner may file a new petition and file proof of publication.
 
Moreover, no birth certificate has
been properly filed by Petitioner.  As
such the Court is unable to determine whether Crystal Rayado Jimenez and Ross
Thomas Tiglao are the parents of Petitioner. 
On September 9, 2024 the Court previously continued the motion for
Petitioner to file the birth certificate, but Petitioner failed to do so. The
petition is dismissed without prejudice. 
Petitioner may file a new petition including a birth certificate.
