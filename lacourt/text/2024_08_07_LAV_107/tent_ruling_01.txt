I.               
BACKGROUND
 
On May 23,
2024, Plaintiff Tade Williams filed a complaint against Defendants JNC
Investment Properties, LLC, and Figure 8 PM, Inc., alleging causes of action
for: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of Implied Warranty of
Habitability / Tenantability (CCC Sec. 1941.1 and H&S Code 17920.3 et seq);
(3) Breach of Implied Warranty of Quiet Enjoyment (CCC Sec 1927); (4)
Negligence; (5) Nuisance; (6) Constructive Eviction; and (7) Breach of CCC
1950.5 et seq (Failure to Return Security Deposit). Plaintiff’s Complaint also
seeks a prayer for punitive damages. 
The complaint alleges that Plaintiff signed a lease
agreement with Defendants on or around May 15, 2023 for the property located at
22423 Del Valle St. #102 Woodland Hills, CA 91364. On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff
discovered a roach infestation inside the Property and immediately notified
Defendants of the same. Plaintiff alleges Plaintiff asked Defendants to perform
repair work on cracks and crevices to prevent further roach infestation;
however, Defendants dragged their feet and did not perform this work until
approximately one month later. The complaint further alleges that on June 2,
2023, the roach infestation re-surfaced as Plaintiff began discovering
additional roaches scattered throughout the entire Property. She immediately
notified Defendants of the issue, yet again. The complaint further alleges that
by June 30, 2023, Plaintiff was constructively evicted from the property as a
result of the deplorable conditions.
            On July 12, 2024,
Defendants filed this motion to strike. On July 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition. On July 31, 2024, Defendants filed a reply.
 
II.            
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Any party, within the time allowed
to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part thereof. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435(b)(1).) The court may, upon
a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1)
strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading;
or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436; Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782.)
 
III.          
DISCUSSION
 
Meet
and Confer
 
Before filing a motion to strike, moving party is required to meet and
confer with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to the motion to
strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached
through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5.)
 
The meet and
confer requirements have been met. (Garcia Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
Motion
to Strike
Defendants move to strike
the allegations and prayer for punitive damages, arguing that Plaintiff
fails to allege any facts which would support a claim for punitive damages.
To
support a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must allege facts and
circumstances showing conduct constituting malice, fraud or oppression.¿(Grieves
v. Superior Court¿(1984) 157 Cal. App. 3d 159, 166.) “‘Malice’ means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(1).) Oppressive conduct is defined as
“despicable conduct” that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of a person’s rights. (Code Civ. Proc. § 3294(c).)¿¿
Despicable conduct is “conduct which is so vile,
base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be looked
down upon and despised by ordinary decent people. Such conduct has been
described as ‘having the character of outrage frequently associated with
crime.’” (Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1269,
1287.) 
 
Moreover,
a claim for punitive damages cannot be pleaded generally and allegations that a
defendant acted "with oppression, fraud and malice" toward plaintiff
are insufficient legal conclusions to show that the plaintiff is entitled to an
award of punitive damages. (Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d
864, 872.) Rather, specific factual allegations are required to support a claim
for punitive damages. (Id.)
 
Under
California law, a landlord’s failure to repair can support a claim for punitive
damages. (Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 920.) In Stoiber,
the court found that the tenant had pled sufficient facts to support her prayer
for exemplary damages because she alleged that the landlord had actual
knowledge of the defective conditions in the premises, including leaking
sewage, deteriorated flooring, falling ceiling, leaking roof, broken windows,
and other unsafe and dangerous conditions, and that the landlord failed to
repair them. (Id.)
 
            Here, as in
Stoiber, the allegations relating to Defendants’ failure to repair the
roach infestation are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The
court notes that there are specific factual allegations pled that, if taken as
true, support a claim for punitive damages.
 
IV.          
CONCLUSION 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s motion to strike is DENIED.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
