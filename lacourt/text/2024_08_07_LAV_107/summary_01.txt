And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to strike filed by the defendants in a case brought by the plaintiff, Tade Williams, against JNC Investment Properties, LLC, et al. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their contract, implied warranties, and quiet enjoyment, and engaged in negligence, nuisance, and constructive eviction. The plaintiff seeks punitive damages.

The defendants argue that the plaintiff has failed to allege any facts that would support a claim for punitive damages. However, the court finds that the allegations relating to the defendants' failure to repair the roach infestation are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court notes that the plaintiff has pled specific factual allegations that, if taken as true, support a claim for punitive damages.

The court denies the defendants' motion to strike and orders the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
