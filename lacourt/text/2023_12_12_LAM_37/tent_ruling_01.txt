Background
 
On
July 5, 2020, Plaintiff purchased a 2019 Ram 2500 for the total cash price of
$64,998.09.   on
February 28, 2022, Pedro Ramirez (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against FCA UC
LLC (“FCA”); FAB4 LLC dba Russel Westbrook CDJR; and Does 1 to 50.  The Complaint alleged two causes of action:
(1) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability under the Song-Beverly Act;
and (2) Breach of Express Warranty Obligations under the Song-Beverly Act. 
 
On
June 5, 2023, Plaintiff accepted a Settlement Agreement and Release offered by
Defendant FCA. Plaintiff now moves for Attorney’s Fees. Defendant FCA opposes.
The matter is now before the court. 
 
Motion for
attorney’s fees
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Under Civ. Code § 1794(d), the prevailing party in an
action that arises out of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entitled to
fees that were reasonably incurred:¿ “If the buyer prevails under this section,
the buyer shall be allowed by the Court to recover as part of the judgment a
sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's
fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been
reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code § 1794(d).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
The lodestar method is the primary method for determining a
reasonable attorney fee award under Civ. Code § 1794(d).¿ (See Robertson v.
Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785,
818-19.)¿ “A trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or
lodestar figure, based on the careful compilation of the time spent and
reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney involved in the presentation of
the case.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1321 [internal quotations omitted].) “The reasonableness of attorney fees
is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a
consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity
of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time
involved.¿ [citation] The court may also consider whether the amount requested
is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan
(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)¿ “The basis for the trial court's calculation
must be the actual hours counsel has devoted to the case, less those that
result from inefficient or duplicative use of time.”¿(Horsford v. Board of
Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359,
395.)¿“The law is clear, however, that an award of attorney fees may be based
on counsel's declarations, without production of detailed time records.”¿(Raining
Data Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
In
the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed that Plaintiff could seek both
attorney fees, by motion, and costs. (Kohen Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. 3.)  Plaintiff now moves for an order awarding
$30,130.00 in attorney’s fees, costs in the amount of $1,099.94, and a
multiplier of 1.1 in the amount of $3,013.00. The total amount requested is
$34,242.94 for about 68 hours of work. (Kohen Decl. Ex. 1.) 
 
On
March 16, 2023, Defendant offered to repurchase the subject vehicle and pay any
additional expenses incurred in compliance with the Song-Beverly Act.  (Skanes Decl., ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff, however, never followed up.  (Id., ¶ 7.)  Instead, Plaintiff then served multiple
discovery requests. 
 
On
May 19, 2023, Plaintiff rejected FCA’s repurchase offer that would have
resulted in recovery of $13,629.02 and the pay off the $52,496.05 loan in
exchange for the surrender of the subject vehicle. (Kohen Decl. ¶ 10, Ex. 9.)
The June 5, 2023, settlement gave Plaintiff $22,000.00 plus the right to
maintain possession of the subject vehicle, valued at $57,500.00. (Kohen Supp.
Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 10.)[1]

 
 
A.        Reasonable Hourly Rates 
 
In setting the hourly rate for an
attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “fees
customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar
work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th
976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by
Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664; see also Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009 [“[R]ate
determinations in other cases, particularly those setting a rate for the
plaintiffs' attorney, are satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market
rate.”].)¿¿¿ 
 
Plaintiff requests an hourly rate of $535.00 for Issac
Kohen and $285.00 for Tamara R. Imber.  (Kohen
Decl. Ex. 1.) Since 2012, Kohen has been practicing lemon law and litigating
cases against various manufacturers. (Kohen Decl. ¶ 15.) Imber has been
practicing law lemon law since she graduated from law school in 2021. (Id.
at ¶¶ 17, 18.)
 
In support of the
requested fee rates, Plaintiff’s counsel relies on the Laffey Matrix and his personal
experience of other lawyers charging rates between $500.00 and $650.00. (Kohen
Decl. ¶¶ 21, 22.) Plaintiff’s counsel also submits previous court orders
approving Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate ranging from $525.00 to $500.00 per
hour. (Id. ¶ 23, Ex. 4 to 8.) Kohen also asserts that Imber’s hourly rate
ranging from $275 to $285 has also been approved. (Id. ¶ 24, Ex. 4, 8.)
Exhibit 4 shows that in May 2023, a court approved an hourly billing rate of
$400.00 for Kohen and $265.00 for Imber. (Id. Ex. 4 at p. 3:1-7.) In
April 2023, another court approved Kohen’s billing rate at $525.00 per hour and
Imber’s rate at $225.00 per hour. (Id. Ex. 8.) 
 
Given that the billing
rates for Plaintiff’s counsel were approved at lower rates in 2023, the court
agrees that the billing rates for Plaintiff’s counsel here are somewhat high.
The court sets Kohen’s reasonable hourly rate at $500.00 per hour and Imber’s
at $250.00 per hour. 
 
B.
       Time Reasonably Spent on the
Litigation
 
“‘In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.’ ” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez¿(2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488, citing Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163¿Cal.App.4th¿550, 564.) The court
will exercise its discretion in determining if Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees
request is reasonable by considering the following factors: the nature of
litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in handling
the matter, the attention given, the success or failure, and the resulting
judgment. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.)¿ 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel asserts that they reasonably spent about
68 hours litigating this action. Defendant argues that the time spent
litigating this action was excessive as there were no discovery disputes, no
depositions taken, no motions filed, no vehicle inspections, and there was no
trial preparation. 
 
Although a prevailing party’s verified billing
invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed
were necessarily incurred, Defendant has successfully challenged the billing
entries below as being excessive, unnecessary, and unreasonably incurred.¿ (Hadley
v.¿Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “A prevailing buyer has the burden of showing that the fees incurred
were allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and
were ‘reasonable in amount.” (Morris v.
Hyundai Motor America¿(2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 34.) Plaintiff failed to address the billing entries
challenged by Defendant such that the court cannot find that they were
necessary or reasonably incurred.  
 
Defendant seeks a reduction of 38 hours for: 1) billing for
communications (4 hours); 2) overbilling on form pleadings (21.5 hours); 3)
excessive overbilling on this motion (6.5 hours; and 4) speculative time spent
on the reply and in preparation for the hearing.  
 
                        i.          Communications and Email
Correspondence 
 
Defendant opposes the
practice by Plaintiff’s counsel of billing in .25 increments as opposed to .10
increments when drafting and reviewing email communications. Defendant argues
that 8.25 hours spent on “communications” and “email correspondence” should be
reduced by half. 
 
The court agrees that
a deduction is warranted, and that Kohen should have spent 4.25 hours on
“communications” and “email correspondence.” Therefore, 4.0 hours will be
subtracted from the lodestar.  
                        
                        ii.         Time Spent on Discovery and Meet and
Confer
 
Defendant argues that
Plaintiff’s billing for 6.25 hours for drafting written form discovery is
excessive, particularly as the discovery was recycled from a previous case.
(Skanes Decl. ¶¶ 8-10.)  Defendant argues
that Plaintiff’s counsel should recover only 1.5 hours drafting discovery.
 
The court finds that
Plaintiff may recover 3 hours of Ms. Imber’s time and .75 of Mr. Kohen’s time
for discovery, and thus deducts .5 hours from Mr. Kohen’s and 2 hours from Ms.
Imber’s time.     
 
                        iii.        Meet and Confer Letter
 
Defendant argues that
the 3.5 hours billed by Imber, and the .5 hours billed by Kohen on July 28,
2022, for the meet and confer letter was excessive because it was nearly
identical to the Meet and Confer Letter served by Kohen’s office in other lemon
law cases. (Skanes Decl. Ex. E, F.)
 
The court finds that
the .5 hour billed by Kohen was reasonable, but that Imber should have spent at
most 1.5 hours drafting the meet and confer letter.  The court deducts 2 hours from Ms. Imber’s
time.     
 
                        iv.        Duplicative and Block Billing
 
Defendant
argues that on July 26 and 27 and August 2 and 11 of 2022, both Imber and Kohen
billed for reviewing Defendant’s discovery responses and document production,
suggesting it took 13.25 hours (10.25 hours for Imber and 3 hours for Kohen) to
review straight-forward discovery responses. 
 
The court agrees that
deductions are warranted and deducts 2 hours from Kohen’s billing entries, and
5 hours for Imber, for reviewing Defendant’s discovery responses. 
 
                           v.         Time Spent on Fee Motion 
 
Plaintiff seeks 12 hours to prepare this motion, to prepare
the reply brief, and attending the hearing. 
“[T]ime expended by attorneys in obtaining a reasonable fee is
justifiably included in the attorneys' fee application, and in the court's fee
award.” (Serrano v. Unruh¿(1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 631.) However, “[a] fee
request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting
the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Id. at p.
635.)¿ 
 
Defendant argues that
the 8 hours spent to draft this fee Motion is excessive and should be reduced
as given that the time spent does not include the time requested to draft a
reply and attend the hearing.   
 
Given Kohen’s
experience in lemon law litigation, the court agrees that it should not have
taken more than 6 hours to draft this initial Motion, including supporting
Declaration and exhibits. It should only have taken Plaintiff’s counsel 3 hours
to review the opposition, draft a reply, and appear at the hearing for this
motion. 
 
Moreover, Defendant
does not oppose Plaintiff’s costs so the 1 hour estimated for Mr. Kohen to draft
the memorandum of costs is not necessary. Accordingly, 5 hours will be
subtracted from the lodestar. 
 
C.        Request for Multiplier
 
The lodestar amount
“may be adjusted by the court based on factors including (1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award.”¿ (Bernardiv. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379,
1399, citing Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)¿ The
purpose of any lodestar and the increase thereto “is intended to approximate
market-level compensation for such services” and is entirely discretionary.¿
(Id.)¿“The purpose of a fee enhancement is not to reward attorneys for
litigating certain kinds of cases, but to fix a reasonable fee in a particular
action.”¿ (Weeks v. Baker & McKenzie (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1171-72.)¿¿¿¿
 
Plaintiff’s counsel
requests a multiplier of 1.1 or $3,013.00 on the basis that Plaintiff’s counsel
took this case on a contingency fee basis with no guarantee of recouping the
costs expended in bringing this action. Moreover, Plaintiff’s counsel asserts
they were precluded from other employment and the skill displayed by counsel
resulted in a favorable outcome. 
The
court finds there is no reasonable basis to award a multiplier because the time
and skill of counsel, as well as the contingent nature of the representation,
are compensated with attorney fees. Plaintiff’s counsel failed to show how this case is
different from other lemon law actions or presented new or complex issues that
made this case particularly hard to litigate.¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request to award a multiplier is denied. 
 
D.        Reasonable Costs and Expenses
 
A prevailing party in litigation may recover costs, including
but not limited to filing fees. (CCP §1033.5(a)(1).¿Under CCP § 1033.5(c)(2),
allowable costs are only recoverable if they are “reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation.” Even mandatory costs, when incurred unnecessarily,
are subject to CCP § 1033(c)(2). (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 245.)¿ CCP § 1033.5(c)(4) provides
that “[i]tems not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon application
may be allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.”¿(CCP §
1033.5(c)(4).)¿¿¿¿ 
 
As Defendant does not
dispute the costs, Plaintiff’s request for costs in the amount of $1,099.94 is
granted. 
 
E.        Adjusted Lodestar
 
Plaintiff’s
unadjusted lodestar was $34,242.94, composed of $30,130.00 in attorney’s fees,
costs in the amount of $1,099.94, and a multiplier of $3,013.00. 
 
The
court deducts 11.5 hours from the 43 hours billed by Kohen, billed at a
reasonable hourly rate of $500.  (31.5
hours x $500= $15,750.)  The court deducts
9 hours from the 25 hours billed by Imber at a rate of $250.00 per hour (16
hours x $250 = $4,000).   
 
Therefore,
after adjusting the hourly rate of Plaintiff’s counsel to a reasonable hourly
rate, the total attorney’s fees incurred is $19,750.00. 
 
The
adjusted lodestar is $19,750.00 since no multiplier is awarded. Therefore, the
court grants Plaintiff’s Motion for attorney’s fees in part, in the amount of $19,750.00
and $1,099.94 in costs. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney’s fees is granted in part. Plaintiff is awarded attorney’s
fees in the sum of $19,750.00 and $1,099.94 in
costs. No multiplier is awarded
