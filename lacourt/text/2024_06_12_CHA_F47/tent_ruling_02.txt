RULING: The petitions are denied.
 
On 5/6/24, Plaintiffs Stephanie Patino (Stephanie), a
minor, by and through her Guardian ad Litem, Juliana Carrillo, and Tatiana Patino
(Tatiana), a minor, by and through her Guardian ad Litem, Juliana Carrillo,
filed this action against Defendants Jack Thomas Yacovone and John A. Yacovone
(Defendants) alleging one cause of action for negligence.  No proof of service on Defendants for the
summons and complaint has been filed and Defendants have not appeared in this
action.
 
On 5/17/24, only 11 days after the action was filed, using
the same reservation number, Plaintiffs filed two petitions to approve the
compromise of the claims of the minors. 
No proofs of service for the petitions have been filed.
 
The petitions were signed by the petitioner, the minors’
mother and guardian ad litem, on 4/3/24, more than a month before this action
was filed.  (See Petitions, p.10).  Additionally, the petitions indicate that
several other individuals involved in the accident, including the minors’
mother and guardian ad litem, who are not parties to this action, are also
receiving substantial settlement funds from Defendants as a result of the
accident.  The petitions incorrectly
indicate that the petitioner, the minors’ mother and guardian ad litem, is a
plaintiff in the same action.  (See
Petitions, No.11.b.(3); Complaint, generally).
 
Based on the foregoing, it appears that this action was
filed for the sole purpose of filing the instant petitions.  However, the Los Angeles County Court Rules (LASC
Local Rules), Rule 4.115(a) provides that the proper court to approve a
settlement where no action is pending the probate court, as provided in Probate
Code 2505(b) and 3500.  As such, minors’
counsel should have sought approval of the settlements of the minors’ claims in
the probate court rather than file this civil action which was settled before
it was filed.      
 
Even if this Court was the proper Court for seeking
approval of the settlements of the minors,  the issue of lack of service of the action and
petitions on Defendants would preclude the Court from approving the settlements
at this time.  Additionally, if the Court
were considering the petitions on their merits, the Court notes that the both
petitions include costs of $65.00 for “Minors Compromise Hearing Fee” when no
filing fee for such petitions is charged by the court as evidenced by the
reservation receipts attached to the petitions. 
(Petitions, No.13.b.).  Also, as
noted above, minor’s counsel has improperly used the same reservation number
for two separate petitions.  Further, the
Court finds that the amount of attorneys’ fees requested from Tatiana’s
settlement to be  excessive, especially considering
the considerable attorneys’ fees counsel expects to receive from the other
settlements arising from the same accident. 
Therefore, the Court would reduce such the attorneys’ fees in relation
to Tatiana to $1,250.00.
