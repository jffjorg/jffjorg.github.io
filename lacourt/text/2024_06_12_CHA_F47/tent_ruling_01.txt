MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 4/3/24.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Justin Zarcone
CLIENT: Plaintiff Martin Willerford
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving attorney
Justin Zarcone as counsel for Plaintiff Martin Willerford in this action.  
 
RULING: The motion is denied without
prejudice.  
 
On 4/3/24, attorney Justin Zarcone filed the instant
motion seeking an order relieving him as counsel for Plaintiff Martin
Willerford in this action.  
 
No proof of service for the motion has been filed.  See CRC 3.1362(d).  In the declaration filed in support of the
motion, attorney Zarcone indicates that he has been unable to confirm the
client’s address after calling the client’s last known telephone number and
contacting two close friends of the client. 
Even if the Court found the foregoing efforts to be sufficient, there is
no proof of service indicating that the motion was served on the client at his
last known address.  Additionally, there
is no proof of service indicating that the motion was served on the other
parties in the action.  
 
Additionally, a proposed order has not been lodged with
the motion as required.  See CRC 3.1362(e).
