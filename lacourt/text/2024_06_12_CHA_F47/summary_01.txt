And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by attorney Justin Zarcone, seeking an order to relieve himself as counsel for plaintiff Martin Willerford. The judge ruled that Zarcone failed to provide proof of service for the motion, indicating that the motion was served on the client at his last known address. Additionally, there was no proof of service provided for the other parties in the action, and a proposed order was not lodged with the motion. The judge denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that Zarcone can refile the motion and address the defects if he can demonstrate that the defects are cured.
