And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Arthur Goldberg. The motion was filed after Defendant Goldberg was hospitalized and unable to appear for the deposition, which was originally scheduled for October 6, 2023. Defendant Goldberg offered alternative dates for the deposition, but the plaintiff did not meet and confer to reschedule the deposition. The court finds that the plaintiff has not been diligent in seeking to depose Defendant Goldberg and that the motion is denied. The court also awards sanctions against the plaintiff's counsel in the amount of $1,050, to be paid to the defendant.
