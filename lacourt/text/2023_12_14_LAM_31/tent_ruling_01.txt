MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
LGT
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Arthur
Goldberg

I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On December 9, 2019, Plaintiff, LGT, a minor, by and through
her guardian ad litem, Ernest Calhoon, initiated this legal malpractice action against
Defendants, Arthur Goldberg, Kurt E. Bier, Kenneth Skipper-Dotta, an Working
People’s Law Center.
 
            On September
21, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant Goldberg with a Notice of Deposition which
also included requests for production of documents. The deposition was noticed
for October 6, 2023.  Defendant Goldberg
agreed to appear.  On September 27, 2023,
defense counsel notified Plaintiff that Defendant Goldberg had been recently
hospitalized and would be unable to appear for the October 6, 2023
deposition.  Defense counsel offered
dates of October 11, 12, and 13 as alternative dates for Defendant Goldberg’s
deposition.  
 
            Instead, on
October 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Defendant Goldberg’s
deposition.  On November 16, 2023,
Plaintiff filed this amended motion to compel. 
Plaintiff requests sanctions against Defendant Goldberg.
 
            On December
1, 2023, Defendant Golberg filed an opposition. 
Defendant Goldberg requests sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel.  
 
            On December
7, 2023, Plaintiff filed a reply.
                         
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS
 
Any party may obtain discovery by
taking in California the oral deposition of any person.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.010.)  “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action…without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(a).)   
 
            Monetary
Sanctions¿ 
¿ 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court
to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿¿ 
 
            “If
a motion under [Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450] subdivision (a) is
granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and
against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless
the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)¿¿¿¿ 
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24
Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions against a party, which are based
on the party's misuse of the discovery process, monetary sanctions against the
party's attorney require a finding the ‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ”
(Ibid.) “It is not enough that the attorney's actions were in some way
improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).)
Because an attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her]
knowledge,” the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not
counsel discovery abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking
sanctions against an attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the
discovery process, the burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or
she did not recommend that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni, at p.
262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.) 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff is
not entitled to an order compelling Defendant Goldberg to appear for
deposition.  As Defendant Goldberg points
out, his deposition has been noticed on two occasions in a case that was filed
over four years ago.  The first
deposition, noticed in August of 2022, ultimately did not go forward.  The second deposition, noticed on September
21, 2023, and which is the subject of this motion, was set for October 6,
2023.  Due to health issues requiring
hospitalization, Defendant Goldberg notified Plaintiff before the deposition
date that he would be unable to appear. 
Defendant Goldberg also offered three alternative dates—October 11, 12,
and 13—for the deposition to go forward. 
However, instead of meeting and conferring on any alternative date,
Plaintiff filed this motion to compel. 
This background makes clear that Plaintiff has not been diligent in
seeking to depose Defendant Goldberg. 
Plaintiff does not address why Defendant Goldberg’s proposed dates were
unacceptable, or otherwise show the efforts Plaintiff made to reschedule his
deposition. 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that he agreed to the alternative dates, but only with stipulation of
all Defendants.  However, Plaintiff does
not describe the terms of the stipulation. 
The Civil Discovery Act does not provide such a requirement.  The motion is denied.
 
            Monetary
Sanctions
 
            The parties
each request imposition of sanctions.  Given
the foregoing, sanctions are  warranted against
Plaintiff’s counsel.  In the context of a
motion to compel a party’s deposition, sanctions are warranted.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)  Pursuant to Hennings, imposition of
monetary sanctions against counsel is proper unless counsel shows that he or
she did not counsel the discovery abuse.  (Hennings, 58 Cal.App.5th at p. 81.)  Plaintiff’s counsel does not, and cannot, meet
his burden. Accordingly, sanctions are appropriate against Plaintiff’s counsel
in the sum $1,050, consisting of 3 hours at defense counsel’s hourly rate.  
            
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            The motion
is Denied.  
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is Denied.
 
Defendant Goldberg’s request for sanctions is Granted.  Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff’s counsel
in the sum of $1,050, to be paid to Defendant, by and through his counsel.
 
Moving party to give notice, unless waived.
