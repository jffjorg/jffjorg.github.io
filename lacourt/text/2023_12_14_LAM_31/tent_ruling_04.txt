MOTIONS
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO 
REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
John Cadusale
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Alameda
Restaurant, LLC, et al.
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            This is a
wrongful termination action.  On August 7,
2023, Plaintiff, John Cadusale, filed these motions to compel Defendants, Alameda
Restaurant LLC, Noypitz Bar & Grill LLC, Lauro Calonzo, and Wokcano
Cerritos, LLC, to provide responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of
Documents, Set One.  Plaintiff seeks
sanctions against Defendants.
                                                     
            Defendants
filed Oppositions.[1]  Plaintiff filed Replies. 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD TO COMPEL DISCOVERY
RESPONSES 
 
            If a party
to whom inspection demands were directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order to compel responses without
objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).)¿ Failure to timely serve
responses waives objections to the requests.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a).)¿¿¿¿  
 
            Monetary
Sanctions 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to
impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿ 
¿ 
            If the
court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel
responses to inspection demands, the court “shall impose a monetary sanction .
. . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)  In the context of a motion to deem requests
for admission admitted, it is mandatory that the court impose monetary
sanctions on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to the request necessitated the motion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24
Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions against a party, which are based
on the party's misuse of the discovery process, monetary sanctions against the
party's attorney require a finding the ‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.)
“It is not enough that the attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns
v. Miller (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).)
Because an attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her]
knowledge,” the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not
counsel discovery abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking
sanctions against an attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the
discovery process, the burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or
she did not recommend that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni, at p.
262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            As a
threshold matter, Plaintiff argues Defendants have not served verified
responses or produced any documents responsive to the production demands.  However, Defendants attach to the Oppositions
verified responses to Plaintiff’s discovery. 
The proofs of service show that the responses were served on May 28,
2023.  In his Reply, Plaintiff attaches
meet and confer letters which confirms that Plaintiff received responses.  In the meet and confer letters, Plaintiff
takes issue with Defendants’ responses, describing them in part as
unverified.  However, based on the evidence
before the Court, Defendants served verified responses on May 28, 2023.  To the extent Plaintiff takes issue with the
responses, his recourse is to file a motion to compel a further response.
 (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(b).)  
            
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motions
to compel responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, is Denied.  
 
            The request
for sanctions is Denied. 
 
Moving party to give notice.

MOTION
FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
John Cadusale
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Lauro Calonzo
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On June 15,
2021, Plaintiff John Cadusale (“Cadusale”) filed the instant action against
Defendants, Alameda Restaurant LLC, Noypitz Bar & Grill LLC, Lauro Calonzo
(“Calonzo”), and Wokcano Cerritos, LLC. 
Plaintiff worked as a waiter and server for Defendants prior to bringing
this action for wrongful termination.
            
            On June 26,
2023, Calonzo filed a Cross-Complaint against Cadusale and his counsel, Ronald
Yoosefian (“Yoosefian”), alleging causes of action of (1) Civil Extortion, (2)
Fraud, (3) Breach of Settlement Agreement, (4) Malicious Prosecution, (5) Abuse
of Process, (6) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, (7) Negligence,
(8) Cal. Rules of Professional Conduct [3-200] Violation, (9) Business and
Prof. Code Violation, and (10) RICO/Hobbs Act Violation.  The Eighth and Ninth Causes of Action are
asserted against Yoosefian only.  All
other causes of action are asserted against Cadusale.  Calonzo is represented by counsel.  However, Calonzo filed the Cross-Complaint in
pro per.
 
            Cadusale
and Yoosefian each filed an anti-SLAPP motion to strike the
Cross-Complaint.  Cadusale’s motion
targeted all causes of action asserted against him.  On October 31, 2023, the Court issued a
ruling granting Cadusale’s anti-SLAPP motion.  As such, the Cross-Complaint was dismissed
with prejudice as to Cadusale.  Cadusale
sought recovery of attorney’s fees. 
However, because Cadusale’s counsel[2]
did not seek a specific amount nor list his hourly rate and the time expended
on the motion, the Court directed Cadusale to move for attorney’s fees in a
later filed motion.
            
            On November
15, 2023, judgment was entered in favor of Cadusale as to Calonzo’s
Cross-Complaint.  On the same day,
Cadusale filed this motion for attorney’s fees.
            
            Calonzo and
his attorney each filed Oppositions.[3]  Cadusale has not replied. 
                                                                                                   
II.        LEGAL STANDARD AND DISCUSSION 
 
            A
prevailing defendant on an anti-SLAPP motion is entitled to recover their
attorney’s fees and costs.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.
(c)(1).)  Cadusale, as the prevailing cross-defendant, requests attorney’s
fees of $9,000.00 for 15 hours of legal services at $600 per hour plus $94.29
in court costs.  (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, p. 3:1-10; Mosesi Decl., ¶¶¿16-18.)
Whether the fees requested are reasonable is analyzed using the lodestar
approach, which calculates the number of hours reasonably spent on the case
multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.  (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) 
 
            Attorney Henrik
Mosesi (“Mr. Mosesi”) requests a $600 hourly rate, a figure he bases “on my
twenty six years of legal experience practicing civil litigation in California.” 
(Mosesi Decl., ¶ 18.)  Based on the Court’s own knowledge of and
familiarity with rates in the relevant community, it finds that a $600 rate is
reasonable for an attorney of Mr. Mosesi’s experience working on the present
matter.  
 
            Calonzo’s
counsel argues the fee should be reduced for lack of adequate
justification.  
 
            The Court
has also reviewed the 15 hours requested.  (Mosesi Decl., ¶ 16 [15 hours
for “conducting legal research on CCP 425.16 and litigation privilege; preparing
the verified answer; drafting the special motion to strike along with the
supporting documents: drafting a short reply to the opposition which I was
never served outlining the late nature and improper nature of the opposition,
appearing remotely for the hearing on my client’s motion.”].)  The Court
finds that the hours requested are not reasonable.  The issues were not novel or complicated.  Given these circumstances, the Court will
reduce the hours requested to 12.
 
            Calonzo’s
counsel next argues that the fee should be reduced in equity because Calonzo
filed the Cross-Complaint in pro per.  If
Cadusale had met and conferred with Calonzo prior to filing the anti-SLAPP
motion and explained the defects with the Cross-Complaint, Calonzo would have
withdrawn the pleading.  However,
Calonzo’s counsel concedes there is no requirement to meet and confer prior to
the filing of an anti-SLAPP motion.  
 
            Calonzo has
also filed an opposition to this motion in pro per.  He argues, in part, that this motion is
premature because two of his causes of action—the Eighth and Ninth Causes of
Action asserted against Mr. Yoosepian—survive. 
This argument lacks merit.  All
causes of action against Cadusale were struck.  That was the purpose of Cadusale’s
anti-SLAPP motion.  That Calonzo’s causes
of action against Mr. Yoosepian may survive is not a proper basis to reduce or
otherwise deny the fees incurred for the preparation of Cadusale’s anti-SLAPP
motion.
 
            Accordingly,
the Court awards Cadusale the sum of $7,294.29 in attorney’s fees, i.e., 12
hours reasonably spent on the case times $600 per hour plus $94.29 in
costs. 
 
III.      CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
John Cadusale’s Motion for Order Awarding Attorney’s Fees and Costs Under C.C.P.
§ 425.16(c)(1) is GRANTED in the amount of $7,294.29.
 
Moving party to give notice.
