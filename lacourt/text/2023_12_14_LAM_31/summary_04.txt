And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on two motions in this case. The first motion is to compel defendants to provide responses to discovery requests. The judge finds that defendants did serve verified responses to discovery requests, and therefore the motion is denied. The judge also denies the request for sanctions.

The second motion is for attorney's fees. The judge grants the motion and awards the plaintiff the sum of $7,294.29 in attorney's fees. The judge reduces the number of hours requested by the plaintiff's counsel from 15 to 12, and finds that the hourly rate of $600 per hour is reasonable. The judge also rejects the defendant's argument that the fee should be reduced because the defendant filed the cross-complaint in pro per.
