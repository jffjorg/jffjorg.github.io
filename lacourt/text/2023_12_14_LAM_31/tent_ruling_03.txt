[1] Dismissed from this action on
September 21, 2022.


[2] Collectively referred to as “Sony
Entities” in this ruling.


[3] All UMF references are to Defendants’
Separate Statement of Undisputed of Material Fact filed 5/3/2023.


[4] In their opening supplemental
brief, Defendants state that SP Entertainment was asked to remove the bike rack
by Remote Broadcasting, Inc., the producer of “The Goldbergs” television show.
(Defendants’ Supp. Brief, p. 3.)  Nonetheless,
SP Television was billed for the work.   


[5]  It is unclear how Lot, Inc. can own the real
property on which the Studio Complex is located, while at the same time SP Studios,
which leases the real property from Lot, Inc. also “owns” the “grounds” at the
Studio Complex.  (Compare UMF 5 with UMF
7.)


[6]
 Moreover, it is not entirely clear that SP
Entertainment acted as an independent contractor.  Certain evidence supports that
conclusion:  SP Entertainment billed SP
Television.  But as stated in Defendants UMF 11, SP Entertainment and its employees manage, operate, and
provide services to SP Studios, SP Television, and Lot, Inc.  How and in what context those services are
provided is unstated and undeveloped.  Plaintiff
does not challenge Defendants’ contention that it acted as an independent
contractor, other than remarking at the last hearing that trying to sort out
the various Sony Defendants roles is like trying to nail jelly to the wall.  Plaintiff does no present or develop an
argument based on the proposition that SP Entertainment did not perform the
work as an independent contractor. 
Consequently, the Court proceeds with its analysis based upon the
premise that SP Entertainment acted as an independent contractor when its
employees removed the bicycle racks.       
 


[7] Defendants do not challenge the
third element.
