And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which concerns the removal of bike racks by SP Entertainment and the subsequent billing of SP Television for the work. The judge notes that it is unclear how Lot, Inc. can own the real property on which the Studio Complex is located while also leasing it to SP Studios, which "owns" the "grounds" at the Studio Complex. The judge also questions the role of SP Entertainment, which billed SP Television for the work, but also managed, operated, and provided services to SP Studios, SP Television, and Lot, Inc. The judge concludes that SP Entertainment acted as an independent contractor and proceeds with its analysis based on this premise.
