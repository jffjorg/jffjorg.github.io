And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by JR Johnnys Limo Services Inc. The demurrer is overruled without prejudice. The case arises from an alleged motor vehicle accident on July 9, 2019, and the plaintiff filed a complaint, which was answered by defendant Ruben Petrosyan. JR Johnnys Limo Services Inc. is in default, and as a result, it cannot file pleadings or take any other affirmative steps in the litigation. The Judge finds that the demurrer does not dispose of an entire cause of action, and therefore, it is overruled without prejudice. The Judge intends to issue a final ruling after considering any opposition or reply to the demurrer.
