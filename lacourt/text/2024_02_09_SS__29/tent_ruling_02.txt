 Case Number:  20STCV34696    Hearing Date:   February 9, 2024    Dept:  29 Demurrer filed by Defendant JR Johnnys Limo Services Inc.

 
Tentative
The
Demurrer is overruled without prejudice.
Background
This case arises out of an alleged motor
vehicle accident on July 9, 2019.  On
September 11, 2020, Plaintiffs Garush Manukyan and Oleh Yatsyshyn filed the Complaint
in this action asserting causes of action for motor vehicle negligence against
Ruben Petrosyan and Does 1 through 10.
On November 18, 2020, Defendant Ruben
Petrosyan filed his answer.
On June 27, 2022, the Court approved a
stipulation submitted by the parties granting leave to Plaintiff to file a First
Amended Complaint (the “FAC”).  According
to the stipulation, among other things, Defendant Ruben Petrosyan had died a “few
months ago.”  
Plaintiffs filed the FAC on May 10, 2023.  In the FAC, Plaintiffs name as defendants JR
Johnnys Limo Services, Inc. (“JR”) and Does 1 through 10.  
On January 3, 2024, default was entered against
JR.
On January 10,
2024, JR filed this demurrer.  Plaintiffs
filed an opposition on January 25, and JR filed a reply on February 2.
Legal
Standard
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the
function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and
for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are
assumed to be true. (Id.)  
A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116
Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co.
(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].)  
A demurrer can be utilized where the
“face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that
would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001)
94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of the complaint” includes
material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into
the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v.
Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and
accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the
pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]).  
A demurrer can only be sustained when it
disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) 

Meet and Confer Requirement
"Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).)
This requirement is satisfied here.  (Tabrisky
Decl., ¶ 4.)
Discussion
Defendant is in default.  A party in default cannot “file pleadings” or
take any other “affirmative steps in the litigation until either its default is
set aside or a default judgment is entered.” 
(Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-386;
see also 1 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before
Trial (2003), ¶ 5:116 [“The only motion [a defendant in default] can file
is a motion to be relieved from default or to set aside the default judgment if
judgment has been entered.”].)
Accordingly, the Court overrules the demurrer
without prejudice.
Conclusion
The Court OVERRULES
the demurrer without prejudice.
Plaintiffs are to
give notice.
