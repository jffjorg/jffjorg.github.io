  Case Number:  19STCV39617    Hearing Date:   February 9, 2024    Dept:  29 Tentative:
 
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the
guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.  
 
By minute order dated January 16, 2024, the Court stated that although
the overall settlement and the requested attorney’s fees are fair and
reasonable, there remains one set of issues regarding the distribution of the
net settlement proceeds.  
 
The Petition filed on February 2, 2024, does not resolve that
issue.  Petitioner does not establish
that mother is the guardian of claimant’s estate or provide other authority for
the proposed distribution of $15,000 to mother. 
As an alternative, to obtain approval of the settlement, Petitioner may
wish to propose distribution of the net settlement proceeds into a blocked
account and make a request for withdrawal of funds from the blocked account,
with a sufficient showing to support the request for withdrawal.
 
The hearing is continued to allow Petitioner to address this
remaining issue.
 
Moving party to give notice.
