And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The plaintiffs, Michelle Alexis Cruz, Aaron Michael Fuentes, and Dominic Liam Fuentes, filed a complaint against Ruth V. Rakayla and Does 1 through 100 on May 3, 2021. The case was set for an OSC re dismissal for failure to file proof of service of summons and complaint on May 9, 2023. However, the plaintiffs did not appear, and the court dismissed the action without prejudice. On November 9, 2023, the plaintiffs filed this motion to set aside the dismissal. The judge finds that the dismissal occurred due to counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect due to poor health. The judge also finds that the motion was filed diligently, six months after the dismissal. Therefore, the motion to set aside the dismissal is granted. The court sets aside the dismissal and sets an OSC re dismissal for failure to file proof of service, or in the alternative a Trial Setting Conference, on April __, 2024. Additionally, the court orders counsel Ramin Ray Kohanarieh to pay $250 to the State Bar Client Security Fund and file proof of payment with the court within 30 days.
