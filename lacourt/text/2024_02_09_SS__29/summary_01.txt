And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the upcoming hearing scheduled for February 9, 2024. The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call instead. The court has reviewed the petition filed on February 2, 2024, and has determined that it does not resolve the issue of distributing the net settlement proceeds. The court suggests that the petitioner propose an alternative distribution plan, such as placing the funds in a blocked account and requesting withdrawal with sufficient justification. The hearing is continued to allow the petitioner to address this remaining issue, and the moving party is required to give notice.
