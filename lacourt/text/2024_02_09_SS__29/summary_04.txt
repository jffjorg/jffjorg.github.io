And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff, Robert Joiner, had alleged a cause of action for negligence against the defendant, Terrence Lloyd Hutchinson, stemming from a motor vehicle collision in 2019. The court had previously dismissed the case without prejudice due to the plaintiff's failure to appear for a non-jury trial. The plaintiff then filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, which was denied. The plaintiff has now filed a motion for reconsideration, which the judge has denied. The judge's ruling is based on the court's discretion to relieve a party from a judgment due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, as well as the court's inherent authority to vacate a default and default judgment on equitable grounds. The judge has determined that the plaintiff has not satisfied the stringent three-part formula for setting aside a default judgment based on extrinsic mistake.
