On March 20, 2023, Seeley filed an answer to Yarbrough’s first  amended complaint.  C.   The Court relates and consolidates the cases  On  May 17, 2022, the Court found that case numbers 21STCV40815 and 21STCV43711 are  related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).  Case number 21STCV40815 became the lead case.  The cases were assigned to Department 28 at the Spring Street Courthouse for  all purposes.  On  May 18, 2022, the Court ordered cases numbers 21STCV40815 and 21STCV43711consolidated  and assigned to Department 28 in the Spring Street Courthouse for all purposes.  The Court designated 21STCV40815 as the lead case.  D.   Post-consolidation proceedings  On  June 7, 2024, the Court granted Seeley’s motion for summary judgment on  Yarbrough’s first amended complaint.  On  July 11, 2024, Edison filed a notice of settlement.  On  August 7, 2024, the Court dismissed Edison’s complaint with prejudice at Edison’s  request.    On August 9, 2024, the Court entered judgment  for Seeley on Yarbrough’s first amended complaint.  On  August 20, 2024, the Court dismissed Yarbrough’s action with prejudice at  Yarbrough’s request.  On  August 29, 2024, Seeley served notice of entry of the August 9, 2024 judgment.  E.   Yarbrough’s motion to strike or tax costs  On September  3, 2024, Seeley filed a memorandum of costs.   The memorandum of costs requested:  Filing  and motion fees:                        $935.00 Jury  fees:                                             $150.00 civil deposit Deposition  costs:                                 $2,374.91 Service  of process:                               $1,735.00 Fees for electronic filing or service:     $336.00 Total  costs:                                          $5,530.91 On  September 16, 2024, Yarbrough filed a motion to strike and tax costs.  The motion was set for hearing on October 28,  2024.  On October 15, 2024, Seeley filed  an opposition.  On October 22, 2024, Yarbrough  filed a reply.  The Court continued the  hearing to December 18, 2024.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Yarbrough  asks the Court to tax or strike the costs listed in Seeley’s memorandum of costs.  Seeley  asks the Court to deny the motion.  LEGAL STANDARD  “Except  as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a  matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).)  “ ‘Prevailing party’ includes the party with  a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a  defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a  defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against  that defendant.  If any party recovers  other than monetary relief and in situations other than as specified, the  ‘prevailing party’ shall be as determined by the court, and under those  circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not and, if  allowed, may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides  pursuant to rules adopted under Section 1034.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.  (a)(4).)  “A  prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs  within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment or  dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date  of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180  days after entry of judgment, whichever is first. The memorandum of costs must  be verified by a statement of the party, attorney, or agent that to the best of  his or her knowledge the items of cost are correct and were necessarily  incurred in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.)  Code  of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivisions (a) and (b), list recoverable  and non-recoverable costs.  Subdivision  (c) of the statute provides in part:  “An award of costs shall be subject to the following:  “(1) Costs are allowable if incurred, whether or not  paid.  “(2) Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to  the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to  its preparation.  “(3) Allowable costs shall be reasonable in amount.  “(4) Items not mentioned in this section and items  assessed upon application may be allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,  subd. (c)(1) to (1)(4).)  “The  losing party may dispute any or all of the items in the prevailing party’s  costs memorandum by a motion to strike or tax costs.”  (R. Fairbanks et al., Cal. Practice Guide:  Civil Trials and Evidence (Rutter 2022) ¶ 17:517, p. 17-94.)  “If the items [in the memorandum of costs]  appear on their face to be proper charges, the verified memorandum of costs is  prima facie evidence of their propriety, and the burden is on the party seeking  to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.”  (Id., ¶ 17:526, p. 17-96.)  “On the other hand, items that are properly  objected to are put in issue, and the burden of proof is on the party claiming  them as costs.”  (Ibid.)  DISCUSSION  A.   Meet and confer  Yarbrough  argues that Seeley’s costs are unreasonable because Seeley did not meet and confer  with Yarbrough before filing its motion for summary judgment.  Yarbrough cites no authority to support this  argument and the Court considers it waived.  B.   Electronic filing fee  Yarbrough  argues that Seeley failed to show it actually incurred the $336.00 fee for electronic  filing or service.  In  response, Seeley provides evidence that it incurred the electronic filing fees.  Seeley argues that it is actually entitled to  $422.18 in costs for electronic filing fees but listed $336.00 in its  memorandum of costs due to a typographical error.  Seeley has not moved to amend its memorandum  of costs.  The Court  denies Yarbrough’s motion to strike or tax Seeley’s request for $336.00 in  costs for electronic filing fees.  C.   Proof of service fee  Yarbrough  argues that the $1,735.00 fee for service of process is “unreasonably inflated.”  According to Yarbrough, there was “no need  for personal service” because he had authorized electronic service and he  should not be responsible for the fee for service of process on the other  parties.  Seeley  responds that Yarbrough never advised or agreed that he would accept electronic  service in lieu of personal service.  (The  Court’s file does not contain a consent to electronic service filed by  Yarbrough.)  In addition, Seeley argues,  when Seeley personally served the motion for summary judgment on Yarbrough,  Seeley was also required to properly and timely serve the motion on the parties.  Yarbrough  argues that other parties agreed to accept personal service, making personal  service of the summary judgment motion on those parties unnecessary.  On May 9, 2022 and September 9, 2022, Blanchette  filed requests that the other parties serve notices and documents by electronic  service unless personal service was required.  Seeley was not required to personally serve the motion for summary  judgment on Blanchette.  Therefore, the  Court taxes $459.00 (the fee for personal service of the summary judgment moving  papers on Blanchette’s counsel) from the memorandum of costs. At the hearing on Yarbrough's motion, Yarbrough's counsel established that even though Edison did not file a consent to receive electronic service with the Court, Edison served a consent on Seeley.  The Court therefore taxes $399.00 (the fee for personal service of the summary judgment moving papers on Edison) from the memorandum of costs. At the hearing on Yarbrough's motion, Yarbrough's counsel also established that a proof of service was inadvertently submitted twice, resulting in a duplicative cost of $17.22.  The Court therefore taxes $17.22 from the memorandum of costs. The  Court also taxes $269.00 in costs for service of “Kenny Hanna, M.D.’s Objections  to Defendants City of Thousand Oaks and Fred Gessler’s Deposition Subpoena for  Personal Appearance and Production of Documents and Things” (exh. C), which  appears to be a filing in a different case.  D.   Jury fee deposit  Yarbrough’s  notice of motion states that he is challenging Seeley’s request for costs based  on the $150.00 jury fee civil deposit.  However,  Yarbrough does not address this cost in the body of his motion.  The Court considers the issue waived.  E.   Deposition costs  Yarbrough  argues that the deposition cost of $2,374.91 was unreasonable because Seeley  did not need to take Yarbrough’s deposition after it moved for summary  judgment.  The  Court finds that Seeley properly continued to prepare for trial after it moved  for summary judgment.  The trial  preparation included taking Yarbrough’s deposition.  The expense was reasonable and necessary.  The Court denies Yarbrough’s motion to strike  or tax this cost.  CONCLUSION  The  Court GRANTS in part Plaintiff Keith Yarbrough’s motion to strike and tax costs.  The Court taxes Defendant Seeley Brothers’ memorandum of costs in the amount of $1,144.22 ($459.00 plus $269.00 plus $399.00 plus $17.22).  In all other respects, the Court DENIES the  motion.  The  Court AWARDS Defendant Seeley Brothers $4,386.69 in costs.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
