 Case Number:  22STCV12236    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On
April 11, 2022, Plaintiffs Destiny Thomas and Jayveon
Keys filed this action against Defendants Eric Daniel, Miguel Gonzalez, and
Does 1-25 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
October 9, 2023, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice.  On April 24, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiffs’ motion to vacate the dismissal. 
On
June 20, 2024, Defendants Eric Daniel and Miguel Gonzalez filed an answer. 
On
October 3, 2024, Defendants Eric Diaz (erroneously sued as Eric Daniel) and
Miguel Gomez (“Defendants”) filed a motion to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to request
for production of documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and
form interrogatories, set one. 
(Defendants should have filed six separate motions, one for each type of
discovery sought from each Plaintiff.) 
The motion was set for hearing on November 13, 2024.  Plaintiffs did not file an opposition.  The Court continued the hearing to December
18, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendants
asks the Court to compel each Plaintiffs’ responses to request for production
of documents, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and form
interrogatories, set one. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
 “If a party to
whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails
to serve a timely response to it, the following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
DISCUSSION 
On June
18, 2024, Defendants served request for production of documents, set one,
special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one, on Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs did not provide timely responses
and had not provided responses by the time Defendants filed this motion. 
The
Court grants Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to request for
production of documents, set one, and orders Plaintiffs to serve verified
code-compliant responses to the request for production of documents without
objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored information,
and/or other things requested without objections by January 15, 2025. 
The
Court grants Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to special
interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiffs
to serve verified code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories and form
interrogatories without objections by January 15, 2025. 
Defendants
request sanctions of $1,067.00.  Under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, the Court shall impose
a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories or a demand
for inspection unless the Court finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c)
[demand for inspection].) 
Plaintiffs
did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or a
demand for inspection. Therefore, sanctions are not available under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for this motion. 
In City of Los Angeles v. Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (2024) 17
Cal.5th 46 (PwC), the Supreme Court held: “It is already
well-established that a court may not rely on [Code of Civil Procedure] section
2023.030 to override the limitations prescribed by any other applicable
sanctions provision in the [Civil Discovery] Act.  A court may invoke its
independent authority to impose sanctions under sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
only when confronted with an unusual form of discovery abuse, or a pattern of
abuse, not already addressed by a relevant sanctions provision.  And where it
invokes that authority, it is constrained by the long-settled rules generally
governing the imposition of discovery sanctions under the Act.”  (PwC, supra, 17 Cal.5th at pp.
74-75.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), and 2031.300,
subdivision (c), limit the Court’s authority to impose sanctions when (as here)
the non-moving party does not oppose a successful motion to compel responses to
interrogatories or inspection demands. 
Because these statutes address this issue, the Court will not invoke its
independent authority to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.  (See PwC,
supra, 17 Cal.5th at pp. 74-75.) 
Defendants
also cite California Rule of Court, rule 3.1348(a), which provides: “The court
may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a
motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed .
. . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
1348(a).)  Because rule 3.1348(a)
authorizes sanctions “under the Discovery Act,” the Court may not award
sanctions under rule 3.1348(a) except as the Discovery Act authorizes.  As explained, the Discovery Act does not
authorize sanctions for Defendants’ unopposed motion to compel responses to
requests for production and interrogatories. 
Therefore, the Court denies Defendants’ request for sanctions.
