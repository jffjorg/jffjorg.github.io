And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to set aside a judgment. The plaintiff was diagnosed with COVID-19 on September 15, 2024, and was prescribed Paxlovid. The plaintiff only learned of the judgment on October 3, 2024, when defense counsel circulated a letter to the owners of the Fall Creek HOA informing them of the judgment. The judge notes that the defendant properly served the plaintiff by mail, as there was no agreement between the parties to permit electronic service. The plaintiff argues that the defendant should have emailed notice of the hearing instead of mailing it, but the judge finds that service by mail was proper. The judge is considering granting relief from the judgment under CCP 473 subdivision (b) or under the court's inherent equity power, citing several California cases. The judge will issue a final ruling after considering the parties' arguments and evidence.
