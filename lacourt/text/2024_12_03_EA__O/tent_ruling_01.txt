  Case Number:  23STCV05277    Hearing Date:   December 3, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
(1)   MOTION TO SET ASIDE AND VACATE
JUDGMENT DUE TOEXTRINSIC FRAUD AND LACK OF NOTICE TO PETITIONER REGARDING
CONTINUED TRIAL DATE is GRANTED; both Defendants and the court made an
error by sending notices to an incorrect address; the address is Palomino
drive, not Pacomino Drive. 
 
(2)   PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES
is MOOT; because the motion is predicated upon being the prevailing
party, the motion for attorney fees is moot. 
 
Background
 
This action pertains
to the HOA’s bylaws. Petitioner/Plaintiff CYNTHIA ESCUTIA-COBIAN in her
petition states, inter alia, that two persons elected to the Board of
Directors, Isabel Hsieh and Karen Lee, are not resident Unit Owners” as neither
live in any condominium of in the Fall Creek community but rent the units to
third parties, in violation of Article IV of the bylaws. 
 
On March 9,
2023, Plaintiff filed the instant ‘petition for writ of mandate, declaratory
relief, and injunction.’

On April 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for preliminary
injunction. 
 
On June 21,
2023, Plaintiff filed an amended petition against the Respondents.
 
On July 13,
2023, the court issued, in pertinent part, the following minute regarding
Plaintiff’s ex-parte application ‘For Temporary Restraining Order Pending
Hearing On Preliminary Injunction And Order To Advance The Hearing On The
Preliminary Injunction Presently Set For Hearing On October 9, 2023’: “The
moving party has failed to make an affirmative factual showing of irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any statutory basis for granting relief Ex Parte
pursuant to California Rules of Court 3.1202(c).”
 
On July 21,
2023, Respondents filed a verified answer to the first amended petition. 
 
On July 26,
2023, Respondents filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff for
Violation/Breach of the Governing Documents; Injunctive Relief; and Damages.
(Based upon a review of the cross-complaint, it is predicated upon the
allegation that the HOA has determined it is necessary to re-pipe all of the
buildings within the development, but Plaintiff has refused to allow the HOA
access to Plaintiff’s unit for the re-pipe project.) 
 
On July 31,
2023, Respondents filed their first amended verified answer. 
 
On September
21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney (replacing William B.
Hanley with Feldsott, Lee & Nichter). 
 
On November
1, 2023 (after supplemental briefing), the court denied Plaintiff’s motion for
a preliminary injunction. Specifically, Plaintiff sought an injunction for an
order that Respondents (a) comply with Article IV that only resident unit
owners serve as members of the board of directors and (b) remove Hsieh and Lee
as neither are ‘resident unit owners’ as required by the bylaws, but Defendants
evidenced showed that respondents are resident unit owners. As for Plaintiff’s contention that the
2017 amendment is invalid, the one-year statute of limitations passed pursuant
to Cal. Civ. Code, § 5145(a) and Cal. Civ. Code, § 5100(a) - amendment of the
governing documents. 
 
On February 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
substitution of attorney.





















 
On April 8,
2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte to ‘Postpone Management Conference Due to a
Medical Emergency.’ (The ex parte did not state the medical emergency.)
Additionally, the address on the ex-parte provides the following address: 364
S. Prospectors Road, Unit #134 in the city of Diamond Bar. 
 
On April 9,
2024, the court granted the ex parte. The CMC was continued to 5/7/24. There
was no appearance at the ex parte hearing by Plaintiff, but Plaintiff’s husband
did appear via LA CourtConnect.
 
On May 2,
2024, Plaintiff filed another similar ex-parte. 
 
On May 3,
2024, the court granted the ex parte and continued to the 5/7/24 CMC to
5/29/24. There was no appearance by Plaintiff. The ‘Certificate of Mailing’
filed by the court provides that service was sent to “23545 Pacomino
Drive Unit 263 Diamond Bar, CA 91765.”
 



 
On May 29, 2024, the court held its CMC. The
Plaintiff did appear at that hearing. The minute order provides, in relevant part, the
following: “Plaintiff's oral motion for a continuance to hire counsel is
heard and DENIED …. Final Status Conference is scheduled for 09/09/2024 at
10:30 AM in Department O at Pomona Courthouse South. Non-Jury Trial is scheduled for 09/16/2024
at 10:30 AM in Department O at Pomona Courthouse South. Defense dCounsel is to
give notice.”
 
On September 4, 2024, Defense Counsel sent an ‘Notice of
Ruling”; the ruling was sent to “Pacomino” Drive. 

 
On
September 9, 2024, there were no appearances at the FSC; the court continued
the hearing to 9/16/24. Notice was sent by the court to a “Pacomino” address. 
 
On
September 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Peremptory Challenge. The Plaintiff’s
listed addressed used a PALOMINO Drive address. 



 
On September 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a ‘Motion to
Postpone Due to Medical Emergency.’ The doctor’s note attached did not provide
an explanation of the illness aside from the fact that she was seen for an
“acute medical illness” (p. 4 of 7 of PDF) and that she should “rest and engage
in therapeutic interventions.” (p. 3 of 7 of PDF.) Of note, the note was signed
by an LMFT. That same day, the court held its non-jury trial and FSC. There
was no appearance by Plaintiff. The minute order provides the following:
 
The Court is in receipt of Petitioner's
Notice of Motion to Postpone Due to Medical Emergency, filed this date. Said
Motion does not detail what the medical condition is or why it necessitates a
continuance.[1]
The Court does not rule on Petitioner's Motion, but understands that Petitioner
may have a medical issue. The instant matters are continued to September 24,
2024 at 11:00 a.m. If Defense Counsel is able to obtain additional information
(as to Petitioner's status), he may provide it to the Court, along with any
requests for the Court to take action next date. Accordingly, the Non-Jury
Trial scheduled for 09/16/2024, and Final Status Conference scheduled for
09/16/2024 are continued to 09/24/2024 at 11:00 AM in Department O at
Pomona Courthouse South. Respondent's Counsel is ordered to give notice.
(emphasis added). 
The notice, sent on 9/19/24 by Defense Counsel, was sent
to the “Pacomino” address. 
 



 
On September 24, 2024, the court
held its FSC and non-jury trial. The minute order states in full the following:
 
The matters are called for hearing.
There is no appearance made by or for the Plaintiff. The Court and Counsel
confer regarding the status of the case. The Petition Writ of Mandate filed by
Cynthia Escutia-Cobian on 03/09/2023 is Off Calendar. Defense Counsel files a
cross-complaint in open court. Defense Counsel's witness, Isabel Shih, is sworn
and testifies. Defense Counsel's Exhibit H (1-page Analysis spreadsheet) is
referenced. The Court orders Defense counsel to submit a judgment on the
cross-complaint on or by end of business day September 25, 2024.
 
On September 25, 2024, the court issued a nunc pro tunc
stating that “The Petition Writ of Mandate filed by Cynthia Escutia-Cobin on
03/09/2023 is dismissed without prejudice.”
 
On September 26, 2024, the court signed the judgment
dismissing Plaintiff’s first amended petition, allowing Defendants/Respondents
to recover attorney fees, and enjoining Plaintiff from interfering with various
projects/construction.
 
On October 1, 2024, Defendant filed a Notice of Entry of
Judgment, which was sent to a “Pacomino” address.
 
On October 3, 2024, an Abstract of Judgment was filed. 
 
On October 22, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion for
attorney fees.
 
On
October 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney was filed
naming Peter D. Gordon as Plaintiff’s attorney. That same day, Plaintiff filed a
motion to set aside/vacate judgment.
 
On November 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the
attorney fees motion. That same day, Defendants filed an opposition to
Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the judgment, along with evidentiary objections. 
 
On October 22, 2024, both parties filed respective replies
to their respective motions.
 
Discussion[2]
 
According to Plaintiff, the only reason that she did not
attend the trial on September 24, 2024, was due to lack of notice.[3]
The Notice of Ruling of the trial continuance from 9/16 to 9/24 indicates the
notice was served on a non-existent address on “Pacomino Drive” (a non-existent
street). The lack of actual notice to Petitioner resulted in judgment being
entered against Plaintiff in absentia and prevented her from presenting her
case on her Petition as well as her defense of the Cross-Complaint. (Motion p.
1.) Based thereon, Plaintiff brings forth the motion pursuant to CCP section
473 subdivisions (b) (excusable neglect and mistake)[4]
and (d) (judgment was void due to lack of notice) and the court’s equitable
powers.[5]
 
Here, Defendant contends that notice was given to a Pacomino
drive address, which tacitly concedes the address was incorrect. (Opp. p. 7: As
5-7; see also Opp. p. 8:12-14 [“The "wrong address" argument fails
because the Association and this Court utilized the address provided by
Petitioner.  If it was wrong, Petitioner
has a legal obligation to complete a change of address form and file with the
Court.  This was Petitioner's own fault.”].)
As indicated in the procedural history above, the court and Defendant made
an inadvertent clerical error sending the various notices to a PaComino
Drive address instead of Plaintiff’s address at PaLomino drive. Accordingly,
the contrary of Plaintiff’s contention, it was not Petitioner's fault
that prior notices were mailed to the wrong address. (Opp. p. 5-6.) 
 
Under CCP 473 subdivision (b), “[t]he court may, upon any
terms as may be just, relieve a party [] from a judgment, dismissal order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” One has made a mistake of fact
when she understands the facts to be other than they are. (Motion p. 8, citing H.
D. Arnaiz, Ltd. V. County of San Joaquin (2002) 96 Cal. App. 4th 1357, 1368.)
“A mistake sufficient to vacate . . . may be found where a party, under some
erroneous conviction, does an act he would not do but for the erroneous
conviction.” (Id. at p. 1369.) Here, Plaintiff did not appear at the FSC
and trial because she was not informed of the continued trial date (i.e.,
excusable mistake). (See Motion p. 7, quoting Jones v. Lindsey
(1952) 114 Cal. App. 2d 237, 238 [“The fact that plaintiff and his counsel did
not have notice of the trial is sufficient for the trial court's ruling
[vacating the judgment].”]; see also Tearney v. Riddle (1944) 64 Cal.App.2d
783 [trial court’s ruling to vacate a judgment pursuant to 473 when record
showed the party did not receive notice of a motion hearing].) 
Relief is also available under the court’s equitable
powers. (See Motion p. 5, quoting Evry v. Tremble (1954) 154
Cal.App.2d 444, 448 [“One who has been prevented by extrinsic factors from
presenting his case to the court may bring an independent action in equity to
secure relief from the judgment entered against him….”].) 
These facts amount to excusable neglect and mistake
sufficient for purposes of a §473 motion, notably when promptly done. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, as neither this Court and Defense
Counsel utilized the address provided by Plaintiff, section 473 and equitable
relief are available to grant the motion. Consequently, Defendant’s motion for
attorney fees is moot (as there is no judgment to collect attorney fees upon.)
