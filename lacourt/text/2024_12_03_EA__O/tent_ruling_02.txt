[1] The instant motion states that Plaintiff was
diagnosed with COVID-19 on 9/15/24 and prescribed Paxlovid. (Motion to Set
Aside Judgment, Ex. 6, p. 65 of 68 of PDF.) 


[2]
To the extent that Plaintiff/Petitioner argues Defendant/Respondent should have
emailed notice of the hearing instead of mailing it, not so. Absent an agreement between
the parties that electronic service is permitted, service must be made by mail.
Here, the court sees no such agreement. Therefore, Defendant’s method of
service was proper. 
 


[3] Plaintiff states that she only learned of the
judgment when Defense Counsel Moreno circulated a letter to the owners of the
Fall Creek HOA on 10/3/24 informing them of the judgment. 


[4] Under CCP 473 subdivision (b), “[t]he court may, upon
any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative
from a judgment, dismissal order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” 
 


[5] A trial court may grant relief from
an order or judgment under its inherent equity power if, because of the fraud of the opponent,
the aggrieved party was prevented from presenting their claim or defense to
the court. (Pittman v.
Beck Park Apartments Ltd., 20 Cal. App. 5th 1009, 230 Cal. Rptr. 3d 113 (2d
Dist. 2018); County of San
Diego v. Gorham, 186 Cal. App. 4th 1215, 113 Cal. Rptr. 3d 147 (4th Dist. 2010).) “Extrinsic
fraud occurs when a party is deprived of the opportunity to present his claim
or defense to the court; where he was kept ignorant or, other than from his own negligence, fraudulently prevented from fully participating in the proceeding.” (City and County of San Francisco v. Cartagena (1995)
35 Cal.App.4th 1061, 1067.) 
Although the grounds for equitable relief are commonly stated as being
extrinsic fraud or mistake, those terms are given a broad meaning and tend to
encompass almost any set of extrinsic circumstances that deprive a party of a
fair adversary hearing. It does not seem to matter if the particular
circumstances qualify as fraudulent or mistaken in the strict sense. (In
re Marriage of Park (1980) 27 Cal.3d 337, 342.)
