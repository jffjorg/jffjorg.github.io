On January 26, 2023, Defendants the International Christian
Church, Inc. and City Of Angels International Christian Church filed a demurrer
with a motion to strike.
 
On February 20, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a first amended
complaint (FAC) alleging the same COAs against the same Defendants, rendering
the 1/26/23 demurrer moot. 
 
On March 25, 2024, Defendants filed a demurrer to the FAC,
which on 4/29/24 the court continued for supplemental briefing as the
Plaintiffs’ opposition did not squarely address Defendants’ demurrer.
 
On June 17, 2024, the court heard the matter and took it
under submission.
 
On June 21, 2024, the court issued its final ruling
sustaining the demurrer and granting the MTS without leave to amend.
 
On July 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their SAC.
 
On August 5, 2024, Defendants filed the instant demurrer. 
 
Discussion
 
The court’s 9/24/24 ruling was to sustain the demurrer
without leave to amend as the complaint was time barred, and there was lack of
an opposition to explain otherwise. However, during the hearing, Plaintiff’s
Counsel, Counsel Benjamin Cutchshaw, represented to the court that they did not receive notice
of the demurrer, i.e., that Plaintiff was not aware of the demurrer.
Defense Counsel Chadbourne explained otherwise. During the hearing, Defense
Counsel explained that on August 13, 2024, Plaintiff’s firm, Samini Block APC, responded directly to
defense counsel’s August 5, 2024 email that contained the notice of the
demurrer and the demurrer itself. Of note, Counsel Cutchshaw was copied on that
email. In the interest of fairness, the court allowed for supplemental
briefing on the specific issue of whether Plaintiff should be allowed to
file an opposition/notice of the demurrer, not that Plaintiffs may file
an opposition. (See also Supp. Reply p. 5.) This was in light of the
court’s 6/21/24 final ruling which clearly indicated that “any
future untimely filings by Plaintiffs will be stricken.” (6/21/24 Final
Ruling, italics and underline original.) 
 
However, in its supplemental brief, Plaintiffs ignore the
court’s ruling and argue the merits of the motion. (See also Supp. Reply p.
5:21-24.) To the extent that Plaintiffs attempt to address the issue of notice
of the demurrer, Counsel Cutchshaw’s declaration mentions the demurrer was
not received for “unknown reasons.” (Cutchshaw Decl., P4.) But the demurrer was
received as acknowledged by the 8/13/24 email sent from Ashley
Hetzel from Samini Block APC to Defendant(s). Hetzel responded to Defendant(s) and
CC’d Counsel Cutchsaw and various other individuals stating that
“Please be sure to update your service list to avoid improper service”; the
additional individuals include Bobby Samini (already emailed), Benjamin
Cutchsaw, Nicole Prado (already emailed), Ashley Hetzel, and Ashely Chau. 
 
To the extent that Plaintiffs are arguing that service was
improper, not so. The
demurrer was served on 8/5/24 by electronic service on the attorneys
listed as counsel of record in the Second Amended Complaint – Bobby
Samini and Nicole C. Prado. 
 
Therefore, as Plaintiff’s Counsel made a representation to
the court that is shown otherwise by the emails, the court adheres to its
original tentative ruling which is to SUSTAIN the demurrer without leave to
amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is sustained without
leave to amend.
