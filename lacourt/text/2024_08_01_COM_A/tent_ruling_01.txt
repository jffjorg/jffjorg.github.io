[TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT ENTERED ON JANUARY 12,
2024 
 
      The first amended
complaint (“FAC”) filed on July 25, 2023, alleged wage and hour and other claims
in violation of the Labor Code (1st through 6th, 8th and
9th causes of action); wrongful termination (7th cause of
action); intentional infliction of emotional distress (10th cause of
action) and a claim for unlawful business practices (11th cause of
action).  
      The Court entered
default against Next Gen on September 7, 2023, and against Shen on September
15, 2023. Plaintiff dismissed all DOES on November 17, 2023. The court issued a
judgment on January 12, 2024, in Plaintiff’s favor, totaling $16,915.06 and
mailed the judgment to Plaintiff on the same day. On March 12, 2024, the court
denied Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration.
      Plaintiff now moves for
discretionary and mandatory relief from the judgment obtained on January 12, 2024,
based on counsel’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Counsel
maintains that he had evidence to support his claims but did not submit it
because it was voluminous. Counsel asks to be relieved from his mistake in not
submitting evidence to the court, but instead relying on counsel’s summary of
the evidence, which the court did not accept alone. 
      The court has
discretion to vacate a judgment taken based on the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect of counsel. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473 (b).)  Relief is mandatory where counsel’s mistake
caused the error in judgment.  (Id.)
["The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or
her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.”
      The motion is timely
made within six months of entry of judgment. Plaintiff timely filed this motion
on June 28, 2024. (Salazar v. Steelman (1937) 22
Cal.App.2d 402, 410.) Counsel avers that he relied on
his mistaken belief that the summary of evidence was sufficient. A mistake
exists when a person fails to do some act because of an erroneous conviction. …
It may arise either from unconsciousness, ignorance, forgetfulness, imposition
or misplaced confidence." (Id.) at 410.
      Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED. The judgment entered on January 12, 2024, is
vacated. The court will consider the foundational evidence submitted by
Plaintiff’s counsel. The court sets an Order to Show Cause re: Default for November 1, 2024,
at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
