[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING Plaintiff’s
 Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint
 
I.       
BACKGROUND      
      This is a
premises liability action arising from injuries Plaintiff allegedly sustained
after falling at Defendant’s store. Plaintiff requests an order to amend the
complaint to add a prayer for punitive damages and a cause of action for
negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. Plaintiff asserts that the
punitive damages claim is based on information recently discovered showing that
Defendant ignored the fact that the area around the fountain where Plaintiff
fell was an ongoing and dangerous condition that persisted for a substantial
period. Defendant will not suffer any prejudice as a consequence of the
amendments. 
      In opposition,
Defendant argues that the motion is vague, and Plaintiff delayed in amending
the complaint as Defendant served its discovery responses on May 30, 2023. Significant
discovery has already occurred, and Defendant will be required to conduct
further discovery related to the newly related claims, which Walmart is
attempting to investigate by targeting discovery on these new claims. Responses
are due on July 30, 2024.
      Plaintiff did not
file a reply brief by July 25, 2024 (five court days before the hearing.) (Code
Civ. Proc., 1005(b).                       
II.     
LEGAL STANDARDS
      Leave
to amend is permitted at the court’s discretion upon any terms that may be
just. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473 subd. (a)(1).) The statute is liberally construed to permit amendment
of the pleadings “unless an attempt is made to present an entirely different
set of facts by way of the amendment.” (Atkinson
v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 760.) 
      If the
motion is timely made, and the granting of the motion will not result in
prejudice to the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend. (Morgan
v. Superior Court of Cal. In and For Los Angeles County (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Where denial of the motion will result in a party
being deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action, “it is not
only error but an abuse of discretion.” (Id.) Amendments are permitted
up to the date of trial or during trial where no prejudice is shown to the
adverse party. (Atkinson
v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) 
III.   
DISCUSSION
      Defendant
has not shown any prejudice resulting from the proposed amendments. Current
counsel was not associated in this case as trial counsel until June 7, 2024, at
which time Mr. Soofer examined the facts and moved to amend the pleading. (Mot.,
Ramin Soofer decl., ¶ 4-5.) Even if Plaintiff obtained the relevant facts
supporting amendments in May of 2023, trial is not set until October 24, 2024,
and Defendant is mitigating any prejudice by conducting “targeted discovery” on
the new issues. (Opp., Lisa Mallinson decl., ¶¶ 5-7.) The claim for negligent hiring
is based on the same facts and the same incident that forms the basis for the
complaint.
       Defendant contends there is no evidence to
support the claim for punitive damages. (Opp., Mallinson decl., ¶3.)  However, a court may not condition leave to
amend on production of admissible evidence substantiating the allegations of
the amended pleading. (Sanai
v. Saltz (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 746, 770 ["Although we may
entertain some skepticism as to the nature of the competent and credible proof Brehm
will be able to offer in support of these allegations, the issue before us is
not whether his evidence will be sufficient but whether his allegations of
intentional misconduct and bad faith are.”]" Moreover, evidentiary
facts are not required to be alleged. (Quelimane
Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal. 4th 26, 47; Lim v. The.TV Corp. Internat. (2002) 99 Cal. App. 4th 684, 690.)
IV.   
CONCLUSION
 
      Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint is GRANTED.
Plaintiff is directed to file and serve the amended pleading forthwith.
