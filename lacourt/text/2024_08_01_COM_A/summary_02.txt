And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of granting Plaintiff Veronica Alejandra Segura's motion to file a first amended complaint. The motion seeks to add a prayer for punitive damages and a cause of action for negligent hiring, retention, and supervision to the original complaint. The Judge found that Defendant Walmart, Inc. did not show any prejudice resulting from the proposed amendments and that current counsel was not associated with the case until June 2024. The Judge also noted that the claim for negligent hiring is based on the same facts and the same incident that forms the basis for the original complaint. Additionally, the Judge ruled that a court may not condition leave to amend on production of admissible evidence substantiating the allegations of the amended pleading. The Judge granted the motion and directed Plaintiff to file and serve the amended pleading forthwith.
