Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Veronica Alejandra Segura's motion to amend the complaint to add a prayer for punitive damages and a cause of action for negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. The Plaintiff alleges that the area around the fountain where she fell was an ongoing and dangerous condition that persisted for a substantial period, and that Defendant Walmart, Inc. ignored this fact. The Judge finds that Defendant has not shown any prejudice resulting from the proposed amendments and that the claim for negligent hiring is based on the same facts and incident as the original complaint. The Judge also notes that the claim for punitive damages does not require production of admissible evidence substantiating the allegations. The motion is granted, and the Plaintiff is directed to file and serve the amended pleading forthwith.
