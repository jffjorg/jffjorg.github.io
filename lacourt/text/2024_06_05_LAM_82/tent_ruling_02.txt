Investment Services, LLC v. Status Collection & Co., Inc., et al.
Case No. 23STCV03744
Applications for Writs of Attachment
 
            Plaintiff
Ace Investment Services, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed applications for writs of
attachment in the amount of $84,025.03 against Defendants Status Collection
& Co., Inc. and Jeremaih Spielman, an individual (collectively, “Defendants”).  Plaintiff filed and served the instant
applications on March 13, 2024.  
 
“Upon the filing
of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to
this article for a right to attach order and a writ of attachment by filing an
application for the order and writ with the court in which the action is brought.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 484.010.)
 
The court shall issue a right to attach order if the court
finds all of the following: 
 
(1)   The claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon
which an attachment may be issued. 
 
(2)   The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
claim upon which the attachment is based.
 
(3)   The attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the
recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based. 
 
(4)   The amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than
zero.  
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 484.090.)  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than
not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that
claim.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 481.190.)  “In
contested applications, the court must consider the relative merits of the
positions of the respective parties and make a determination of¿the probable
outcome of the litigation.”¿  (Hobbs
v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 80.) 
“The application shall be supported by an affidavit showing that the
plaintiff on the facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim
upon which the attachment is based.”¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 484.030.)  “The facts stated in each affidavit filed [in
support of the application] shall be set forth with particularity.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 482.040.) 
 
            There are several problems with Plaintiff’s
applications.  Plaintiff did not file a
memorandum of points and authorities.  Pursuant
to the Rules of Court, a memorandum of points and authorities is required for a
pre-judgment application for writ of attachment.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 3.1103(a)(1);
3.1112(a)(3); 3.1113(a); and 3.1114.) 
“The court may construe the absence of a memorandum as an admission that
the motion … is not meritorious and cause for its denial ….”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(a).)  Furthermore, “[t]he Attachment Law statutes
are subject to strict construction.” (Epstein
v. Abrams (1997) 57
Cal.App.4th 1159, 1168.)  
 
            Putting
that aside, the record does not contain sufficient information to issue the
writs of attachment.  These applications
are based on a claim for breach of contract. 
To establish a claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must
prove: (1) existence of a contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach of the contract; and (4) damages
incurred by plaintiff as a result of the breach.  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare, (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1367.)  The facts stated in
a declaration submitted in support of an application for writ of attachment “shall be set
forth with particularity.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 482.040.)    
 
In
the declaration submitted with the applications, Plaintiff’s managing member,
Sam Wafaa, states that Plaintiff and Defendants entered a written contract on
or about November 16, 2022, under which Plaintiff sold a gold bar to Defendants
for $120,000.  (Wafaa Decl. ¶¶ 2-3 & Exh.
A.)  The contract required Defendants to
make an initial payment of $40,000.00 on or before November 25, 2022, and then
six additional weekly payments of $13,333.33, on or before December 2, 2022,
December 9, 2022, December 16, 2022, December 23, 2022, December 30, 2022, and
January 6, 2023.  (Id. ¶ 3 and Exh.
A.)  The contract also states that for
“any payment made late after the due date, the late fee will be 10% of the
total outstanding balance for each late payment and added to the payment
due.”  (Id. Exh. A.)  
 
Wafaa
declares that Plaintiff performed its obligations under the contract and that
Defendants breached “by failing to make all timely payments, and there is now
due and owning, under the Contract, the sum of $84,025,03, consisting of the
outstanding principal balance and late fees, due as of the date of filing of
this Complaint.”  (Id. ¶ 5.)  Wafaa does not submit a written account
balance or ledger showing the payments that were made on the contract or how
late fees were calculated.  Wafaa also
does not provide such information in his declaration.  Accordingly, Wafaa
has not described “with particularity” how Plaintiff’s damages of $84,025,03
were calculated, including late fees.  
 
Finally,
Plaintiff requests
attachment against Defendant Jeremiah Spielman, a natural person, of “any
property of a defendant who is not a natural person.”  (Application ¶ 9a.)  That request is improper.  Pre-judgment attachment against a natural
person is limited to the items listed in Code of Civil procedure section
487.010(c) and (d). 
 
Based upon the
foregoing, the court denies Plaintiff’s applications for writs of attachment
without prejudice.  Plaintiff’s counsel
shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
