And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies the plaintiff's applications for writs of attachment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Ace Investment Services, LLC, seeks attachment against the defendants, Status Collection & Co., Inc. and Jeremaih Spielman, in the amount of $84,025.03. The plaintiff claims that the defendants breached a contract by failing to make timely payments and seeks attachment of their property to secure this claim. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's applications are deficient in several respects. The plaintiff failed to file a memorandum of points and authorities, which is required for a pre-judgment application for writ of attachment. Additionally, the plaintiff did not provide sufficient information to establish the probable validity of its claim and did not describe with particularity how its damages were calculated. Finally, the plaintiff's request for attachment against Jeremaih Spielman, a natural person, is improper. The court orders the plaintiff's counsel to provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
