And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling denies the petition for a writ of administrative mandate filed by Cynthia Sims to set aside the decision denying her application for custody of her grandchildren. The court finds that Sims has not met her burden of proof under section 1094.5 to show a prejudicial abuse of discretion, a denial of a fair trial, or other reversible error in the administrative decision. The petition is denied due to the lack of an opening brief and lodged administrative record.
