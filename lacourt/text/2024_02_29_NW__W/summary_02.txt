The Court's Tentative Ruling on Plaintiff's Motion for Protective Order

The Court denies Plaintiff Karen Soronow's motion for a protective order, which seeks to limit the number of requests for admission (RFAs) propounded by Defendant Sunshine's Place II. The motion argues that the RFAs are excessive and unduly burdensome, as they are largely cumulative and duplicative of previous requests. Defendant argues that the complexity of the case warrants the additional RFAs, citing the nuances of the timeline of the decedent's care during the COVID-19 pandemic and Plaintiff's repeated decision not to seek emergency care for her mother. The Court finds that Defendant has justified the number of RFAs and that they are not unduly burdensome. As a result, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for a protective order.
