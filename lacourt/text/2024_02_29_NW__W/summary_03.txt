And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Shady Hatem Hassan's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff Carry Jarrett Kievman and Roes 1-10. The cross-complaint arises out of an incident that occurred at Westlake Village Inn, where Plaintiff Kievman alleges he was touched by a female patron, pushed, and attacked by unknown individuals. The judge finds that Defendant Hassan is entitled to file the cross-complaint, as it is related to the same transaction or occurrence as the cause of action alleged in the complaint. The motion is granted in the interest of justice, as it would otherwise be lost.
