Summary:
The tentative ruling denies the defendant's demurrer to the seventh and tenth causes of action, which alleged violations of Civil Code sections 1941, 1941.1, and 1942.4. The court finds that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action. However, the court grants the defendant's motion to strike requests for and references to punitive damages from the complaint, as the plaintiff failed to plead specific facts supporting the request for punitive damages. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for leave to amend, as the plaintiff failed to specify how the complaint could be amended to cure the deficiencies.
