And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The motion is partially granted and partially denied.

The judge grants the motion as to Olan individually, finding that the plaintiff's first cause of action against Olan is untimely. The judge also grants the motion as to the second cause of action for conversion, finding that the plaintiff's claim is untimely.

The judge denies the motion as to the first cause of action for elder abuse, finding that there is a genuine issue of material fact that precludes granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The judge also denies the motion as to punitive damages, finding that the defendants have failed to advance evidence pertinent to the issue.

The judge orders the defendants to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
