The plaintiff, Jane Doe, seeks to quash the subpoena, which was served by the defendant, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The defendant seeks to depose Deponent and obtain documents from him. The court has determined that Deponent is a percipient witness in this action and that the defendant is entitled to discovery concerning his observations of the plaintiff after the alleged assault. However, the court has also concluded that the subpoena is overbroad and has limited the scope of the production of documents to specific time periods. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
