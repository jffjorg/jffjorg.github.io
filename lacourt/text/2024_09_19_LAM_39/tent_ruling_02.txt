Motions to Quash Subpoenas

MOTION
              Plaintiff
Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”) moves for protective orders to quash the subpoenas Defendant
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Defendant”) served on Deponents Bradley Coddington and
Catherine Coddington (“Deponents”).  Defendant
opposes the motions.
ANALYSIS
If a subpoena requires deposition testimony
or the production of documents, the Court may quash the subpoena entirely or
modify it.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1,
subd. (a).)  In ruling on a motion to
quash, “the Court may in its discretion award the amount of the reasonable
expenses incurred in making or opposing the motion, including reasonable
attorney's fees, if the court finds the motion was made or opposed in bad faith
or without substantial justification or that one or more of the requirements of
the subpoena was oppressive.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1987.2, subd. (a).) 
In the instant case, Plaintiff contends,
while she worked for Defendant, her co-worker Eric Pagel (“Pagel”) sexually harassed
and assaulted her.  Defendant served a
subpoena on Deponents, in which Defendant seeks to depose them and asks them to
produce documents.  Plaintiff has a right
to privacy in “various private or sensitive information regarding [her]
personal life . . . .”  (Hooser v.
Superior Court (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 997, 1003-1004.)  This includes Plaintiff’s friendship with Deponents.  Accordingly, the Court cannot order
disclosure of information regarding Plaintiff’s friendship with Deponents unless
such information is directly relevant to this litigation.  (See Britt v. Superior Court (1978) 20
Cal.3d 844, 855-856.)  
However, Deponents are percipient witnesses
in this action in that Plaintiff has indicated she socialized with them the
evening after Pagel’s alleged assault.  Plaintiff
also testified she texted Pagel photographs of Plaintiff with Deponents.  Defendant is entitled to discovery concerning
Deponents’ observations of Plaintiff in this time frame immediately after the
assault, as Plaintiff testified she was distraught.  Plaintiff also testified she told Catherine
Coddington about Pagel’s assault.  Defendant is entitled to learn what Plaintiff
told Catherine Coddington.  (See Opposition, pp. 6-8.)  Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to depose Deponents,
and the motion to quash is denied.  However,
the Court concludes Defendant’s subpoena to Deponents is overbroad.  The entirety of the communication history
between Plaintiff and Deponents and Deponents and Plaintiff’s husband is not
pertinent to this action.  Accordingly,
the Court limits the subpoena for production of documents to communications
between Deponents and Plaintiff and Deponents and Plaintiff’s husband from: (1)
January 14 to April 30, 2020; (2) May 22 to June 30, 2020; (3) August 6, 2020
to December 31, 2021; (4) January 1 to July 5, 2023; (5) October 1 to November
1, 2023; and (6) January 1, 2024 to the present.  Defendant indicates it is amenable to these
limitations.  (Opposition, p. 9.)
Plaintiff is to give notice of this
order and to file proof of service of same.
