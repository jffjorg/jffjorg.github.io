MOTION
              Plaintiff
Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”) moves for a protective order to quash the subpoena Defendant
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Defendant”) served on Deponent John Aiello
(“Deponent”).  Defendant opposes the
motion.
ANALYSIS
If a subpoena requires deposition testimony
or the production of documents, the Court may quash the subpoena entirely or
modify it.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1,
subd. (a).)  In ruling on a motion to
quash, “the Court may in its discretion award the amount of the reasonable
expenses incurred in making or opposing the motion, including reasonable
attorney's fees, if the court finds the motion was made or opposed in bad faith
or without substantial justification or that one or more of the requirements of
the subpoena was oppressive.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1987.2, subd. (a).) 
In the instant case, Plaintiff contends, while
she worked for Defendant, her co-worker Eric Pagel (“Pagel”) sexually harassed
and assaulted her.  Defendant served a
subpoena on Deponent, in which Defendant seeks to depose Deponent and asks him
to produce documents.  Plaintiff has a
right to privacy in “various private or sensitive information regarding [her]
personal life . . . .”  (Hooser v.
Superior Court (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 997, 1003-1004.)  This includes Plaintiff’s friendship with
Deponent.  Accordingly, the Court cannot
order disclosure of information regarding Plaintiff’s friendship with Deponent unless
such information is directly relevant to this litigation.  (Britt v. Superior Court (1978) 20
Cal.3d 844, 855-856.)  
However, Deponent is a percipient witness in
this action.  According to Plaintiff, she
had dinner with Deponent the night after Pagel’s alleged assault.  Plaintiff also testified she texted Pagel
photographs of Plaintiff and Deponent.  Defendant
is entitled to discovery concerning Deponent’s observations of Plaintiff in
this time frame immediately after the assault, as Plaintiff testified she was
distraught.  Plaintiff also testified she
told her husband about Pagel’s assault, and that Plaintiff’s husband told
Deponent.  Defendant is entitled to learn
what was told to Deponent.  Plaintiff also
testified she told her husband about Pagel’s alleged assault at a dinner party
at Deponent’s home.  (See Opposition, pp.
4-6.)  Accordingly, Defendant is entitled
to depose Deponent, and the motion to quash is denied.  
However, the Court concludes Defendant’s
subpoena to Deponent is overbroad.  The
entirety of the communication history between Plaintiff and Deponent and
Deponent and Plaintiff’s husband is not pertinent to this action.  Accordingly, the Court limits the subpoena
for production of documents to communications between Deponent and Plaintiff
and Deponent and Plaintiff’s husband from: (1) January 14 to April 30, 2020;
(2) May 22 to June 30, 2020; (3) August 6, 2020 to December 31, 2021; (4)
January 1 to July 5, 2023; (5) October 1 to November 1, 2023; and (6) January
1, 2024 to the present.  Defendant
indicates it is amenable to these limitations. 
(Opposition, pp. 8-9.)
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of
this order and to file proof of service of same.
