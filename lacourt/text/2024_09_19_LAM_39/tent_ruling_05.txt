[1]In
its motion, after arguing certain of Plaintiff’s claims are duplicative of
each other, Defendant does not present argument concerning the insufficiency of
Plaintiffs’ negligence, premises liability, breach of the implied covenant of
quiet use and enjoyment, or constructive eviction claims.  Thus, the Court does not address those claims, as it perceives Defendant does not challenge
their sufficiency in this motion.
 


[2]Defendant
objects to Exhibit 4, contending it was not attached to Plaintiff’s complaint
filed on August 25, 2023.  The record
before the Court indicates four exhibits were attached to the operative compliant,
including Exhibit 4. Therefore, Defendant’s objection is overruled.
