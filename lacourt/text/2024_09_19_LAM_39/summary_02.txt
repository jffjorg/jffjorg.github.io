And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to quash subpoenas served on Deponents Bradley Coddington and Catherine Coddington by Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, is seeking to protect her privacy and prevent the disclosure of private information. However, the judge finds that the Deponents are percipient witnesses in this action and are entitled to discovery concerning their observations of the plaintiff in the time frame immediately after the alleged assault. The judge also finds that the plaintiff is entitled to discover what she told Catherine Coddington about the assault.

The judge denies the motion to quash, but limits the scope of the subpoena for production of documents to specific time periods and communications between the Deponents and the plaintiff. The defendant agrees to these limitations. The judge orders the plaintiff to give notice of this order and file proof of service.
