MOTION
            Plaintiffs
Marlena Schwenck and Patrick Salway (“Plaintiffs”) sued Defendant Mayer Moizel
(“Defendant”) for habitability violations. 
Defendant demurs to Plaintiffs’ complaint.  Plaintiffs oppose the motion.
ANALYSIS
“[A] demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis
v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In ruling on a
demurrer, the court must “liberally construe[]” the allegations of the
complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) 
“This rule of liberal construction means that the reviewing court draws
inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the defendant.”  (Perez v.
Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.) 
Any party, within
the time allowed to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a motion to
strike the whole pleading or any part of the pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435,
subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (b).)  On a motion to strike, the court may: (1)
strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading;
or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42
Cal.2d 767, 782.)
In his demurrer, Defendant
argues Plaintiffs improperly allege facts on information and belief.  Defendant cannot demurrer to
allegations.  (Daniels v. Select
Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1167 (disapproved of
on other grounds by Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th
905, 948.)  This argument fails.
Likewise,
Defendant’s argument Plaintiffs’ allegations for the premises liability, nuisance,
habitability, negligence causes of action are duplicative is unavailing.[1]  First, Defendant fails to explain how those claims
are duplicative.  The Court notes, for
example, Plaintiffs allege a different basis for the premises liability and nuisance
claims and seek different damages.  Second,
and in any event, Plaintiffs are entitled to plead in the alternative.  (See, e.g., Mendoza v. Continental Sales
Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1395, 1402 [“When a pleader is in doubt about
what actually occurred or what can be established by the evidence, the modern
practice allows that party to plead in the alternative and make inconsistent
allegations”].)[2]  
Third Cause of Action: Breach of
Implied Warranty of Habitability
Defendant further
contends Plaintiffs fail to allege facts to support their claim for breach of
the implied warranty of habitability.  To
state such a claim, Plaintiffs must allege a material, defective condition
existed in their rental unit, which impacted its habitability, and Defendant
failed to restore the rental unit to habitability. (Knight v. Hallsthammar
(1981) 29 Cal.3d 46, 55.)  In support of
this cause of action, Plaintiffs allege Defendant “failed to inspect and remedy
the Plaintiffs’ complaints of water intrusion, dampness and on information and
belief, toxic mold exposure.”  (Complaint,
¶ 76.)  For pleading purposes, these
allegations suffice. 
Defendant may obtain further information regarding Plaintiffs’
claims in discovery.  (Khoury v.
Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Therefore, the demurrer to the cause of
action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability is overruled.  
Fourth Cause of Action: Private
Nuisance
Defendant demurs
to Plaintiffs’ claim for private nuisance. 
To state a claim for private nuisance, Plaintiffs must allege Defendant substantially
interfered with Plaintiffs’ use and enjoyment of the rental property; this
caused actual damage; and the interference was unreasonable in terms of its
nature, duration, or amount.  (San
Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. Superior Court (1996) 13 Cal.4th 893, 938.)
 In this regard, Plaintiffs allege Defendant,
“by acting or alternatively failing to act, . . . created a condition or
permitted a condition to exist that was: harmful to Plaintiffs' health; was
indecent or offensive to the senses; was an obstruction to the free use of the
property; and created a dangerous condition to Plaintiffs’ property; so as to
interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property.”  (Complaint, ¶ 88.)  For pleading purposes, these allegations
suffice.  
Sixth
Cause of Action: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Defendant demurs
to Plaintiffs’ cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional
distress. The elements for this claim are “(1) extreme and outrageous conduct
by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the
probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering
severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of
the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct. Conduct to be
outrageous must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated
in a civilized community. The defendant must have engaged in conduct intended
to inflict injury or engaged in with the realization that injury will result.”
(Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 965, 1001,
internal quotations and citations omitted.)  Plaintiffs allege Defendants failed to address
dangerous conditions in Plaintiffs’ apartments despite knowing of the
conditions.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 125-127.)  Plaintiff’s allegations suffice for pleading
purposes as they constitute extreme and outrageous conduct that could support a
claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Accordingly, the Court
overrules the demurrer to Plaintiffs’ cause of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress.
Motion to Strike
Defendant moves to
strike the prayer for punitive damages. 
In ruling on a motion to strike punitive damages, “judges read
allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts
in their context, and assume their truth.” (Clauson v. Superior Court
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.) To state a prima facie claim for punitive
damages, a plaintiff must allege the elements set forth in the punitive damages
statute, Civil Code section 3294. (College Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 721 (College Hospital).)  Pursuant to Civil Code section 3294, a
plaintiff must allege the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or
malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).)  “Malice is defined in the statute as conduct
intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (College Hospital, supra,
8 Cal.4th at p. 725.)  “The mere
allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an
award of punitive damages. Not only must there be circumstances of oppression,
fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a
claim.” (Grieves v. Superior Ct. (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166, internal
citations and footnotes omitted.)
Plaintiffs allege Defendant
failed to maintain the apartment Plaintiffs leased from Defendant in a
habitable condition and to remedy serious issues with the apartment even though
Plaintiffs informed Defendant of those issues. 
(See, e.g., Complaint, ¶¶ 108, 132.)  However, Plaintiffs do not allege any specific
facts to show Defendant acted with malice, rather than acted negligently.  As such, Plaintiffs have not alleged a claim
for punitive damages against Defendant. 
The Court grants the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages but
gives Plaintiffs the opportunity to amend the prayer.
Defendant moves to
strike allegations on information and belief. 
Plaintiffs may allege facts not within Plaintiffs’ knowledge on
information and belief (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th
531, 550), but Plaintiffs cannot allege facts they know directly on information
and belief (see Thompson v. Sutton (1942) 50 Cal.App.2d 272, 279 [when “facts
peculiarly within the knowledge of the party” is alleged on information and belief,
they are insufficient and should be stricken]). 
Plaintiffs’ allegations in paragraphs 16, 17, 20, 23, 35, and 36 are
necessarily within Plaintiffs’ knowledge. 
As such, the Court grants the motion to strike these allegations with
leave to amend.  Plaintiffs’ allegations
in paragraph 92 concern Defendant’s state of mind, of which Plaintiffs lack
direct knowledge.  The motion to strike
paragraph 92 is, therefore, denied.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ complaint
is overruled.
Defendant’s motion to strike paragraphs
16, 17, 20, 23, 35, and 36 is granted with leave to amend.  Defendant’s
motion to strike the punitive damages allegations is granted with leave to
amend.  Plaintiffs are to file an amended
complaint within 10 days. 
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of
this order and to file proof of service of same.
