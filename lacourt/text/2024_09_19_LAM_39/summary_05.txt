And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a defendant's motion to dismiss certain claims made by the plaintiff. The defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff's claims of negligence, premises liability, breach of the implied covenant of quiet use and enjoyment, or constructive eviction, so the court will not address those claims. The defendant did object to Exhibit 4, claiming it was not attached to the plaintiff's complaint, but the court found that the record shows the exhibit was indeed attached to the complaint, so the objection is overruled.
