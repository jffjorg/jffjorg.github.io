And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted Defendant's motion to require Plaintiff to furnish an undertaking in the amount of $263,058.42. The Court finds good cause to require the undertaking because of the risk of Plaintiff disposing of its assets or evading the judgment. The undertaking is required due to the large award of costs and the danger of asset dissipation. The Court has exercised its discretion to impose an undertaking requirement to mitigate any injustices arising from the costs-only judgment rule.
