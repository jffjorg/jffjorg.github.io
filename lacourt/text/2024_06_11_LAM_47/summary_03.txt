```
case_number: 21STCV06963
hearing_date: 2024-06-11
dept: 47
judge: Theresa M. Traber
moving_party: Defendant Orion Housing, LLC
responding_parties:
  - Plaintiff Griffin M. Bracci
statement_of_material_facts_and_or_proceedings: |
  This is an action for breach of contract that was filed on February 23, 2021.
  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to provide proper notice of construction on the property which Plaintiff was leasing from Defendant, denying Plaintiff the full use of that property.
motion: |
  Plaintiff moves for summary judgment or summary adjudication of all causes of action.
tentative_ruling:
  - Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
  - Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Adjudication is GRANTED as to the first cause of action.
  - Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Adjudication is GRANTED as to the second cause of action.
discussion:
  - The Court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers, except evidence to which the Court has sustained an objection, as well as all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.
  - Plaintiff moves for summary adjudication of both causes of action asserted in the Complaint.
  - The purpose of a motion for summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.
  - Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and "all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence" and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
  - On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.
  - Once the moving party has met that burden, section 437c shifts the burden to the opposing party to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.
  - If the opposing party cannot do so, summary judgment should be granted.
  - When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the Court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers, except evidence to which the Court has sustained an objection, as well as all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.
  - Plaintiff requests that the Court take judicial notice of its July 19, 2023 order deeming the truth of the matters stated in Plaintiff's Requests for Admissions. Plaintiff's request is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d) (court records).
request_for_judicial_notice: |
  Plaintiff requests that the Court take judicial notice of its July 19, 2023 order deeming the truth of the matters stated in Plaintiff's Requests for Admissions.
first_cause_of_action: |
  Plaintiff moves for summary adjudication of the first cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
second_cause_of_action: |
  Plaintiff moves for summary adjudication of the second cause of action for breach of contract.
attorney's_fees: |
  Plaintiff also requests attorney's fees on this action. Plaintiff cites no authority authorizing a request for attorney's fees as part of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, and the Court declines to consider that issue in connection with this motion.
conclusion:
  - Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
  - Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Adjudication is GRANTED as to the first cause of action.
  - Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Adjudication is GRANTED as to the second cause of action.
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, finding that Plaintiff has demonstrated entitlement to summary adjudication of both causes of action. The court has also granted Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Adjudication as to the first cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and as to the second cause of action for breach of contract. The court has denied Plaintiff's request for attorney's fees on this action, citing lack of authority. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any party's submission on the tentative ruling.
