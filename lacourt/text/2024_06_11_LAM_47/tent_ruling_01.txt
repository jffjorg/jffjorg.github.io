STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This was an action for fraud, conversion, and breach of fiduciary duty.
Plaintiff alleged that the lawyer Defendants made misrepresentations to
it so that it would pay them $600,000 to provide services to another of their
clients, Paul Turley. The Court granted terminating sanctions on October 27,
2023 for repeated and flagrant misconduct by Plaintiff and its former counsel
of record and perpetration of a fraud on this Court. 
 
Defendant Bird, Marella, Boxer,
Wolpert, Nessim, Drooks, Lincenberg & Hrow, P.C. moves tor require
Plaintiff to furnish an underaking pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
917.9. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Defendant’s
Motion to Require Undertaking is GRANTED. 
 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to deposit an undertaking with this Court in the amount of
$263,058.42 within 5 days of this order. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Defendant Bird, Marella, Boxer,
Wolpert, Nessim, Drooks, Lincenberg & Hrow, P.C. moves to require Plaintiff
to furnish an undertaking pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 917.9. 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 916(a) states that, “[e]xcept as provided in Sections
917.1 to 917.9, inclusive, and in Section 116.810, the perfecting of an appeal
stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from
or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement
of the judgment or order, but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter
embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.” (Code Civ.
Proc § 916(a).) Ordinarily, under section 917.1, an appeal from an order or
judgment for money or for costs not available under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5 does not stay enforcement of the judgment unless an undertaking
is given. (Code Civ. Proc. § 917.1(a).) Where the award is solely for costs, however,
enforcement of the judgment is automatically stayed and no undertaking is
required. (Code Civ. Proc. § 917.1(d).) Notwithstanding that exception, section
917.9 provides, in relevant part:
 
(a) The perfecting
of an appeal shall not stay enforcement of the judgment or order in cases not
provided for in Sections 917.1 to 917.8, inclusive, if the trial court, in
its discretion, requires an undertaking and the undertaking is not given, in
any of the following cases:
 
. . . 
 
(3) The judgment
against appellant is solely for costs awarded to the respondent by the trial
court pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 1021) of Title 14.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 917.9(a)(3).) Thus, “[i]n a case where
the costs judgment is large or the danger of asset dissipation is acute,” the
Court may, in its discretion, impose an undertaking requirement and thereby
“mitigate any injustices arising from the costs-only judgment rule.” (Quiles
v. Parent (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 130, 144-45.) If the Court exercises that
discretion, “[t]he undertaking shall be in a sum fixed by the court and shall
be in an amount sufficient to cover all damages which the respondent may
sustain by reason of the stay in the enforcement of the judgment or order.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 917.9(b).) That undertaking “shall be conditioned upon the
payment of the sums required by the judgment or order appealed from if the
judgment or order is affirmed or the appeal is withdrawn or dismissed,” and, in
such case, “the appellant will pay all damages which the respondent may sustain
by reason of the stay in enforcement of the judgment.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
917.9(c).) This includes an amount sufficient to cover the costs awarded to the
responding party. (Code Civ. Proc. § 917.9(d)(2).)  
 
            Defendant
requests that the Court exercise its discretionary authority to require
Plaintiff to furnish an undertaking for the entire award of costs, totaling $263,058.42.
Defendant bases this request on the obfuscated and convoluted status of
Plaintiff’s assets and ownership as an ostensibly dissolved corporation (see
Declaration of Hilary Potashner ISO Mot. Exh. 2) and its conduct throughout the
course of this action. Defendant contends that, if an undertaking is not
required, there is an acute danger that Plaintiff will dissolve or distribute
its assets to evade the reach of the judgment, which, as Defendant accurately
observes, is quite large. 
 
            Rather than
recapitulate the lengthy procedural history of this case and disentangle the
layers of contradictory testimony by Plaintiff and its witnesses concerning
Frontline’s ownership and assets, the Court will simply reference its October
27, 2023 ruling granting terminating sanctions in which that information was
set forth in copious detail. (See October 27, 2023 Minute Order.) Based on the
evidence presented in connection with that motion, the Court is persuaded that
there is a substantial risk of Plaintiff disposing of its assets or otherwise evading
the judgment. The Court therefore finds good cause to require Plaintiff to
furnish an undertaking in an amount equal to the award of costs to Defendant. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Require Undertaking is GRANTED. 
 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to deposit an undertaking with this Court in the amount of $263,058.42
within 5 days of this order. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
