Background
 
On July 11, 2023, the Estate of Reginald Humphry by and through,
Deana Dodd, as Administratrix of the Estate (hereinafter “Plaintiff”) filed a
Complaint against the City of Los Angeles (“Defendant City”). The Complaint
alleges four causes of action: (1) Civil Rights Violation (Civ. Code, §§ 51.7,
52.1(b), and 52.1(h)); (2) Assault and Battery (Gov. Code, § 820); (3) False
Imprisonment (Gov. Code, § 820); and Negligence (Gov. Code, § 820.) 
 
On January 3, 2023, Defendant City filed a Motion for Judgement on the
Pleadings (“MJOP”). Plaintiff filed opposing papers on March 7, 2024. Defendant
City filed a Notice of Non-Opposition on March 22, 2023. The matter is now
before the court. 
 
motion for
judgment on the pleadings[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same
function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the
face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.” (Burnett
v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1064.) “In deciding or
reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all properly pleaded material facts are
deemed to be true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from
those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) When considering demurrers and judgment on the
pleadings, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v.
Transit Authority of City of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.)
A motion for judgment on the pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause
of action. (Id.) “In the case of either a demurrer or a motion for
judgment on the pleadings, leave to amend should be granted if there is any
reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Gami
v. Mullikin Medical Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.) A non-statutory
motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made any time before or during
trial. (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
A.        Plaintiff’s
Opposition 
 
Plaintiff filed opposing papers on
March 7, 2024, with proof of service attesting to service by email. On March
22, 2024, Defense counsel filed a declaration asserting that no opposition
papers had been received by mail, email, or any other means. (Ford Decl. ¶ 2.)
The court will proceed to address the Motion on the merits. If Defendant City
feels it has been prejudiced by the fact that it did not have notice that an
opposition to the Motion had been filed and did not have the opportunity to
reply, the court is amenable to continue the hearing to allow Defendant City an
opportunity to reply. However, the court feels that any prejudice is mitigated
by the fact that the court is inclined to grant Defendant City’s Motion for the
reasons outlined below. 
 
            B.
       The Complaint’s Allegations
 
This action arises out of an incident that occurred on July
5, 2022, in the City of Wilmington, CA which resulted in the death of the
decedent, Reginald Humphry. (Compl. ¶ 7.) Officers from the Los Angeles Police
Department (“LAPD”) responded to a call regarding a possible assault with a
deadly weapon suspect. (Comp. ¶ 7.) The Complaint alleges that LAPD officers
shot the Decedent with a beanbag shotgun, causing the Decedent to allegedly
drop what was in his hands and thereafter the Defendant Does 1 to 20 drew their
weapons and shot the decedent multiple times, causing the decedent to die later
in the hospital. (Compl. ¶¶ 10, 11.) 
Defendant City now demurs on the basis that the Complaint
fails to plead facts sufficient to sustain claims against the city. “‘In view of the
fact that tort causes of action against public entities are now based on
statute, the general rule that statutory causes of action must be pleaded with
particularity is applicable. Every fact essential to the existence of statutory
liability must be pleaded.’” (Richardson-Tunnell v. School Ins.
Program for Employees (2007) 157 Cal.App 4th 1056, 1061 citing Susman v.
City of Los Angeles (1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 803, 809.)  “[P]ublic
entities may only be held liable only if a statute is found declaring them to
be liable.” (Hoff v. Vacaville Unified School District (1998) 19 Cal.4th
925, 932.)
 
Here, the Complaint fails to allege a statutory basis that
would permit Defendant City to be held liable directly for the actions or
inactions of several Doe Defendants. Nor does the Complaint allege a statutory
basis that would permit Defendant City to be held vicariously liable for the acts
or omissions of the Doe Defendants. 
 
Plaintiff’s only statutory reference is to Gov. Code § 820
which imposes direct liability on public employees but not a direct liability
on government entities.[2] For
example, in Scruggs v. Haynes (1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 256, the appellate
court found that the government entity could be held liable for the acts of its
police officers pursuant to Gov. Code § 815.2. (See id. at p. 268 [“It
follows that appellant city is not immune under subdivision (b) of section
815.2, and is vicariously liable under subdivision (a) thereof.”].) In Mary
M. v. City of Los Angeles (1991) 54 Cal.3d 202, the City was
held liable under the doctrine of respondent superior pursuant to Gov. Code §
815.2. (Id. at p. 209 [“The
doctrine of respondeat superior applies to public and private employers alike”].)
For example, in Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Authority
(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1178, the liability against the public entities under
the Bane Act was premised on breach of mandatory duty under Gov. Code § 815.6,
direct liability under Health & Saf. Code, § 1799.107; and vicarious
liability under § 815.2. In O'Toole v. Superior Court (2006) 140
Cal.App.4th 488, 493, liability under the Bane Act was brought pursuant to
breach of mandatory duty under Gov. Code § 815.6 and Pen. Code, § 626.6. 
 
Here, the Complaint makes no reference to Gov.
Code § 815.2 or any other statute that would permit imposing liability on
Defendant City.  In a conclusory manner,
the Complaint asserts that Does 1 to 40 were all acting within the scope of
their employment without stating facts to support the allegation. (See Compl. ¶
4.) “It is settled law that a pleading must allege facts
and not conclusions, and that material facts must be alleged directly and not
by way of recital.” (Ankeny v. Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. (1979) 88
Cal.App.3d 531, 53.) Because on demurrer conclusions of law are not admitted,
the Complaint is devoid of allegations to support the finding that the Doe
Defendants were acting within the scope of their employment when they shot the
decedent. Lastly,
Plaintiff must identify the individual officers and what act or omission they engaged
in that gives rise to the officer’s tort liability sufficient to show that
Defendant City can be held vicariously liable. (Koussaya v. City of Stockton
(2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 909, 945 [“[I[a specific individual officer has not
engaged in an act or omission giving rise to that officer's tort liability, the
City cannot be held vicariously liable”].)

Defendant City further asserts that its officers are immune
from liability. (See Pen. Code, § 835(a).) While Defendant bears the burden of
proving its affirmative defenses, it is Plaintiff’s responsibility to plead
facts to show that Defendant City is not immune from liability. Here no facts
are alleged to show that Doe Defendants owed a duty or that the Doe Defendants
are not entitled to immunity. “It is a plaintiff's responsibility to plead
facts sufficient to show their cause of action lies outside the breadth of any
applicable statutory immunity.” (Soliz v. Williams (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th
577, 585 [internal citation and quotation marks omitted].) 
 
Based on the above, the MJOP is granted
with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant City’s MJOP is granted with leave to amend.
Plaintiff is given 30 days leave to amend the Complaint. OSC Re. Amended
Complaint set for April 30, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. 
Defendant to give notice.
