  - "In view of the fact that tort causes of action against public entities are now based on statute, the general rule that statutory causes of action must be pleaded with particularity is applicable.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings (MJOP) with leave to amend. The plaintiff has 30 days to amend the complaint. The next order to show cause (OSC) is set for April 30, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The judge is granting the MJOP because the complaint fails to plead facts sufficient to sustain claims against the city. The complaint does not allege a statutory basis for holding the city liable directly or vicariously for the actions or inactions of the Doe defendants. The judge is requiring the plaintiff to plead facts to show that the city is not immune from liability and that the Doe defendants owed a duty.
