English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion for attorney's fees in the sum of $38,303.50 plus $3,455.31 in costs. The ruling is based on the defendants' prevailing party status in the breach of contract action, and the court finds that the defendants' hourly rates and hours spent litigating the action are reasonable. The court deducts certain hours from the lodestar figure to account for excessive or unnecessary work. The ruling is consistent with California law regarding attorney's fees and costs, and the Judge's discretion in determining reasonable attorney's fees.
