CCP § 439 requires the moving party to meet and confer
in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading before filing a
motion for judgment on the pleadings. Defense counsel asserts he tried to meet
and confer with Plaintiff before filing this action, but no resolution was
reached. (Smith Decl.¶¶ 3,4.) The court is satisfied that the meet and confer
requirement has been met.

Government Code § 820(a) states in the relevant
part: “Except as otherwise provided by statute (including Section 820.2), a
public employee is liable for injury caused by his act or omission to the same
extent as a private person.”
