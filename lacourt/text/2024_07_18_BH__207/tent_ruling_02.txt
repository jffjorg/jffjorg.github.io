BACKGROUND
 
This breach of contract case arises from a dispute regarding the
amount of back rent Defendants allegedly owe Plaintiff in connection with a
residential property lease.
 
On September 26, 2022, Plaintiff SM 10000 Property LLC (“Plaintiff”)
brought suit against tenant Defendants Nicolai Bergman (“Nicolai”), Amanda
McDermott-Bergmann (“Amanda”), and Nicolai Bergmann KK (“Nicolai KK”)
(together, “Defendants.”)  
 
Amanda answered the complaint, but default was entered against Nicolai
and Nicolai KK on August 10, 2023.
 
Plaintiff now moves for summary judgment against Amanda on the single
breach of contract cause of action. 
Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed.
 
LEGAL STANDARD – MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT
 
“[T]he party moving for
summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue
of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.]
There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would
allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the
party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.”
 (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.)
 “[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of
production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable
issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production, he causes a
shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden
of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a
triable issue of material fact.”  (Ibid.)  
 
“On a summary judgment
motion, the court must therefore consider what inferences favoring the opposing
party a factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence. While viewing the
evidence in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its primary function
is to identify issues rather than to determine issues.  Only when the inferences are indisputable may
the court decide the issues as a matter of law. If the evidence is in conflict,
the factual issues must be resolved by trial.” 
(Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839
[cleaned up].)  Further, “the trial court
may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine whose
version is more likely true.  Nor may the
trial court grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of
credibility.”  (Id. at p. 840
[cleaned up]; see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department of Transportation
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or
summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the
light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences
in favor of that party”].)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
“To prevail on a cause of
action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2)
the plaintiff's performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
the defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.”  (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)  
            
            Plaintiff has provided evidence that
on May 25, 2019, the parties entered into a 12-month lease agreement effective
April 25, 2019 to April 24, 2020, and to become month-to-month thereafter.  (UMF Nos. 1-3.)  Pursuant to the terms of the lease,
Defendants were to pay Plaintiff $11,850 in monthly rent.  (UMF No. 4.) 
Defendants also agreed to pay a $150 monthly technology fee, a $22,400
refundable security deposit, a refundable club amenity deposit of $2,000, a
$200 monthly storage fee, and a $150 annual club membership.  (UMF No. 5.) 
Defendants were also required to pay 100% of the electricity service
separately metered to the premises and billed by Plaintiff.  (UMF No. 6.) 

 
            After April 6, 2022, Defendants
failed to make any payments for rent, utilities, or technology fees.  (UMF Nos. 12-15, 18-19.)  After Defendants vacated the premises, Plaintiff
completed all repairs to the premises on December 6, 2023.  (UMF Nos. 19-20.)
 
The Lease further requires that if a resident fails to pay any portion
of rent when due and it remains owing on the fifth following the due date, the
resident owes liquidated damages of $400. 
(UMF No. 16.)  And as of December
6, 2023, Defendant’s outstanding principal balance due for rent, utilities,
technology fees, and late fees was $255,003.28. 
(UMF No. 20.)
 
The Lease also contains an attorney fee provision, entitling the
prevailing party to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees not to exceed $10,000.
(UMF No. 24.)  Plaintiff incurred $12,407.50
in reasonable attorneys’ fees and $2,421.97 in costs, and anticipates incurring
reasonable attorneys’ fees in the total amount of $14,829.47.  (UMF Nos. 27-30.)
 
Plaintiff further calculated prejudgment interest owed in the amount
of $31,828.76.  (UMF No. 21.)
 
Therefore, Plaintiff has met its initial burdens of establishing a
prima facie case that a lease agreement exists, Plaintiff performed under the
agreement by providing Defendants the premises, Defendants breached the
agreement by failing to pay the rental amounts owed, and as a result, Plaintiff
has suffered damages in the amount of $255,003.28.  
 
Because Amanda has not opposed the motion, she has not met her burden
of production to raise a triable issue of material fact.   Consequently, Plaintiff has demonstrated
entitlement to damages in the amount of $255,003.28, attorneys’ fees in the
amount of $10,000, costs in the amount of $2,421.97, and prejudgment interest
in the amount of $31,828.76.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Plaintiff’s unopposed
motion for summary judgment.   Further, the Court will enter the Order lodged
on April 29, 2024, and orders Plaintiff to lodge a proposed Judgment in
conformity with the Court’s ruling on or before August 1, 2024.  
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
