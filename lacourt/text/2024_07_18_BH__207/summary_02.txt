And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in this breach of contract case. The plaintiff, SM 10000 Property LLC, sued the defendants, Nicolai Bergman, Amanda McDermott-Bergmann, and Nicolai Bergmann KK, for failing to pay rent and other charges under a lease agreement. The defendants were required to pay $11,850 in monthly rent, as well as other fees and charges. They failed to make any payments after April 6, 2022, and the plaintiff completed repairs to the premises on December 6, 2023.

The judge found that the plaintiff has met its initial burden of establishing a prima facie case for summary judgment, and that the defendants have failed to raise a triable issue of material fact by opposing the motion. The plaintiff is entitled to damages in the amount of $255,003.28, as well as attorney fees in the amount of $10,000, costs in the amount of $2,421.97, and prejudgment interest in the amount of $31,828.76.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to lodge a proposed judgment in conformity with the court's ruling on or before August 1, 2024, and has ordered the plaintiff to provide notice of the court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
