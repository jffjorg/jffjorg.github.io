And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions brought by Defendant Claude Zdanow against Plaintiff Main Street Corridor, LLC. Zdanow argues that the Complaint was brought for an improper purpose and that the claims are unmeritorious under existing law. However, the judge finds that the Complaint was brought for a legitimate purpose and is not unmeritorious under existing law. The judge also finds that Zdanow has not demonstrated that the Complaint was brought for an improper purpose or that the claims are unmeritorious under existing law.

The judge notes that while Zdanow has provided some evidence that Mediakix was not as solvent as Plaintiff, Stadiumred, and Zdanow believed prior to the acquisition, Zdanow has not provided any evidence demonstrating that he did not fraudulently transfer Mediakix's pre-acquisition assets to himself or his other entities to prevent Mediakix from paying Plaintiff the rent it owed.

The judge also notes that the lease agreement between Plaintiff and Mediakix does not provide for an assignment of the lease to Stadiumred without Stadiumred's express assumption of the lease, and that there is no evidence that Stadiumred ever assumed the lease.

Finally, the judge declines to award sanctions due to the small accounting discrepancies and lack of evidence of bad faith by Plaintiff. The judge finds that the heart of Plaintiff's claims - that Mediakix owes approximately $251,984.94 in back rent - is substantially supported, and that the evidence may ultimately reveal that Mediakix had hidden financial problems before the acquisition and that the COVID-19 pandemic strained Mediakix's finances beyond the brink.
