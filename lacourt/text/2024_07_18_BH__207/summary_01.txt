And here is the English text summary:

The Judge, Michael E. Whitaker, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to continue the trial date from September 3, 2024, to a later date on or after October 21, 2024, filed by Defendant Gilberto Rios dba Beto's Drywall & Plaster Interior Finishes. The motion is unopposed, but the Judge denies the motion without prejudice. The Judge finds that Beto's counsel's vacation is not a sufficient reason for a continuance, as it was planned before the trial date was set, and Beto's counsel has still not filed an answer to the operative complaint. The Judge also notes that the case is extremely aged and the parties are running up against the five-year rule, and the Court's trial calendar is very impacted.
