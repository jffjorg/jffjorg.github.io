RESPONDING PARTY(S): N/A
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for conversion that was filed on August 22, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s principal misappropriated confidential and
sensitive personal information belonging to Plaintiff’s claimants.

Plaintiff’s Motion for Entry of
Default Judgment and Permanent Injunction is GRANTED IN PART as described
herein. Plaintiff is directed to prepare and serve a revised proposed judgment
reflecting the Court’s ruling within 10 days of this order. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves for entry of
default judgment and (1) compensatory damages; (2) treble damages under Penal
Code section 496; (3) attorney’s fees and costs; and (4) an order (a) enjoining
Defendant from using, disclosing, or disseminating Plaintiff’s confidential
claimant information or any copies of that information; (b) requiring Defendant
to return all of Plaintiff’s property in its possession; (c) requiring
Defendant to preserve all of Plaintiff’s confidential claimant information in
its possession, custody, or control pending Plaintiff’s retrieval of that
information; and (d) enjoining Defendant from doing business in California
while suspended by either the California Secretary of State or Franchise Tax
Board. 
 
Legal Standard for Default Judgment
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 585(b) governs default judgments in actions other than
an action arising upon contract or judgment for recovery of money or money
damages only. Under this provision:
 
[I]f the defendant
has been served, other than by publication, and no answer, demurrer, notice of
motion to strike of the character specified in subdivision (f), notice of
motion to transfer pursuant to Section 396b, notice of motion to dismiss
pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 583.210) of Chapter 1.5 of Title
8, notice of motion to quash service of summons or to stay or dismiss the
action pursuant to Section 418.10 or notice of the filing of a petition for
writ of mandate as provided in Section 418.10 has been filed with the clerk of
the court within the time specified in the summons, or within further time as
may be allowed, the clerk, upon written application of the plaintiff, shall
enter the default of the defendant. The plaintiff thereafter may apply to the
court for the relief demanded in the complaint. The court shall hear the
evidence offered by the plaintiff, and shall render judgment in the plaintiff's
favor for that relief, not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint, in the
statement required by Section 425.11, or in the statement provided for by
Section 425.115, as appears by the evidence to be just. If the taking of an
account, or the proof of any fact, is necessary to enable the court to give
judgment or to carry the judgment into effect, the court may take the account
or hear the proof, or may, in its discretion, order a reference for that
purpose. If the action is for the recovery of damages, in whole or in part, the
court may order the damages to be assessed by a jury; or if, to determine the
amount of damages, the examination of a long account is involved, by a
reference as above provided.

            Plaintiff’s
Requests are GRANTED as public records which may be judicially noticed as
official acts pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(c). (See SC Manufactured
Homes, Inc. v. Liebert (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 68, 82, fn.8.) 
 
Service of Process
 
            A default
or default judgment may only issue under Code of Civil Procedure section 585(b)
“if a defendant has been served, other than by publication.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
585(b). Service of process may be accomplished via personal service, (Code Civ.
Proc. § 415.10), substituted service (Id. § 415.20), or by mail (Id.
§ 415.30.) Service on a corporation may be accomplished by delivering a copy of
the summons and complaint to the person designated as agent for service of
process or to a head, senior officer, or other person authorized by the
corporation to accept service of process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 416.10 (a)-(b).) 
 
            The Amended
Proof of Service filed with the Court on February 8, 2024 states that personal
service of the Summons and Complaint was made on September 5, 2023 at 4:00 PM
on Jamie Padilla, a person authorized to accept service, at 628 S. Aviation
Boulevard, Manhattan Beach, CA 90266. According to the California Secretary of
State’s public records, this address is the address of MMTS, Inc. (RJN Exh. 3.)
MMTS Inc. is listed as the designated agent for Defendant. (RJN Exh. 1.)
Plaintiff has demonstrated proper service of process. 
 
Entry of Default
 
            A default
may not be entered until the time for the party to respond to the complaint has
expired. (Code Civ. Proc. § 585 (b).) When a default is sought, the default
must include an affidavit stating that it was mailed to the defendant’s
attorney of record or the last known address of the Defendant. (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 587.) 
 
            The
operative request for entry of default and default judgment was filed on
February 15, 2024, more than five months after service of the summons and
complaint. (Request for Entry of Default/Judgment.) The request was served by
mail on the same address where service of process was effected on February 15,
2024. (Id. POS.) Default was entered on the date the request was filed.
(Id. p. 1.) 
 
Circumstances Voiding Default
 
            Plaintiff
has not amended the Complaint since the request was filed, and Defendant has
never appeared in the action. Moreover, although no notice of punitive damages
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.115(f) has been served,
Plaintiff is not seeking to recover punitive damages, notwithstanding the
prayer for such relief in the Complaint. The Court therefore finds that there
are no circumstances which warrant setting aside the default as void under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(d) at this time. 
 
Mandatory Filings
 
            California
Rule of Court 3.1800 sets forth specific requirements for the contents of an
application for entry of default judgment:
 
A party seeking a
default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100), unless the
action is subject to the Fair Debt Buying Practices Act, Civil Code section
1788.50 et seq., in which case the party must use mandatory Request for
Entry of Default (Fair Debt Buying Practices Act) (form CIV-105). In
an unlawful detainer case, a party may, in addition, use optional Declaration
for Default Judgment by Court (form UD-116) when seeking a court
judgment based on declarations. The following must be included in the documents
filed with the clerk:
 
(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim;
 
(2)
 Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested;
 
(3)  Interest
computations as necessary;
 
(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements;
 
(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought;
 
(6)  A
proposed form of judgment;
 
(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment;
 
(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and
 
(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.
 
(Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1800(A).) Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default was submitted on form CIV-100 and includes a declaration
of nonmilitary status, a cost memorandum, and a request for attorney’s fees.
(February 15, 2024 Request for Entry of Default/Judgment.) Plaintiff also
separately filed a proposed judgment, a request for dismissal of all Doe
Defendants, and several declarations in support of the motion. Plaintiff’s
memorandum of points and authorities includes a summary of the case. (Memorandum
of Points & Authorities p.1:19-4:28.)
 
Well-Pled Allegations
 
            Plaintiff
asserted six causes of action against Defendant: (1) Conversion; (2) Aiding and
Abetting Breach of Duty of Loyalty; (3) Breach of Privacy Rights; (4) Civil
Conspiracy to Violate Penal Code section 502; (5) Violation of Penal Code
section 496; and (6) Unfair Competition.
 
            In a
default case, no evidence is required to establish liability. (Kim v.
Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 281-82.) However, a defendant’s
failure to answer the complaint admits only well-pleaded allegations in
the complaint. (See Molen v. Friedman
(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.) To obtain any form of relief, Plaintiff
must therefore have pled sufficient facts to state a cause of action.
 
//
 
1.      Conversion
 
            To
establish a claim for conversion, a plaintiff must plead and prove (1) the
plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of property; (2) the defendant’s conversion
by wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3) damages.
 
            Here, the
Complaint alleges that Defendant, through its principal, knowingly interfered
with Plaintiff’s possession of its confidential claimant information by
misappropriating it and using that information for itself, causing Plaintiff to
incur monetary losses, including the costs of efforts to retrieve that
information without litigation. (Complaint ¶¶ 27-32, 35-37.) Plaintiff has
therefore pled sufficient facts to support a claim of conversion.
 
2.      Aiding
and Abetting Breach of Duty of Loyalty
 
            To allege a
breach of the duty of loyalty, a party must plead (1) the existence of a
relationship giving rise to a duty of loyalty; (2) a breach of that duty, and
(3) resulting damage proximately caused by that breach. (See, e.g., Huong
Que Inc. v. Luu (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 400, 510.) A defendant is liable for
aiding and abetting the commission of an intentional tort if the defendant
knows the others’ conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance
or encouragement to the other. (See Nasrawi v. Buck Consultants, LLC
(2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 328, 343.) 
 
            The
Complaint alleges that Keyan Aghili owed Plaintiff a duty of loyalty as a
Claimants Manager and, later, a Claims Supervisor. (Complaint ¶ 41.) The
Complaint alleges that Aghili breached that duty by stealing confidential
claimant information; and that Defendant abetted this breach by receiving that
information and hiring Aghili to do work for Defendant that created a conflict
of interest between Aghili and Plaintiff. (Complaint ¶¶ 42-46.) Plaintiff has
therefore pled a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of a duty of loyalty. 
 
3.     
Breach of Privacy Rights
 
            To allege a
breach of privacy rights, a plaintiff must plead (1) a legally protected
privacy interest; (2) a reasonable expectation of privacy; (3) the
offensiveness or seriousness of the intrusion; (4) resultant harm; and (5) that
the Defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing that harm. (See Hill
v. Nat. Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 24; Hernandez v.
Hillsides, Inc. (2009) 47 Cal.4th 272, 287-88.) Privacy must be evaluated
in reference to the identity of the alleged intruder and the nature of the
intrusion. (Sanders v. Am. Broadcasting Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 907,
914-915.)
 
            The
Complaint alleges that Plaintiff and its clients and claimants have a privacy
interest in their personal information, including medical conditions and
history, employment, social security numbers, dates of birth, and financial
information, in which they had a reasonable expectation of privacy. (Complaint
¶¶ 14, 52; Cal. Const. art. I § 1.) The Complaint alleges that Aghili’s theft
of that information and Defendant’s facilitation of that theft is both serious
and offensive, that it has harmed the clients and claimants, and that
Defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing that harm. (Id.
¶¶ 52-53.) Plaintiff, as custodian of that information, has standing to assert
the privacy interests of its customers. (See Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman
Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 471, 503.) Plaintiff has therefore
pled facts sufficient to support this cause of action.
 
4.      Conspiracy
to Violate Penal Code Section 502
 
            To allege a
civil conspiracy, a plaintiff must plead (1) the formation and operation of the
conspiracy; (2) wrongful conduct in furtherance of that conspiracy; and (3)
resulting damages. (Wittenberg v. Bornstein (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 303,
312 fn. 7.) To establish a claim under Penal Code section 502, Plaintiff must
prove: (1) Plaintiff is the owner of the computer system, computer network,
computer program and/or data; (2) Defendant knowingly accessed and without
permission (i) used any data, computer, computer system, or computer network in
order to wrongful control or obtain money, property, or data and/or (ii) took,
copied, or made use of any data from a computer, computer system, or computer
network, or took or copied any supporting documentation, whether existing or
residing internal or external to a computer, computer system, or computer
network; (3) Defendant’s use of the computer systems was without Plaintiff’s
permissions; (4) Plaintiff was harmed; and (5) Defendant’s conduct was a
substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s harm. (Penal Code, § 502(c)(1)-(2).)
 
            The
Complaint plainly alleges that Aghili planned with Defendant to access
Plaintiff’s computer systems and steal customer and claimant information stored
therein for the benefit of Defendant. (Complaint ¶¶ 14-15, 18, 23-32; 58-60.)
The Complaint alleges that Defendant’s conduct harmed Plaintiff by obligating
Plaintiff to act to preserve its clients’ privacy. (Complaint ¶ 61.) Plaintiff
has therefore pled facts sufficient to support this claim.
 
5.      Violation
of Penal Code Section 496
 
            To plead a
violation of Penal Code section 496(a), a plaintiff must allege (1) that property
was stolen or obtained in a manner constituting theft; (2) the Defendant knew
the property was stolen; and (3) the Defendant received possession of that
property. (Switzer v. Wood (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 116, 126.) 
 
            The
Complaint squarely alleges that Defendant received confidential information
which was the property of Plaintiff that was stolen by Aghili with knowledge
that the property was stolen. (Complaint ¶¶ 64-65.) Plaintiff has therefore
pled facts sufficient to support this cause of action.
 
6.      Unfair
Competition
 
            Section
17200 of the Business and Professions Code prohibits “any unlawful, unfair, or
fraudulent business practice.” (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200.) Any person who
has been injured by a violation of section 17200 is entitled to restitution and
injunctive relief. (Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17203, 17204.) Violation of
“[v]irtually any law—federal, state, or local—can serve as a predicate for an
action” under this section. (Ticconi v. Blue Shield of Cal. Life &
Health Ins. Co. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 528, 539.) This cause of action is
therefore derivative of the previous five causes of action. (See Complaint ¶
69.) Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant has violated Corporations Code
section 2205 and Revenue & Tax Code section 23301 et seq. by
operating in California while suspended by the Secretary of State and/or
Franchise Tax Board. (Id.) Thus, as Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts
to state those causes of action, it has likewise sufficiently pled the sixth
cause of action. 
 
Compensatory Damages
 
            Plaintiff
first requests an award of compensatory damages in the amount of $408,030.20. This
amount is the gross salary paid to Kenyan Aghili from January 1, 2021 through
the date of his resignation. (Supplemental Declaration of Victoria Gonzales ISO
Mot. ¶ 3.) 
 
            A party who
prevails on a claim for breach of a duty of loyalty is entitled to damages
which will compensate for all the detriment proximately caused by the breach.
(Civ. Code § 3333.) In the case of a breach of the duty of loyalty to an
employer by an employee, disgorgement of salary and benefits by the employee is
a proper remedy. (Service Employees Inter’l Union, Local 250 v. Colcord
(2008) 160 Cal.4th 362, 371.) Plaintiff cites no authority standing for the
position that disgorgement of these benefits can be sought from Defendant,
rather than from Aghili himself. Similarly, Plaintiff cites no authority establishing
that Business & Professions Code section 17203 contemplates such relief. Moreover,
absent any alter ego claims—which Plaintiff has not asserted—the Court fails to
see how a corporation could have obtained a salary paid to one of its employees
by another corporation such that disgorgement of that salary could be
compelled. 
 
            Indeed, the
only monetary damages to which Plaintiff’s entitlement is apparent from the
papers are the costs of the investigation to determine what Aghili and
Defendant had done to Plaintiff’s computer systems, totaling $2,863.65.
(Declaration of Michael Kunkel ISO Request for Entry of Default ¶¶ 5-11.)
Expenditures that are “reasonable and necessarily incurred by the owner or
lessee to verify that a computer system, computer network, computer program or
data was or was not altered, damaged, or deleted by the access.” (Pen. Code §
502 (e)(1).) These costs alone are recoverable. Further, as Plaintiff has
justified these costs, Plaintiff has likewise justified in claiming an
additional $5,727.30, accounting for treble damages under Penal Code section
496(c). The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated entitlement
to a total of $8,590.95 in compensatory damages. 
 
//
 
//
Permanent
Injunction
 
Plaintiff also requests a permanent injunction (a)
enjoining Defendant from using, disclosing, or disseminating Plaintiff’s
confidential claimant information or any copies of that information; (b)
requiring Defendant to return all of Plaintiff’s property in its possession;
(c) requiring Defendant to preserve all of Plaintiff’s confidential claimant
information in its possession, custody, or control pending Plaintiff’s
retrieval of that information; and (d) enjoining Defendant from doing business
in California while suspended by either the California Secretary of State or
Franchise Tax Board. 
 
Injunctive relief is available for privacy
violations. (Richardson-Tunnell v. Sch. Ins. Program for Employees (SIPE)
(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1056, 1066 (disapproved on other grounds by Leon v.
Cnty. of Riverside (2023) 14 Cal.5th 910, 930-931).) Injunctive relief is
also available for violations of Penal Code section 502, and under the Unfair
Competition Law. (Pen. Code § 502(e)(1); Bus. & Prof. Code § 17203.) To be
entitled to a permanent injunction, a plaintiff must prove (1) the elements of
the claim involving the wrongful act to be enjoined; and (2) the grounds for
equitable relief. (E.g., San Diego Unified Port Dist. v. Gallagher
(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 501, 503.) Permanent injunctions are governed by Code of
Civil Procedure section 526, which authorizes such relief, as relevant here:
 
(1) When it appears by the complaint
that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded, and the relief, or any
part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act
complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually;
 
. . .
 
(4) When pecuniary compensation would
not afford adequate relief. 
 
(5) Where it would be extremely
difficult to ascertain the amount of compensation which would afford adequate
relief. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §526(a).) Plaintiff contends that injunctive
relief is necessary and appropriate because several of the claims asserted
entitle it to injunctive relief, and because it would be injured in a manner
that cannot be alleviated by pecuniary compensation if the private information
of Plaintiff’s claimants is not returned. Plaintiff also argues that it will
continue to be injured if Defendant is permitted to continue operating when not
in good standing with the California Secretary of State and Franchise Tax Board,
as Defendant’s conduct constitutes unfair or unlawful competition. The gravamen
of the Complaint is that Defendant wrongfully acquired Plaintiff’s confidential
claimant information for its own benefit, and logic therefore dictates that an
appropriate remedy is the return of that information before the misuse of that
information exposes Plaintiff to as-yet-undetermined liability. Further,
several of Plaintiff’s claims, including the unfair competition claims,
expressly entitle Plaintiff to injunctive relief. The Court finds that
Plaintiff has adequately demonstrated that injunctive relief is proper.
Attorney’s Fees
 
            Plaintiff
also seeks an award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $49,416.50 plus costs
in the amount of $765.16. 
 
1.      Entitlement to Fees.
 
            In
default cases other than those seeking purely monetary damages, there are no
special procedures for attorney fee awards. (Code Civ. Proc. § 585(a)-(b).) Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1021, the apportionment of attorney’s fees is
left to the agreement of the parties. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1021.) Further, a
party who prevails in an action is expressly entitled to recover costs, except
where otherwise provided by statute. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1032(b).) Attorney’s
fees, as authorized by contract, statute, or other law, are among these
recoverable costs. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(10).) For the purposes of these
statutes: 
 
“Prevailing
party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose
favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant
obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not
recover any relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than
monetary relief and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing
party” shall be as determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the
court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion
costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules
adopted under Section 1034. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1032(a)(4).) Penal Code sections 502 and
496 expressly entitle a prevailing party to attorney’s fees. (Pen. Code §§
496(c); 502(e)). Plaintiff is therefore entitled to attorney’s fees.
 
2.     
Reasonableness of Fees. 
 
Reasonable
attorney fees are ordinarily determined by the Court pursuant to the “lodestar”
method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134
Cal.App.3d 999, 1004 [“California courts have consistently held that a
computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”].) “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Ibid.)
In setting the hourly rate for a fee award, courts are entitled to consider the
“fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for
similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th
976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin
v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden
is on the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove the reasonableness of the
fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) 
 
The Court has broad discretion in determining the
amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be overturned
absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or
necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)  The
Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will
suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258,
274-275.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks a total of $49,416.50 in
attorney’s fees, accounting for 8.8 hours of attorney time by Attorney Aaron
Olsen at $690 per hour ($6,072.00), 20 hours of attorney time billed by
Attorney Darcey Groden at $545 per hour ($10,900.00), 27  hours of attorney time billed by Attorney
Darcey Groden at $595 per hour ($15,930.00); 29.9 hours of attorney time billed
by Attorney Jasmine Samuels at $445 per hour ($13,305.00) and 8.9 hours of
attorney time billed by Attorney James Teal at $440 per hour ($3,916.00.)
(Declaration of Darcey M. Groden ISO Mot. ¶ 12.) Attorney Groden testifies to
her own hourly rate, and that of her colleagues, but does not speak to their
respective experience. (Id.) That said, although itemized billing
records are not provided, Attorney Groden describes in detail the tasks
performed by each attorney and the hours incurred. (Id.) From this
testimony, the Court observes that Plaintiff’s counsel exercised billing
judgment, assigning the bulk of the work to those attorneys charging lower
rates to prevent runaway fees. The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has
demonstrated the reasonableness of the fee request.
 
Plaintiff also requests an award of costs in the
amount of $765.15, based on $640.75 in filing and motion fees and $125.00 in
service of process costs. (Memorandum of Costs.) Plaintiff filed and served a
Memorandum of Costs with the moving papers on February 9, 2024. (Memorandum of
Costs.) Plaintiff’s counsel also provides a detailed breakdown of the filing
fees and service of process costs incurred. (Groden Decl. ¶ 13.) Plaintiff has
therefore demonstrated the propriety of the claimed costs. 
CONCLUSION:
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Entry of Default Judgment and Permanent Injunction is GRANTED IN PART as
described herein. Plaintiff is directed to prepare and serve a revised proposed
judgment reflecting the Court’s ruling within 10 days of this order. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
