And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has ruled that Cross-Complainants' demurrer to the Answer to the Cross-Complaint is sustained, with leave to amend as to all affirmative defenses, except for the legal defense of failure to state a cause of action. This means that Cross-Defendant must file a First Amended Answer within 20 days from the date of the order. The Court has also granted leave to amend the answer, allowing Cross-Defendant to cure the defects in its pleading. The Judge has ruled that several of Cross-Defendant's affirmative defenses are invalid because they are conclusory and lack factual support.
