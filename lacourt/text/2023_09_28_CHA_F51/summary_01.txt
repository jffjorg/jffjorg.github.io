And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Mark T. Young, representing Mary Jo Davis, is continued. The motion was filed on July 5, 2023, and served on the client by mail. However, the proof of service is missing a signature. The judge has ordered Counsel to file a properly signed proof of service by the next hearing date. If the signature cannot be obtained, the motion will be continued to a later date. The judge has also noted that the statutory requirements for the motion have been satisfied, and Counsel's withdrawal does not raise the risk of unduly prejudicing his client.
