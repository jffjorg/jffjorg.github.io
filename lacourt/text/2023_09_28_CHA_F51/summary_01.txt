**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by attorney Mark T. Young to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Mary Jo Davis in case number 20CHCV00390.  

The Judge acknowledges that Mr. Young properly followed the procedural requirements for filing this type of motion, including providing notice to his client and filing the necessary forms. However, the Judge notes that the proof of service filed with the motion lacks a signature.

As a result, the Judge is continuing the motion to allow Mr. Young to submit a properly signed proof of service. If this cannot be obtained, the motion will be continued further.

The Judge states that while the motion appears to be procedurally sound, the necessity of relief will be further examined at the continued hearing.
