MOVING PARTIES: Plaintiffs JOSE H. NAUPARI VELEZ and JESUS
J. NAUPARI RODRIGUEZ
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant KIA AMERICA, INC.
The court
considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND
This is a lemon law case. Plaintiffs Jose H. Naupari Velez
and Jesus J. Naupari Rodriguez filed the complaint against defendant Kia
America, Inc. on February 23, 2023. Plaintiffs allege the following causes of
action: (1) violation of Song-Beverly Act – breach of express warrant; (2)
violation of Song-Beverly Act – breach of implied warranty; and (3) violation
of Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2. Plaintiffs allege that on July 1, 2022,
they purchased a 2023 Kia Sportage (subject vehicle). Plaintiffs allege that
the subject vehicle was delivered to or developed serious defects and
nonconformities to warranty to the electrical, transmission, engine and emission systems. These issues
include abnormal noise while operating the HVAC system and a “Check hybrid
system” message.
LEGAL STANDARD
With respect to requests for production of documents there
are three appropriate responses: (1) a statement that the party will comply
with the request; (2) a statement of inability to comply; or (3) an objection.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210(a).)
The requesting party may move for an order compelling
further responses to request for production of documents if any of the
following apply: (1) a statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete;
(2) a representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive; or (3) an objection in the response is without merit or too general.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(a).)
The motion must be filed within 45 days from verified
responses, supplemental responses, or a specific later date agreed to in
writing (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) Failure to make motion within the
specified period constitutes waiver of right to compel a further response.
(Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) The time period is
mandatory and jurisdictional in the sense that it renders the Court without
authority to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them. (Id.)
The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(b)(2).) The purpose of the meet and confer requirement is to encourage
the parties to make serious effort to work out differences informally and avoid
a need for a formal order. (Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87
Cal. App. 4th 1006, 1016.)
Under Rule of
Court 3.1345, the movant must submit a separate statement along with the motion
to compel further responses. The movant must include specific facts showing
good cause justifying further responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).)
DISCUSSION
A. Timeliness
Defendant served responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set Two on September 9, 2024, consisting of objections. (Jung Decl.,
¶ 14; Exh. 4.) Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 subdivision (c),
the time limit for bringing a motion to compel further responses runs from the
service of a verified response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) Because the
responses consisted only of objections, verifications are not necessary. Since
plaintiffs filed this motion on October 15, 2024, this motion is timely.
B. Meet and Confer
Plaintiffs’ counsel states that on October 2, 2024,
plaintiffs’ counsel sent defendant’s counsel a letter attempting to meet and
confer in good faith regarding the responses. (Jung Decl., ¶ 16; Exh. 5.) Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(b)(2), the parties are required to
meet and confer prior to filing a motion to compel further responses and are
required to file a declaration stating facts showing a reasonable and good
faith attempt at an informal resolution. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(2).)
Defendant’s counsel states that defendant failed to prepare its responses to
plaintiffs’ requests during settlement discussions and requested an extension
to its responses to provide verified substantive responses, but plaintiffs
failed to respond to the extension request. (Chang Decl., ¶ 6.) The court finds
that sending one letter via email does not constitute a good faith effort to
meet and confer. Accordingly, the court orders the parties to meet and confer.
Based on the foregoing, the court CONTINUES the motion to
February 3, 2025 at 8:30 a.m., to allow the parties to meet and confer. The
court orders the parties to file an updated joint statement five days prior to
the next hearing addressing any remaining issues.
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
