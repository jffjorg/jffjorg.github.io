The court finds that the single letter sent by Plaintiffs' counsel to Defendant's counsel does not constitute a good faith effort to meet and confer, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(b)(2). The court orders the parties to file an updated joint statement five days prior to the next hearing addressing any remaining issues.
