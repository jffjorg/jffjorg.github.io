And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court considered the demurrer filed by defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation, but since no opposition was received, the court did not consider the demurrer on the merits. The plaintiff, Rafik Dermehrabian, filed a first amended complaint on November 21, 2024, which is deemed filed and operative. The court grants plaintiff leave to amend the complaint, as the initial complaint was deficient in providing sufficient facts. The court notes that an amendment to the pleading after the date for filing an opposition to the motion to strike requires stipulation by the parties, but in this case, the amendment was filed before the opposition due date.
