The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the defendant's 75 motions, including 50 motions to compel initial responses and 25 motions to deem requests for admission admitted. Since no oppositions were filed, the judge has granted all 75 motions. The defendant is required to provide initial responses without objections within 20 days. The judge has also declined to award monetary sanctions, but notes that if there is a future request for terminating sanctions, all applicable plaintiffs should be consolidated in one motion only. The defendant is ordered to provide one proposed order relating to all 75 motions, and the moving party is responsible for giving notice.
