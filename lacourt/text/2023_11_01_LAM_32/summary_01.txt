(2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general." (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 2031.310(a))
  - "A statement of compliance 'shall state that the production, inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, and related activity demanded, will be allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party and to which no objection is being made will be included in the production.'" (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 2031.220)
  - "Defendant's response does not state whether the production will be allowed in whole or in part. The statement that Defendant will produce all documents in its possession is a separate requirement. Even if Defendant produces all documents in its possession, that may only constitute part of the request."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The plaintiff, Kristina Turpin, alleged employment discrimination against the defendant, Learning with a Difference, Inc. The defendant objected to several requests for production, claiming that they were overbroad, vague, and not relevant to the claims being litigated.

The judge found that the defendant's responses were incomplete and inadequate, and therefore granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses. The judge ordered the defendant to provide a further response to the subject RFPs within 15 days. The judge also denied sanctions, finding that the parties acted with substantial justification.

The judge's ruling requires the defendant to provide a more detailed response to the requests for production, including a statement of compliance with the demand and an explanation of any inability to comply. The judge also found that the defendant's objections to the requests for production were without merit, and therefore the requests are deemed relevant and necessary for discovery.
