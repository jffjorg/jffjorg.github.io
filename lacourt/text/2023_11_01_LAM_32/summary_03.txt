And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by Jonathan Martin and Paul Scott to the complaint filed by Anton Toutov. The demurrer was based on the argument that the causes of action asserted in the complaint are identical to those asserted in a prior federal action filed by Toutov against the same defendants. The judge agreed with the defendants that the primary right alleged in the complaint is the same as the primary right alleged in the federal complaint, namely the deprivation of Toutov's interest in Curative Labs Inc. and the corresponding share of revenue. The judge held that the legal theories asserted in the two complaints, one based on Penal Code section 496 and the other based on breach of fiduciary duty, are merely different legal theories based on the same harm, and therefore the causes of action are identical. As a result, the judge denied Toutov's motion to proceed with the state action and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
