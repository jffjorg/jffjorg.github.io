And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, American Honda Company, Inc., moves to compel arbitration in this lemon law action brought by plaintiff Rita Rozezadea. The defendant argues that the arbitration clause in the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) applies to the dispute and that it has standing to compel arbitration as a nonsignatory to the contract. The court considers the defendant's motion and finds that the arbitration clause does not apply to the dispute and that the defendant is not a third-party beneficiary of the RISC. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration.
