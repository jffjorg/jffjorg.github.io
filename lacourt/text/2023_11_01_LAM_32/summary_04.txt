And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel General Motors to produce a Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) for deposition and to produce documents specified in the deposition notice. The plaintiff, Abraham Amouyal, claims that General Motors failed to produce a PMK and relevant documents as required by the deposition notice. The judge finds that General Motors must produce a PMK for deposition for certain topics, including repair orders and invoices, communications with dealers and call centers, and warranty claims. The judge also orders General Motors to produce certain documents, including repair orders and invoices, communications with dealers and call centers, warranty claims, and recall notices and technical service bulletins. The judge denies sanctions, finding that both parties acted with substantial justification. The judge's ruling is tentative and will be subject to further revision and finalization at the hearing on November 1, 2023.
