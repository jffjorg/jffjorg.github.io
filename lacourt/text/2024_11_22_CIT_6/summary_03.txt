And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion to continue the trial date and all related deadlines. The defendants had requested a continuance citing the need to complete discovery, review over 980,000 documents produced in June 2024, and review a physical copy of a server hard drive received on October 11, 2024. The judge finds that the defendants have not demonstrated good cause for the continuance, as they have not shown diligence in their discovery efforts. The judge notes that the case has been pending for almost two years and that the parties recently stipulated to a continuance. The judge also finds that the probative value of the documents contained within the server hard drive is speculative. The judge orders the plaintiff to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
