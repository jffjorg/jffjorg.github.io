  Case Number:  20STCV11677    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Nobia  Joyce v. Shawn M. Millner, et al.  Plaintiff’s  Motion to Compel Responses/ or Alternatively to Compel Further Response [sic]  to Special Interrogatories, Set One Without Objections  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s alternative  motion to compel further responses as to Special Interrogatory Numbers 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 37, 41, 42,  43, 45, 48, and 52. Defendant Millner must provide code-compliant verified  further responses, without further objections, to these interrogatories within  30 days of the Court’s order.  The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion as to Special  Interrogatory Numbers 29, 35, 39 and 53.  The Court  GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $2,137.50,  comprised of 3.5 hours preparing the motion and reply and 1.0 hour appearing at  the hearing on the motion, for a total of 4.5 hours, multiplied by the reduced  hourly rate of $475.00. Defendant Millner and her counsel of record must pay  said monetary sanctions to counsel for Plaintiff within 30 days of the Court’s  order.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s rulings within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a  quiet title action. On March 20, 2020, plaintiff Nobia Joyce (Plaintiff) filed  this action against defendants Shawn M. Millner, the Shawn Marie Millner  Revocable Trust (collectively, Millner), Laurence Todd (Todd) (Millner and Todd  may be collectively referred to as Defendants), and Does 1 through 20, alleging  causes of action for quiet title, partition, declaratory relief, and ejectment  and damages.   On November  29, 2022, Defendants filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff, Stephen R.  Golden, Stephen R. Golden & Associates, P.C., and Does 1 through 20. On  February 2, 2024, Defendants filed the operative Second Amended Cross-Complaint  (SACC) against the same parties, alleging causes of action for breach of the  July 5, 2018 Settlement Agreement, breach of the covenant of good faith of the  July 5, 2018 Settlement Agreement, fraud (No. 1), breach of the August 2018  Co-signor agreement, breach of the covenant of good faith breach [sic] of the August 2018 Co-tenant [sic] agreement, fraud (No. 2),  assault, battery, false imprisonment, negligent infliction of emotional  distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, slander of title, fraud  (No. 3), invasion of privacy, unjust enrichment, comparative indemnity, apportionment  of fault, breach of the May 2023 Settlement Agreement, and breach of the  covenant of good faith of the May 2023 Settlement Agreement. On August 27,  2024, the Court dismissed cross-defendants Stephen R. Golden and Stephen R.  Golden & Associates, P.C., from the SACC without prejudice.   On August  28, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed the First and Second Causes of Action for quiet  title and partition as to Defendant Todd without prejudice.   On October  10, 2024, Plaintiff moved to compel responses or alternatively to compel  further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, without objections. On  November 15, 2024, Millner’s counsel submitted a declaration in opposition to  the motion to compel. On November 18, 2024, Plaintiff submitted exhibits in  support of the motion. On November 19, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel submitted a  declaration to continue the hearing on the motion based upon the exhibits being  filed after the motion and based upon Millner’s late opposition. On November  20, 2024, Plaintiff replied to the declaration in opposition to the motion.  LEGAL STANDARD  Code of  Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a), provides that on receipt of  a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order  compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the  following apply:  (1) An  answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.  (2) An exercise of the option to  produce documents under Section 2030.230¿is unwarranted or the required  specification of those documents is inadequate.  (3) An  objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.   (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)   Code of  Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (d), further provides that “[t]he  court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it  finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification  or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)  PRELIMINARY ISSUES              Millner’s counsel’s declaration  submitted in opposition to the motion is untimely. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,  subd. (b).) Additionally, Plaintiff’s exhibits were untimely served as well. Nevertheless,  the  Court exercises its discretion to still consider Millner’s opposition and  Plaintiff’s exhibits, but admonishes the parties to comply with the requirements of  the Code of Civil Procedure going forward. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1300, subd. (d); Juarez v. Wash Depot Holdings, Inc. (2018) 24  Cal.App.5th 1197, 1202.) DISCUSSION              Meet  and Confer              The  Court finds Plaintiff’s efforts to meet and confer before bringing this motion  sufficient. (Barnes Decl., ¶¶ 5-10.)              Summary  of Arguments              Plaintiff  moves to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, from  Millner. Plaintiff indicates having initially served Special Interrogatories,  Set One, on Millner on June 7, 2021, and that Millner eventually served  responses on July 23, 2024, but virtually all of them contained objections. Plaintiff  indicates the parties eventually attended an Informal Discovery Conference on  August 27, 2024, in which Millner agreed to provide supplemental responses by  September 26, 2024. Plaintiff states that Millner provided unsigned and  unverified responses on September 25, 2024. Plaintiff contends she further  attempted to meet and confer regarding the problems with the responses, but to  no avail. Plaintiff contends further responses are needed for Plaintiff to prepare  her defense against Millner’s cross-complaint. Plaintiff also contends that if  Millner provides verifications for the responses at issue, Millner’s responses  are still improper because they were evasive, incomplete, and contained  numerous objections.              In  opposition, Millner’s counsel states that verified responses were sent on  September 25, 2024.              In  reply, Plaintiff contends the statement from Millner’s counsel are inconsistent  with the exhibits in the moving papers, and that there is no declaration from  his legal assistant attesting that the responses served in September were  verified. Plaintiff contends there is no credible evidence showing that Millner  served verified responses on Plaintiff by the date set in the Court’s August  27, 2024 minute order. Plaintiff reiterates that the responses received on  September 25, 2024, were unsigned and unverified.              Analysis  The Court finds Plaintiff is entitled to an order  compelling further responses to some but not all of Millner’s supplemental responses.[1] The  Court does find that Millner’s supplemental responses served on September 25,  2024, were unsigned and unverified, as Plaintiff presented a copy of the unsigned and unverified responses from Millner.  (Exhibits ISO Motion to Compel (11/18/24), Ex. E.) Although Millner’s counsel  presented signed and verified responses with his declaration filed on November  15, 2024, the fact that Plaintiff has those same responses but unsigned and  without a verification persuades the Court that those are the responses that  Millner served on September 25, 2024. (See Exhibits ISO Motion to Compel  (11/18/24), Ex. E; Bowman Decl. (11/15/24), Ex. 1.) However, by virtue of  filing and serving the declaration on November 15, 2024, Millner has now served  signed and verified further responses, albeit untimely. (See Minute Order re  FSC (8/27/24).) As such, the initial basis for Plaintiff’s motion is now moot.              However,  Plaintiff anticipated that Millner might serve the signed and verified  responses after Plaintiff filed this motion and alternatively requested that the  Court compel further responses on the grounds that Millner’s supplemental  responses are evasive, incomplete, and contain meritless objections. Having  reviewed Plaintiff’s separate statement, the Court does not find Millner  improperly asserted objections in her supplemental responses, as Millner merely  referenced the objections asserted in the original responses. But, the Court does  agree with Plaintiff that a number of Millner’s responses are incomplete and  not fully responsive, namely Special Interrogatory Numbers 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17,  37, 41, 42, 43, 45, 48, and 52. These  interrogatories request Millner to identify annual salary amounts and witnesses, provide the locations of such witnesses, or identify documents, dates,  amounts of bills, and other details, but such information was not provided. For  example, the supplemental responses to Numbers 9 and 10 request Millner’s  annual salary. Defendant responded with an estimate above the average median  income. Plaintiff is entitled to a direct and concise response and Defendant  must make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information.  Defendant’s response does not indicate such effort was made. With respect to  Number 11, Defendant must identify documents reflecting her salary for the  request years, not state Defendant’s deposition. As an additional example, Numbers  14, 15 and 48 request amounts of medical bills and the types, dates and number  of treatments or consultations or counseling sessions. Defendant’s responses do  not provide any of this information.  The Court also notes that the declaration from Millner’s  counsel submitted in opposition to the motion does not address Plaintiff’s  arguments regarding evasive and incomplete responses, which the Court construes  as a tacit admission that Plaintiff’s arguments on those points are  meritorious. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410;  C. Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro.  Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10; see also Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v.  Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 [“Contentions are waived  when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations to  authority. [Citation]”].)  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s alternative  motion to compel further responses as to Special Interrogatory Numbers 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 37, 41, 42,  43, 45, 48, and 52. Millner must provide code-compliant verified further  responses, without further objections, to these interrogatories within 30 days  of the Court’s order.  The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion as to Special  Interrogatory Numbers 29, 35, 39 and 53.  With  respect to monetary sanctions, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request in the  reduced amount of $2,137.50, comprised of 3.5 hours preparing the motion and  reply and 1.0 hour appearing at the hearing on the motion, for a total of 4.5  hours, multiplied by the reduced hourly rate of $475.00. Millner and her  counsel of record must pay said monetary sanctions to counsel for Plaintiff  within 30 days of the Court’s order.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s alternative  motion to compel further responses as to Special Interrogatory Numbers 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 37, 41, 42,  43, 45, 48, and 52. Defendant Millner must provide code-compliant verified  further responses, without further objections, to these interrogatories within  30 days of the Court’s order.  The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion as to Special  Interrogatory Numbers 29, 35, 39 and 53.  The Court  GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $2,137.50,  comprised of 3.5 hours preparing the motion and reply and 1.0 hour appearing at  the hearing on the motion, for a total of 4.5 hours, multiplied by the reduced  hourly rate of $475.00. Defendant Millner and her counsel of record must pay  said monetary sanctions to counsel for Plaintiff within 30 days of the Court’s  order.  Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED in all other respects.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s rulings within five calendar days of this order.
