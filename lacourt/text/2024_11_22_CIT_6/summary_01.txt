And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nobia Joyce v. Shawn M. Millner, et al. Plaintiff Joyce moves to compel defendant Millner to provide further responses to special interrogatories, and the court grants the motion as to 14 of the 18 interrogatories. The court finds that defendant Millner's responses were incomplete and not fully responsive, and that Plaintiff Joyce is entitled to direct and concise responses. The court also grants Plaintiff Joyce's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,137.50, which represents 4.5 hours of time spent preparing the motion and reply, and appearing at a hearing on the motion. The court denies Plaintiff Joyce's motion as to the remaining four interrogatories, and orders defendant Millner to provide code-compliant verified further responses to the remaining interrogatories within 30 days.
