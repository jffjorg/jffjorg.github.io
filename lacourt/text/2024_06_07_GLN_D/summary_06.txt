And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the paperwork and is granting the unopposed motions to relieve the attorneys as counsel for both Kristine Cherkezyan and Total Plumbing & Rooter Services. The Court finds that the motions are necessary due to irreconcilable differences in the attorney-client relationships. The attorneys will be relieved effective upon the efiling of the proof of service of the signed order upon the clients. The Court notes that Department D encourages the use of audio or video appearances and advises parties to schedule these in advance.
