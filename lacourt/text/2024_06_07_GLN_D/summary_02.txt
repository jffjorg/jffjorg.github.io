And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to interrogatories. The plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to the interrogatories, which waived their right to produce and object to the interrogatories. The court orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the special interrogatories set two within 10 days without objection. Additionally, the court has awarded monetary sanctions of $1,300.00 to the defendant for the defendant's attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with the pending motion.
