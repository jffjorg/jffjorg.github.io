Greystar Real Estate Partners, LLC, et al. MOTIONS TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY (4) Moving Party:  Defendant CP IV Glendale, LLC  Defendant Greystar Real Estate Partners, LLCResponding Party: Plaintiff Sashile Wood (No Opposition) RELIEF REQUESTED:Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Two Order deeming Requests for Admissions, Set One, admittedOrder deeming Requests for Admissions, Set Two, admitted   CHRONOLOGY:Date Discovery served:     February 20 2023 Date Responses served:  NO RESPONSES SERVED Date Motion served:     March 29, 2024     Timely OPPOSITION:  No opposition.   ANALYSIS:InterrogatoriesUnder CCP § 2030.290, “If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,” that party “waives any legal right to exercise the option to produce writings...as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product...”  Under subdivision (b), “The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.”  In this case, interrogatories have been directed at plaintiff and plaintiff has failed to serve timely responses. Plaintiff accordingly has waived the right to exercise the option to produce, as well as all objections.  Defendants have appropriately moved for orders to compel responses.  The court grants the motions and orders plaintiff to serve verified responses, without objection.   Requests for Admissions Under CCP § 2033.280, a party who fails to serve a timely response to requests for admissions “waives any objection to the requests.”   In addition, the requesting party may move for an order that “the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction....”   CCP Section 2033.280(b).   The code specifies that “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admissions have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the request for admissions that is in substantial compliance with section 2033.220.”  CCP section 2033.280(c).   In this case, requests for admissions were served on plaintiff and plaintiff has failed to serve timely responses and has therefore waived all objections.  Defendants have filed noticed motions requesting orders that the requests be deemed admitted as truth.  Unless satisfactory responses are served before the hearing, the court must grant the motions.SanctionsWith respect to Requests for Admissions, CCP section 2033.280(c) provides: “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admissions necessitated this motion.”With respect to interrogatories, under CCP § 2030.290(c), “The court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  CCP § 2023.010 provides that misuse of the discovery process includes “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where there has been such conduct, under CCP § 2023.030(a), “The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct....If a monetary sanction is authorized” by the statute, “ the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that the other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” CCP § 2023.030(a).  Under CRC Rule 3.1348(a): “The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”The burden is on the party subject to sanctions to show substantial justification or injustice.  Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young & Co. (1990, 2nd Dist.) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436.  In this case, plaintiff has failed to respond to authorized methods of discovery and made the motions necessary.  Defendants have submitted evidence showing that they have incurred expenses as a result of the conduct.  Since the motions are unopposed, there is no evidence that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.  Sanctions are awarded.  The sanctions requested are $1,250 for each of the two interrogatories motions, and $1,187.50 for each of the two RFAs motions.  The sanctions requested include 2 hours of time at $250 per hour for each motion to review opposition and prepare replies, but there are no oppositions, so that time will be minimal.  In addition, one hour of time is sought for each motion to attend the hearing, when all of the motions will be heard together.   The sanctions are adjusted accordingly as follows: 2 attorney hours [given no opposition filed] for each motion at $250.00 per hour for a total of $500.00 per motion with an addition 1 hour for one motion for defendant’s attorney’s appearance at or the remote hearing on 4 motions.RULING:[No opposition]Defendant CP IV Glendale, LLC’s UNOPPOSED Motion to
