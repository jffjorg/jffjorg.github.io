  Case Number:  24STCV20932    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2024    Dept:  49 Jessie Colvin Jr. v. Linder & Associates Real Estate Services Unlimited, et al.MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS MOVING PARTY: Defendants Linder & Associates Real Estate Services Unlimited, a California corporation, and California Property Law Group, APCRESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff Jessie Colvin Jr.STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:Plaintiff Jessie Colvin Jr. brings this action against his landlords, Defendants Linder & Associates Real Estate Services Unlimited and California Property Law Group, APC. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants turned his gas off and posted a Three Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit in retaliation for Plaintiff filing a separate lawsuit against them, 24STCV18850.Defendants now move to quash service of the summons. Plaintiff opposed. TENTATIVE RULINGDefendants’ Motion to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED.Moving parties are ordered to give notice.DISCUSSION:Motion to Quash Service of Summons and ComplaintDefendants move to quash service of the summons and complaint.  [FN 1]“A defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes:  (1) [t]o quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a).)  “[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.)  “[T]he filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper” but only if it “complies with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.”  (Id. at pp. 1441-1442.)  When a defendant moves to quash service of the summons and complaint, the plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective service.”  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868.)  “A court lacks jurisdiction over a party if there has not been proper service of process.”  (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 801, 808.)On August 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Electronic Service. The Proof of Service reflects that Plaintiff himself served the Summons, Complaint, and related documents by email on various individuals affiliated with the Defendant entities. (See 08/23/2024 Proof of Service.) This included Rafael Azizyan, one of Defendants’ attorneys. (Id.)First, only a person who is “not a party to the action” may serve a summons. (CCP § 414.10.) Plaintiff cannot serve the summons himself.Second, the manner of service on an entity is strictly proscribed by statute. With some exceptions not applicable now, service on a California corporation must first be attempted by personal service (CCP § 416.10(b)), substitute service (CCP § 415.20(b), or mail service and acknowledgment of receipt. (CCP § 415.30(a).) Based on the Proof of Service and Opposition, Plaintiff has not attempted these methods. The Code does not allow for service of a Summons and Complaint by email. Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Quash Service is GRANTED.Moving parties are ordered to give notice.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   October 25, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M. Hammock Judge of the Superior CourtFN 1 - A defendant generally has 30-days to move to quash service. The 30th day after service fell on Sunday, September 22, 2024. Defendants filed this motion on Monday, the following day, and it is therefore timely. (See CCP §§ 10, 12.) Any party may submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept49@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.  All interested parties must be copied on the email.  It should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
