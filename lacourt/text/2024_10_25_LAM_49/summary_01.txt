And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash service of summons filed by the defendants, Linder & Associates Real Estate Services Unlimited and California Property Law Group, APC. The plaintiff, Jessie Colvin Jr., brought this action against his landlords, alleging that they turned off his gas and posted a three-day notice to pay rent or quit in retaliation for his filing a separate lawsuit against them.

The judge ruled that the plaintiff's attempt to serve the summons and complaint by email was not proper service. According to California law, a person who is not a party to the action may serve a summons, but a plaintiff cannot serve the summons themselves. Additionally, the law requires specific methods for serving a summons on an entity, including personal service, substitute service, or mail service and acknowledgment of receipt. The plaintiff did not attempt these methods, and therefore did not establish personal jurisdiction over the court.

The judge noted that the defendants timely filed their motion to quash service, and that the plaintiff had the burden of proving the facts that gave the court jurisdiction. Since the plaintiff failed to meet this burden, the court found that it lacked jurisdiction over the defendants. The judge ordered the moving parties to give notice and granted the motion to quash service.
