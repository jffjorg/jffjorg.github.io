English-text summary: The judge's tentative ruling is in response to the City of Los Angeles' demurrer to the Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Bak Auto Enterprise Inc. and Ashot Keshishyan. The City argued that the Complaint fails to state sufficient facts, specifically that homeless encampments are not conditions/characteristics of public property, and that the City did not owe a duty of care to protect the Plaintiffs' business. The judge rejected these arguments, finding that the Complaint clearly states that the City failed to maintain foliage near known encampments and fires, which created a dangerous condition that led to the destruction of the Plaintiffs' business. The judge noted that the City's liability arises from its failure to maintain the property, not from failing to enforce laws. The demurrer is overruled, and the City is required to file an answer within 20 days.
