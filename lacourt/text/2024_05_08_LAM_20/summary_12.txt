English-text summary:

The tentative ruling discusses the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants in an employment action brought by Kathleen Sullivan against the Los Angeles Community College District and others. The Court overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff had adequately exhausted her administrative remedies and the complaint sufficiently alleged facts supporting her claims. The Court also denied the motions to strike, finding that the plaintiff's allegations of malice, oppression, and fraud were sufficient to support her claims for punitive damages. However, the Court granted the motion to strike as to one defendant, Genice Sarcedo-Magruder, finding that the plaintiff's allegations against her did not support a claim for punitive damages.
