## English Summary

The judge is considering a motion by Defendant PTI Union, LLC to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.  Plaintiffs Stephen and Robin Anderson allege Stephen was injured due to asbestos exposure from Defendant's products.

Defendant argues it lacks sufficient connection to California to be subject to the court's jurisdiction. Defendant claims it is a Missouri-based company, not involved in the distribution, sale, or marketing of its products in California.  

Plaintiffs counter that Defendant's manufacturing and packaging of products for customers who shipped those products to California demonstrates an intentional effort to serve the California market.  

The judge grants Plaintiffs' request for further discovery to investigate the extent of Defendant's efforts to market its products in California and whether those efforts were substantial enough to establish jurisdiction. The hearing on the motion to quash is continued to December 20, 2023.

And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant PTI Union, LLC. The defendant is arguing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because it is a Delaware company located in Missouri and has no connections to California. The plaintiff, Stephen Anderson, alleges that he was injured as a result of asbestos exposure from the defendant's products.

The judge is considering whether the defendant has purposefully availed itself of the forum by manufacturing and packaging products for customers who directed the products to be shipped to California. The judge is granting the plaintiff's request for discovery on this issue and is continuing the hearing to December 20, 2023. The parties may file supplemental briefs on regular notice.

English text:
The tentative ruling is for a hearing on a motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. The plaintiffs, Stephen Anderson and Robin Anderson, allege that Stephen Anderson was injured as a result of asbestos exposure from the defendant, PTI Union, LLC’s products. The defendant filed a motion to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of personal jurisdiction. The court may dismiss the complaint in whole or as to that defendant when dismissal is made pursuant to Section 418.10. The court may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United States. A defendant may move to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her. When a defendant moves to quash service of process on jurisdictional grounds, the plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction. A defendant is subject to a state’s general jurisdiction if its contacts “are so continuance and systematic as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.” A nonresident defendant may be subject to the specific jurisdiction of the forum “if the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits [citation], and the ‘controversy is related to or ‘arises out of’ a defendant’s contacts with the forum’.” The plaintiff must provide specific evidentiary facts, through affidavits and other authenticated documents, sufficient to allow the court to independently conclude whether jurisdiction is appropriate. The plaintiff cannot rely on allegations in an unverified complaint or vague and conclusory assertions of ultimate facts. Here, the defendant argues that there is no general jurisdiction over it because it is a Delaware company located in Missouri. The defendant further argues Plaintiffs cannot prove specific jurisdiction because Defendant blended talcum products in Missouri for customers, those customers directed the shipment of their products, and Defendant had no role in the release, distribution, sale, or marketing of those products. However, the defendant submitted no evidence of these assertions. The plaintiffs argue that Defendant placed the product in the stream of commerce. The plaintiffs have the right to discover whether Defendant’s manufacturing and packaging of products for customers who directed the products to be shipped to California was more than an isolated occurrence and arose from Defendant’s purposeful efforts to market its products in California. The hearing on the motion is continued to December 20, 2023 at 9 a.m. Plaintiffs may file a supplemental opposition brief and Defendant may file a supplemental reply brief on regular notice.
