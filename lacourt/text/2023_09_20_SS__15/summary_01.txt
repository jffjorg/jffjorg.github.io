And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion to quash service of summons filed by PTI Union, LLC, alleging lack of personal jurisdiction. The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that while PTI Union, LLC may not have had direct involvement in the sale and distribution of Gold Bond powder products in California, it did provide manufacturing and packaging services for customers who directed the products to be shipped to California. The court grants the request for discovery on issues of specific jurisdiction regarding PTI Union, LLC's efforts to serve the market for Gold Bond powders in California during the time Stephen Anderson was exposed to the product. The hearing on the motion is continued to December 20, 2023, at 9 a.m., and the parties are allowed to file supplemental briefs.
