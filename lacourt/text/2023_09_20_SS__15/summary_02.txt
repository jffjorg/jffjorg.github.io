  - Pfeifer v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270
Statutes:
  - California Civil Code Section 3294
  - OSHA regulations
Roles:
  - Plaintiff: Thanh M. Nguyen
  - Defendant: Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC
  - Judge: Undisclosed
Significant Statements:
  - "The defendant may, but need not, present evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's cause of action."
  - "The defendant may also present evidence that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence – as through admissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect that he has discovered nothing."
  - "If a plaintiff responds to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations, or simply provide laundry lists of people and/or documents, the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses."
```

Summary:

The tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion for summary judgment and grants the motion for summary adjudication as to the third cause of action (false representation) and punitive damages. The ruling denies the motion for summary adjudication as to the fourth cause of action (concealment and failure to warn).

The ruling finds that the Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to create a disputed issue of fact regarding the Defendant's liability for the Plaintiff's injuries, and therefore the motion for summary judgment is denied.

The ruling also finds that the Defendant has failed to shift the burden of production as to the third cause of action and punitive damages, and therefore the motion for summary adjudication is granted as to those claims.

The ruling denies the motion for summary adjudication as to the fourth cause of action, finding that the Defendant has failed to present sufficient evidence to support the claim.

  case\_number: "22STCV11362"
  hearing\_date: "September 20, 2023"
  department: "15"
  tentative\_order:
    - type: "Summary Judgment"
      defendant\_arguments:
        - no\_evidence\_of\_exposure: "Defendant argues Plaintiffs have no evidence to support their allegations of Nguyen’s exposure WHILE working on a 1986 Jaguar and a 1972 Jaguar."
        - brake\_work: "Nguyen testified he did brake work on the 1972 Jaguar and the vehicle had the original brakes on it."
        - no\_successor\_liability: "Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ discovery responses show they have no evidence that Nguyen removed asbestos-containing gaskets or original gaskets from the two Jaguars. However, Defendant did not conclusively establish that it has no liability as a successor-in-interest."
      plaintiff\_response: "Plaintiffs’ discovery responses are not factually-devoid, and Defendant did not shift the burden."
      ruling: "The motion for summary judgment is denied."
    - type: "Summary Adjudication of Third Cause of Action"
      defendant\_arguments:
        - no\_misrepresentation: "Defendant argues there is no evidence it made any misrepresentation."
        - plaintiff\_response: "Plaintiffs do not mention this cause of action and do not identify any evidence of any false representation."

    - type: "Summary Adjudication of Fourth Cause of Action"
      defendant\_arguments:
        - no\_evidence\_of\_concealment: "Defendant cites Plaintiffs’ responses to Special Interrogatory No. 9 to support the assertion that Plaintiffs have no evidence supporting this cause of action."

      ruling: "The motion is denied."
    - type: "Summary Adjudication of Punitive Damages"
      defendant\_arguments:
        - no\_clear\_and\_convincing\_evidence: "Defendant moves for summary adjudication of the punitive damages claim. When the motion targets a request for punitive damages, a higher standard of proof is at play."
      plaintiff\_response: "Plaintiffs do not mention punitive damages and do not identify any evidence supporting the assertion that Defendant continued to distribute asbestos-containing parts for over two decades after the early 1990s."
