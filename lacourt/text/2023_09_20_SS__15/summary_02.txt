  - Judge: Undisclosed
Significant Statements:
  - "The defendant may, but need not, present evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's cause of action."
  - "The defendant may also present evidence that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence – as through admissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect that he has discovered nothing."
  - "If a plaintiff responds to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations, or simply provide laundry lists of people and/or documents, the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses."
```

Summary:

The tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion for summary judgment and grants the motion for summary adjudication as to the third cause of action (false representation) and punitive damages. The ruling denies the motion for summary adjudication as to the fourth cause of action (concealment and failure to warn).

The ruling finds that the Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to create a disputed issue of fact regarding the Defendant's liability for the Plaintiff's injuries, and therefore the motion for summary judgment is denied.

The ruling also finds that the Defendant has failed to shift the burden of production as to the third cause of action and punitive damages, and therefore the motion for summary adjudication is granted as to those claims.

The ruling denies the motion for summary adjudication as to the fourth cause of action, finding that the Defendant has failed to present sufficient evidence to support the claim.

## Case Summary:

**Case Number:** 22STCV11362
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Department:** 15

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiffs:**  Not specified in the provided text.
* **Defendant:** Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC 

**Key Issues:**

* **Motion for Summary Judgment:** Defendant Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC argues Plaintiffs lack evidence to support claims that Thanh M. Nguyen was exposed to asbestos from Jaguar parts while working on two Jaguar vehicles (a 1986 and a 1972 model).
* **Motion for Summary Adjudication:**  Defendant also seeks summary adjudication of the third cause of action (false representation) and the fourth cause of action (punitive damages). 

**Summary of Judge's Ruling:**

* **Summary Judgment:** DENIED. The Judge finds Plaintiffs' discovery responses are not factually-devoid and Defendant did not conclusively establish they are not liable as a successor-in-interest.
* **Summary Adjudication:**
    * **Third Cause of Action (False Representation):** GRANTED. The Judge finds Plaintiffs did not provide evidence supporting this claim.
    * **Fourth Cause of Action (Punitive Damages):** GRANTED. The Judge finds Plaintiffs did not present evidence supporting their claim for punitive damages.


**Important Facts and Arguments:**

* **Nguyen's Testimony:** Nguyen, the Plaintiff, testified he worked on both Jaguar vehicles and replaced gaskets but does not recall the manufacturer of the gaskets. He did state he worked on the brakes of the 1972 Jaguar and they were original Jaguar brakes.
* **Defendant's Argument:** Defendant argues that evidence shows Jaguar brakes were asbestos-free by 1983 and gaskets were asbestos-free by 1987, and that Plaintiffs' discovery responses lack evidence Nguyen removed asbestos-containing gaskets.
* **Successor Liability:** Defendant argues they are not the successor-in-interest holding liability for Plaintiffs' claims. The Judge finds Defendant did not conclusively establish this argument.
* **Punitive Damages:** Defendant argues Plaintiffs failed to provide evidence of Defendant's knowledge of asbestos dangers, actions taken to protect its employees, knowledge that its products posed a danger, and failure to warn consumers.

**Relevant Statutes:**

* **California Civil Code Section 3294:** Addresses punitive damages.

**TENTATIVE RULING**

**Case Number:** 22STCV11362
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Dept:** 15

**I. Introduction**

This is a tentative ruling on Defendant Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC's ("Jaguar") motions for summary judgment (Jaguar) and summary adjudication. Jaguar moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims that Thanh M. Nguyen was exposed to asbestos from Jaguar's parts while working on two Jaguars, a 1986 and a 1972.

**II. Summary Judgment**

A. Jaguar argues that Plaintiffs have no evidence to support their allegations of Nguyen's exposure while working on the two Jaguars. However, Nguyen testified that he removed and replaced original gaskets on both cars. While Nguyen does not know who manufactured the gaskets, he does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence to establish the exposure.

B. Jaguar also argues that it is not a successor-in-interest holding liability for Plaintiffs' claims. However, Jaguar failed to provide a deponent on successor issues and did not attach the various agreements underlying the transactions, making it difficult to determine which entities assumed assets or liabilities.

**Conclusion**

The motion for summary judgment is DENIED. Jaguar did not conclusively establish that it has no liability as a successor-in-interest, and therefore did not shift the burden.

**III. Summary Adjudication of Third Cause of Action**

A. Jaguar moves for summary adjudication of the third cause of action for false representation under Restatement of Torts Section 402-B. Under this section, liability arises from justifiable reliance on false advertising.

B. Plaintiffs responded to a Special Interrogatory asking for all facts supporting the claims for false representations. However, the response does not mention any false representation, and is factually-devoid.

**Conclusion**

The motion for summary adjudication is GRANTED as to the third cause of action.

**IV. Summary Adjudication of Punitive Damages**

A. Jaguar moves for summary adjudication of the punitive damages claim. For a corporate defendant, the oppression, fraud or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.

B. Plaintiffs responded that the hazards of asbestos were known in the industry by the 1970s, yet Jaguar continued to distribute asbestos-containing products without adequate warnings. However, the response does not cite any evidence supporting this assertion.

**Conclusion**

The motion for summary adjudication is GRANTED as to punitive damages.

**V. Conclusion**

The motion for summary judgment is DENIED. The motion for summary adjudication is GRANTED as to the third cause of action and punitive damages and DENIED as to the fourth cause of action. The moving party is to give notice.
