## English Text Summary

The Judge is considering a motion for trial preference filed by the Plaintiffs, Kathleen Hiland and John Brockett. They argue that Ms. Hiland's stage IV mesothelioma, which is rapidly progressing, means she likely won't live beyond six months.  Therefore, they request an expedited trial under Code of Civil Procedure section 36.

The Judge reviewed medical documentation from Ms. Hiland's oncologist, Dr. Jiaxin Niu, which supports the claim that her condition is terminal. The Defendants, Hyster-Yale Group and Pneumo Abex, argued against the motion, but the Judge found the medical evidence convincing. 

Based on this, the Judge granted the motion for trial preference and set a trial date for January 16, 2024. A final status conference is scheduled for January 2, 2024, and a status conference to discuss the trial setting order is set for September 28, 2023.
