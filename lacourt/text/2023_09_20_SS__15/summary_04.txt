And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for trial preference filed by Plaintiffs Kathleen Hiland and John Brockett, who are seeking to expedite their personal injury case due to Hiland's illness caused by asbestos exposure. The judge finds that there is sufficient evidence to meet the clear and convincing standard for granting this motion, based on Dr. Jiaxin Niu's declaration providing details about Hiland's medical records, recent condition, and prognosis. The judge concludes that the interests of justice will be served by granting preference in this case, allowing Hiland to pursue her case while she is still able. The trial is set for January 16, 2024, and a final status conference is scheduled for January 2, 2024.
