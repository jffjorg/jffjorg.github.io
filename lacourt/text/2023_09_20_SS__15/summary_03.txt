**English Summary:**

The Judge is considering two motions to quash service of summons filed by defendants PTI Union, LLC and Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC. Both defendants are arguing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over them. 

In the first case, PTI Union argues it had no role in directing shipments of its products to California and therefore lacks specific jurisdiction.  The judge notes that Plaintiff must provide evidence to support its claim of jurisdiction over PTI Union. 

In the second case, Vanderbilt Minerals argues it is not subject to general jurisdiction in California and Plaintiff needs to prove its talc was in the products that caused Plaintiff's injuries. The judge agrees and orders jurisdictional discovery to determine if Vanderbilt Minerals' talc was present in the products that caused Plaintiff's mesothelioma. 

The hearings on both motions are continued to December 20, 2023, to allow for further discovery.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of summons filed by PTI Union, LLC and Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC. The defendants argue that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over them because they are not subject to California's general or specific jurisdiction. The plaintiff, Marquee Routh, alleges that he was injured as a result of asbestos exposure from the defendants' products.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for jurisdictional discovery to obtain evidence that the defendants' talc was in the DAP caulk products to which Routh was exposed. The defendants argue that they are not subject to California's jurisdiction unless the plaintiff can prove that Routh was exposed to their products in California.

The hearing on the motion is continued to December 20, 2023, at 9 a.m. for jurisdictional discovery. The plaintiff may file a supplemental opposition brief and the defendants may file a supplemental reply brief on regular notice. The moving party is to give notice.

English summary:
The tentative ruling is regarding two motions to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. The first motion is brought by PTI Union, LLC, and the second by Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC. Both defendants argue that they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the California court.

In the first motion, the plaintiff Marquee Routh alleges that her husband Mark Routh was injured as a result of asbestos exposure from PTI Union, LLC's products. The court states that a defendant may move to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, and that the court may dismiss the complaint without prejudice when dismissal is made pursuant to Section 418.10. The court cites the Due Process Clause, which protects an individual’s liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgments of a forum with which he has established no meaningful ‘contacts, ties, or relations.’ The court also cites Asahi Metal Industry Co., which states that a state court may not exercise personal jurisdiction over a party under circumstances that would offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.”

The court states that when a defendant moves to quash service of process on jurisdictional grounds, the plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction. Once facts showing minimum contacts with the forum state are established, the defendant has the burden to demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.

In this case, the plaintiff argues that Defendant placed the product in the stream of commerce, and that the indirect placement of products into the stream of commerce does not necessarily insulate a foreign manufacturer from the jurisdiction of California courts. The court grants the plaintiff's request for discovery on issues of specific jurisdiction regarding Defendant’s efforts to serve the market for Gold Bond powders in California during the time Routh used the product.

In the second motion, the plaintiff Marquee Routh alleges that her husband developed mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos in talc supplied by Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC, Inc. The court states that a defendant may move to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, and that the court may dismiss the complaint without prejudice when dismissal is made pursuant to Section 418.10.

The court cites the Due Process Clause, which protects an individual’s liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgments of a forum with which he has established no meaningful ‘contacts, ties, or relations.’ The court also cites Asahi Metal Industry Co., which states that a state court may not exercise personal jurisdiction over a party under circumstances that would offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.”

The court states that when a defendant moves to quash service of process on jurisdictional grounds, the plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction. Once facts showing minimum contacts with the forum state are established, the defendant has the burden to demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.

In this case, the plaintiff argues that Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC provided evidence that it is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Connecticut, and therefore it is not a resident of California and not subject to its general jurisdiction. The plaintiff also argues that the defendant assumed the liability of R.T. Vanderbilt Company, which had a talc mine and sales office in California.

The defendant argues that it is not subject to California’s specific jurisdiction unless the plaintiff can prove the plaintiff was exposed in California to asbestos in a product that contained the defendant's talc. The defendant argues that the complaint does not allege the specific products at issue.

The plaintiff identifies the products as DAP caulk products, but the defendant argues that it has no evidence that its talc was in the DAP caulk products to which Routh was exposed. The plaintiff requests jurisdictional discovery to obtain evidence that the defendant's talc was in the DAP caulk products to which Routh was exposed. The court continues this motion for jurisdictional discovery.
