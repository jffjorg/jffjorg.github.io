Summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding two separate motions to quash service of summons, one filed by PTI Union, LLC and the other by Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC. Both defendants argue that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over them. The court finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated minimum contacts with the forum state and that the defendants have purposefully availed themselves of the benefits of the forum. The court grants jurisdictional discovery to determine whether the defendants' products were in the products to which the plaintiff was exposed. The hearing on the motions is continued to December 20, 2023.
