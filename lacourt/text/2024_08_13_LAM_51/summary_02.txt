And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a tentative ruling in a case involving negligent misrepresentation. The judge notes that the plaintiffs failed to adequately plead their case, specifically failing to identify which defendant made the representations, how the plaintiffs justifiably relied on those representations, and how the plaintiffs' reliance was a substantial factor in causing their harm. The judge also notes that the Compass Defendants argue that there was no duty to disclose visually apparent facts. The judge is deferring discussion of duty until the second cause of action for negligence. The judge concludes that the plaintiffs' complaint, although flawed, is sufficient to survive the pleading stage, but notes that the evidence presented may not be sufficient to survive a dispositive motion or prevail at trial.
