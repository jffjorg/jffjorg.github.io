And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ryan Wenger and Yifat Resnick v. Compass California, Inc. and Rick Ojeda. The case involves a dispute over the sale of a property located at 1277 Calle De Sevilla, Los Angeles, California 90272. The defendants, Compass California, Inc. and Rick Ojeda, filed a demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint, arguing that it fails to state a cause of action.

The Judge has determined that the demurrer is without merit and has overruled it in its entirety. The Judge has also ordered the defendants to file their answer within 14 days of notice of this ruling.

The case involves allegations of negligent misrepresentation and negligence by the defendants. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants made false representations about the property, including that it included a built-in-barbeque, patio/decking, and extension to the southern side of the adjacent dwelling. The defendants argued that they did not owe the plaintiffs a duty to disclose these facts and that the plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts to support their claims.

The Judge has determined that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a claim for negligent misrepresentation and negligence. The Judge has also found that the defendants breached their duty to disclose the facts alleged by the plaintiffs and that this breach caused the plaintiffs' harm.

In conclusion, the Judge has overruled the demurrer and ordered the defendants to file their answer within 14 days. The case will proceed to the next stage, where the parties will have the opportunity to present evidence and argue their claims.
