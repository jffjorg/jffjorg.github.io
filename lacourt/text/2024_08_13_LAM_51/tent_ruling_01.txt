STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On February 7, 2023, Plaintiffs Ryan Wenger and Yifat
Resnick filed a Complaint against Defendants Obrach-Araujo Family Trust, Rick
Ojeda, Compass California, Inc., Compass California II, Inc., and Compass
California III, Inc. (Defendants) with two causes of action for: (1) Negligent
Misrepresentation and (2) Negligence. According to the Complaint, this dispute
concerns the sale of real property located at 1277 Calle De Sevilla, Los
Angeles, California 90272 (the Property). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants
misrepresented aspects of the property, including a built-in-barbeque and
outdoor kitchen and trees. 
 
On July 5, 2023, Defendants Orbach-Araujo Family Trust
erroneously sued as Obrach-Araujo Family Trust filed an Answer and a Motion to
Compel Arbitration. 
 
On July 10, 2023, Defendant Compass California, Inc. filed a
demurrer. 
 
On September 28, 2023, Defendant Rick Ojeda filed a Joinder
to Defendant Compass’s demurrer.
 
On October 10, 2023, Defendant Orbach-Araujo Family Trust
withdrew its motion to compel arbitration.
 
On November 1, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC) for the same causes of action. 
 
On December 5, 2023, Defendants Compass California, Inc. and
Rick Ojeda (Compass Defendants) filed a demurrer to the FAC which the court
SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
On January 11, 2024, Defendant Orbach-Araujo Family Trust (Orbach-Araujo)
filed a demurrer to the FAC which the court SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Second
Amended Complaint (SAC).
 
On April 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Request for Dismissal,
with prejudice, as to Defendant Obrach-Araujo Family Trust only.
 
On April 10, 2024, Compass Defendants filed a meet and
confer declaration.
 
On May 9, 2024, Compass Defendants filed the instant
Demurrer to the SAC. On July 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On August
6, 2024, Compass Defendants filed a reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Prior to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required
to satisfy their meet and confer obligations pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. §430.41, and demonstrate that they so satisfied their
meet and confer obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant to Code of Civ.
Proc. §430.41(a)(2) & (3). Here, the Compass Defendants met the meet and
confer requirement because counsel sent a letter, several follow-up emails, and
ultimately received an email response from Plaintiffs’ counsel indicating no
further need for discussion. (Anast Decl. ¶¶ 3 – 13.) Thus, the meet and confer
requirement is met.
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only
issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿ 
 
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true. (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.) Courts also consider exhibits attached to
the complaint and incorporated by reference. (See Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94 (Frantz).) 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
First Cause of
Action - Negligent Misrepresentation
 
The arguments presented here are virtually unchanged from
the previous demurrer. The Compass Defendants contend that Plaintiffs failed to
sufficiently allege particular facts supporting this cause of action.[1]
 
 
Plaintiffs argue they did specifically plead who made the
representations, including Defendant Ojeda as agent for Defendant Compass. Plaintiffs
also argue that whether their reliance was reasonable is a question of fact. 
 
The elements of a claim for negligent misrepresentation are (1)
the defendant made a false representation as to a past or existing material
fact; (2) the defendant made the representation without reasonable ground for
believing it to be true; (3) in making the representation, the defendant
intended to deceive the plaintiff; (4) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the
representation; and (5) the plaintiff suffered resulting damages.[2]
(Majd v. Bank of America, N.A. (2015)
243 Cal.App.4th 1293, 1307; National
Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Penn. V. Cambridge Integrated Services
Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 35, 50; Wilson v. Century 21 Great Western Realty (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th
298, 206 [requiring an assertion of fact, not an implied assertion or
representation].) 
 
Fraud and negligent misrepresentation must be pleaded with
particularity, which means the pleading “must set forth how, when, where, to
whom, and by what means the representations were made.” (SI 59 LLC v. Variel Warner Ventures, LLC (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 146,
155; Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145
Cal.App.4th 170, 184-185, fn. 14; see Foster
v. Sexton (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 998, 1028 [citing Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.]) 
 
Upon reviewing the SAC, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged
a claim for negligent misrepresentation. First, Plaintiffs allege the following
misrepresentations: “that The Property (1) included a built-in-barbecue, (2)
included patio/decking, and (3) extended to the southern side of the adjacent
dwelling located at 1283 Calle De Sevilla.” (SAC ¶ 20.) Second, Plaintiffs
allege that the Compass Defendants “knew or should have known” that the
Property “did not include” these items. (Ibid.)
Third, Plaintiffs allege that the Compass Defendants “intended that Plaintiffs
rely on these representations and knew [they] materially affected the value and
desirability of The Property.” (Ibid.)
Fourth, Plaintiffs allege they justifiably relied on these misrepresentations and
they were a “substantial influence on their decision to purchase The Property
and the amount of consideration paid for The Property.” (Ibid.) Fifth, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Ojeda, individually
and on behalf of Compass, made these representations in the November 2020
marketing materials as well as in January 7, 2021 writings to Plaintiffs. (Ibid.) Sixth, Plaintiffs allege
resulting damages.[3]
(SAC ¶ 21.) 
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer as to the
first cause of action.
 
Second Cause of
Action - Negligence
 
As before, the Compass Defendants contend that they did not
owe Plaintiffs a duty because the encroachments were visible, there was no duty
to inspect public records to discover the encroachment, and there was no duty
to verify the seller’s statements.[4]
Plaintiffs argue they sufficiently alleged a claim for negligence and Compass
Defendants’ arguments are factual questions inappropriate at the demurrer
stage. 
 
The basic elements of a negligence claim are: a duty on the
part of the defendant towards the plaintiff; defendant’s breach of that duty;
causation; and harm to plaintiff. (Kesner
v. Sup. Ct. (Pneumo Abex, LLC) (2016 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1142.) 
 
A real estate broker or salesperson has a duty to a
prospective buyer “to conduct a reasonably competent and diligent visual
inspection of the property offered for sale and to disclose to that prospective
buyer all facts materially affecting the value or desirability of the property
that an investigation would reveal, if that broker has a written contract with
the seller to find or obtain a buyer or is a broker who acts in cooperation
with that broker to find and obtain a buyer.” (Civ. Code § 2079(a); Field v. Century 21 Klowden-Forness Realty
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 18, 23-24. (Field).)
The scope of inspection “does not include or involve an inspection of areas
that are reasonably and normally inaccessible to this type of an inspection,
nor an affirmative inspection of areas off the site of the subject property or
public records or permits concerning the title or use of the property . . . .”
(Civ. Code § 2079.3; Wilson, supra,
at p. 308.) 
 
Upon reviewing the SAC, Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged a
claim for negligence. First, Plaintiffs alleged that the Compass Defendants “[have]
a duty to disclose to the buyer all facts known to the broker regarding the
property or relating to the transaction that materially affect the value or
desirability of the property. A broker must disclose facts if the broker knows
or should know that the buyer is not aware of them and cannot reasonably be
expected to discover them through diligent attention and observation.” (SAC ¶
24.) In short, Plaintiffs allege the duty imposed by Civ. Code § 2079(a) and
relevant case law. Second, Plaintiffs allege that Compass Defendants breached
this duty by falsely representing that the Property included the
built-in-barbeque, patio/decking, and extension to the southern side of the
adjacent dwelling. (Ibid.) Third,
Plaintiff allege that this breach caused their harm because the representations
were “a substantial influence on their decision to purchase The Property and
the amount of consideration paid for The Property.” (Ibid.) Finally, Plaintiffs allege damages. (SAC ¶ 25.)
 
Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the demurrer as to the
second cause of action.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.The demurrer to the SAC is
OVERRULED in its entirety;
2.Compass Defendants to file their
answer within 14 days of notice of this ruling.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
