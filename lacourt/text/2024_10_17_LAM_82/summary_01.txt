And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application for a temporary restraining order to stop a trustee sale scheduled for October 17, 2024. The plaintiff, John Suh, alleges that the defendant, Hwa Chong Kang, executed a promissory note with the Los Angeles Korean 1st Presbyterian Church Congregation for $4 million and received $3.2 million. The plaintiff claims breach of contract and other causes of action. However, the court finds that the plaintiff lacks standing to raise claims on behalf of the church, which is not a party to this action. Additionally, the ex parte application is defective because it relies exclusively on the complaint, which is not verified and does not cite admissible evidence. Finally, the application does not establish good cause for the exigency, as the plaintiff could have sought relief sooner.
