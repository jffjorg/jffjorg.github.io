  - "While the statute refers only to evidence of the defendant's financial condition, in practice bifurcation under this section means that all evidence relating to the amount of punitive damages is to be offered in the second phase, while the determination whether the plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages (i.e., whether the defendant is guilty of malice, fraud or oppression) is decided in the first phase along with compensatory damages."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to bifurcate trial for punitive damages. The evidence regarding the financial condition of the moving defendants (Ramon Cartznes, Precision Construction Experts, Inc., and Stephen Andrew Myers) will be precluded unless and until a verdict is reached awarding actual damages on the plaintiff's claims seeking punitive damages and finding that the defendants acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. The bifurcation is intended to minimize potential prejudice by preventing the jury from learning of the defendants' "deep pockets" before determining the threshold issues of liability and compensatory damages.
