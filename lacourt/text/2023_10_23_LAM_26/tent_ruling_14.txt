license number or California id number (Petitioner may apply for and obtain a
new California id or California driver license and provide such information to
Probation);
(2) providing Probation with a driver
license number or DMV-issued id number from another state and identifying the
state that issued the driver license or id; or
(3) contacting Probation at (323)

who can provide instructions on how Petitioner may have fingerprints taken for
a LIVESCAN and results sent to Probation.
The petition is continued to December

options.  If Petitioner fails to provide
Probation with sufficient information to run a criminal history assessment
