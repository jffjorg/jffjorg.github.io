And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to discovery requests, including interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff is ordered to serve verified and code-compliant responses to these requests within 1-2 days of notice of this order. The plaintiff is also ordered to produce all responsive documents within 2 days of notice of this order. The judge imposes monetary sanctions of $2,062.50 on the plaintiff and his attorney for discovery abuse. The judge denies the defendant's request for terminating sanctions, finding that while the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery requests was willful, terminating sanctions would be extreme and unwarranted under the circumstances.
