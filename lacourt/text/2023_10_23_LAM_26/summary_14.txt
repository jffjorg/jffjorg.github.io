And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a continuation of the petition to December 11, 2023 at 9:00 am to allow the petitioner to provide necessary information. Specifically, the petitioner must file proof of publication at least one week before the continued hearing date and provide identification with a fingerprint to enable the Probation department to run a criminal history assessment. The petitioner may provide identification through one of three options: providing a California driver's license or identification number, providing a driver's license or DMV-issued identification number from another state, or contacting Probation to request instructions on how to have fingerprints taken for a Livescan. If the petitioner fails to provide the necessary information, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice.
