The Judge's tentative ruling continues the petition for name change to December 11, 2023 at 9:00 am. The Petitioner has failed to provide proof of publication and fingerprint identification, which is necessary for the criminal history assessment. The Petitioner must provide one of three options for fingerprint identification: a California driver's license number or ID number, a driver's license number or DMV-issued ID number from another state, or contacting Probation to request a LIVESCAN. If the Petitioner fails to provide sufficient information for the criminal history assessment prior to the next hearing date, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice.
