Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication filed by Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (Defendant) to dismiss the claim for punitive damages brought by Virginia Adams (Plaintiff) alleging that she developed mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products.

The Judge has concluded that the Plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence to show that Estee Lauder knew about the dangers of asbestos in talc and failed to warn consumers. The Judge has considered the evidence presented by the Plaintiff, including testimony and documents, and has found that it does not demonstrate that Estee Lauder was aware of the hazards presented by its products.

As a result, the Judge has granted the motion for summary adjudication on the claim for punitive damages. The Plaintiff will be notified of the ruling.
