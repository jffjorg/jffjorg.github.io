And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. The defendant, Cosmetic Specialties Inc., is incorporated in New Jersey and has its principle place of business there, and has never engaged in business in California. The plaintiffs, Lucille Lazio and John Lazio, contend that the defendant distributed talc in California, which was used to manufacture talcum powder and cosmetic products, including Cover Girl, Revlon, and Estee Lauder products.

The court finds that the defendant is not subject to California's general jurisdiction, as it is not a resident of the state. However, the court also finds that the defendant may be subject to specific jurisdiction in California, as it may have purposefully availed itself of the forum by distributing talc in the state.

The court continues the hearing to allow the parties to engage in jurisdictional discovery on the issue of whether the defendant distributed talc in California during the period that Lucille Lazio was using Cover Girl, Revlon, and Estee Lauder products. The court also notes that the admissibility of certain deposition testimony is an issue that will need to be addressed.

The motion is continued to April 10, 2024, at 9 a.m., and the parties are allowed to file supplemental oppositions and replies.
