And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff's unopposed motion to set aside dismissal and enter judgment against Defendants. The dispute arises from a stipulation for conditional settlement and entry of judgment, which was signed by the parties on October 8, 2019. The stipulation provided for payments to be made by Defendants to Plaintiff, but Plaintiff's counsel declares that Defendants have failed to make timely payments. As a result, Plaintiff seeks to enter judgment in the amount of $39,616.38 plus costs of $870. The Court finds that Defendants have breached the terms of the stipulation and grants Plaintiff's motion to set aside dismissal and enter judgment.
