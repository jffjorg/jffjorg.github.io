Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff's deposition to take place in-person. The Plaintiff, Maria Morales Garcia, has been refusing to appear for an in-person deposition due to her caretaking responsibilities for her immunocompromised quadriplegic husband and concerns about COVID-19 exposure. The Defendant, County of Los Angeles, argues that it has the right to depose parties in-person and that the Plaintiff's refusal to appear for an in-person deposition is unjustified. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff did not formally object to the deposition notices and that the Defendant has properly served the notices. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to justify her refusal to appear for an in-person deposition. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to appear for deposition at a mutually agreeable date, and if the Plaintiff does not participate in the meet and confer discussions, the Defendant may unilaterally notice the deposition.
