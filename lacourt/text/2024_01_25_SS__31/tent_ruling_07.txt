 Case Number:  22STCV31486    Hearing Date:   January 25, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 01/25/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 22STCV31486 JASMINE FOSTER, et al. vs HOLLY SUE CULLEN PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR Zaira Truss, Age 2 RECOMMENDATION: DENY  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Plaintiff(s) have agreed to settle their claims against Defendant(s) for the total amount of $250,000, with $5,000 being apportioned to Zaira Truss (“Claimant”). If the settlement is approved, $2,000 will be used for attorneys’ fees. The net balance of $3,000 will be deposited into a blocked account.  The petition filed on December 13, 2023 is denied for the following reasons:  First, the Court is unclear as to whether Petitioner is requesting $2,000 in expenses, or $2,000 in attorney’s fees. Item 13(a) indicates that $2,000 is requested for attorney’s fee, yet $2,000 is also provided in the “Total” under Item 13(b), which is intended for expenses other than medical (and not including attorney’s fees).   Based on the fact that only attorney’s fees are listed on Item 13 and Item 16, the Court presumes no expenses are sought from Claimant’s proceeds. If so, then Item 13(b) should either be left blank or $0 to be indicated in the “Total.”   Second, the following attachments with the corresponding required information are absent from the petition: Attachment 11b(3), Attachment 11b(6), and Attachment 18b(2).   Third, Plaintiff filed three electronic duplicates of MC-350. In addition to the Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim (MC-350), Petitioner must also file an Order Approving Compromise (MC-351), and because the net settlement is proposed to be deposited into a blocked account, Petitioner must also file an Order to Deposit Funds Into Blocked Account (MC-355) ¿ Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
