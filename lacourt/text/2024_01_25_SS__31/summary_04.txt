And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied a motion to deem two separate automobile accident cases related with prejudice. The motion was filed by Gibran C. Lee, a named defendant to Case No. 22STCV13942, seeking to consolidate this action, Case No. 21STCV33424, with Case No. 22STCV13942. The two cases arise from separate accidents occurring nearly one year apart, at different locations, and do not warrant relating the two. The court has already denied the request to relate the cases on two previous occasions. The court finds that the cases are independent and should be tried separately. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must do so by email.
