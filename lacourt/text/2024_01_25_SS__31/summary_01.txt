And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant, Jonathan Lyndale, due to improper service of the statement of damages. The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to serve the statement of damages in the same manner as the summons and complaint, and therefore, the default is void. The judge also identifies several form and procedural deficiencies in the plaintiff's request for default judgment, including the use of an outdated form, incomplete completion of the judgment form, failure to dismiss all other parties, and lack of supporting documents for the amount of damages incurred. The judge orders the plaintiff to correct these deficiencies and submit a new default judgment package by a certain date. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
