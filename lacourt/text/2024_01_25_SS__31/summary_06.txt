Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the lawsuit. The lawsuit was dismissed on May 2, 2023, after the plaintiff's counsel failed to appear at a hearing due to a calendaring error. The plaintiff's counsel claims that the error was caused by a high turnover in the litigation paralegal position in his office, which resulted in his new paralegal not being able to catch up on all the files. The judge finds that the dismissal was caused by the plaintiff's counsel's mistake and grants the motion to set aside the dismissal, reinstating the lawsuit.
