And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to substitute Elena Balshem as the real party in interest for decedent Donald Erikson. The motion was unopposed, and the court's electronic filing system showed no opposition at the time of the publication cutoff. The judge notes that a decedent's appointed personal representative may substitute into an action for causes of action that survive a plaintiff's death, and that Elena Balshem has filed a declaration with the required elements and a death certificate. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the complaint with 150 days leave to amend, and the case management conference will be conducted concurrently. The judge orders the moving defendant to provide notice.
