SUMMARY
OF ACTION
In
October, 2001, Plaintiff Norma Salceda, commenced leasing 13672 Van Nuys Blvd.,
Pacoima, for operation of an OB/GYN medical practice on the premises. The
premises were owned by Nance Malmrose. Plaintiff and Malmrose were also
personal friends.
 
In
2010, Plaintiff offered to purchase the property from Malmrose. Two weeks
later, Malmrose rejected the purchase offer, and instead promised to bequeath
the property to Salceda at the time of death in to be reflected in an updated
will/estate plan. Following the promise, Plaintiff suggested conversion of the
property into a community healthcare center instead of continuing as an OB/GYN
clinic. Malmrose agreed. Plaintiff subsequently engaged in plans to convert the
premises, and began investing funds for the remodel plus working with
government agencies.
 
On
January 23, 2019, passed away intestate with no spouse or offspring. No will
was ever found, and Plaintiff suspects a private nurse to Malmrose, Ken
Preston, absconding it. 
 
A
probate proceeding commenced (19STPB09601). On October 12, 2022, Ginger
Brandenburg (Ginger), child of decedent’s “late husband” Earl Malmrose (stepdaughter
of Ginger?) was awarded “100% of Malmrose’s” estate valued at approximately “11
million dollars.” Ginger, however, passed away on September 24, 2022, two weeks
before the award. Ginger’s surviving husband, Joe Brandenburg, was designated
trustee. Joe subsequently resigned as trustee, thereby leading to the
designation of Kelly Brandenburg Pelton (Pelton) as successor trustee. A later
probate proceeding (23STPB00795) facilitated the transfer of all assets into
the Brandenburg family trust.
 
Plaintiff
alleges that prior to Ginger being awarded the estate, Plaintiff nevertheless
informed Ginger Brandenburg about the purported agreement to leave the
commercial premises for the community clinic. Ginger purportedly assured
Plaintiff that the property would be transferred in accordance with Malmrose’s
wishes upon appointment as administrator. The purported promise was also
confirmed by a third party attorney, Richard Hoefflin, representing the Malmrose
estate. 
 
Plaintiff
elected to forego making any claim with the probate court (presumably in the
19STPB09601 action), though the operative complaint lacks any actual
forbearance agreement with any identified person. Hoefflin in fact specifically
disclaimed any and all representation of Plaintiff in any capacity, and confirmed
with the Estate attorney of the lapse to present any claim. Plaintiff also
confirmed the lapse of any claim with Plaintiff’s own attorney.
 
On
February 6, 2021, Ginger demanded a rental payment from Plaintiff. Plaintiff
subsequently began paying rent. Following other communications, the parties
entered into a seven month lease for the premises beginning on May 1, 2022, and
ending November 30, 2022. “On October 12, 2022, Brandenburg was awarded 100% of
Estate in Malmrose Probate Proceeding (19STPB09601).” [Sec. Amend. Comp., ¶
79.] Following the death of Ginger, and assumption of trustee duties by Pelton,
a notice of termination of the lease was later delivered stating that a month
to month tenancy now existed on the property as of June 30, 2023
(notwithstanding the lapse of the actual lease on November 30, 2022). On August
4, 2023, Pelton filed an unlawful detainer action against Plaintiff.
 
On
October 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Quasi Specific
Performance/Constructive Trust, Promissory Estoppel, and Unjust Enrichment, and
Elder Financial Abuse. On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Related
Cases for the instant action with Pasadena unlawful detainer action,
23PDUD02724. On October 24, 2023, the court declined to find the complaints
related. On October 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint for Quasi
Specific Performance/Constructive Trust, Promissory Estoppel, and Unjust
Enrichment. On December 14, 2023, Department 1 deemed the unlawful detainer
action related to the instant complaint. On February 15, 2024, the court
consolidated the cases.
 
On
February 15, 2024, the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended
complaint with leave to amend. On March 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a verified
second amended complaint for Quasi Specific Performance/Constructive Trust, and
Promissory Estoppel.
 
RULING: Sustained with
Leave to Amend.
Request
for Judicial Notice & Supplement Request for Judicial Notice: Granted in
Part/Denied in Part.
·        
A
court can normally only take judicial notice of orders for the existence of the
orders, but not any factual findings. (Kilroy v. State of California (2004)
119 Cal.App.4th 140, 147-148; Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) The subject orders both
address the represented disposition of the claims directly referenced in the
complaint. The court therefore considers the content due to incorporation. 
 
Defendant
Kelly B. Pelton, Trustee of the Brandenburg Family Trust Dated October 28,
2019, brings the subject demurer to the entire second amended complaint for
Quasi Specific Performance/Constructive Trust and Promissory Estoppel, on grounds
that all claims are barred by the one year statute of limitations, and lacks facts
in support of the claims. Plaintiff counters that the causes of action were
both timely filed and sufficiently pled based on the filing of the August 4,
2024, filed unlawful detainer action. The now consolidated unlawful detainer
action was filed within one year of the September 24, 2022, death of Ginger
Brandenburg. Plaintiff also denies any loss of a successor liability claim
based on the dismissal against Ginger Brandenburg. Defendant in reply
reiterates the statute of limitations bar, and lack of factual basis. Defendant
in reply challenges any effort to relate the subject action back to the date of
the unlawful detainer action. Defendant also describes the opposition as
“meandering,” maintains the action remains barred under Code of Civil Procedure
section 366.2 and 366.3, and argues against the “void judgment” argument. The
claims are directed on the alleged representations of Ginger, which fall under
the one year statute of limitations. Defendant also reiterates the substantive
defects with the individual causes of action. 
 
A
demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from
either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules, where the
complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently apprising
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty
should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.]
 
Statute of Limitations
Defendant maintains the subject action is governed by Code
of Civil Procedure sections 366.2 and 366.3, which both provide in relevant
part. 
 
“If a
person against whom an action may be brought on a liability of the person,
whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, and whether accrued or not
accrued, dies before the expiration of the applicable limitations period, and
the cause of action survives, an action may be commenced within one year after
the date of death, and the limitations period that would have been applicable
does not apply.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 366.2, subd. (a).)
 
“If a
person has a claim that arises from a promise or agreement with a decedent to
distribution from an estate or trust or under another instrument, whether the
promise or agreement was made orally or in writing, an action to enforce the
claim to distribution may be commenced within one year after the date of death,
and the limitations period that would have been applicable does not apply.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 366.3, subd. (a).)
 
Defendant
interprets the statute of limitations as accruing on the date of death of the
promisor. Defendant cites to the order sustaining the demurrer to the first
amended complaint, whereby the court found a more than one year gap from the
date of Ginger’s passing (September 24, 2022) and the October 10, 2023, filing
of the instant complaint. The court continues to adhere to this position. 
 
Plaintiff
offers no specific challenge to the reliance on sections 366.2 and 366.3 or the
interpretation of the one year statute of limitations from the date of death
against the person responsible and necessarily named to enforce the claim. Plaintiff
instead contends the August 4, 2023, unlawful detainer action brought by the
Trustee, preserved the one year statute of limitations, when the action consolidated
with the subject action.
 
Plaintiff
relies on the interpretation of Code of Civil Procedure section 1048, as
converting the cases into a single filing, thereby apparently also
retroactively establishing the statute of limitations. (Guardianship of C.E. (2019)
31 Cal.App.5th 1038, 1053.) While the court agrees that at a minimum one
judgment will the result as an outcome of the consolidation order,
consolidation of an unlawful detainer action rendered necessary because of an
intertwined legal question regarding possession, lacks an articulated nexus for
purposes of finding the issues relate back to a certain statute of limitations
date. (Hamilton v. Asbestos Corp.,
Ltd. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147.)
 
The
unlawful detainer action itself constitutes a summary proceeding. “[I]t is
sufficient to note that the proceeding is summary in character; that,
ordinarily, only claims bearing directly upon the right of immediate possession
are cognizable” (Vella v. Hudgins (1977) 20 Cal.3d 251, 255; See Mehr
v. Superior Court (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 1044, 1049; Cheney v.
Trauzettel (1937) 9 Cal.2d 158, 159.) Nothing in the unlawful detainer
proceeding in and of itself apparently raised any of the unfiled claims
regarding the purported oral promises of Ginger. The unlawful detainer action
itself sought to initiate a summary proceeding for possession as provided in
the statutes. Plaintiff, in pro per, at the time filed an answer to the
unlawful detainer proceeding, regarding the subject promise of Ginger, but the
court finds no support for preservation of the issue for purposes of
establishing timely compliance with the statute of limitations. Plaintiff
presents no legally supported argument in opposition establishing a basis for
relation back to the unlawful detainer for purposes of deeming the action
timely under Code of Civil Procedure sections 366.2 and 366.3. Given the
summary nature of the unlawful detainer, the court finds nothing in the
unlawful detainer complaint and answer in any way contemplated the claims
governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 366.2 and 366.3. (Martin-Bragg v. Moore (2013)
219 Cal.App.4th 367, 391-393.) The subsequent effort to raise said new claims
more than one year after the death of Ginger in a properly filed complaint
before the superior court and subsequent consolidation of the unlawful detainer
action in no way establishes a timely filed action. 
 
Plaintiff
acknowledges this possibility, and offers an alternative position that the
statute of limitations only arose on April 11, 2023, when the court awarded
Defendant Pelton the property. This view relies on a challenge to any award of
property to a dead person, which the court finds inapposite. (In re Parsell's Estate (1923)
190 Cal. 454, 456; Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v.
McKenzie (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 681, 688.)
No property was ever ordered to Ginger following her passing. The operative
complaint specifically states that because Ginger pre-deceased the October 12,
2022, hearing, and Joe was appointed trustee until his resignation on September
26, 2022, with Kelly Pelton ultimately named trustee. The unchallenged statutes
require submission of the claim against the promisor, which a party submits
through the naming of the operative trustee during the relevant time frame. 
 
“It has
been the law in California for over a century that a new trustee ‘succeed[s] to
all the
rights, duties, and responsibilities of his predecessors.’” (Moeller v. Superior Court
(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1124, 1131.) “There is no meaningful distinction between the
liability of the decedent trustee who committed a tort as trustee and the
successor trustee in her capacity as trustee, except that the decedent
trustee's estate might also be liable. Plaintiffs attempt to draw a distinction
between the decedent trustee, on the one hand, and the trust (which, as noted,
is not an entity or proper party) and successor trustee, on the other hand, for
purposes of the application of section 366.2. The authorities do not support
such a distinction. [¶][¶] ‘There is a one-year statute of limitations for all
actions against the decedent for which the statute of limitations has not run
at the time of the decedent's death. (Code Civ. Proc., § 366.2.) This statute
applies to claims against a living trust. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 366.2(b)(3).)’” (Stoltenberg v. Newman (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 287, 294.)
 
Furthermore,
the operative complaint lacks any allegations in support of a “void” order as
to Ginger, even if the argument held weight. Regardless, even if the court
considered the alternative “void” order, such a situation would effectively
eviscerate the entire complaint in that Plaintiff improperly named Ginger as a
defendant, and should have named a different party. The result improperly
disregards the language of sections 366.2 and 366.3.
 
Plaintiff
somewhat acknowledges this potential in the legally unsupported successor
liability section. Plaintiff suggests Pelton somehow “stepped” into Ginger’s
position and therefore assumed all claims, thereby extending the statute of
limitations. The court declines to find the legal support for this position on
behalf of Plaintiff, and again, otherwise cites back to the trustee liability
and statute of limitations argument grounding consideration of the validity of
the action. 
 
Plaintiff
also circles back to Ginger on grounds of estoppel. Plaintiff cites to the
assurances of Ginger to leave the property, without actually addressing the
statute of limitations argument. Plaintiff only depends on citation to the
substantive allegation standard of review as a means of suggesting a potential
reversal on an otherwise presumptively properly pled estoppel claim. The court
acknowledges the argument (and addresses the estoppel claim further below), but
again, without any actual legally supported argument regarding the statute of
limitations, the court finds any potentially properly pled estoppel claim lacks
support on this basis.
 
Given the pled date of death as September 24, 2022, and the
filing date of the complaint on October 10, 2023, the more than one year gap
between the date of death and the original complaint filing date establishes an
untimely filed action as against Ginger, subsequently becoming a claim against
the estate. The court therefore sustains the demurrer on statute of limitations
grounds. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 366.2, subd. (a) 366.3, subd. (a); Davies v. Krasna (1975) 14
Cal.3d 502, 508; Dacey v. Taraday (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 962, 983; Ferraro v. Camarlinghi (2008)
161 Cal.App.4th 509, 554.)
 
1st
Cause of Action: Quasi Specific Performance/Constructive Trust
2nd
Cause of Action: Promissory Estoppel
Defendant also challenges the
substantive individual causes of action. Although the court finds no supporting
argument excusing the statute of limitations, the court considers the issues
presented in the demurrer. 
 
An action
to make performance of a contract part of a will can be identified as quasi
specific performance. “Since the making of a will cannot be compelled, there
can be no specific
performance of
such a contract in the strict sense, but under certain circumstances equity
will give relief equivalent to specific performance by impressing a
constructive trust upon the property which decedent had promised to leave to
plaintiff. (Citations.) ... A contract to make a will is breached only if it
has not been complied with at the time of the promisor's death, and for this
reason the cause of action for the breach does not ordinarily accrue or the
period of limitation commence to run until the promisor dies. (Citations.)” (Ludwicki v. Guerin (1961) 57
Cal.2d 127, 130.) “A constructive
trust is an
involuntary equitable trust created by operation of law as a remedy to compel
the transfer of property from the person wrongfully holding it to the rightful
owner. [Citations.] The essence of the theory of constructive trust is to
prevent unjust enrichment and to prevent a person from taking advantage of his
or her own wrongdoing.” (American Master Lease LLC v.
Idanta Partners, Ltd. (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th
1451, 1485.)
 
Promissory estoppel constitutes
the second cause of action. “The elements of a promissory estoppel claim are ‘(1)
a promise clear and unambiguous in its terms; (2) reliance by the party to whom
the promise is made; (3)[the] reliance must be both reasonable and foreseeable;
and (4) the party asserting the estoppel must be injured by his reliance.’” (Aceves v. U.S. Bank, N.A. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 218, 225 (internal quotation marks
omitted).) “The elements of equitable estoppel are ‘(1) the party to be estopped must be
apprised of the facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,
or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to believe it
was so intended; (3) the other party must be ignorant of the true state of
facts; and (4) he must rely upon the conduct to his injury. [Citation.]’
[Citation.] The detrimental reliance must be reasonable. [Citations.] [¶] An
additional requirement applies in cases involving equitable estoppel against the government. In such a
case, the court must weigh the policy concerns to determine whether the
avoidance of injustice in the particular case justifies any adverse impact on
public policy or the public interest.” (Schafer v. City of Los Angeles (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th
1250, 1261.)
 
The quasi specific performance
claim in no way relieve Plaintiff of the statute of limitations challenges. (Ludwicki v. Guerin (1961) 57
Cal.2d 127, 130.) “In the statute of limitations
context, equitable estoppel may be appropriate where the defendant's act or
omission actually and reasonably induced the plaintiff to refrain from filing a
timely suit. (Citation.) The requisite act or omission must involve a
misrepresentation or nondisclosure of a material fact bearing on the
necessity of bringing a timely suit. (Citation.)” (Doe v. Marten (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 1022, 1028.)
While the subject claim may excuse the late filed action, the court finds no
factual basis for a finding of any misrepresentation or reasonable basis of
detrimental reliance.
 
The court therefore finds under
the currently alleged version of the complaint and arguments, Plaintiff
alternatively to pled a basis around the statute of limitations. The demurrer
is sustained on this basis as well. 
 
“In response to a demurrer and prior to the case being at
issue, a complaint or cross-complaint shall not be amended more than three
times, absent an offer to the trial court as to such additional facts to be
pleaded that there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured to state
a cause of action. The three-amendment limit shall not include an amendment
made without leave of the court pursuant to Section 472, provided the amendment is
made before a demurrer to the original complaint or cross-complaint is filed.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (e)(1).) 
 
The first amended complaint was filed 21 days after the original
complaint, and without any judicial review. The court has therefore now twice
reviewed the action, and elects to sustain the demurrer with 20 days leave to
amend under statutory guidelines. 
 
The court grants leave to amend in order to allow Plaintiff
the opportunity to address the statute of limitations issues, including
potential relation back doctrine. Again, Plaintiff may not add any new causes
of action without leave of court, but the court will allow further
clarification regarding any and all terms material to stating a claim. (Harris
v. Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.) Any new
causes of action added without leave of court may be subject to a motion to
strike. Material changes to the operative complaint seeking to alter or omit the
material terms of the purported agreement may also be subject to a demurrer
under the sham pleading standard.
 
Defendant to give notice.
