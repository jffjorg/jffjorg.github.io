SUBSTITUTION OF REAL PARTY IN INTEREST
 
MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff, Donald Erikson 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Unopposed/Defendant, Mark Geragos
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED
Motion
to Substitute Real Party in Interest
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
David Erikson, “an elite and highly experienced attorney” accepted an “offer to
act as “Of Counsel” for the law firm Geragos & Geragos. In addition to
handling the equivalent of an “entire intellectual property department” and
handling “two raging litigation matters,” Plaintiff also contributed more than
2,000 hours of work in other “important and lucrative civil matters” for the
firm. While the parties engaged in some form of moderately specified
compensation agreement, Plaintiff maintains Defendant in fact “stiffed”
Plaintiff on some or all promised compensation, notwithstanding the tremendous
wealth of Mark Geragos. While the parties sought a compensation payment, no
satisfactory agreement materialized. 
 
On
February 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Quantum Meruit, Breach of
Contract, Open Book Account, Account Stated, Promissory Fraud, and Unjust
Enrichment. On March 14, 2024, a notice of death and request for stay was filed
with the court stating Plaintiff Erickson passed away on February 19, 2024. 
 
On
May 8, 2024, the court sustained the demurrer to the complaint with 150 days
leave to amend.
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff
the Balshem/Erickson Family Trust moves to substitute Elena Balshem as the real
party in interest for decedent Donald Erikson. The court electronic filing
system shows no opposition at the time of the tentative ruling publication
cutoff. Plaintiff filed a reply acknowledging the lack of any filed or served
opposition, and reiterating the basis for substitutiton. 
 
A decedent’s appointed personal representative may
substitute into an action for causes of action that survive a plaintiff’s
death. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 377.11, 377.30, 377.31, 377.34.) A
successor-in-interest must file a declaration with specified elements and a
death certificate (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.32). The declaration of Elena Balshem
presents the basis of the application and required documentation. The unopposed
motion for substitution of personal representatives is therefore granted. 
 
The case management conference will be concurrently
conducted.
 
Moving
Defendant to provide notice.
