On
October 18, 2019, Plaintiff Bradley Listermann filed a complaint against James
Davis aka Mick Davis for 1. Slander/Defamation 2. Libel/Defamation 3.
Intentional Interference of Contractual Relations. Following a denied motion to
strike, the clerk entered a default against James Davis on April 20, 2020.

Faith And Fair Dealing; (5) Fraud; (6) Abuse Of Process; (7) Professional
Negligence; (8) Unfair Business Practices against Bradley M. Listermann, Kevin

On
September 21, 2020, the court granted the motion of Davis to vacate the

Astra Verda Corporation and Paranotek for 1. Rescission Of Contract (Mistake)

Breach Of Fiduciary Duties; (2) Conversion; (3) Breach Of Contract; (4) Breach
Of The Duty Of Good Faith And Fair Dealing; (5) Fraud; (6) Abuse Of Process;
(7) Professional Negligence; (8) Unfair Business Practices on May 3, 2021. On

On

amended cross-complaint of James Davis without Leave to Amend, and with leave
to amend as to Paranotek, LLC. On November 29, 2021, the parties filed a third

Breach Of Contract; (4) Breach Of The Duty Of Good Faith And Fair Dealing; (5)
Fraud; (6) Professional Negligence; (7) Unfair Business Practices. On February
24, 2022, the court sustained the demurrer of Listermann to the third amended
cross-complaint without leave to amend.
 
On
July 13, 2022, Sean Teague, in pro per, answered the third amended
cross-complaint. On October 17, 2023, the court granted the motion of Cross-Defendants
Benjamin Eppinga, Scott Eppinga, and Think Humble, Inc. to dismiss them from
the third amended cross-complaint due to untimely service.
 
On
April 2, 2024, the court entered defaults against cross-defendants Kevin Mills,
Ryan Woods and Derrick DeRoom. On April 4, 2024, the court struck the answer of
Sean Teague to the third amended cross-complaint due to the failure to appear
for the final status conference.
 
On
April 10, 2024, pursuant to a settlement agreement, the court dismissed James
Davis and Does 1-20 without prejudice; cross-defendants Astra Verda Corporation
and Paranotek, LLC dismissed without prejudice from the Listermann
cross-complaint; dismissal of Listermann from the third amended cross-complaint
of Astra Verda Corporation and Paranotek, LLC; and entered defaults as to
Cross-Defendant Nikita Volchetskiy and Todd Myers.
 
RULING: Granted.
Cross-Defendant, Sean Teague, pro per, moves for relief from
the April 4, 2024, order striking the answer to the third amended
cross-complaint and entry of default, due to mistake, inadvertence, and/or
excusable neglect. The court electronic filing system shows no opposition or
reply at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivision (b) provides
in part: 
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may
be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the
judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”
 
“The six-month
time limit for granting statutory relief is jurisdictional and the court may
not consider a motion for relief made after that period has elapsed.
(Citation.) The six-month period runs from entry of default, not entry of
judgment.” (Manson, Iver & York v.
Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42.) The motion was filed 12 days after
entry of the judgment. The motion is therefore timely.
 
“[A] trial court is obligated
to set aside a default, default judgment, or
dismissal if the motion for mandatory relief (1) is filed within six months of
the entry of judgment, (2) ‘is in proper form,’ (3) is accompanied by
the attorney affidavit of fault, and (4) demonstrates that
the default or dismissal was in fact caused by
the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.’” (Martin Potts & Associates, Inc. v.
Corsair, LLC (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 432, 443.) Given the answer was
filed by Cooper, and counsel only substituted into the case after entry of the
default, the court considers the self-represented party standard. 
 
A discretionary standard applies to the motion given the
lack of an attorney statement and dependence on the individual parties’
explanation. (Lang
v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1251-1252; see Rodriguez v. Brill (2015)
234 Cal.App.4th 715, 727.) Public policy favors adjudication of claims on the
merits. Nevertheless, where conduct by the party acting in pro per represents a
deliberate, strategic decision, public policy vests the court with discretion
to find no basis for relief. (Benedict v. Danner Press (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 923, 929-930; Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1251-1252.)
 
Teague
represents a lack of notice of the continued hearings, and dependence on said
notices for a determination of when to appear. The court cannot verify the
veracity of the statement due to the lack of any notice of order from the court
filed by Defendant. The court, however accepts the lack of notice caused by
Teague’s failure to monitor the proceedings from other sources instead of
waiting for mail notice. 
 
The court
therefore grants the motion and vacates the default judgment as to Teague. The
July 13, 2022, filed answer to the third amended cross-complaint is therefore
no longer stricken. 
 
The court will
concurrently conduct an OSC re: Sanctions, Dismissal, etc.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
