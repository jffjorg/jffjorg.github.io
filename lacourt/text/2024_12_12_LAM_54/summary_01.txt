And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the second amended complaint and the motion to strike. The demurrer was filed by Defendant Christopher Smedley, and the motion to strike was also filed by him.

The Judge has OVERRULED the demurrer, finding that the claims are not improperly pleaded derivative claims. The Judge has also denied the motion to strike, finding that the allegations that were the subject of the motion are not irrelevant, false, or improper.

The Judge has also addressed several specific issues, including the statute of limitations and the relation back of the amended complaint. The Judge has found that the claims are not barred by the statute of limitations and that the relation back of the amended complaint is a question of fact that is not suitable for determination on demurrer.

The Judge has also discussed the elements of a civil conspiracy and has found that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to allege a civil conspiracy.

Finally, the Judge has noted that the parties may submit on the tentative ruling by emailing the courtroom with notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
