deliver to Sim certain electric vehicles and the sum of $500,000.00.”
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
When timely responses to
interrogatories are not received, “[t]he party propounding the interrogatories
may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.”  (CCP § 2030.290(b).) “If a party to whom a demand
for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a
timely response to it. . .  [t]he party
to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed
waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product. . . .  The
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand.”  (CCP § 2031.300(a)–(b).)
 
Defendant Sim moves to compel responses to form interrogatories and
requests for production of documents from Plaintiff Sangtae Choi. Defendant served the subject
discovery on August 27, 2024. As of the filing of this motion, Defendant has
not received responses. Plaintiff does not oppose this motion to show that responses
have been served.
 
Defendant’s motion is
GRANTED. The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $1,500.00.
