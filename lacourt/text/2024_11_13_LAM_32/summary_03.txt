And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued two tentative rulings in this case. The first ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant. The defendant has already responded to the plaintiff's special interrogatories and requests for production, and the judge finds that the plaintiff's motion does not address the defendant's responses. The second ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial date by one year. The plaintiff has not provided any evidence of good cause for the continuance, and the judge finds that the trial date of January 28, 2025, is firm.
