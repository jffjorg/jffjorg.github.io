And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for sanctions, which seeks to exclude trial exhibits not properly identified by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint on May 8, 2023, and the defendant filed the instant motion for sanctions on October 17, 2024. The Judge finds that while the plaintiffs' disclosure is incomplete, evidentiary sanctions are unwarranted at this stage. Instead, the parties must exchange their trial exhibits at least five days prior to the Final Status Conference, and any exhibits not exchanged will be excluded from trial. The Judge denies the defendant's motion for sanctions, but orders the parties to comply with the exchange requirement.
