**English Text Summary**

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration in this case. The plaintiff, Trixxi Clothing Company, Inc., filed a complaint against the defendants, Meigui, LLC, Shirin Moftakhar, and Gabriella Ferrari, alleging various causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and unfair business practices. The defendants filed a cross-complaint alleging sexual harassment. The Court previously denied the defendants' motion to stay or dismiss the arbitration, and the plaintiff filed a motion to compel arbitration. The Judge ruled that the Employment Arbitration Fairness Act (EFAA) exempts the entire case from arbitration, as the sexual harassment claims arose after March 3, 2022, and the continuing violation doctrine applies to the allegations of hostile work environment. The Judge also found that the defendants did not waive their rights under the EFAA by filing mandatory responses and participating in required hearings in the arbitration.
