JANE DOE,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
LUIS DIAZ ROJAS, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  22STCV41020
  Hearing Date:  November 13, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses (CRS# 8435)




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Jane
Doe filed this action against Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas stemming from an
alleged sexual assault.  
            On August 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production (Set Eight). Defendant
filed his opposition on October 30, 2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on November
5, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Upon receiving responses to its discovery
requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a).) The party seeking production of documents
bears the initial burden of showing good cause through a fact-specific showing
of relevance. (Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)
Once this showing is made, the burden shifts to the responding party to justify
any objections. (Ibid.) 
DISCUSSION
For SROG Nos. 7-12, 15, 16, and 18,
Defendant objected and then answered with responsive information. (Plntf.’s Ex.
A, B.) Defendant is entitled to assert objections to preserve them while
providing a substantive response. Defendant properly objected to SROG Nos. 1-6,
13, 14, and 17 as irrelevant, vague, and seeking attorney work product. (Ibid.)    
Plaintiff’s motion does not address the
RFPs, but in any event, Defendant responded to RFP Nos. 1 and 2 by stating that
he has never possessed the documents requested. (Plntf.’s Ex. B.) Thus,
Defendant has sufficiently responded to the RFPs.   
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel further
responses is DENIED.

  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to continue trial
  (CRS# 3509)




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Jane
Doe filed this action against Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas stemming from an
alleged sexual assault. 
            On October 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to continue the trial date. Defendant filed his opposition
on October 28, 2024. Plaintiff filed her reply on November 5, 2024.  
LEGAL STANDARD
            “To ensure the prompt disposition of
civil cases, the dates assigned for a trial are firm.” (Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule
3.1332(a).) “The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing
of good cause requiring the continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule 3.1332(c).)
DISCUSSION
            The current trial date is January
28, 2025. Plaintiff moves to continue the trial by at least one year, to
January 2026. Plaintiff’s motion articulates no good cause for such a
continuance. Plaintiff provides no evidence of any of the supposed issues listed
in her motion, nor does Plaintiff demonstrate that those issues will cause the
case to not be ready for trial by January 28, 2025. Plaintiff certainly does
not demonstrate that the trial needs to be delayed by an entire year.
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to continue trial
is DENIED.
