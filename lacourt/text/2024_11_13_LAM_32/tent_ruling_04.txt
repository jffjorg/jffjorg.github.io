 Case Number:  24STCV03364    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2024    Dept:  32      TRIXXI CLOTHING    COMPANY, INC.,                         Plaintiff,             v.   MEIGUI, LLC, et al.,                          Defendants.           Case No.:  24STCV03364   Hearing Date:  November 13, 2024        [TENTATIVE]    order RE: plaintiff’s demurrer               BACKGROUND             On February 8, 2024, Plaintiff Trixxi  Clothing Company, Inc. filed this action against Defendants Meigui, LLC, Shirin  Moftakhar, and Gabriella Ferrari, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of  contract, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, (3) interference with contract, (4)  misappropriation of trade secrets, (5) trademark infringement, (6) unfair  business practices, (7) common law unfair business practices, and (8)  conversion.              Defendants Moftakhar and Ferrari  worked for Plaintiff as Director of Design and Director of Sales, respectively.  The complaint is premised on Moftakhar’s and Ferrari’s formation of a competing  company, Defendant Meigui, LLC.              Prior to filing this action,  Plaintiff initiated a JAMS arbitration on December 19, 2023, alleging that  Moftakhar and Ferrari formed a competing business in violation of their  employment agreements and misappropriated Plaintiff’s confidential information.  (O’Kane Decl., Ex. 1.) Moftakhar and Ferrari filed their response on January  16, 2024. (Id., Ex. 5.) An arbitrator was appointed on January 29, 2024  after a rank and strike process. (Id., Ex. 6.) Plaintiff filed this  action on February 8, 2024.               On September 12, 2024, Defendants  filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff in this action for harassment,  retaliation, and wage violations.              On October 14, 2024, the Court  denied Defendants’ motion to stay or dismiss the arbitration. However, the  Court noted that the EFAA exempted the entire case from arbitration and  expressed its intent to proceed with the action regardless of the pending arbitration.  The Court suggested that the parties request the arbitrator to stay the  arbitration.              On October 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a  motion to compel arbitration.             On October 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed  the instant demurrer for an abeyance of the action as an alternative in the  event its motion to compel arbitration is denied. Defendants filed their  opposition on October 22, 2024.        LEGAL STANDARD A demurrer lies where “[t]here is another  action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 430.10(c).) “The pendency of another earlier action growing out  of the same transaction and between the same parties is a ground for abatement  of the second action.” (Leadford v. Leadford (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 571,  574.) “In such a case, the defendant must show that the parties, cause of  action, and issues are identical, and the same evidence would support the  judgment in each case.” (California Union Ins. Co. v. Trinity River Land Co.  (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 104, 108.)  DISCUSSION Plaintiff moves to abate this action based  on the pending JAMS arbitration. “However, abatement is required only where the  multiple actions are pending in courts of the same state.” (Leadford, supra,  6 Cal.App.4th at p. 574.) Here, there is no earlier pending court action.  Plaintiff cites no authority requiring abatement based on a pending  arbitration.  Moreover, the claims and parties involved  in this action and the JAMS arbitration are not identical. For example,  Defendants assert counterclaims for sexual harassment in this action which  cannot be arbitrated, and Plaintiff added a defendant in this action who is not  a party to the arbitration. Lastly, as the Court has noted previously, the EFAA  exempts the entire case from arbitration and thus the Court will proceed to  trial in this action.  CONCLUSION             Plaintiff’s demurrer is OVERRULED.

BACKGROUND

            On February 8, 2024, Plaintiff Trixxi
Clothing Company, Inc. filed this action against Defendants Meigui, LLC, Shirin
Moftakhar, and Gabriella Ferrari, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of
contract, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, (3) interference with contract, (4)
misappropriation of trade secrets, (5) trademark infringement, (6) unfair
business practices, (7) common law unfair business practices, and (8)
conversion. 

            Defendants Moftakhar and Ferrari
worked for Plaintiff as Director of Design and Director of Sales, respectively.
The complaint is premised on Moftakhar’s and Ferrari’s formation of a competing
company, Defendant Meigui, LLC. 

            Prior to filing this action,
Plaintiff initiated a JAMS arbitration on December 19, 2023, alleging that
Moftakhar and Ferrari formed a competing business in violation of their
employment agreements and misappropriated Plaintiff’s confidential information.
(O’Kane Decl., Ex. 1.) Moftakhar and Ferrari filed their response on January
16, 2024. (Id., Ex. 5.) An arbitrator was appointed on January 29, 2024
after a rank and strike process. (Id., Ex. 6.) Plaintiff filed this
action on February 8, 2024.  

            On September 12, 2024, Defendants
filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff in this action for harassment,
retaliation, and wage violations. 

            On October 14, 2024, the Court
denied Defendants’ motion to stay or dismiss the arbitration. However, the
Court noted that the EFAA exempted the entire case from arbitration and
expressed its intent to proceed with the action regardless of the pending arbitration.
The Court suggested that the parties request the arbitrator to stay the
arbitration. 

            On October 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel arbitration. Defendants filed their opposition on
October 22, 2024. Plaintiff filed its reply on October 28, 2024.     

LEGAL STANDARD

“On petition of a party to an arbitration
agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a
controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists….” (Code Civ. Proc, § 1281.2.) “The party seeking
arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of an arbitration
agreement, and the party opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any
defense, such as unconscionability.” (Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v.
Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223, 236.)

DISCUSSION

I.
The EFAA Applies to the Entire Case

The EFAA provides that “no predispute
arbitration agreement or predispute joint-action waiver shall be valid or
enforceable with respect to a case which is filed under Federal, Tribal,
or State law and relates to the sexual assault dispute or the sexual harassment
dispute.” (9 U.S.C. § 402.) “Under the EFAA, when a plaintiff's lawsuit
contains at least one claim that fits within the scope of the act, the
arbitration agreement is unenforceable as to all claims asserted in the lawsuit.”
(Liu v. Miniso Depot CA, Inc. (Cal. Ct. App., Oct. 7, 2024, No. B338090)
2024 WL 4446693, at *4.) 

Therefore, despite the fact that
Defendants only allege sexual harassment in some claims in their
cross-complaint, the entire case is exempt from arbitration. The EFAA plainly
exempts “a case” from arbitration, not just certain “claims.” (Liu, supra,
2024 WL 4446693, at *6.) 

II.
The Sexual Harassment Dispute Arose After the Enactment of the EFAA

a. The Dispute Arose After March 3, 2022
Even If the Wrongdoing Occurred Earlier

The EFAA applies “to any dispute or claim
that arises or accrues on or after March 3, 2022.” (9 U.S.C. § 401.) “[T]he
date that a dispute has arisen for purposes of the Act depends on the unique
facts of each case, but a dispute does not arise merely from the fact of injury”
or “solely from the alleged sexual conduct.” (Kader v. Southern California
Medical Center, Inc. (2024) 99 Cal.App.5th 214, 218, 222.) Instead, “[a]
dispute arises when one party asserts a right, claim, or demand, and the other
side expresses disagreement or takes an adversarial posture.” (Id. at p.
222.) This is unlike a claim, which “arises for the first time when the
plaintiff suffers an injury.” (Id. at p. 223.) Thus, “a claim may arise
or accrue before a dispute arises.” (Id. at pp. 224-25.) 

In Kader, despite the alleged
sexually harassing conduct beginning in 2018, there was no evidence that the
employer disputed any claim before March 3, 2022. (Kader, supra, 99
Cal.App.5th at pp. 218-19, 224.) A dispute did not arise until the plaintiff
filed charges with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing[1] in
May 2022. (Id. at p. 224.) Because the dispute arose after March 3,
2022, “the Act applied to invalidate the predispute arbitration agreement.” (Id.
at p. 225.)    

Plaintiff argues that the EFAA does not
apply because the alleged sexually harassing conduct occurred prior to March 3,
2022. (See Cross-Compl. ¶¶ 41, 46, 51.) However, under Kader, the date
of the misconduct is not the date that a dispute arises for purposes of the
EFAA. Here, as in Kader, a dispute did not arise until Defendants filed
charges with the CRD in March 2024. (See Cross-Compl. ¶ 92.) Plaintiff does not
identify any other date when a dispute could have arisen. Because the sexual
harassment dispute arose after March 3, 2022, the EFAA applies.

b. The Claims Accrued After March 3, 2022
Under the Continuing Violation Doctrine  

Under the continuing violation doctrine, a
claim based on a “pattern of reasonably frequent and similar acts” accrues on
the date of the last act. (Willis v. City of Carlsbad (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 1104, 1124.) “[H]ostile work environment claims . . . by their very
nature involve repeated conduct and thus cannot be said to occur on any
particular day.” (Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028,
1057.) “[A] harassment claim is composed of a series of separate acts that
collectively constitute one ‘unlawful employment practice.’” (Ibid.)
Thus, “it is appropriate to apply the continuing violation doctrine to . . .
harassment claims.” (Id. at p. 1058.)

Even if the applicability of the EFAA
depended on the dates of the harassing conduct, Defendants allege that the
conduct “continued throughout the period of [their] employ with TRIXXI.”
(Cross-Compl. ¶ 40.) The conduct allegedly “continued until her departure from
TRIXXI in July 2023.” (Ibid.) Because the harassing conduct continued
past March 3, 2022, the sexual harassment claims accrued after March 3, 2022.
Therefore, the EFAA applies.

III.
Defendants Did Not Waive Their Rights Under the EFAA

            Plaintiff argues that Defendants
waived their right to invoke the EFAA by voluntarily asserting their sexual
harassment allegations in the JAMS arbitration. However, Defendants’
counterclaim in the arbitration does not assert sexual harassment claims. (See
Jablon Decl., Ex. 8.) Defendants did not waive their right to contest
arbitration by filing mandatory responses and participating in required
hearings in the arbitration. (See, e.g., Armstrong v. Michael’s
Stores, Inc. (9th Cir. 2023) 59 F.4th 1011, 1015-16.) Defendants did not
litigate the merits in arbitration. Therefore, Defendants did not waive their
rights under the EFAA.

IV.
There Is No Post-Dispute Arbitration Agreement

            Plaintiff argues that “the
Counterdemand in Arbitration (and conducting of the Arbitration on the same)
constitutes a postdispute agreement to arbitrate that is not impacted by the
provisions of the EFAA.” (Mtn. 18:13-15.) Plaintiff cites no authority for this
argument. It also appears to be derivative of the waiver argument. (See Mtn.
18:13 [“related to the issue of waiver”].) However, as discussed above,
Defendants did not waive their right to invoke the EFAA. There is no evidence
that the parties entered into an arbitration agreement after their dispute
arose, and no authority for the proposition that filing responses and attending
certain proceedings constitute an agreement to arbitrate. 

CONCLUSION

            Plaintiff’s motion to compel
arbitration is DENIED.
