Case No./Name.:      20STCV44666 SARKIS AVAGYAN vs THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA
Motion Name:           MOTION TO AMEND WITNESS LIST
Moving Party:           Plaintiff
Responding Party:    Defendant Jose Gabriel Martinez
Notice:                     Sufficient
 
Ruling:                               MOTION TO AMEND DENIED AS MOOT
 
On
November 20, 2020, Plaintiff filed the present lawsuit, alleging he was a
passenger in a Lyft vehicle involved in a multi-vehicle accident. The jury
trial was recently continued to July 29, 2024. On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff
and Defendant exchanged expert witness designations. Plaintiff designated Don
Stevens as his intended accident reconstruction expert. On March 8, 2024,
Plaintiff's counsel raised the need to augment Plaintiff’s expert designation due
to Mr. Stevens’ unavailability.  On April
2, 2024, as reflected in the Notice of Ruling prepared by Defendant, the Defendant
agreed “to allow Plaintiff to substitute a different accident and biomechanical
expert in place of Plaintiff’s previously designated expert.”  
Accordingly,
it appears to the Court that Defendant already agreed to allow a substitute
expert for Don Stevens.  To the extent
the parties need further communication with the Court regarding who that alternate
expert will be, what he can opine on, and when a deposition of that expert will
be taken, the Court will hear from the parties.
