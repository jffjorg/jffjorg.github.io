Ruling:                              MOTION TO COMPEL FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET
ONE, AND FOR SANCTIONS IS GRANTED.
 
Background
On August 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed the present
auto collision case. On October 10, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant Boris
Navarro with his Form Interrogatories (FROG), Set One. On December 12, 2023,
Plaintiff sent Defendant's counsel, Hanger, Steinberg, Shapiro & Ash,
courtesy copies of the discovery requests. From December 2023 to February 2024,
the parties were in communication, and Plaintiff granted Defendant several
extensions to provide the discovery responses, even allowing Defendant to
preserve his objections. However, Defendant failed to provide the discovery
response by the final deadline set for February 19, 2024, and Plaintiff now
moves the court to compel Defendant to provide discovery responses to
Plaintiff’s FROG, Set One.
 
Legal Standard
 
A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)
 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)
 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.¿¿¿¿ 
¿
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that
the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of
the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery
process includes failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)   A court has
discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791.)  
 
Analysis
 
Motion to
Compel
 
It is
undisputed that Defendant failed to serve an initial response, even one
consisting solely of objections, within the statutory timeline. Defendant filed
an opposition but did not show that a response was served prior to the hearing
date. Therefore, the present motion is thereby GRANTED.
 
Sanctions
 
Sanctions are
mandatory against the party, the attorney, or both whose failure to serve
timely discovery responses necessitated Plaintiff to file the current motion.
(CCP § 2030.290(c).) Defendant's counsel contends that they have
not resolved a representation issue with Defendant's carrier and intend to move
to be relieved as counsel. However, this does not excuse Defendant’s failure to
provide responses for over six months, during most of which time Plaintiff has
also been in communication with defense counsel. Defendant has
requested sanctions in the amount of $1,250.00, which the Court finds reasonable.
Given that Plaintiff’s counsel and Defendant’s counsel have been in
communication since December 12, 2023, with Plaintiff agreeing to several
extensions and even consenting to preserve Defendant’s objections, Plaintiff
has been more than accommodating to Defendant. Thus, under the circumstances,
the Court finds that Defendant did not act with substantial justification and GRANTS
Plaintiff's request for sanctions. Defendant and his counsel are ORDERED,
jointly and severally, to pay sanctions of $1,250.00 to Plaintiff within 20
days of today’s date.
