The tentative ruling is in response to a motion to compel form interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions. The plaintiff, Cesar Chavez, filed the present auto collision case on August 30, 2023. The defendant, Gilmer Figueroa, failed to provide discovery responses, despite several extensions granted by the plaintiff. The court finds that the defendant's failure to provide responses is a misuse of the discovery process and grants the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery responses. The court also orders the defendant and his counsel to pay sanctions of $1,250.00 to the plaintiff.
