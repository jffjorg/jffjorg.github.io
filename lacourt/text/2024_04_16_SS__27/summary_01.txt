And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to amend the witness list in a lawsuit filed by Sarkis Avagyan against the State of California. The plaintiff was a passenger in a Lyft vehicle involved in a multi-vehicle accident and is seeking damages. The jury trial has been continued to July 29, 2024. The parties exchanged expert witness designations, with the plaintiff originally designating Don Stevens as its accident reconstruction expert. However, Don Stevens became unavailable, and the plaintiff sought to substitute a new expert. The defendant agreed to allow the substitution of an alternate expert, making the motion to amend the witness list moot. The judge will hear from the parties regarding the identity of the alternate expert and the scope of their testimony.
