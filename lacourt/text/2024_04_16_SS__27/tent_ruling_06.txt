Notice:                     Sufficient
 
Ruling:                     MOTION TO COMPEL INITIAL RESPONSES TO REQUESTS
FOR ADMISSIONS, SET ONE, AND FOR SANCTIONS IS DENIED
 
On April 26, 2023, Plaintiff Jaheim Martin filed the present
dog bite case. On December 7, 2023, Defendant served its first set of requests
for admissions on Plaintiff. Plaintiff failed to provide a response by the
statutory deadline. On January 19, 2024, Defendant sent a meet and confer
letter requesting responses to the discovery requests at issue. Plaintiff did
not respond to the letter. Defendant now moves the Court to compel Plaintiff to
provide responses to Defendant’s first set of Requests for Admissions under
California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2030.290(b) and 2031.300(b).
However, these sections pertain to interrogatories and requests for production,
respectively. The applicable section for requests for admissions starts with
CCP 2033.010.  Therefore, the present
motion is DENIED, and the request for sanctions is likewise DENIED.
