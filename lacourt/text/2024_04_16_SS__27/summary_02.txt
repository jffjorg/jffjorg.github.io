```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"Based on the case file, the court rules that the motion to compel compliance is granted in part and denied in part. The defendant must produce the unredacted version of their document production, but the plaintiff's request for all of the defendant's documents related to the claim is denied. The court also denies the defendant's request for relief from the waiver of objections and denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that both parties acted with substantial justification. The parties are advised to submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument. Failure to submit or appear may result in the court taking the motion off calendar or adopting the tentative ruling as the order of the court."
