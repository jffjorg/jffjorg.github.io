On August 29, 2022,
Plaintiff Hector Hipolito filed the present case, 22STCV28139, alleging
injuries from a work-related concrete pump accident against four defendants,
including Defendant Catalina Pacific Concrete Company. On September 12, 2022,
Everest National Insurance Company, the worker compensation insurer for
Hipolito’s employer, filed a subrogation claim (Case No. 22STCV29697) against
Defendants M2 Concrete Pumping and Catalina Pacific. On August 21, 2023, the
Court issued a minute order declaring the two cases related, designating
Hipolito’s case (22STCV28139) as the lead case but emphasizing that the cases
are still considered independent of each other. On March 11, 2024, the Court
dismissed Everest’s subrogation claim (22STCV29697). Subsequently, Defendant
Catalina in the lead case filed a motion to compel Everest to produce further
responses to its Response to Defendant’s Request for Production No. 72. Everest
filed an opposition asserting it is not a party to the case and requesting that
the motion be taken off the calendar. Defendant did not file a reply.
The Court's minute
order dated August 21, 2023, clarifies that while the two cases are related,
they remain independent of each other. Although Everest is the Plaintiff in the
subrogation case (22STCV29697), it is not a plaintiff in the lead case.  The fact that the two cases are related does
not automatically make a plaintiff in one case a plaintiff in the other, as the
court has previously emphasized that the cases remain independent of each
other.
Requests for the
production of documents under CCP 2031.010 are applicable only to discovery
between parties in the lawsuit. Consequently, a motion to compel further
responses can only be directed at a party to the dispute. Since Everest is not
a party in the lead case, a motion to compel further against Everest is
therefore inappropriate.
However, the Court notes
that Everest filed a motion for leave to intervene in the lead case on April 5,
2024. The court will continue the current motion to April 30, 2024, at 1:30
p.m. Everest may file a renewed opposition challenging the substance of the
present motion if it chooses and Defendant may likewise file a reply, both on
dates pursuant to Code.
