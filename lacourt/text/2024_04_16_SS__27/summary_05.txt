And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is on the motion to compel further responses to requests for production and for sanctions filed by defendant M2 Concrete Pumping, LLC, against Everest National Insurance Company, the worker compensation insurer for plaintiff Hector Hipolito's employer. The Court notes that Everest is not a party to the lead case and therefore a motion to compel further responses is inappropriate. The Court has previously emphasized that the cases remain independent of each other. The motion is continued to April 30, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.
