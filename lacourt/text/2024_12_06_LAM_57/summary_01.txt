And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling of the judge states that the defendant's demurrer to the claim for breach of fiduciary duty in the plaintiff's first amended complaint is sustained, but with leave to amend. The judge finds that the oral agreement between the plaintiff and defendant to form a partnership to purchase real property in Texas does not establish a partnership for purposes of the breach of fiduciary duty claim. The judge gives the plaintiff the opportunity to cure the pleading defect in the first amended complaint by filing a second amended complaint. The ruling is based on the fact that a joint agreement to purchase property, in and of itself, is insufficient to establish a partnership.
