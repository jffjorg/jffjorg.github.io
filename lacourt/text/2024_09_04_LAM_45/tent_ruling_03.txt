Legal
Standard
Pro hac vice admission in California is governed by California Rules of Court, Rule
9.40.  To be admitted pro hac vice, one must be “a member in good
standing of and eligible to practice before the bar of any United States court
or the highest court in any state, territory, or insular possession of the
United States.”  California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40(a).  However,
in no case shall an attorney appear pro hac vice if the attorney is a
resident of California, regularly employed in California, or “regularly engaged
in substantial business, professional, or other activities in the State of
California.”  Ibid.   
 
An attorney
seeking pro hac vice admission must file a verified application in both
court and the State Bar of California establishing  
 
(1) [t]he
applicant's residence and office address; (2)[t]he courts to
which the applicant has been admitted to practice and the dates of admission;
(3)[t]hat the
applicant is a member in good standing in those courts; (4)[t]hat the
applicant is not currently suspended or disbarred in any court; (5)[t]he title of
court and cause in which the applicant has filed an application to appear as
counsel¿pro hac vice¿in this state in the preceding two years, the date
of each application, and whether or not it was granted; and (6)[t]he name,
address, and telephone number of the active member of the State Bar of
California who is attorney of record.  (California Rules of Court, Rule
9.40(d). )
 
Lastly, repeated
applications for pro hac vice appearance may result in denial. 
California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40(b).  
 
Discussion
            Merits

Rule 9.40. Counsel Van Leeuwen and Peyrot are not residents of California. (van

New York. (Peyrot Decl. ¶ 3.) Counsel van Leeuwen is admitted to practice in New

            It
is so ordered.
