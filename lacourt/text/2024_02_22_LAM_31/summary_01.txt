And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Johann Peeters. The plaintiff, German Pantoja Reyes, had served Peeters with a notice of deposition, but Peeters objected and refused to provide a deposition date. Although Peeters's new counsel was substituted, they also refused to provide a deposition date. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel the deposition, which the judge finds is timely. The judge orders Peeters to appear for deposition and imposes sanctions of $1,060 on Peeters. The judge also finds that sanctions are mandatory in this case and orders Peeters to pay the sanctions.
