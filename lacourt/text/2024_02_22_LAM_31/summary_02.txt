And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is based on the events that occurred at a hearing on January 2, 2024, where counsel for the plaintiff failed to appear. The court continued the motion to allow counsel to appear and discuss available dates for the deposition. On January 3, 2024, counsel for the plaintiff filed a declaration explaining the failure to appear. On January 10, 2024, counsel for the defendant filed an objection to the continuance of the hearing, citing California Rule of Court 3.1304 (d) and arguing that the court had two options: take the motion off calendar or rule on the motion. The court overruled the objection, citing its discretion in controlling its calendar or docket. The court notes that if it had taken the motion off calendar, it could have put the matter back on calendar on its own motion, which would be consistent with the ruling in R & A Vending Services v. City of Los Angeles (1985).
