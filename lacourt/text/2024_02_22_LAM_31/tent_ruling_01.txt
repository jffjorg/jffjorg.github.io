MOTION
TO COMPEL DEPOSITION OF DEFENDANT JOHANN PEETERS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
German Pantoja Reyes
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Johann
Peeters
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On July 12, 2022, Plaintiff, German Pantoja Reyes, filed a
Complaint against Defendants, Johann Peeters (“Peeters”) and Money Tax Group,
Inc., alleging causes of action for (1) Violation of the Tax Preparation Act
(Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 22250 et
seq.), (2) Fraud, (3) Violation of Penal Code § 496, and (4) Unfair Competition. 

 
            On December
30, 2022, Plaintiff served Peeters with a Notice of Deposition for January 19,
2023.  The Notice did not include a
request for documents.  Peeters timely
served a written objection to the deposition on the grounds the deposition date
was unilaterally scheduled.  The parties
met and conferred.  Peeters’s
then-counsel stated he would provide alternate dates.  No new dates, however, were provided.  
 
            On February
23, 2023, Peeters substituted new counsel.  On August 29, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
contacted Peeters’s new counsel about a deposition date.  Defense counsel refused to provide a date.
 
            On
September 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel Peeters’s
deposition.  Plaintiff requests sanctions
against Peeters.
 
            Peeters
filed an Opposition.  Plaintiff replied[1].
                         
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS
 
Any party may obtain discovery by
taking in California the oral deposition of any person.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.010.)  “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action…without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(a).)   
 
            Monetary
Sanctions¿ 
¿ 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court
to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿¿ 
 
            “If
a motion under [Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450] subdivision (a) is
granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and
against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless
the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)¿¿¿¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Peeters argues
the motion should be denied because it is untimely.  In support, Peeters cites Unzipped
Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 123 (Unzipped Apparel)
for the proposition that a motion to compel a deposition must be filed within
60 days after a valid objection is served. 
In Unzipped Apparel, the Court of Appeal considered the issue of
timeliness of a motion to compel the production of business records brought
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision (b).  The Appellate Court held that
“objections served in response to ... business records subpoenas constituted a
record of a deposition” triggering the 60-day deadline.   (Unzipped Apparel, 156 Cal.App.4th at
p. 136.)  
 
            Unzipped
Apparel does not apply here.  Unlike Unzipped
Apparel, Plaintiff served, and Peeters objected to, the notice for taking
Peeters’s oral deposition.  Further, Section 2025.480 requires that a motion to compel a deponent
to answer any question or to produce any document specified in the deposition
notice or deposition subpoena be made no later than 60 days after the
completion of the record of the deposition. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480,
subds. (a), (b).)  Here, Peeters’s deposition never took place.  As such, this motion does not (and cannot) seek
to compel Peeters’s answer to any deposition question.  Unzipped Apparel does not stand for
the proposition that an objection to an oral deposition that never occurs begins
the 60-day clock to bring a motion to compel.[2]  The 60-day clock did not start in this
case.  Plaintiff’s motion is timely.  
 
            Further,
it is undisputed that Plaintiff properly served Peeters with a Notice of
Deposition and that Plaintiff met and conferred with Peeters’s new counsel
prior to the filing of this motion.  Peeters refused to provide alternate
deposition dates based on an incorrect application of Unzipped Apparel.  Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to an order
compelling Peeters to appear for deposition.
 
            Monetary
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Peeters.  Given
the foregoing, sanctions are warranted.  Indeed,
in the context of a motion to compel a party’s deposition, sanctions are mandatory.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)  Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against Peeters
in the amount of $1,060, consisting of two hours at Plaintiff’s counsel hourly
rate and $60 in filing fees.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            The motion
is GRANTED.  Defendant Johann Peeters is
ordered to appear for deposition.
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is GRANTED. 
Sanctions are imposed against Peeters in the sum of $1,060, to be paid
to Plaintiff, by and through his counsel.
 
            Peeters is
to appear for deposition and to pay sanctions within 30 days of this order. 
 
Moving party to give notice, unless waived.
