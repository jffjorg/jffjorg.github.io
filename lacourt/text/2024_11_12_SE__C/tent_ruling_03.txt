Background 
This is a personal injury action. On December 19, 2022,
Plaintiffs Fariba Santos, Garbriel Herrarte, Zareena Herrate, Rayleena Muniz,
and Raider Muiz (“Plaintiffs”) filed suit against Defendants Taylor Laine Springer and Kurt Springer
("Defendants”) alleging motor vehicle negligence and negligence.  Plaintiffs allege that on December 18, 2020,
Defendants so negligently and recklessly operated, entrusted and maintained
defendants’ vehicle that they struck Plaintiffs [sic] vehicle, causing severe property
damage and severe bodily injury. (Complaint, p. 5.) 
Defendants move to compel responses to Request for
Production of Documents (Set One) and Form Interrogatories (Set One) from
Plaintiff Fariba Santos (“Santos”). 
As of November 4, 2024, no opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
 
If a party to whom interrogatories and document demands are
directed fails to respond at all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a
court order compelling answers thereto. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) All that
needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served on the opposing
party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind
has been served. The moving party is not required to show a reasonable and good
faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before filing this motion. A
motion to compel initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting
and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate
statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
Discussion
On or about November 1, 2023, Defendants
served Form Interrogatories
(Set One) and Demand for Production of Documents.
(Maxwell Decl., ¶ 2; Exhibit A.) Plaintiff Santos failed to respond by the due date of
December 5, 2023. (Id.,
¶ 3.) Despite Defendants’ meet
and confer efforts, no response had been received from Plaintiff
Santos as of April 11, 2024, the date the instant motions were filed. (Id., ¶ 6.)  
Defendants’
motions to compel responses to Request for Production of Documents (Set One)
and Form Interrogatories (Set One) are GRANTED. 
Plaintiff Santos is ordered to provide verified responses without objection, including
objections based on privilege or the protection for work product, within 30
days.  
Sanctions 
 
Misuse of the discovery process constituting conduct subject to
sanctions include “failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery” and “failing to confer in person, by telephone, or by letter with an
opposing party or attorney in a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve
informally any dispute concerning discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subds. (d) and (i).) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).) 
 
Defendants request sanctions in the amount of $2,060.00 for
each motion, or $4,120.00 in total for (4 hours preparing the motions, 4
anticipated hours preparing replies and attending the hearing at a rate of
$500.00 plus reimbursement of the $60.00 filing fees).  Because the motions are unopposed and substantially
similar to each other, the Court awards sanctions in the total reduced amount
of $1,620.00 (3 hours to prepare the motions and to attend the hearing, and
reimbursement of $120.00 in filing fees).
