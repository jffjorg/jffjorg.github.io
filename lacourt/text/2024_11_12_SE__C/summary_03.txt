And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Fariba Santos, et al. vs. Taylor Laine Springer, et al. The defendants' motions to compel responses to request for production of documents (Set One) and form interrogatories (Set One) from Plaintiff Fariba Santos are granted. Plaintiff Santos failed to respond to the discovery requests, despite being served with them on November 1, 2023, and despite the defendants' efforts to meet and confer. The court awards sanctions of $1,620.00 to the defendants for the misuse of the discovery process. The sanctions are reduced from the amount requested by the defendants, as the motion was unopposed and the court found that the defendants' efforts to meet and confer were reasonable. The Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified responses without objection, including objections based on privilege or the protection for work product, within 30 days.
