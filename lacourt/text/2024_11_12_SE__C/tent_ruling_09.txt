Tentative Ruling 
Defendant City of Bellflower’s Demurrer is
OVERRULED. 
Plaintiffs to give notice.
 
Background 
This is a personal injury case.  In a Complaint filed on December 1, 2023, Plaintiffs
Estate of Lori Braza and Julia Braza as Successor-in-Interest of Decedent Lori
Braza (“Plaintiffs”) allege that on or about December 20, 2022, “Decedent LORI
BRAZA was lawfully walking on Cedar St. near 8536-8522 Cedar St. when she
tripped on an uneven, broken, raised and/or deteriorating portion of the
pavement and/or sidewalk. This caused Plaintiff to fall and sustain serious
injuries and damages.” (Complaint, pp. 6-8.) Plaintiffs assert causes of action
for General Negligence and Premises Liability against City of Bellflower,
County of Los Angeles, State of California, California Department of
Transportation, and Cedar Private Homes. 

Defendant City of Bellflower (“the City”) demurs to the
First and Second Causes of Action on the grounds that Plaintiffs failed to
comply with the mandatory provisions of the Government Claims Act before filing
the instant lawsuit.  
Evidentiary Objections 
The Court rules as follows to the objections presented to by
Plaintiffs: 
Objection Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are OVERRULED. 
Legal Standard 
A demurrer can be used
only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack;
or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  No other extrinsic evidence can
be considered (i.e., no “speaking demurrers”).  
 
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City
of Los Angeles Dep’t of Water & Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216,
1228.)  In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face
of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury
Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.  Therefore, it lies
only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.”  (SKF Farms v. Superior Ct. (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902,
905.)  “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.”  (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
 
Discussion 
The City
argues that Plaintiffs Estate of Lori Braza and Julia Braza, as
Successor-in-Interest of Decedent Lori Braza, were each required to file their
own government claim with the City on or before January 29, 2024, which was six
months after the death of Lori Braza on July 27, 2023.
 
The California Tort Claims Act (Act) (Gov.Code, § 810 et seq.) governs
actions against public entities and public employees. The timeliness of such
actions is governed by the specific statute
of limitations set forth in the Government Code, not the statute of limitations applicable to
private defendants. (County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2005)
127 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1267.) Under the Act, no person may sue a public entity
or public employee for “money or damages” unless a timely written claim has
been presented to and denied by the public entity. (Gov.Code, § 945.4.) A claim
pertaining to a cause of action for personal injury must be filed within six
months after the cause of action accrues. (County of Los Angeles, supra, 127
Cal.App.4th at 1267.) “The general rule for defining the accrual of a cause of
action sets the date as the time ‘when, under the substantive law, the wrongful
act is done,’ or the wrongful result
occurs, and the consequent ‘liability arises.’ [Citation.] In other words, it
sets the date as the time when the cause of action is complete with all of its
elements.” (Norgart v. Upjohn Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th
383, 397.)
 
Failure
to allege facts in the complaint demonstrating compliance with the
prelitigation governmental claims presentation requirements subjects the
complaint to a general demurrer. (State of Calif. v. Sup. Ct. (Bodde)
(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1239.)
 
Here,
Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded compliance with the California Tort Claims
Act.  The Complaint alleges that the City
was served with a claim for damages on June 9, 2023. (Complaint, Attachment
page, Second Cause of Action.) This date is within six-months of the date of
injury on December 20, 2022.  
 
Survival
causes of action are governed by CCP §377.30 which provides: “A cause of action
that survives the death of the person entitled to commence an action or
proceeding passes to the decedent’s successor in interest … and an action may
be commenced by the decedent’s personal representative or, if none, by the
decedent’s successor in interest.” Therefore, this lawsuit, which survives the
death of Lori Braza, is properly commenced by her Successor-in-Interest, Julia
Braza.  
 
The City
argues that Plaintiffs were required to file separate government claims within
6 months of Lori Braza’s death.  This
argument presumes that Plaintiffs are seeking damages for wrongful death.  They are not. 
Unlike a wrongful death action, a survival action is a cause of action
that existed while the decedent is alive and survives the decedent. The decedent's
personal representative or successor in interest may commence that action. (Grant
v. McAuliffe (1953) 41 Cal.2d 859, 864; Quiroz v. Seventh Avenue Center (2006)
140 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1264 [“Unlike a cause of action for wrongful death, a
survivor cause of action is not a new cause of action that vests in the heirs
on the death of the decedent. It is instead a separate and distinct cause of
action which belonged to the decedent before death but, by statute, survives
that event.”] Simply put, because Plaintiffs are not seeking damages for
wrongful death, they need not allege that such claims were filed in compliance
with the California Tort Claims Act. 
 
The City’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
