Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff MPLI Capital Holdings IV Pharmacy’s
Motion to Deem Request for Admissions Admitted as to Defendant Javier Martinez
is GRANTED.  No sanctions.  
Plaintiff to give notice.
 
On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff MPLI Capital Holdings IV
(“Plaintiff”) filed this breach of contract lawsuit against Defendant Javier
Martinez (“Defendant”).
Plaintiff moves for an order to Deem Request for Admissions
Admitted as to Defendant pursuant to CCP § 2033.280(b).   
As of November 4, 2024, no opposition has been filed. 
Pursuant to CCP § 2033.280(b), where there has been no timely response to requests for
admissions, a “requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of
any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted …” 
 
On January 11, 2024,
Plaintiff served Request for Admissions (Set One) upon Defendant by mail. (D’anna
Decl., ¶2.) Responses were due on or before February 16, 2024. (Ibid.) As
of the filing date of the instant motion (March 12, 2024), no responses have
been provided. (Id., ¶ 3.)
 
Thus, the motion is GRANTED.  The genuineness of any documents and the
truth of any matters specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admissions (Set One)
is deemed admitted.  
A
court must impose monetary sanctions on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admissions necessitated the
motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §2033.280(c).) Here, no request for sanctions was
made.  Accordingly, the Court does not
grant sanctions.
