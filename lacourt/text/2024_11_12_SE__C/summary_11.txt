The judge has granted the motion of Counsel Jeremy J. Alberts and BWA Law Group, APC to be relieved as counsel for Defendant and Cross-Complainant Ramzy Saad. The motion is unopposed and good cause exists for the withdrawal of counsel based on a breakdown in the working relationship with the client. The client's insistence on presenting a claim or defense that is not warranted under existing law and cannot be supported by good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, or by other conduct renders it unreasonably difficult for the member to carry out the employment effectively. The judge finds that the client's actions constitute good cause for withdrawal under Rule 3-700(C) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
