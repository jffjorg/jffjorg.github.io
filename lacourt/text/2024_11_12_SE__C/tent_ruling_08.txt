On October 12, 2023, Plaintiff Jean Gluck (“Plaintiff”) filed
this lawsuit against Defendant Guy Christensen (“Defendant”) based upon an
incident at The Gardens Casino located at 11871 E. Carson Street, Hawaiian
Gardens, California, 90716, on December 16, 2022.  Plaintiff alleges Defendant made a sexual
advance towards her and grabbed her buttocks. 
Plaintiff asserts causes of action for sexual battery and intentional
infliction of emotional distress.
Defendant moves to compel responses to Request for
Production of Documents (Set One), Form Interrogatories (Set One), and Special
Interrogatories (Set One).
Legal
Standard
If a party to whom interrogatories and document
demands are directed fails to respond at all, the propounding party’s remedy is
to seek a court order compelling answers thereto. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
All that needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served. The moving party is not required to show a reasonable
and good faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before filing this
motion. A motion to compel initial discovery responses need not show good
cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by
a separate statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac.
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)
If a party fails to timely respond to interrogatories or document
demands, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to exercise
the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives
any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).)  
 
Discussion 
On November 13, 2023, Defendant
served upon Plaintiff Request for Production of Documents (Set One), Form
Interrogatories (Set One), and Special Interrogatories (Set One). (Zacher
Decl., ¶2; Exhibit A.) Responses were originally due on December 12, 2023, but
Defendant agreed to an extension to January 18, 2024. (Id., ¶2.) As of
the date the instant motions were filed (February 14, 2024) no responses had
been received from Plaintiff. (Id., ¶3.) 
In
Opposition, Plaintiff states that code-compliant verified responses were served
to all discovery requests, without objections, on October 28, 2024. (Bertch
Decl., ¶ 2.) 
 
Because
Plaintiff has served responses, the motions to compel responses is MOOT.  
 
Sanctions
 
Failure to respond to discovery requests is misuse of the
discovery process subject to sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.) The
court is required to award monetary sanctions against Plaintiff unless
Plaintiff can show she “acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) The monetary
sanction shall be in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney's
fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030.) 
 
Defendant requests $2,511.50 in sanctions for the Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, $2,861.50 in sanctions for the Motion to
Compel Response to Request for Production of Documents, $2,511.50 in sanctions
for the Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories.  
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel explains that his professional calendar was impacted with numerous
litigation deadlines, he has no staff or associate attorneys as a sole
practitioner, he hired a contract attorney to assist him with litigation
matters, and that as President of the Orange County Trial Lawyers Association
his time was greatly strained. (Bertch Decl., ¶ 3.) 
 
The
Court determines that sanctions are warranted because Plaintiff delayed nearly one
year before providing responses.  However,
given the simplicity of the moving papers and the lack of any substantive
opposition, the Court imposes sanctions in the sum of
$1050.00 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s Counsel, jointly and severally,
payable within 60 days.
