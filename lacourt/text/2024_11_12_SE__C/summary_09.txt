And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the City's demurrer, which challenges the complaint filed by the Plaintiffs, Estate of Lori Braza and Julia Braza as Successor-in-Interest of Decedent Lori Braza. The City argues that the Plaintiffs failed to comply with the mandatory provisions of the Government Claims Act before filing the lawsuit. However, the judge has determined that the Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded compliance with the California Tort Claims Act, which governs actions against public entities and public employees. The judge has also ruled that the City's demurrer is unfounded and has overruled it. The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the Plaintiffs have alleged that they filed a claim for damages with the City on June 9, 2023, which is within the six-month period allowed by the Government Claims Act. The judge has also noted that the City's argument assumes that the Plaintiffs are seeking damages for wrongful death, which is not the case. Instead, the Plaintiffs are seeking damages for a survival cause of action, which is a separate and distinct cause of action that existed while Lori Braza was alive and survives her death.
