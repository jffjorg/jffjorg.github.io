Group, LLC, Case No.: 23NWCV01830
This is a personal injury action.
Defendant Sage Environmental Group, LLC applies ex parte for an order
continuing the Mandatory Settlement Conference (“MSC”) scheduled for November
15, 2024 to January 27, 2025. Defendant contends that its adjuster is not
available due to having to report to jury duty on November 15, 2024. 
Plaintiff opposes the application due to Defendant’s prior failure to appear at
a MSC on October 30, 2024.  Plaintiff has no objection to a different
adjuster appearing remotely.  The Ex Parte Application is DENIIED. 
Alternatively, the Court finds good cause to continue the MSC to December 2,
2024, or as soon thereafter as may be convenient for the Court, counsel, and
the parties.  Moving party to give notice.
