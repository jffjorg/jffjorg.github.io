And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is issued in the case of Rafael Mora Gonzalez vs. Leticia Banuelos, Case No. 23NWCV01301. The defendant's motion to compel the production of Rafael Mora Gonzalez's cellular device is granted, and the plaintiff must comply within 45 days. Sanctions are imposed on the plaintiff in the amount of $470.00.

The plaintiff's counsel, Rene Gutierrez, Esq., has moved to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The court grants the motion, citing good cause for withdrawal.

The case arises out of a motor vehicle accident that occurred on April 30, 2021, and the plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the defendant on April 28, 2023. The defendant served the plaintiff with a demand for inspection of the cellular device on April 9, 2024, and the plaintiff failed to respond. The defendant filed a motion to compel production of the device on August 8, 2024.

The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the demand constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and imposes sanctions on the plaintiff. The court also grants the defendant's motion to compel production of the cellular device, ordering the plaintiff to comply within 45 days.
