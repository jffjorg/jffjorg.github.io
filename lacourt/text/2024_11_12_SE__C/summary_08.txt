And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding defendant Guy Christensen's motions to compel responses to discovery requests. The motions are deemed moot since the plaintiff has already served responses to the requests. However, the judge has imposed sanctions on the plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $1050.00 for their failure to respond to the discovery requests in a timely manner. The sanctions are payable within 60 days. The judge found that the plaintiff's delay in providing responses was unreasonable and constituted a misuse of the discovery process.
