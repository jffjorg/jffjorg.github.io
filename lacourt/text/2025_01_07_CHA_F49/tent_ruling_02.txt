BACKGROUND
 
On June 27, 2023, Plaintiff Sanah “Sonya” Hamad (“Plaintiff”
or “Hamad”) initiated this action. Subsequently, on
January 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed her First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). 
 
On May 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed
her operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendants Prezzee, Inc.
(“Prezzee”), Peter Durham (“Durham”) (collectively, “Defendants”) and Does 1
through 10, alleging eleven causes of action: (1) Reproductive Health
Decision-Making Discrimination in Violation of FEHA (Gov. Code, §§ 12940 et
seq.), (2) Sex Discrimination in Violation of FEHA (Gov. Code, §§ 12940 et
seq.), (3) Disability Discrimination in Violation of FEHA (Gov. Code, §§ 12940
et seq.), (4) Retaliation in Violation of FEHA (Gov. Code, §§ 12940 et seq.),
(5) Harassment in Violation of FEHA (Gov. Code, §§ 12940 et seq.), (6) Failure
to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment and/or Retaliation in Violation of FEHA
(Gov. Code, § 12940, subd. (k)), (7) Failure to Engage in the Interactive
Process in Violation of FEHA (Gov. Code, §§ 12940 et seq.), (8) Failure to
Accommodate in Violation of FEHA (Gov. Code, §§ 12940 et seq.), (9) Retaliation
in Violation of Labor Code § 1102.5, (10) Wrongful Termination in Violation of
Public Policy, and (11) Failure to Reimburse Business Expenses. Subsequently,
on June 6, 2024, Defendants filed their Answer to the SAC.
 
 
On September 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel
Michelle Schober and Victoria Volfovski to Answer Questions at Deposition (the
“Motion”). Subsequently, Defendant Prezzee filed its Opposition on December 23,
2024, and Plaintiff replied on January 2, 2025.


ANALYSIS
 
“If a deponent
fails to answer any question or to produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s control that is specified
in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery
may move the court for an order compelling that answer or production.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (a).) Additionally, “This motion shall be made no
later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the deposition, and
shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (b).)
 
“The court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel an answer or production, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.480, subd. (j).)
 
A.   
Meet and
Confer
 
The Court finds that
Plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer requirement (See Bodell Decl. ¶ 5.)
 
B.    
Timeliness
 
A motion to compel a
deponent to answer a question must be “made no later than 60 days after the
completion of the record of the deposition.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480,
subd. (b).) 
 
Here, the certified
completed deposition transcripts of non-party deponents Michelle Schober
(“Schober”) and Victoria Volfovski (“Volfovski”) were served by the court
reporter on June 19 and June 25, 2024, respectively. (Opp’n. at p. 3, Bronstein
Decl. ¶¶ 12, 13.) Defendant Prezzee contends that the Motion is untimely,
arguing that the deadlines to file a motion to compel answers were August 19,
2024, for Schober and August 25, 2024, for Volfovski. However, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion on September 16, 2024, more than three weeks after these
deadlines had passed. (Opp’n. at p. 3.) 
 
By contrast, Plaintiff contends that her Motion is
timely, asserting that the 60-day time limit under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.480 is not triggered until after the 30-day period for deponents
to correct and sign the transcript, citing Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.520. (Reply at p. 2.) Plaintiff relies on subdivision (b) of section
2025.520, which states, in pertinent part, that “[f]or 30 days following each notice under subdivision (a), unless the
attending parties and the deponent agree on the record or otherwise in writing
to a longer or shorter time period, the deponent may change the form or the
substance of the answer to a question, and may either approve the transcript of
the deposition by signing it, or refuse to approve the transcript by not
signing it.”
 
Plaintiff acknowledges the procedural distinction
between “the reporter giving notice that the deposition transcript has been
completed” and “[the expiration of] the time for the deponent to correct and
sign the transcript has expired.” (Reply at p. 2.) Nevertheless, Plaintiff
contends that the phrase “completion of the record of the deposition” under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480 should be interpreted to mean the same
as “approv[al] [of] the transcript” under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.520.
Plaintiff fails to provide any legal authority to support this interpretation,
and the Court finds it unpersuasive.
 
Section 2025.480 and 2025.520 address distinct issues,
as evidenced by their placement under separate articles of the Code of Civil
Procedure and the remedies they provide. Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.480 authorizes the party seeking discovery to move the court for an order
compelling that answer or production, which is directly on point for the
instant Motion. By contrast, Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.520 governs
the deponent’s right to approve or correct the transcript or seek to suppress
the deposition. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.520, subds. (b), (f) and (g).) If
the deponent files a seasonable motion to suppress the deposition, “the court
may determine that the reasons given for the failure or refusal to approve the
transcript require rejection of the deposition in whole or in part.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.520, subd. (g).)
 
Plaintiff’s interpretation imposes
a condition on section 2025.480’s 60-day deadline, contingent on an uncertain period
during which a court might resolve a motion under section 2025.520. This
reading lacks support in the statutory text or legislative intent. Courts
consistently hold that if the statutory language is not ambiguous on its
face and no latent ambiguity is identified, “‘“we presume the Legislature meant
what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.”’” (Pratt v.
Vencor, Inc. (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 905, 909.)
 
The Court observes that the language of Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.480 neither states nor implies that its 60-day time
limit is contingent upon a separate procedural or its outcome under section 2025.520.
In other words, the latter section does not alter or extend the mandatory
60-day deadline. The plain language of section 2025.480 establishes that the
60-day deadline is triggered by the court reporter’s notice of the deposition
record’s completion, rather than by the deponent’s approval or correction of
the transcript. Therefore, Defendant Prezzee correctly states that the
deadlines for Plaintiff’s motion to compel answers were August 19 and August
25, 2024, respectively. Since Plaintiff filed the motion on September 16, 2024,
it is untimely under the statute.
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion.
 
C.    Monetary
Sanctions
 
“The court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel an answer or production, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.480, subd. (j).)
 
            Defendant Prezzee seeks monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $4,000.00. (Opp’n. at p. 7,
Bronstein Decl. ¶ 20.)
 
            The Court finds the mandatory
sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision (j)
applicable under the circumstances. Utilizing the lodestar approach, the Court
determines the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the Defendant Prezzee’s work performed in connection with its
Opposition to the Motion to be $900.00, calculated based on a reasonable hourly
rate of $450.00 for 2 hours of work reasonably spent.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant
Prezzee’s request for monetary sanctions, awarding Prezzee $900.00 against
Plaintiff for unsuccessfully making the Motion pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision (j).
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Sanah “Sonya” Hamad’s Motion to Compel Michelle
Schober and Victoria Volfovski to Answer Questions at Deposition is DENIED.
 
Defendant
Prezzee, Inc.’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
Plaintiff Sanah “Sonya” Hamad and
her attorney of record are ordered to pay $900.00, jointly and severally, to
Defendant Prezzee,
Inc.’s attorney of record.
