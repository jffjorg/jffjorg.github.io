Disposition 


REVIEW/CONTINUE 


 



Upon reviewing the Petition, the Court identifies the
following deficiencies:
 
(1)  
Lack of Proof of
Service
 
The petition does not include proof of service,
demonstrating the petition papers have been served on Defendant.
 
(2)  
Missing Information
regarding Blocked Account(s)
 
Under paragraph 9a of the MC-350, Petitioner shall
“specify name, branch, and address of each depository, and the
amount of each account.” However, Petitioner has not provided any information. 
 
(3)  
Incorrect Amount Entered
on the Proposed Order MC-351
 
Under paragraph 8a of the MC-351 form, Petitioner
appears to have entered incorrect amount for “Medical, hospital, ambulance,
nursing, and other similar expenses payable directly to providers as follows,
in the total amount of: $450.00”
 
Accordingly, the
Court requires supplemental information and/or amended petition papers to address
these deficiencies. A ruling will be issued after Petitioner has had an
opportunity to correct the issues identified above.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Petitioner
Rachel Alvarez’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim for Minor Alexis Alvarez is CONTINUED
to allow for the submission of additional information or corrections.
 
Moving
party to give notice.
