And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Application for Admission Pro Hac Vice filed by Attorney Jenna Fischman, Esq. on behalf of Defendant Playa Hotels & Resorts, LLC. The application was filed without opposition and the judge has denied it without prejudice. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the applicant has not satisfied the procedural and substantive requirements set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40, including the requirement for proof of service of the application and notice of hearing on all parties who have appeared in the cause. The judge has also noted that the applicant has not appeared pro hac vice in California courts before and that the repeated appearances by out-of-state counsel in California lawsuits may be cause for denial of the application.
