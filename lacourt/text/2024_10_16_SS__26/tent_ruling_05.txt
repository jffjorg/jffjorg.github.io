ANALYSIS:
 
On March 13, 2024, Defendant Budget Truck Rental, LLC (“Defendant”)
served Form Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set One, on
Plaintiff Robert Hawes (“Plaintiff”). (Motions, Bergerson
Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort, Plaintiff has not
served responses to the discovery. (Id. at ¶¶5-7 and Exh. B.) Defendant
filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set
One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on September 6, 2024. Plaintiff’s
counsel filed opposition declarations on October 7, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Based on Plaintiff’s failure to serve initial responses to
the discovery, the Motions to Compel Responses to the Form and Special
Interrogatories, are granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) There is no
requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to compel
initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) Furthermore, the
motion can be brought at any time after the responding party fails to provide
the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) Therefore, Defendant is entitled
to an order compelling Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the
Interrogatories, without objections.
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for
simple and unopposed motions. Pursuant to a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $460.00 based on two hours of
attorney time billed at $230.00 per hour. (Motion, Bergerman Decl., ¶9.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Budget Truck Rental, LLC’s (1) Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion
to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions, are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF
ROBERT HAWES IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS, WITHOUT
OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF IS ORDERED TO PAY
SANCTIONS OF $460.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
