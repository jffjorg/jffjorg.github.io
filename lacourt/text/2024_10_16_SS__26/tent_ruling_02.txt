Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees
 
“The judgment creditor may claim under this section the
following costs of enforcing a judgment: . . . (6) Attorney's fees, if allowed by Section
685.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.070, subd. (a).) Code of Civil Procedure, section 685.040
states: “The
judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of
enforcing a judgment. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not
included in costs collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by
law. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as
costs collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an award
of attorney’s fees to the judgment creditor pursuant
to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section
1033.5.” Also, the motion must be brought within two years of the incurred
costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080, subd. (a).) 
 
Judgment
Creditor is entitled to attorney’s fees incurred enforcing its judgment pursuant to
Code
of Civil Procedure section 685.040 based on the award of attorney’s fees in the underlying
sister-state judgment. (Motion, RJN, Exh. 1, p. 2:4-5.) The Motion is timely filed with
respect to fees incurred between August 26, 2022 and July 3, 2024. (Motion,
Baillio Decl., ¶¶7-8.) 
 
Calculation
of Attorney Fees and Costs
 
The Court’s objective is to award
attorney fees at the fair market value
based on the particular action.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  “The reasonable hourly
rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily
begins with the 'lodestar,' i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.)  The lodestar method is based on the factors, as
relevant to the particular case: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Id. at 1132.) “The ‘‘experienced
trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in
his court, and while his judgment is of course
subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’’” (Id.) A negative modifier was appropriate
when duplicative work had been performed.
(Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.) 
 
Judgment
Creditor submits the declaration of its attorney, Austin Baillio (“Baillio”)
with an itemization of work performed, in support of its request for attorney’s
fees. (Motion, Baillio Decl. and Exh. A.) Baillio declares he billed 3.6 hours
of attorney time on collection efforts and the drafting of the instant Motion.
(Id. at ¶¶6, 12 and Exh. A.) The hourly rate started at $325.00 per hour
and increased to $375.00 per hour. (Id. at ¶6.) Baillio also billed three
flat fees of $450.00 each and one flat fee of $150.00 for writs of execution
and earnings withholding orders. (Id. at ¶7 and Exh. A.) Finally, three
paralegals billing at $150.00 to $175.00 per hour spent 2.8 hours on this
action during the same time frame. (Id. at ¶¶8-11 and Exh. A.) The Court
finds these fees are reasonable based on the continuing post-judgment
enforcement efforts undertaken by Judgment Creditor and the hourly rates
charged. Judgment Creditor is awarded attorney’s fees in the amount of $3,835.00.

 
Plaintiff
also incurred costs from investigation, filing fees, appearance fees, and other
costs in the amount of $1,612.97. (Id. at Exh. A.) The Court finds the
costs should be reduced under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, pursuant
to the Court’s discretion under subdivision (c)(4) with respect to costs not
expressly allowed for “postage” and “background investigation.” (Ibid.)
Accordingly, Judgment Creditor is awarded costs of $1,548.73.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff Western American Loan,
Inc’s Motion for Award of Attorney’s Fees and
Costs is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,835.00
ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND $1,548.73 COSTS.
