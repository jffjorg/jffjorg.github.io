STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On October 13, 2021, Plaintiff Arleen M. Asadoorian
(Plaintiff) filed a Complaint against Defendant General Motors, LLC with six
causes of action for: (1) violation of Civ. Code § 1793.2(D); (2) violation of
Civ. Code § 1793.2(B); (3) violation of Civ. Code § 1793.2(A)(3); (4) breach of
express written warranty; (5) breach of the implied warranty of
merchantability; and (6) fraud by omission.
 
According to the Complaint, Plaintiff purchased a Chevrolet
Cruze in February 2011 which contained or developed defects. The Subject
Vehicle required multiple repairs, but Defendant failed to replace the vehicle.
 
On November 17, 2021, Defendant filed a demurrer with motion
to strike.
 
On February 10, 2022, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC).
 
On March 10, 2022, Defendant filed a demurrer to the FAC
with motion to strike which the court SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
 
On July 25, 2022, Defendant filed an Answer.
 
On May 17, 2023, the parties stipulated to continue trial
and all related dates.
 
On June 12, 2024, the court held a Final Status Conference.
Plaintiff did not appear. The court continued the Final Status Conference to
June 17, 2024.
 
On June 17, 2024, the court held the continued Final Status
Conference. Plaintiff appeared telephonically but did not respond when the
court called the matter. The court called the matter for Trial at 10:28 a.m.
Plaintiff did not respond. On the court’s own motion, the court dismissed the
matter without prejudice pursuant to CCP § 581(b)(5).
 
On June 18, 2024, Plaintiff moved ex parte for an Order setting aside the dismissal which the court
DENIED.
 
On June 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. On
September 26, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition. Replies were due on or
before October 3, 2024. As of October 7, 2024, the court has not received a
reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“The court may,
upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect…¿ [The application]¿shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.”¿ (CCP¿§¿473(b).) Courts must grant relief when the
attorney’s inexcusable neglect results in the dismissal. (Ibid.) Otherwise, relief under this section is discretionary. (Ibid.) This section also applies to
orders of dismissal resulting from voluntary settlement agreements. (Zamora v. Clayborn Contracting Group, Inc.
(2002) 28 Cal.4th 249, 255 (Zamora)
[internal citations omitted].)  
¿ 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff contends that relief is warranted because counsel
mistakenly believed their request for remote appearance had been granted, that
they had enough time to appear after their 8:30 a.m. hearing, and ultimately
failed to appear because they could not hear the court when they logged in
remotely for the 10:00 a.m. Jury Trial hearing. Defendant argues relief is not
warranted because Plaintiff counsel was not prepared for trial, not mistakenly
appeared telephonically. 
 
CCP § 473(b) provides that when an application for relief
is made no more than six months after entry of dismissal and is accompanied by
an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect, the court shall set aside a dismissal entered against the
attorney’s client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not
in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b).) “The court shall, whenever relief is granted based
on an attorney's affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable
compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.”¿ 
¿ 
Where an “attorney¿affidavit of fault” is filed, there is
no requirement that the¿attorney's¿mistake, inadvertence, or neglect be
excusable. Relief¿must¿be granted even where the default or dismissal resulted
from¿inexcusable¿neglect by defendant's¿attorney. (Robert E. Weil, et al.,
California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial ¶ 5:495 (2018).)¿ The mandatory relief provision applies to “those dismissals
that are procedurally equivalent to a default.” (Jackson v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Inc. (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th
166, 174 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)
 
Here, mandatory relief is warranted. First, Plaintiff’s
request to set aside is timely because it was made within six months after
entry of dismissal. Second, the request has three attorney affidavits
indicating their own mistake, namely, miscalendaring the Jury Trial as a
hearing allowing remote appearance.[1]
(Avelino Decl. ¶¶ 3, 7, 8.) Indeed, the hearing was a Final Status Conference
until Plaintiff kept failing to respond when the court repeatedly called the
matter. (June 17, 2024 Minute Order.) Ultimately, counsel’s mistake resulted in
the dismissal.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to set
aside the June 17, 2024 dismissal.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
to Set Aside the June 17, 2024 dismissal is GRANTED;
2.      The
June 17, 2024 order dismissing the matter is VACATED.
If Plaintiff is a prevailing party, Plaintiff may not recover
costs related to dismissal and motion to vacate since they are not reasonably
related to prosecution of claim. Trial setting conference to follow hearing.
 
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
