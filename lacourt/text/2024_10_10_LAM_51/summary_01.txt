And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to set aside the dismissal of the case filed by Arleen M. Asadoorian against General Motors, LLC. The case was dismissed on June 17, 2024, due to Plaintiff's counsel's mistake in failing to appear at a Final Status Conference. However, Plaintiff's counsel claims that they mistakenly believed their request for remote appearance had been granted, and therefore, the dismissal was caused by their mistake. The judge finds that the dismissal was indeed caused by the attorney's mistake and grants the motion to set aside the dismissal. The June 17, 2024 order dismissing the matter is vacated, and the case is reinstated.
