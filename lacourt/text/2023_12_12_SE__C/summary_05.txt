The Court has denied the requests related to documents concerning vehicles worldwide.

The Court has also granted the requests related to communications with governmental agencies and suppliers, but only to the extent that they relate to communications concerning the same transmission in 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 vehicles sold in California.

The Court has denied the requests related to documents concerning policies and procedures related to the Song Beverly Act, as the Defendant has already produced the relevant documents.
