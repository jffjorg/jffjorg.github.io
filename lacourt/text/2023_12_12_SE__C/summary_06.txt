Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to request for production (Set Two) without prejudice. The plaintiff, Alfredo Castellanos, has sought an order compelling the defendants, Manuel Coria and Brightside Electrical & Plumbing, Inc., to submit further responses to the request and sanctions of $1,261.65. The judge found that the plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and confer requirement, but denied the motion because the deposition of the plaintiff has yet to take place. The judge ruled that the deposition was meant to occur on August 15, 2023, but was delayed due to the illness of defense counsel. The judge noted that the information requested in the motion is substantially similar to the information requested in the plaintiff's previous motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories, which was also denied as premature.
