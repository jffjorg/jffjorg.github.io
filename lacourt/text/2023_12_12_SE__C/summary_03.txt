And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Joseph Construction v. Andy Tran. The Court denies Defendant Tran's motion to deem matters admitted as moot, as Cross-Defendant Machul's counsel served responses in substantial compliance with the Code of Civil Procedure before the hearing. The Court also denies Defendant Tran's request for sanctions and Cross-Defendant Machul's request for sanctions. The Court finds that Cross-Defendant Machul's counsel acted with substantial justification for the initial lack of responses to the requests for admission, and that Defendant Tran's counsel did not copy Ms. Rollins in all servings, including the one for the instant motion.
