And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendants' ex parte application to stay depositions and shorten time for a hearing on their motion for a protective order. The court has also granted the plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with defendant Cortazar's responses to requests for production. The court has awarded sanctions against each of the defendants and their counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $599.77. The court has also granted the plaintiff's motion to deem matters admitted against defendants Sandoval and Mitchell, but has awarded sanctions against them in the amount of $599.77, rather than the amount requested by the plaintiff. The court has scheduled a hearing on the defendants' motion for a protective order for January 17, 2024.
