Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's demurrer with motion to strike is denied and taken off calendar. The plaintiff filed a first amended complaint after the demurrer was filed, which is allowed under California law. The hearing is therefore taken off calendar, and the plaintiff is required to give notice. The judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 472(a), which allows a party to amend their pleading once without leave of court. The judge also cited two previous court cases, Hedwall v PCMV, LLC and People ex rel Strathmann v Acacia Research Corp., to support their decision.
