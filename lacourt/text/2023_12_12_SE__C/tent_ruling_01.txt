Background
This
is a landlord-tenant dispute between Plaintiff Ortegon and Defendants Carolina
Cortazar, Steven Mitchell, and Carlos Sandoval.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants unlawfully entered
the leased property on several occasions, threatened Plaintiff, removed
Plaintiff’s personal property, and wrongfully evicted Plaintiff.
Late
Oppositions
Defendants’
late filed oppositions will be considered for these motions.
Defendant’s
Ex Parte Application to Stay Depositions and to Shorten Time
Defendants apply ex
parte for an order staying the depositions of Defendants, quashing the notice
of depositions, and a protective order to suspend their obligation to respond
to further written discovery or to appear at any deposition by Plaintiff; or,
in the alternative, an order shortening time for hearing on the motion.  Defendants Carolina Cortazar, Steven Mitchell, and
Carlos Sandoval’s Ex Parte Application to Stay Depositions and to Shorten Time is
GRANTED.  Defendants’ Motion for
Protective Order is scheduled for hearing on January 17, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in
Dept. SE-C.  The ex parte application is
deemed to be the moving papers; opposition and reply briefs are to be filed in
compliance with the new hearing date.  
Motion
to Compel Compliance
“If
a party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280
thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in
accordance with that party's statement of compliance, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling compliance.” (CCP § 2031.320.)
Plaintiff
Ortegon served his Requests for Production (set one) on Defendant Cortazar.
Defendant Cortazar responded on April 14, 2022 stating that she would comply
with Requests Nos. 1-7. However, Defendant Cortazar has not produce any
responsive documents as of the date of this hearing. Defendant Cortazar argues
that Plaintiff failed to meet and confer, however, CCP § 2031.320 does not
require a meet and confer declaration. Additionally Defendant Cortazar argues
that the motion is improper because she objected to the Requests. However, the
responses state that she would “comply with the request by producing copies of
responsive documents ….” Thus, a motion to compel compliance is appropriate.
Thus, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Compliance is GRANTED.

Motion to Deem Matters Admitted
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply … (b) The
requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted … (c)
The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP § 2033.280.)
Plaintiff Ortegon served his Requests for
Admission (set one) on Defendants Sandoval and
Mitchell on July 25, 2023.  Untimely
responses were served by Defendant Sandoval on December 10, 2023, and by Defendant
Mitchell on December 5, 2023.  Because
the responses were filed before the hearing, the instant motions are MOOT. 
Sanctions
Sanctions are mandatory against any party,
person, or attorney who fails to timely serve responses to requests for
admission or who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response
to interrogatories unless the one subject to sanctions acted with substantial
justification or other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions unjust.
(CCP §§ 2031.320(b), 2033.280(c).)  
In each of his Motions to Deem Matters
Admitted, Plaintiff Ortegon seeks $1,824.77 in sanctions consisting of 3 hours
preparing the motion and 2 hours reviewing the opposition, drafting a reply,
and attending the hearing at $350.00 per hour and $74.77 in filing fees.
In untimely oppositions, Counsel for Defendants
Sandoval and Cortazar argues that the failure was due to his mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect and that he should be relieved from the
judgment. (CCP §2033.280(a)(2).) Counsel further argues that the delay was not
a result of any bad faith or willful neglect as he was meeting and conferring
with counsel for Plaintiff.  Counsel also
argues that imposing sanctions would not serve the interests of justice but
would instead impose an undue financial burden on the Defendants.   
The Court is unpersuaded. However, the Court
notes the similarity between these motions and the fact that no replies have
been filed.  Accordingly, sanctions will be awarded in the reasonable sum of $599.77
(1.5 hours preparing the motion, reviewing the opposition, and attending
the hearing at $350.00 per hour, and $74.77 in filing fees) against Defendant
Sandoval and counsel, jointly and severally, and against Defendant Cortazar and
counsel, jointly and severally, payable within 30 days.  
Plaintiff Ortegon also seeks $2,524.37 in
sanctions against Defendant Cortazar consisting of 4.5 hours preparing the
motion and 2.5 hours reviewing the opposition and drafting a reply at $350.00
per hour and $74.37 in filing fees. The Court finds that the amount of time
requested to draft a basic discovery motion is excessive. Sanctions will be
awarded in the reasonable sum of $599.77 against Defendant Cortazar and
counsel, jointly and severally, payable within 30 days.
