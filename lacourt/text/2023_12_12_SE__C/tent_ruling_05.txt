Background

On April 26, 2023, Plaintiffs propounded Requests for Production
of Documents (Set One) seeking documents relating to GM’s internal
investigation and analysis, among other things, of the Transmission Defects.
(Sanaia Decl., ¶ 21, Ex. 8.) Specifically, Plaintiffs requested that Defendant
produce documents concerning: (A) The Subject Vehicle (i.e., RFP Nos. 1, 2, 3,
7, 8, 9, and 12); (B) Internal Knowledge and Investigation related to the
Transmission Defects in 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 17, 19,
22, 24, 30, 35, 38 and 41); (C) Summaries, Memoranda, Power Points related to
the Transmission Defects in 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 42,
and 50) (D) Policies and Procedures related to the Song Beverly Act (i.e. RFP
Nos. 55, 57, 58, and 67); (E) Communication With Governmental Agencies and
Suppliers related to the Transmission Defects in 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 vehicles
(i.e., RFP Nos. 75, 76, 77, and 79). (Id. ¶ 22.)
Defendant provided its unverified Responses to Plaintiffs’
RFP (Set One) on May 24, 2023. Verifications were later served on June 15,
2023. (Id. ¶ 24, Ex. 9.)
On June 12, 2023, Plaintiffs proposed a protective order
for matters concerning “confidential, proprietary, and commercially sensitive
trade secret.” (Sanaia Decl. in Reply, ¶ 31.)
 
Meet and Confer Requirement 
A
motion¿to compel further responses to requests for production “shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the
motion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿  The Court finds that
Plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and confer requirement. 
 
Separate Statement 
A motion to compel further
responses requires a separate statement.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a).) Plaintiff properly filed separate statements.
 
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production.  
 
CCP
§ 2031.310(a) provides that on receipt of a response to a request for
production of documents, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further responses if:¿¿ 
(1)
A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete.¿¿ 
(2) A representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.¿¿ 
(3) An
objection in the response is without merit or too general.
Discussion

Requests Nos. 1-2 and 7-9 
These requests concern documents relating the Subject
Vehicle.
·       1: All
DOCUMENTS regarding the SUBJECT VEHICLE that are maintained in YOUR databases.
·       2: All
DOCUMENTS concerning the SUBJECT VEHICLE, including warranty records, customer
contacts, field reports, technician line contact, field service reports, and/or
dealer contacts.
·       7: All
DOCUMENTS, including recalls, technical service bulletins, special service
messages, dealer alerts, reports, Star Reports, campaigns, extended warranties,
dealer advisories, summaries, etc., that were issued for the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
·       8: The
warranty repair histories relating to the SUBJECT VEHICLE, as kept in its
ordinary course of business by YOU, including diagnostic trouble codes, labor
codes, part numbers, including part numbers applicable to any PCM, TCM, Engine
Control Unit (“ECU”), or other module update/reprogramming.
·       9: All
Vehicle Data Recovery Reports for the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
Defendant argues that it produced the responsive documents
within its possession, custody, and control, and as expressly permitted under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230.  Defendant
further argues it has identified and referred Plaintiffs to those documents,
including the Vehicle Summary, the New Vehicle Invoice, the Global Warranty
Vehicle History Report (which details any repairs to the Subject Vehicle under
warranty), any incidentally obtained repair orders, and the Repair Order
Details.  
Accordingly,
Defendant
has properly responded to Nos. 1-2 and 7-9 because it stated that it conducted
a diligent search and produced the relevant documents.
Request No. 3
·       3: All
investigations, reports, and/or studies conducted by YOU and/or on YOUR behalf
regarding the root cause or failure analysis of any parts that were repaired or
replaced on the SUBJECT VEHICLE and returned by any of YOUR authorized repair
facilities to YOU/or anyone acting on YOUR behalf for analysis.
As
to the investigation request in RFP No. 3, Defendant contends that it conducted
a reasonable and diligent search and could not find any documentation relating
to the investigation, reports, and/or studies. Accordingly, Defendant
has properly responded to No. 3 because it stated that it conducted a diligent
search and no responsive documents ever existed.
RFP Nos. 12, 17, 19, 22, 24, 30, 35, 38, 41,
and 42
These requests reference internal knowledge, investigations,
customer complaints, power points, memoranda, warnings, or equivalent
information related to the Transmission Defects in 2020 GMC Sierra 1500
vehicles. 
Defendant contends it has produced copies of those
bulletins for any field action, including recalls, applicable to the Subject
Vehicle, and a list of TSBs and ISBs applicable to the Subject Vehicle.
However, Plaintiffs contend that it wants the ESI and emails concerning the
internal analysis in the 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 vehicles. 
These
requests are overbroad because they seek documents related to vehicles
worldwide. Therefore, these requests are granted to the extent they relate to
the internal knowledge, investigations, customer complaints concerning 2020 GMC
Sierra 1500 vehicles sold in California. Defendant is ordered to provide
further responses to Requests Nos. 12, 17, 19, 22, 24, 30, 35, 38, 41,
and 42 as to 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 sold in
California. 
RFP No. 50
·       50:
All DOCUMENTS, including emails, regarding software release notes for all
software released for the TRANSMISSION DEFECT(S) in GMC VEHICLES equipped with
the 10-speed transmission like the SUBJECT VEHICLE
This
request is overbroad because it seeks documents related to vehicles worldwide.
Therefore, this request is granted to the extent it relates to any software
release notes concerning 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 vehicles sold in California.
Defendant is ordered to provide further responses to Requests No. 50 as to 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 sold in
California. 
RFP Nos. 55, 57, 58, and 67

authorized repair facility(s), within the state of California, since 2020 to
the present.
·       67:
All LEMON LAW DOCUMENTS published by YOU and provided to YOUR employees,
agents, and representatives.
Defendant maintains that it has already produced to
Plaintiffs its Warranty Policy & Procedure Manual and its lemon law
policies and procedures manual in response to these requests; thus, there is
nothing for this Court to compel.
Accordingly,
Defendant
has properly responded to Nos. 55, 57, 58, and 67 because it stated that it
conducted a diligent search and produced the relevant documents.
RFP Nos. 75, 76, 77, and 79
These requests concern communications with governmental agencies
and suppliers related to GMC vehicles.
·       75:
All DOCUMENTS, including ESI, regarding any communications between YOU and any
government agency or entity (e.g., the National Highway Traffic Safety

VEHICLES.
·       79:
All Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation
(“TREAD”) reports YOU submitted concerning GMC VEHICLES.
Nos. 75, 76, 77 and 79 are overbroad because they seek
documents not related to the subject vehicle. 
Therefore, these requests are granted
to the extent they relate to communications regarding the same transmission in
2020 GMC Sierra 1500 vehicles sold in California.
