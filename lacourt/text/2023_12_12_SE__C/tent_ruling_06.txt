TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Alfredo Castellanos’s Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Request for Production (Set Two) is DENIED without
prejudice.
 
Moving Party to give Notice.
 
Background

Plaintiffs ALFREDO AND MARIA CASTELLANOS filed this lawsuit
following a vehicle accident purportedly caused by Defendant MANUEL CORIA (“CORIA")
while CORIA was driving in the scope of his employment for Defendant BRIGHTSIDE
ELECTRICAL & PLUMBING, INC. (“BRIGHTSIDE”) in an auto owned by BRIGHTSIDE.  Plaintiff Alfredo Castellano (“Plaintiff”) seeks
an order compelling CORIA and BRIGHTSIDE (“Defendants”) to submit further
responses to Request for Production (Set Two) and sanctions of $1,261.65.  
In a July 20, 2023 order, this Court ruled that Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories was premature because
Plaintiff had yet to be deposed.
The instant motion requests substantially similar
information to that requested in the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories. 
 
Meet and Confer Requirement 
A
motion¿to compel further responses to requests for production “shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the
motion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿  
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and
confer requirement. 
 
Separate Statement 
A motion to compel further
responses requires a separate statement.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a).) Plaintiff properly filed separate statements.
 
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production.  
 
CCP
§ 2031.310(a) provides that on receipt of a response to a request for
production of documents, the demanding party may move for an order compelling
further responses if:¿¿ 
(1)
A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete.¿¿ 
(2)
A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive.¿¿ 
(3) An
objection in the response is without merit or too general.
 
Discussion 
Plaintiff has filed a motion
to compel further requests for production as to the following requests: 
·       
Request 24: Any and all surveillance videos
taken by YOU or YOUR agents of Plaintiff ALFREDO CASTELLANOS at any time since
the INCIDENT.
·       
Request 25: Any and all Sub Rosa videos taken
by YOU or YOUR agents of Plaintiff ALFREDO CASTELLANOS at any time since the
INCIDENT.
·       
Request 26: Any and all surveillance
photographs taken by YOU or YOUR agents of Plaintiff ALFREDO CASTELLANOS at any
time since the INCIDENT.
·       
Request 27: Any and all Sub Rosa photographs
taken by YOU or YOUR agents of Plaintiff ALFREDO CASTELLANOS at any time since
the INCIDENT.
In a July 20, 2023 order, this Court ruled that Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories was premature
because Plaintiff had yet to be deposed. This Court ruled that at a minimum,
Defendants should be afforded a fair opportunity to obtain Plaintiff’s sworn
deposition testimony before being compelled to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery
requests.
The deposition of Plaintiff was meant to occur on August
15, 2023. However, due to the illness of Defense counsel it was not taken. 
The information requested here is substantially similar to
the information requested in the Motion to Compel Further Form
Interrogatories.  Accordingly, since the
deposition has yet to take place, the Court finds the motion is premature.  
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Requests for Production is DENIED without prejudice.
