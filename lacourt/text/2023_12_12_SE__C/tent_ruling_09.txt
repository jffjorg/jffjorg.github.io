#12
Tentative 
Defendant General Motors LLC’s (Defendant)
Demurrer with Motion to Strike is DENIED and taken off calendar. 
Opposing Party to give notice. 
 
Background 
On June 14, 2021, Plaintiff Angel A. Herrera (Plaintiff)
purchased a 2021 GMC Sierra, VIN No.: 3GTP8CED3MG330981 (“Subject Vehicle”). 
On July 17, 2023, Plaintiff sued Defendant, alleging breach
of warranty claims under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, as well as a
common law fraud-fraudulent inducement-concealment claim. 
On August 16, 2023, Defendant filed the Demurrer with the
Motion to Strike. On November 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint. 
Legal
Standard 
A party may amend the party's pleading once without leave
of court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed,
or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before the demurrer or
motion is heard. (CCP § 472(a).) The amended pleading must be filed and served
no later than the date for filing opposition to the demurrer or motion. The
time for responding to an amended pleading is computed from the date of service
of that pleading. (CCP § 472(a).)
The right to amend once without leave of court afforded by
CCP § 472(a) is limited to the complaint as originally filed, i.e., the version
of the complaint that commences the action. (Hedwall v PCMV, LLC (2018)
22 CA5th 564, 574–575.)
When the plaintiff files an amended complaint in response
to a defendant's demurrer before the hearing on the demurrer, that hearing
should be taken off calendar because the amended complaint supersedes the
complaint to which the demurrer was directed. (People ex rel Strathmann v
Acacia Research Corp. (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 487, 505–506.)
Discussion

On August 16, 2023, Defendant filed the Demurrer with the
Motion to Strike. On November 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed the First Amended
Complaint.  A hearing was set for the
instant motion for December 12, 2023, making any opposition due on or before
November 30, 2023.  Instead of filing an
opposition, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint, which is allowable under
California law. (CCP § 472(a).)
Accordingly, the hearing is taken off calendar.
