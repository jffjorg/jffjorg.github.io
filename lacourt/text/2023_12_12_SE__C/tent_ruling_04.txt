Background 
Through this action, filed 11/02/22, City of Huntington

6803 Malabar Street, in the City of Huntington Park, County of Los Angeles
("Subject Property").
On 1/31/2023, the Court Granted Plaintiff’s application for
appointment of a receiver and appointed Blake Alsbrook (Receiver).  On 5/24/23 the Receiver requested an order

the Court.  This motion is unopposed.  
Applicable
Law 
 
A
receiver must present by noticed motion or stipulation of all parties: (1) A
final account and report; (2) A request for the discharge; and (3) A request
for exoneration of the receiver's surety.  (CRC 3.1184(a).)  Notice
of the motion or of the stipulation must be given to every person or entity
known to the receiver to have a substantial, unsatisfied claim that will be
affected by the order or stipulation, whether or not the person or entity is a
party to the action or has appeared in it.  (CRC 3.1184(c).)
 
The
owner, the mortgagee, or any lienor of record may apply for the discharge of
all moneys not used by the receiver for removal of the condition and all other
costs authorized by this section.  (Health & Safety Code
§¿17980.7(c)(9).)  Any objections must be brought at the discharge
hearing, otherwise they are waived.  (Aviation Brake Systems, Ltd. v.
Voorhis (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 230, 232, 235.) 
 
The
compensation to be allowed a receiver is primarily within the trial court's
discretion.  (Melikian v. Aquila, Ltd. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1364,
1368.)   
 
Discussion 
 
On November 17, 2023, the Receiver filed his oath, and on
November 18, 2023, he posted his bond, and thereafter, immediately took control
of the Property. The Receiver instructed the Receivership Administrator to
begin removing trespassers, and began to communicate with brokers and general
contractors to coordinate an initial inspection. (Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 4.) Pursuant
to the Appointment Order, the Receiver also obtained an advance of funds in the
amount of $40,000.00 from Silberpal Enterprises, LLC, at ten percent (10%) per
annum with a loan fee of three percent (3%) payable upon funding. On December
19, 2023, the Receiver recorded the First Certificate of Indebtedness in the
Official Records of the Recorder's Office of Los Angeles County (Document No.
20230033736). (Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 5.) In January 2023, the Receiver oversaw the
solicitation of competitive bids for the rehabilitation work on the Property.
As was necessary, the Receiver filed an ex parte application to seek authority
to demolish the Property, borrow funds, and retain a real estate broker.
(Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 7.)
In March 2023, the Receiver retained Adam Orozco of Compass
as his real estate broker to assist with marketing and selling the Property.
The Receiver instructed Mr. Orozco to list the Property for sale, and
subsequently, the Receiver received five purchase offers between $320,000.00
and $425,000.00. One of the offers the Receiver received was from Raul
Echemendia ("Buyer") for $425,000.00. (Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 10.) In April
2023, the Receiver submitted counteroffers to all prospective buyers, and also
informed them that the sale of the Property would be subject to overbidding and
court confirmation of the sale after notice and a hearing. Thereafter, the
Buyer submitted a counteroffer, increasing their offer to $528,000.00, which
the Receiver accepted, as it was the best and highest offer. On April 26, 2023,
the Receiver filed a Motion for Issuance of Order Authorizing and Confirming
Sale of Real Property (the "Sale Motion"), which was granted on May
24, 2023. (Alsbrook Decl. ¶¶  11, 13.)
Through the present motion, the Receiver alleges he
incurred the following fees in connection with this matter: $78,168.34, of
which $52,083.52 has been paid and $26,084.82 is due and owing in fees
(Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 18; Ex. 5); the Receiver’s accountants, Dominic LoBuglio CPA,
Inc., incurred a total of $6,689.20 in costs (Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 21; Ex. 6); and
the disbursement of $13,059.50 to Plaintiff City of Huntington Park (the
“City”) in consideration of its attorney fees and costs incurred related to
this matter (Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 16).  The
Court finds these fees and costs were reasonably incurred. 
The revised proposed order includes $9,648.64 for
code enforcement costs incurred by the City in this case. However, this is not
included in the declaration and there are no supporting exhibits relating to this
cost.  Thus, these costs are not
awarded.  
On or around January 19, 2023, in Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 22STPB09182, the Superior Court filed its Letters of
Administration appointing Brenda Depew as the administrator of the Estate of
Barbara Brym-Kulatti. (Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 8; Ex. 2.)
A receivership bank account was established in this matter
on December 19, 2022, with an initial deposit of $40,000.00. As shown in that
financial report, the receivership bank account holds $285,181.18 as of October
2023. (Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 22; Ex. 7.) The Receiver attests that after payment of
all fees and costs of administration above, $239,347.66 will remain in the
Receivership Estate bank account. The Receiver attests he believes all of the
remaining funds should be disbursed to Ms. Depew as the administrator of the
decedent's Estate of Barbara Brym-Kulatti. (Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 23.)
The Court GRANTS dispersal of the remaining funds to Ms.
Depew as the administrator of the decedent's Estate of Barbara Brym-Kulatti.
