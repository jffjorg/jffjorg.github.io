Plaintiff Jennifer Juliana Avendano Hoyos’
motion to strike as to Defendants Victor Acevedo and Jorge H. Perez’s Answer is
GRANTED with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Background
On or about October 2, 2023, Plaintiff Jennifer Juliana
Avendano Hoyos (“Plaintiff”) served a Notice to Quit the real property located
at 12050 Horley Ave., Downey, CA 90242 (“Subject Property”) on the occupants of
the Subject Property including Defendants Reyna Perez (“R. Perez”), Victor
Acevedo (“Acevedo”), and Jorge H. Perez (“J. Perez”) (collectively
“Defendants”). On or about October 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed an unlawful
detainer action.
On or about October 25, 2023, Defendant R. Perez filed a
General Denial Answer. On or about October 27, 2023, Defendants Acevedo and J.
Perez filed a General Denial Answer.  
Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ Answers must be stricken
because they were not filed in conformity with the laws of this state which
require a defendant answering a verified complaint to answer each material
allegation of the verified complaint with specific admissions or denials.
Legal Standard 
Upon motion, or at any time in its own discretion, a court
may grant a motion to strike any of the following material: (1) irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) all or any part of
any pleading not drawn in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule,
or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. §436.) These provisions also
authorize “the striking of a pleading due to improprieties in its form or in
the procedures pursuant to which it was filed.” (Ferraro v. Camarlinghi,
(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 509, 528, emphasis in original.)
Discussion 
Plaintiff argues that each Answer improperly responds to
the verified Complaint by stating “Defendant generally denies each statement of
the complaint and of the Mandatory Cover Sheet and Supplemental Allegations
Unlawful Detainer (form UD-101). (See Answer-Unlawful Detainer.)
A general denial is not allowed in response to a verified
complaint. (Code Civ. Proc. §431.30(d).) Where a complaint is verified, a
defendant must “answer each material allegation of a verified complaint with
specific admissions or denials…” (See, e.g., Paul Blanco’s Good Car Co. Auto
Group v. Sup. Ct. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 86, 93.)
The Court notes that Defendant R. Perez verified the
general denial in her answer and Defendant Acevedo verified the general denial
in his answer with J. Perez.  However,
this verified denial is insufficient as a general denial is insufficient to
controvert a verified complaint.  A
verified complaint must be denied positively or according to information and
belief. (Code Civ. Proc. §431.30(d); see City of Hollister v. Monterey Ins.
Co. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 455, 476, fn. 19.)
Defendants Acevedo and J. Perez, in opposition, argue that
since the value of property is less than $1,000.00, they may file a general
written denial. (See Code Civ. Proc. §431.40(a).) 
In Reply, Plaintiff asserts that the verified complaint
also seeks damages for the reasonable daily rental rate of the property, which
exceeds $1,000.00.  (Compl., Prayer, ¶ 3.)
Plaintiff alleges that “the daily rental value for the Subject Property is
approximately $163.26 per day.” (Complaint ¶16.) To date, Defendants Acevedo
and J. Perez have been on the subject property without paying rent for 106 days
and Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $17,305.56.  Because the requested relief is over $1,000.00,
Defendants Acevedo and J. Perez may not file a general written denial. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff Jennifer Juliana Avendano Hoyos’
motion to strike as to Defendant Reyna Perez Answer is GRANTED with 20 days
leave to amend. 
In Addition, Plaintiff Jennifer Juliana Avendano Hoyos’
motion to strike as to Defendants Victor Acevedo and Jorge H. Perez Answer is
GRANTED with 20 days leave to amend.
