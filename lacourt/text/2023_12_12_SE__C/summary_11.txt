And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Sandra Carillo, has filed a motion to set aside the dismissal of the case under Code of Civil Procedure § 473(d). The court has reviewed the case and has granted the motion. The defendant is permitted to file a responsive pleading within 30 days of this signed order. The court has also ordered that the moving party give notice of the granting of the motion.

The case arises from a premises liability issue that occurred at 6500 ½ Cottage Street, Huntington Park, CA 90255. The plaintiff, Cynthia Ledezma, alleges that she slipped and fell and was then wrongfully evicted. The plaintiff filed the complaint without a statement of damages and failed to serve the defendant with a statement of damages, as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 425.11.

The defendant's counsel contacted the plaintiff's counsel requesting an extension of time to file a responsive pleading, but the plaintiff's counsel did not respond. The defendant's counsel then filed an Ex Parte application requesting an extension of time to file a responsive pleading, but the plaintiff's counsel did not respond to that either. The defendant's counsel argues that the plaintiff's failure to serve a statement of damages deprived the defendant of actual notice and the "last clear chance" to respond to the allegations in the complaint.

The court has reviewed the case and has concluded that the defendant's motion to set aside the dismissal is granted. The defendant is permitted to file a responsive pleading and the plaintiff is ordered to serve a statement of damages. The court has also ordered that the moving party give notice of the granting of the motion.
