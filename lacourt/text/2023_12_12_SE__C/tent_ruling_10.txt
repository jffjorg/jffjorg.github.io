Ryan Heidari’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Sohail Abed
Ahmady is GRANTED. 
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
Background
This is a negligence action arises from a motor vehicle

Plaintiff filed his complaint on July 11, 2023. 
This motion is unopposed as of December 8, 2023.  
 
Legal Standard 
 
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. (2)) is one which lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.’  [Citation.]”  (People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations
omitted].)  The court should also consider whether the attorney’s
“withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the client’s
interests.”  (Ramirez v. Sturdivant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904,
915.) 
  
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires that the following be submitted in support
of an attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel pursuant Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (2): (1) a notice of motion and motion
directed to the client (made on Notice of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil (Judicial Council Form, MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in
general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil (Judicial Council Form,
MC-052)); (3) a proof of service evidencing service of the notice of motion and
motion, declaration, and proposed order on the client and on all other parties
who have appeared in the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel
(prepared on Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
(Judicial Council Form, MC-053)).  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,
subd. (a), (c), (d), (e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel, Sam Ryan Heidari, seeks to be relieved as counsel
for Plaintiff Sohail Abed Ahmady. 
Counsel filed
a Notice of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (MC-051), an Order
Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (MC-053), and a
Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (MC-052)
on the appropriate forms, as outlined within California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subdivisions (a), (c), and (e). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,
subd. (a), (c), (e).) 
Counsel
declares that he served Plaintiff by mail at his last known address and
confirmed that address telephonically. (Heidari Decl., ¶ 2 and 3(b)(1)(b).) Counsel cites a significant breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship which has significantly impeded counsel's ability
to effectively prosecute this case and represent Plaintiff's interest. (Heidari
Decl., ¶ 2.)
 
Plaintiff
will not be prejudiced if Counsel’s motion is granted. The next hearing in this
matter is a case management conference set for February 08, 2023. Trial is not
currently set. Thus, there is
sufficient time for Plaintiff to engage new counsel.
 
Accordingly, Attorney
Sam
Ryan Heidari’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Sohail Abed
Ahmady is GRANTED.
