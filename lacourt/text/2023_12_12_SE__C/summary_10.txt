And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion by Sam Ryan Heidari, counsel for Plaintiff Sohail Abed Ahmady, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed and the Judge grants the motion. The Judge finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship has significantly impeded counsel's ability to effectively prosecute the case and represent the Plaintiff's interests. The next hearing in the matter is a case management conference set for February 8, 2024, and trial is not currently set. The Judge concludes that there will be no prejudice to the Plaintiff if the motion is granted, and thus grants the motion to relieve counsel.
