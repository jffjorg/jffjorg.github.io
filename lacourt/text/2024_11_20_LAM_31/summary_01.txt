And here is the summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court's Tentative Ruling is that the Defendant's Motion for Reconsideration is denied. The Defendant's motion is procedurally defective because it was not filed within the 10-day time limit after service of the written notice of entry of the court's August 29, 2024, order. Additionally, the motion is substantively defective because it does not present new or different facts, circumstances, or law that warrants reconsideration of the court's August 29, 2024, order.
