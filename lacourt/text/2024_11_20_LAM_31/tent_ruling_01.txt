CASE NO.:                 23STCV14971
 





















 
MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant Mai Thai 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Steve K. Lopez
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
This is a partition action
concerning the real property located at 1114, 1114 ½, and 1116 S. Kern Ave.,
Los Angeles, CA 90022 (the “Subject Property”).  On June 27, 2022,
Plaintiff Steve K. Lopez (“Plaintiff” or “Lopez”) filed a Verified Complaint for
Partition By Sale of Real Property against Defendant Mai Thai (“Defendant” or
“Thai”)1.  Plaintiff alleges that he and Defendant are joint
tenants with equal 50% ownership interest in the Subject Property.  The
grant deed evidencing the parties’ equal ownership of Subject Property as joint
tenants is attached as Exhibit B to the Verified Complaint.  Defendant is
self-represented.
 
On March 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion for interlocutory judgment of partition on the pleadings and for
appointment of a referee.  The court
granted the motion on May 6, 2024. 
Pursuant to the court’s order, Matthew Taylor was appointed as the
referee to determine the method of partition.
 
On June 26, 2024, Mr. Taylor filed
a report recommending partition by sale of the property.  On August 29, 2024, the court adopted Mr.
Taylor’s recommendation over Defendant’s objections.
 
On October 28, 2024, Defendant
filed this Motion for Reconsideration.
 
On November 5, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an opposition.
 
Defendant did not file a reply.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD & DISCUSSION
 
            Defendant
appears to seek reconsideration of the court’s August 29, 2024, order adopting
court-appointed referee Matthew Taylor’s recommending partition by sale of the
Property.   “When an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application
to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008, subd.
(a).)¿ “A party seeking reconsideration also must provide a satisfactory
explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at an earlier time.
[Citation.]”¿ (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 206, 212.)¿¿A motion for reconsideration is properly denied where
it is based on evidence that could have been presented in connection with the
original motion.¿ (Morris v. AGFA Corp. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
1452, 1460.) 
 
Here, Defendant’s motion is
procedurally defective.  The motion is brought
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a).  Defendant therefore had 10 days after service
of written notice of entry of the court’s August 29, 2024, order to file this
motion.  Plaintiff served Defendant with
notice of that order on August 30, 2024. 
More than 10 days have passed.  The
failure to timely file the motion for reconsideration is grounds alone to deny
the motion.  (In
re Marriage of Herr (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
1463, 1468.)
 
Defendant’s
motion is also substantively defective.  Defendant does not present new or
different facts, circumstances, or law that warrants reconsideration of the
court’s August 29, 2024, order.
 
III.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motion
for reconsideration is DENIED.  
 
            Plaintiff
to give notice.  
 
Dated:   November 20,
2024
