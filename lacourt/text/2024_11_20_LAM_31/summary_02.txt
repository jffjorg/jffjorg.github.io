And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, issued a tentative ruling on November 20, 2024, in the case of Sophia Henry v. Rob Bonta, et al. The case involves a dispute over the denial of Paid Family Leave benefits by the State of California and other defendants. The plaintiff, Sophia Henry, is a self-represented litigant who alleges that she is under consular jurisdiction pursuant to Treaty Law and that she was wrongfully denied benefits.

The judge has stayed the proceedings in the case pending the outcome of the plaintiff's appeal of the court's order setting aside default. The judge has also taken off calendar the plaintiff's motions, including her demurrer and discovery motion. The judge has set a status conference for January 24, 2025, to discuss the status of the appeal.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 916, subdivision (a), which provides that the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court. The judge has concluded that the defaults will be re-entered against the defendants if the plaintiff's appeal is meritorious, which would moot the plaintiff's demurrer and discovery motion.
