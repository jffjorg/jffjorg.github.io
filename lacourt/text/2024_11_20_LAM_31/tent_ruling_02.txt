PLAINTIFFS’
DEMURRER
 
PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO ADVANCE DEFAULT JUDGMENT HEARING UNDER THE TRADING WITH THE ENEMY ACT



 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On December 12, 2023, Plaintiff Sophia Henry, a
self-represented litigant, filed this action against Defendants Rob Bonta,
acting as California Attorney General for the State of California (“Bonta”),
Ana M. Lasso, acting as Director of Department of General Services Office of
Risk and Insurance Management for State of California (“Lasso”), the State of
California (the “State”), Employment Development Department (“EDD”), and Paid
Family Leave Office—Fresno (“PFLO”) (collectively, “Defendants”), arising from the
denial of Plaintiff’s Paid Family Leave claim. 
Plaintiff seeks relief for alleged wrongdoing on the basis that she is
“under consular jurisdiction pursuant to Treaty Law as Bloodright Heir by
Blood, Deed, Creed, and Custom to: i) Treaty of Peace with Morocco of 1787/1836
(signed at Meccanez; copy at Tangiers) between the United States of North
America and Moroccan Empire, which is in full force and effect under Article 25
of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1836, and the organic Constitution for
the United States of North America.” 
Based on those rights, Plaintiff alleges she was entitled to, and
wrongfully denied, benefits in the amount of “Three Thousand Four Hundred
Eighty ($3,480.00) Dollars.” 
 
Based on her treaty rights, Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants
“are responsible in some manner for the claimed tortious interference with
Trade and Commerce by irreparable injury to Plaintiff through: i) economic
hardship / mental anxiety / psychological and emotional distress caused by
failure / refusal or delay to make payment under an insurance policy; ii) bad
faith; iii) wrongfully disqualifying benefits; iv) wrongfully subjecting
insured to biased claims handling; v) wrongfully withdrawing benefits due; vi)
adopting an inconsistent position in refusing claim; vii) breach of contract;
viii) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failure to
investigate claim; ix) violation of California Insurance Code § 790.035; x)
violation of California Labor Code § 5814; xi) violation of California Civil
Code § 3294; and xii) violation of 15 § U.S.C. § 1; 15 U.S.C. § 2; 15 U.S.C. § 45;
15 U.S.C. § 1125; 19 U.S.C. § 1592.”  
 
Procedural Background
 
On March 8, 2024, the clerk of the court entered default
against the State of California, EDD, and Paid Family Leave Office – Fresno.
 
On March 26, 2024, the clerk of the court entered default
against Bonta and Lasso.
 
On June 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Advance
Default Judgment Hearing Under the Trading With The Enemy Act (TWEA). On June
18, 2024, Plaintiff also filed a Request for
Attorney’s (Consul’s) Fees Under the Trading With The Enemy
Act (TWEA).
 
On July 8, 2024, Defendants filed a Motion for Order Setting
Aside Default Based Upon Defective Notice, and Removal to Federal Court (Motion
to Set Aside Default).  
 
On August 6, 2024, the court continued Plaintiff’s Motion to
Advance to be heard concurrently with Defendants’ Motion to Set Aside Default.
 
On September 4, 2024, the court granted in part, Defendants’
Motion to Set Aside Default.  The
defaults entered on March 8, 2024, and March 26, 2024, were vacated.  Further, the ruling on Defendants’ Motion to
Set Aside Default mooted Plaintiff’s Motion to Advance.
 
On September 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed an appeal of the
court’s order setting aside default.  The
appeal is pending.
 
On September 11, 2024, Defendants filed their Answer to the
Complaint.
 
Before the court are two motions: (1) Plaintiff’s Demurrer
to Defendants’ Answer, and (2) Plaintiff’s Motion for Order Establishing
Admissions and for Sanctions.  
 
II.        DISCUSSION
& LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 916, subdivision (a)
provides, “the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court
upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein
or affected thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or order, but the
trial court may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the action and not
affected by the judgment or order.”
 
Here, Plaintiff filed an appeal of the court’s September 4,
2024, order vacating the defaults entered against Defendants.  If Plaintiff’s appeal is meritorious, the
defaults will be re-entered against Defendants, which will moot Plaintiff’s
demurrer and discovery motion.  The
appeal embraces the matters before this court. 

 
III.      CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, the matter is STAYED.  Plaintiffs’ motions, including Plaintiff’s
discovery motion scheduled to be heard on November 27, 2024, are taken off
calendar.  
            
            The court
sets a Status Conference re: Status of Appeal for January 24, 2025, at 9:00 AM.

 
Defendants to give notice. 

 
 
Dated:   November 20,
