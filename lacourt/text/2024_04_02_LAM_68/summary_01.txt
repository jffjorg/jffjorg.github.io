```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Yu Chen, has moved for summary judgment on the second cause of action for Common Count: Money Had and Received, and the fifth cause of action for Unjust Enrichment. The defendant, Cong Ye, has opposed the motion. The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the plaintiff has not sufficiently established the subject claims. The motion for summary judgment is denied.

The court finds that there is no evidence of consideration under the common counts standard, and therefore, the plaintiff has not met the burden of proof required for summary judgment. Additionally, the court declines to consider the subject cause of action independent of any other potentially tethered viable cause of action.

The motion for summary judgment is denied, and the bench trial remains set for May 6, 2024. The plaintiff is required to give notice to all parties.
