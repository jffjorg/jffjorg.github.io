SUMMARY JUDGMENT
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff, Yu Chen
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant, Cong Ye
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion for Summary Judgment on the First Amended
Complaint
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
In 2021, Plaintiff Yu Chen deposited $105,000 into the
bank account of Defendant Cong Ye. The parties purportedly agreed that
Defendant would hold and return the funds upon request of Defendant. Instead,
on December 8, 2021, when Plaintiff requested a return of the funds, and
Defendant agreed, on December 9, 2021, Defendant transferred all funds to an
unspecified relative. Defendant subsequently paid $25,000 back to Plaintiff,
but $79,000 remains outstanding. 
 
On February 8, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for
conversion, common count, constructive trust, and violation of Penal Code
section 496. Defendant, in pro per, answered the complaint on April 8, 2022. On
October 14, 2022, Plaintiff substituted in JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA for Doe 6.
On January 17, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed the first, and fourth causes of action
as to JPMorgan Chase Bank only. On February 1, 2023, the court sustained the
demurrer of JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA with leave to amend.
 
On February 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint for Conversion, Common Count: Money Had and Received, Violation of
Penal Code section 496, and Unjust Enrichment. Defendant Ye, in pro per,
answered the first amended complaint on April 17, 2023. On May 15, 2023, the
court ordered the dismissal of JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA. with prejudice. 
 
RULING: Denied.
Request for Judicial Notice: Granted.
The court takes judicial notice of the filed pleadings,
but not the content for the truth of the matter stated in any and all of the
filed documents. 
 
Plaintiff Yu Chen moves for summary judgment on the
second cause of action for Common Count: Money Had and Received, and the fifth
cause of action for Unjust Enrichment. Plaintiff moves for relief on grounds
that defendant Ye owes the outstanding balance due following the deposit and
transfer of funds to a third party. Ye, in a pro per filed opposition, admits
to the agreement to hold onto the funds, but maintains the deposit was the
result of Plaintiff seeking to conceal assets during a pending divorce. The
court electronic filing system shows no reply on file at the time of the
tentative ruling publication cutoff. 
 
The pleadings
frame the issues for motions, “since it is those allegations to which
the motion must respond. (Citation.)” 
(Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37
Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A plaintiff or cross-complainant has met
his or her burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if
that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party
to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Plaintiff need not disprove all defenses, if
the elements of a cause of action are made. (Oldcastle Precast, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. (2009)
170 Cal.App.4th 554, 564; WRI Opportunity
Loans II, LLC v. Cooper (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 525, 532.) “An issue of fact
can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.” (Lyons v.
Security Pacific National Bank (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation
omitted).)
 
The motion itself provides
improper notice in that Plaintiff only seeks summary judgment on two of the
five pending causes of action, and otherwise fails to separately move for
summary adjudication on the individual causes of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c), (f)(1).) The
court can therefore neither accord complete relief on the entire first amended
complaint pursuant to the motion for summary judgment, or consider any
alternative unmade motion for summary adjudication. (Jimenez v. Protective Life Ins. Co. (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 528, 535; Maryland Casualty Co. v. Reeder
(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 961, 974 (footnote 4); Gonzales
v. Superior Court (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d
1542, 1545–1546 [“The language
in Code of Civil Procedure section 437c subdivision (f) makes it clear that a
motion for summary adjudication cannot be considered by the court unless the
party bringing the motion duly gives notice that summary adjudication is being
sought”].)
 
The motion is
therefore DENIED on this basis. Even if the court considered the merits of the
motion, the court finds Plaintiff insufficiently establishes the subject
claims. 
 
2nd Cause of Action: Common Count: Money Had and
Received
A common count requires the following elements: a
statement of indebtedness, consideration, and nonpayment. (Farmers Insurance Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th
445, 460; Avidor
v. Sutter's Place, Inc. (2013) 212
Cal.App.4th 1439, 1454; Schultz v. Harney (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1623 [“A cause of action is
stated for money had and received if the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff
in a certain sum ‘for money had and received by the defendant for the use of
the plaintiff’”].)
 
Other than a statement of an
agreed upon placement of the funds into the account of Defendant, and a return
upon demand, the court finds no evidence of any basis of consideration under
the common counts standard. [Declaration of Yu Chen.] (Allen v. Powell (1967) 248
Cal.App.2d 502, 510.) The court declines to consider the separate argument
presented in the declaration of Feng Bo regarding an effort to enter into a
settlement agreement, or the request for admissions. [Declaration of Feng Bo;
Appendix of Evidence.] Said issues are neither presented in the operative pleading,
nor addressed in the points and authorities. Thus, the court declines to find
Plaintiff sufficiently establishes the burden of proof required for summary
judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) The motion is therefore denied on this additional basis as well.
 
5th Cause of Action:
Unjust Enrichment
The Second Appellate District no longer recognizes unjust
enrichment as a cause of action. (Melchior
v. New Line Productions, Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793.)
“Unjust enrichment is a ‘general principle, underlying various legal doctrines
and remedies,’ rather than a remedy itself.” (Ibid.) This remedy may still be
pled in conjunction with a valid cause of action. (Jogani v. Superior Court (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 901, 911; Slovensky v. Friedman (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th
1518, 1535.) The court declines to consider the subject cause of action independent
to any other potentially tethered viable cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) The motion is therefore denied on this additional basis
as well.
 
The motion for summary judgment is
DENIED.
 
Bench trial remains set for May 6,
2024.
 
Plaintiff to give notice to
parties.
