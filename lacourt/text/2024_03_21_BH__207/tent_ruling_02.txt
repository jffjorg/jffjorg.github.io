[1] In Reply, Defendants argue for the first time that
Plaintiff also fails to state a breach of contract cause of action because she
is not a party to the Multi-Strategy Operating Agreement.  Defendants have not demurred on this basis
and raise the argument for the first time on Reply.  As such, it would deprive Plaintiff of due
process to sustain the demur on this basis. 
In any event, third party beneficiaries may, under certain
circumstances, maintain a breach of contract cause of action against a party to
the contract.  (Goonewardene v. ADP,
LLC (2019) 6 Cal.5th 817, 821.)
