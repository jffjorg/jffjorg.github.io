And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to continue the trial date by Plaintiff Justin Shelton is denied. The Plaintiff had requested a continuance to allow his motion for summary adjudication, which is currently scheduled for May 16, 2024, to be heard at least 30 days prior to the trial date, which is scheduled for June 10, 2024. The Defendant, WIB Holdings, LLC, filed a late opposition to the motion, but the Court found that the Plaintiff's lack of diligence in timely reserving a hearing date for his motion for summary adjudication does not constitute good cause to continue the trial date. The Court also found that the motion for summary adjudication would not promote judicial economy or narrow the triable issues, as it seeks resolution of issues not pleaded.
