And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Insight Multi-Strategy U.S. Partners, LLC, Insight Advisors, LLC, and Michael Tito, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Suzanne Tito. The plaintiff is seeking recovery of capital contributions and loans made to the defendants.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the claims are not preempted by federal securities laws and are not barred by the statute of limitations. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has adequately pleaded the elements of fraud and has made sufficient allegations to support the claims.

The judge has ordered the defendants to file and serve an answer to the complaint on or before April 12, 2024. The judge has also continued the case management conference from March 22, 2024 to May 7, 2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207.

The judge has noted that the defendants' demurrer was based on the argument that the claims are preempted by federal securities laws, but the judge has found that this argument is without merit. The judge has also rejected the defendants' argument that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations, finding that the plaintiff has adequately pleaded the elements of fraud and has made sufficient allegations to support the claims.
