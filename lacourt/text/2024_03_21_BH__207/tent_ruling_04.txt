[1] Because Plaintiff’s
motion for summary adjudication refers only to the “second” and “third” causes
of action, without specifying what those causes of action are, it is unclear
whether Plaintiff refers to the second and third causes of action of the
operative complaint or the second and third causes of action in the proposed
amended complaint that Plaintiff never filed. 
Either way, it seeks declaratory relief not at issue in the operative
complaint.
