BACKGROUND
 
On February 22, 2023, Plaintiff Forwardline Financial, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) filed suit against Defendants Vent Tech, Inc. (“Vent Tech”) and
Christopher Taulbee (“Taulbee”) (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging causes of
action for (1) account stated against Vent Tech; (2) money lent against Vent
Tech; (3) open book account against Taulbee; (4) breach of contract against
Vent Tech; and (5) breach of contract against Taulbee, seeking to recover
$66,697.45 in connection with Defendants’ alleged default on a commercial loan.
 
Both Defendants have filed an Answer, but Defendants have not
responded to any of Plaintiff’s discovery requests.  Plaintiff now seeks summary judgment.  Defendants have not filed an opposition.
 
LEGAL STANDARD – MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT
 
“[T]he party moving for
summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue
of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.]
There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would
allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the
party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.”
 (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.)
 “[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of
production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable
issue of material fact; if he carries his burden of production, he causes a
shift, and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden
of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a
triable issue of material fact.”  (Ibid.)  
 
“On a summary judgment
motion, the court must therefore consider what inferences favoring the opposing
party a factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence. While viewing the
evidence in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its primary function
is to identify issues rather than to determine issues.  Only when the inferences are indisputable may
the court decide the issues as a matter of law. If the evidence is in conflict,
the factual issues must be resolved by trial.” 
(Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839
[cleaned up].)  Further, “the trial court
may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine whose
version is more likely true.  Nor may the
trial court grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of
credibility.”  (Id. at p. 840
[cleaned up]; see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department of Transportation
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or
summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the
light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences
in favor of that party”].)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
1.      COMMON COUNTS
 
The elements of an “Account
Stated” cause of action are (1) at the time of the statement, an indebtedness
from one party to the other existed (2) a balance was then struck and agreed to
be the correct sum owing from the debtor to the creditor; and (3) the debtor
expressly or impliedly promised to pay to the creditor the amount thus
determined to be owing.  (Truestone,
Inc. v. Simi West Industrial Park II (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 715, 725.)  The second and third elements can be
established where an account is sent to the debtor, and the debtor does not
object within a reasonable time.  (Trafton
v. Youngblood (1968) 69 Cal.2d 17, 25; Atkinson v. Golden Gate Tile Co.
(1913) 21 Cal.App. 168, 171.)  
 
            “A
book account is ‘open’ where a balance remains due on the account.”  (Eloquence Corporation v. Home Consignment
Center (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 655, 664–665.) 
However, “[t]he mere recording in a book of transactions or the
incidental keeping of accounts under an express contract does not of itself
create a book account.”  (Id. at
p. 666.)   
 
To establish a cause of action
to recover on an Open Book Account, the plaintiff must establish that it has an
“open book account,” defined as (1) a detailed statement constituting the
principal record of transactions between a debtor and creditor (2) arising out
of a contract; (3) that shows the debits and credits for the transaction(s);
(4) and against whom and in favor of whom the entries are made; (5) kept in a
reasonably permanent form and manner. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 337.)  
 
            A plaintiff may similarly recover for money
lent at the request defendant that remains unpaid.  (See, e.g., Moya v. Northrup (1970) 10
Cal.App.3d 276, 278.)
 
            Here, Plaintiff has demonstrated that
Plaintiff lent Vent Tech $58,000, with $85,260 to be repaid, and Taulbee
guaranteed the loan (UF 2-3); Plaintiff kept an account of all debits and
credits for the transaction and sent Defendants a statement of their account
(UF 4); Defendants never disputed the accuracy of the account (UF 5); and
Defendants owe Plaintiff $66,697.45 on the account (UF 5).
 
            Therefore,
Plaintiff has met its burden of establishing a prima facie case that it will
prevail on the common counts.
 
2.      BREACH OF CONTRACT
 
“To prevail on a cause of
action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2)
the plaintiff's performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
the defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.”  (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)  
 
            Here, as to Vent Tech, Plaintiff has
demonstrated (1) Plaintiff and Vent Tech entered into a commercial loan
agreement (UF 9); (2) Plaintiff performed all conditions, covenants, and
promises under the agreement (UF 15); (3) Vent Tech breached the agreement by
defaulting on the loan payments (UF 14, 16); and (4) as a result of Defendant’s
breach, Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of $66,697.45.
 
            As
to Taulbee, Plaintiff has demonstrated (1) Plaintiff and Taulbee entered into
an agreement whereby Taulbee agreed to guarantee the loan to Vent Tech (UF 24);
(2) Plaintiff performed all conditions, covenants, and promises under the loan
agreement with Vent Tech and the guaranty agreement with Taulbee (UF 27); (3)
Taulbee breached the guaranty by failing to pay the loan payments as they
became due (UF 26); and (4) as a result of Defendants’ breaches, Plaintiff has
been damaged in the amount of $66,697.45.
 
            Therefore,
Plaintiff has similarly met its burden of establishing a prima facie case that
Defendants breached their agreements with Plaintiff.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Having found that Plaintiff met its burden of production and
persuasion in establishing its prima facie case, the Court grants Plaintiff’s unopposed
motion for summary judgment in its entirety. 
Plaintiff is entitled to recover $66,697.45 from Defendants, jointly and
severally, on Plaintiff’s claims for common counts and breach of contract.  
 
Defendants shall file a proposed order and judgment in conformity with
the Court’s ruling forthwith and shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and
file a proof of service regarding the same.
