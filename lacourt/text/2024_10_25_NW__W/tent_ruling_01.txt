DISCUSSION
 
I.                   
DEFENDANT WALMART INC.’S MOTION TO
COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES (SET ONE)
 
Defendant Walmart Inc. moves the court for an order compelling
Plaintiff Sajjad Takallou to provide further responses to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories (Set One). Defendant also request that the court impose
sanctions on Plaintiff in the amount of $760.00 representing reasonable
attorney fees and costs incurred in preparation of this motion. 
 
A propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses to interrogatories if the responding party’s responses contain (1)
answers that are evasive or incomplete; (2) an unwarranted or insufficiently
specific exercise of an option to produce documents in lieu of a substantive
response; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. (CCP
§2030.300(a).)
 
Defendant moves for further responses on the grounds Plaintiff has
provided responses which are evasive, incomplete and patently not code
compliant. Plaintiff responded “I don’t know” or “I don’t understand” to
several interrogatories and failed to respond to all subsections contained in
several other interrogatories. 
 
The court agrees the responses are not code compliant. For
example, for Form Interrogatory 2.1, Plaintiff must respond to sections (b) and
(c) as well as (a). If he has not used other names in the past, he can write
Not Applicable to each subsection. These are straight forward Form
Interrogatories. For example, Plaintiff cannot write “I don’t understand” as to
whether at any time after the incident, did Plaintiff sustain injuries which he
is now claiming damages for. (See Form Interrogatory 10.3.) As noted above,
Plaintiff must respond to each subsection for each interrogatory. Plaintiff
should look to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240 for guidance in responding. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant
Walmart Inc.’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set One) is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant requests $760.00 in sanctions against Plaintiff for
their failure to properly respond to the subject written discovery. Counsel for
Defendant asserts they spent 2.5 hours preparing the motion and anticipate
spending another 1.0 hours attending the hearing and replying to any
opposition. (Cummings Decl. ¶¶10-11.) Counsel’s hourly rate is $200.00.
(Cummings Decl. ¶12.) The filing fee for the motion is $60.00. 
 
The court finds that plaintiff’s responses were not substantially
justified and that this motion to compel was necessary.  They court finds the amount of time on these
simple motions to be excessive and grants instead $560 in sanctions for this
motion.   
 
II.                 
DEFENDANT WALMART INC.’S MOTION TO
COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES (SET ONE)
 
Defendant Walmart Inc. moves the court for an order compelling
Plaintiff Sajjad Takallou to provide further responses to Defendant’s Special
Interrogatories (Set One) as well as request this court impose sanctions
against Plaintiff in the amount of $760.00. 
 
A propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses to interrogatories if the responding party’s responses contain (1)
answers that are evasive or incomplete; (2) an unwarranted or insufficiently
specific exercise of an option to produce documents in lieu of a substantive
response; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. (CCP
§2030.300(a).)
 
Defendant moves for further responses to Defendant’s Special
Interrogatories (Set One) on similar grounds as above. To most of the
interrogatories, Plaintiff responded “I don’t understand” or did not respond at
all. Plaintiff also improperly referred Defendant to “check the camera”. 
 
The court agrees none of these responses are code compliant.
Plaintiff cannot respond to an interrogatory by telling the opposing side to
look at the evidence. Plaintiff must respond to these interrogatories by
explaining what happened based on their recollection. Plaintiff can reference
the videotape, but the response must be code compliant. As noted above,
Plaintiff should look to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.220, 2030.230,
and 2030.240 for guidance in responding.
 
Accordingly, Defendant Walmart Inc.’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set
One) is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant requests $760.00 in sanctions against Plaintiff for
their failure to properly respond to the subject written discovery. Counsel for
Defendant asserts they spent 2.5 hours preparing the motion and anticipate
spending another 1.0 hours attending the hearing and replying to any
opposition. (Cummings Decl. ¶¶10-11.) Counsel’s hourly rate is $200.00.
(Cummings Decl. ¶12.) The filing fee for the motion is $60.00. 
 
The court finds that plaintiff’s responses were not substantially
justified and that this motion to compel was necessary.  They court finds the amount of time on these
simple motions to be excessive and grants instead $560 in sanctions for this
motion.   
 
III.               
DEFENDANT WALMART INC.’S MOTION TO
COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
(SET ONE)
 
Plaintiff moves this court for an order compelling Plaintiff
Sajjad Takallou to provide further responses to Defendant’s Request for
Production of Documents (Set One) on the grounds Plaintiff’s responses are
evasive and incomplete. Defendant also requests this court impose sanctions
against Plaintiff in the amount of $760.00. 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, the court may
order a responding to serve a further response to a request for production when
the court finds that any of the following apply: (1) a statement of compliance
with the demand is incomplete; (2) a representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.
 
Defendant argues many of Plaintiff’s responses to the requests for
production were evasive, incomplete, and patently not code compliant. Plaintiff
responded “I don’t understand” to some requests, failed to provide code
compliant responses to several other requests, and did not produce any
responsive documents. 
 
The court agrees. Plaintiff cannot respond to “I don’t understand”
to the request for production of documents. He also cannot just write “under
the policies”. Plaintiff must explain the documents which support his
contentions and provide the responsive documents as well. Moreover, Plaintiff
has waived objections by failing to timely respond to the requests for
discovery. (See Request for Production of Document, No. 19.) Plaintiff should
look to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.220, 2031.230 and 2031.231 for
guidance in responding. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant Walmart Inc.’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s
Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents (Set One) is GRANTED.
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant requests $760.00 in sanctions against Plaintiff for
their failure to properly respond to the subject written discovery. Counsel for
Defendant asserts they spent 2.5 hours preparing the motion and anticipate
spending another 1.0 hours attending the hearing and replying to any
opposition. (Cummings Decl. ¶¶10-11.) Counsel’s hourly rate is $200.00.
(Cummings Decl. ¶12.) The filing fee for the motion is $60.00. 
 
The court finds that plaintiff’s responses were not substantially
justified and that this motion to compel was necessary.  They court finds the amount of time on these
simple motions to be excessive and grants instead $560 in sanctions for this
motion.   
 
Plaintiff is ordered to pay the
sanctions within 30 days and to provide further verified responses within 30
days.
