And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Defendant Walmart Inc.'s motion to compel Plaintiff Sajjad Takallou's further responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production of Documents (Set One). The court finds that Plaintiff's initial responses were incomplete, evasive, and not code-compliant. The court orders Plaintiff to provide further verified responses within 30 days and to pay sanctions of $560.00 within 30 days.

The court also grants Defendant's request to impose sanctions on Plaintiff for failure to properly respond to discovery. The court finds that Plaintiff's responses were not substantially justified and that this motion to compel was necessary. The court concludes that the amount of time spent on these simple motions was excessive and grants instead $560 in sanctions for this motion.
