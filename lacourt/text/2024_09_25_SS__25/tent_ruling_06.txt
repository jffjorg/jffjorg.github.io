MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            On
August 26, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Deem Plaintiff’s
Responses to Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted and Request for Monetary
Sanctions. Defendant argues that they served Requests for Admission, Set One,
on Plaintiff via electronic service on June 10, 2024, comprised of three
requests for admission. (Mot., 2:7-3; Garcia Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. A.) Plaintiff
never requested an extension and failed to provide responses by July 12, 2024,
so objections were waived. (Mot., 2:10-12; Garcia Decl., ¶4-5.)
 
            On July 17,
2024, Defendant sent meet and confer correspondence to Plaintiff requesting
responses without objections by July 19, 2024. (Mot., 2:14-16; Garcia Decl., ¶
6; Exh. B.) On July 19, 2024, Plaintiff called Defendant and acknowledged
Plaintiff’s overdue responses, asserting they were never received but indicated
they would serve responses without objections. (Mot., 17-20; Garcia Decl., ¶
7.)
 
            On July 30,
2024, Defendant sent another correspondence to plaintiff requesting the overdue
responses by August 2, 2024, to which Plaintiff did not respond or serve
responses. (Mot., 2:21-25; Garcia Decl., ¶ 8-9; Exh. C.) As the date of filing
the instant Motion, Defendant has not received Plaintiff’s responses. (Mot.,
2:26-28.)
 
OPPOSITION
 
            No
Opposition was filed.  
 
            
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard & Discussion
A. Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted
A party must respond to
requests for admissions within 30 days after service of such requests. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd. (a).)  “If a party to whom requests for
admission are directed fails to serve a timely response…(a) [that party] waives
any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The
requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7.” (Id. at subd.
(b).)  A motion dealing with the failure to respond, rather than with
inadequate responses, does not require the requesting party to meet and confer
with the responding party. (Deymer v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates
(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, fn. 4 [disapproved on other grounds in Wilcox
v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973]. There is no time limit within which
a motion to have matters deemed admitted must be made. (Brigante v. Huang
(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1569, 1585.)  
Here, Defendant served
Requests for Admission, Set One, on Plaintiff via electronic service on June
10, 2024. (Mot., 2:7-3; Garcia Decl., ¶ 3; Exh. A.) As of the date this Motion was filed, Defendant had not
received any responses. (Mot., 2:26-28.) Plaintiff did not oppose this
motion. Thus, Defendant is
entitled to an order deeming the Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted
against Plaintiff. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
B. Request for Sanctions
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Furthermore, it is “mandatory that the
Court impose a monetary sanction…on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  
 
The Court finds Plaintiff’s failure to
respond to Defendant’s discovery requests a misuse of the discovery process.
The Court is also required to impose a monetary sanction on Plaintiff for their
failure to respond to the Requests for Admission under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.280, subdivision (c). 
 
Defendant seeks sanctions of $1,297.50,
comprised of a) 3 hours of attorney time billed at $275.00 per hour for
preparation of the motion, “including research, analyzing discovery requests,
drafting Motion, review of opposition and drafting a reply;” b) 1.5
hours of attorney time billed at $275.00 per hour for attendance at the hearing
on this Motion; and c) $60.00 filing
fee. (Mot., p. 8, ¶ 11.). The
amount sought is excessive given the simplicity of this Motion, the three
discovery requests analyzed, and the lack of opposition and reply. The Court
finds $472.50, based on 1.5 hours of attorney time total for preparing the
motion and attending the hearing (1.5 hours x $275.00 = $412.50) and the $60.00
filing fee, to be reasonable.  
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Defendant’s Motion to Deem Plaintiff’s Responses to
Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted is GRANTED.
 
Defendant’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED in
the amount of $472.50, payable to Defendant’s Counsel within thirty (30) days
of notice of this Court’s order.
 
The Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
