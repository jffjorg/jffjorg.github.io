And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted in part the defendant's motion to compel discovery responses and imposed monetary sanctions on the plaintiff and the plaintiff's counsel. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's discovery demands, including interrogatories and a request for identification and production of documents. The court found that the plaintiff's failure to respond was not due to a mistake, but rather intentional delay. As a result, the court awarded the defendant monetary sanctions in the amount of $285.00 for each of the two discovery motions. The court also ordered the plaintiff to provide verified, complete, and code-compliant responses to the defendant's discovery demands within 30 days of the date of notice of the order.
