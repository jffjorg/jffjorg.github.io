Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Compel Arbitration filed by Lyft, Inc. (Defendant) against Mostafa Nasimi (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff had filed a personal injury action against the Defendant and others, alleging general negligence and intentional tort of assault and battery. The Defendant seeks to compel arbitration of the Plaintiff's claims based on the Plaintiff's acceptance of Lyft's Terms of Service, which includes an arbitration agreement.

The Judge finds that the Defendant has met its burden of demonstrating the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by presenting a copy of the agreement to the Court. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff did not oppose the motion and did not establish any grounds for revocation of the agreement.

As a result, the Judge grants the Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and stays the civil proceedings pending completion of the arbitration. A post-arbitration status conference is set for June 25, 2025, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
