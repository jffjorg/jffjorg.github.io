CROSS-ACTIONS.
______________________________________
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Patriot Environmental Services, Inc. (“Patriot”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers.  No opposition papers were filed.  Any opposition papers were required to have
been filed and served at least nine court days before the hearing under
California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
             This action arises from remediation services
allegedly provided by Patriot after a boat fire that occurred at the marina
located at 1970 Taylor Road, Bethel Island, CA 94511, known as Anchor
Marina.  Plaintiff alleges that Anchor
Marina Inc. (“AMI”) failed to pay Patriot’s outstanding invoice of over
$400,000 for services rendered.  The
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) asserts a single cause of action for breach
of contract against, among others, Defendants AMI, BI Properties Inc., Kevin
Davidson (“Davidson”) and Allen Wagner (“Wagner”).  In the FAC, Patriot alleges that Davidson is
the Chief Financial Officer of AMI. 
(FAC, ¶4.)  Wagner is identified
only as an alter ego of AMI, together with Davidson.  (FAC, ¶¶ 5 and 18.)
 
            On April 25, 2024, Davidson and
Wagner (collectively, “Cross-Complainants”) individually filed identical cross-complaints
(the “Cross-Complaints”) against Patriot. 
On May 31, 2024, Patriot filed a demurrer to each of the
Cross-Complaints.     
 
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard
            “The
primary function of a pleading is to give the other party notice so that it may
prepare its case [citation], and a defect in a pleading that otherwise properly
notifies a party cannot be said to affect substantial rights.”  (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013)
56 Cal.4th 203, 240.)  “A demurrer tests
the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff
v. Bank of America, N.A. (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.)  The Court looks to whether “the complaint
alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses a complete
defense.” (Id.)  The Court does
not “read passages from a complaint in isolation; in reviewing a ruling on a
demurrer,
we read the complaint ‘as a whole and its parts in their context.’ [Citation.]”
(West v.
JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.)  The Court “assume[s] the truth
of
the properly pleaded factual allegations, facts that reasonably can be inferred
from those
expressly
pleaded and matters of which judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris, supra,
56 Cal.4th p. 240.) “The court does not, however, assume the truth
of contentions, deductions or
conclusions
of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th
1350,
1358.)
 
            As a general matter, in a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  “The only issue a demurrer is concerned with
is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)
 
Where
a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on
the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.)  However, “[i]f there is any reasonable
possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” 
(Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 


 
The Cross-Complaints
            The Cross-Complaints
are virtually identical and assert a sole cause of action for fraud against
Patriot.  Patriot demurs to the
Cross-Complaints for failure to state a cause of action and for
uncertainty.  
 
Fraud
            “The
elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (1) a
misrepresentation, (2) with knowledge of its falsity, (3) with the intent to
induce another's reliance on the misrepresentation, (4) justifiable reliance,
and (5) resulting damage.”  (Conroy v.
Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2009) 45 Cal. 4th 1244, 1255; Charnay v.
Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184; Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc.
(2003) 30 Cal. 4th 167, 173.  Generally,
fraud must be pled with particularity.  (E.g.,
Hills Transportation Co. v. Southwest Forest Ind., Inc. (1968) 266
Cal.App.2d 702, 707.)  With regard to
fraud claims, pleadings must allege facts as to “‘how, when, where, to whom,
and by what means the representations were tendered.’”  (Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.
App. 3d 59, 73; Accord Wald v. Truspeed Motorcars, LLC (2010) 184
Cal.App.4th 378, 393; Morgan v. AT &T Wireless Services, Inc. (2009)
177 Cal.App.4th 1235, 1262.  
 
            First
and foremost, the Court notes that the Cross-Complainant in each
Cross-Complaint is not AMI, but the two individuals.  Yet, the actions alleged all involve actions
against AMI and not against the individuals. 
Therefore, neither Davidson nor Wagner appears to have standing to make
any of the claims purportedly alleged in the Cross-Complaints.
 
            In
addition, the Court notes that Cross-Defendant Patriot is alleged to be a
corporation.  (Cross-Complaints, p. 1, ¶4
a (2).)  The requirement of specificity
in a fraud action against a corporation “requires the plaintiff to allege the
names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their
authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and what was
said or written.  (Tarmann v. State
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)   Here,
the Cross-Complaints fail to properly allege “how, when, where, to whom, and by
what means the representations were tendered.”  
 
            Cross-Complainants
are attempting to allege fraud by stating that “Mr. Wagner was threatened with
jail time if Anchor Marina did not hire Patriot” and “Defendant scared Plaintiff
with threats of jail time.” (Compl., ¶ ¶ 11, 19 and 20.)  Neither an alleged threat nor scaring someone nor
coercion is a misrepresentation.  
 
            The
only even possible allegation of a misrepresentation is implied in paragraph 23,
in which the Cross-Complaints allege that “Patriot falsified time sheets to
include two 12-hour shifts with full crews.” 
Again, this appears to allege a misrepresentation against AMI, not
against either Davidson or Wagner.  Even
if this allegations were made against AMI, this claim is not an actionable
misrepresentation because there is no allegation as to what individual at Cross-Defendant
presented the falsified time sheets, what that person’s authority was to do so,
to whom that person presented the time sheets, and what the falsifications were
on those time sheets.  
 
            The
Cross-Complaint further does not allege that the time sheet was not only false
and was known to be false by Cross-Defendant at the time they were submitted.  The allegation that “[t]he number of hours
reported on the time sheet was incorrect and a flat out lie” [Cross-Complaints,
¶23) does not allege that Cross-Defendant knew at the time that they “lied about
the standby time requirement” that the time sheet was not correct. 
            Moreover,
from the pleading, it is unclear whether the original “lie” was a prediction or
estimate as to future time that might be incurred or a statement as to actual
time already incurred. In addition, the Cross-Complaints do not allege that Cross-Complainants
justifiably relied upon the alleged misrepresentation, or that it was the
proximate cause of Cross-Complainants’ damages. 
In fact, the Cross-Complaints allege that “AMI protested but could do
little since the COVID pandemic was in full swing,” a situation which was
presumably not caused by Patriot.
 
            The
Cross-Complaints are also replete with improper conclusory allegations, such as
“[t]his was all just pure fraud” (Compl., ¶ 15) and “[t]hese lies constitute
fraud” (Compl., ¶ 21).  Goldrich v.
Natural Y Surgical Specialties, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal. App. 4th 772, 783
(“conclusory allegations offer no facts at all and it is impossible to
determine what was said or by whom or in what manner.”).  “The allegation of the parties’ intent is a
conclusion of fact, which need not be accepted for purposes of demurrer.”  (Poseidon Development, Inc. v. Woodland
Lane Estates, LLC (2007) 152 Cal. App. 4th 1106, 1115; Cansino v. Bank
of Amer. (2014) 224 Cal. App. 4th 1462, 1472 (“Nor is the knowledge element
of fraud satisfied by the complaint's conclusory statement that defendants
‘knew that the … [r]epresentation[] [was] either false or at least highly
speculative.’”).  A complainant’s
conclusory assertion of reliance on misrepresentations is insufficient to
satisfy the requirement of specific pleading of fraud, and instead facts must
be alleged that would indicate actual reliance on the misrepresentations.  (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003)
30 Cal. 4th 167, 184.)
 
            Finally,
Cross-Complainants must also plead that fraud has caused damages, which they
failed to do.  (Patrick v. Alacer
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 995, 1016-17.)  The
Cross-Complaints fail to state facts showing any financial damage and no prayer
for damages. 
 
            In
short, the Cross-Complaints do not allege an actionable claim against Cross-Defendants
and in fact appear to be claims which they are not entitled to file, as any
actionable claim (if properly pled) would be held by AMI and not these
individual Cross-Complainants.  There is
a serious question as to whether these claims can amended to state a valid
cause of action against Patriot.
 
RULING
Accordingly,
because the Cross-Complaints fail to state a cause of action and are uncertain,
the Court SUSTAINS the demurrers. 
Because the Cross-Complaint have never been amended and were filed by
the individuals in propria persona, the Court grants each of them leave
to file an amended Cross-Complaint within twenty days of the date of this order.    If
the flaws in the Cross-Complaints are not cured in any amended pleadings, the
Court will consider sustaining any subsequent demurrers without leave to amend.
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
