And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Daniel Ventura's motion for an order deeming the complaint filed on June 19, 2023, and Defendant Myron Longhurst's demurrer to the complaint on the grounds that it was time-barred. The Court finds that the clerk incorrectly rejected the complaint due to a minor defect, a misspelling of the defendants' names, and that the complaint should be deemed filed as of June 19, 2023. As a result, the Court grants Plaintiff's motion and overrules Defendant's demurrer.
