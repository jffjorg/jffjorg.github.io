And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling is related to a court hearing on March 12, 2024, regarding a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Defendant Gloria Gao. The case involves a dispute between Plaintiff George L. Young and the Defendants over a property located at 1128 W. Duarte Road, #E in Arcadia, California. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to pay rent on the property and owes him $96,000 in rent, as well as an additional $300,000 in rent that was allegedly collected on his behalf. The Defendant argues that the family law court has jurisdiction over the property and that the Complaint does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.

The Judge has granted Defendant's request for judicial notice of records in the Dissolution Action, which was filed in 2010. The Judge has also denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the family law court has jurisdiction over the property and that the Plaintiff's action requires a determination of a foundational issue that is currently pending in the family law court. The Judge has stayed the action in its entirety pending resolution of the Dissolution Action. A status conference is scheduled for September 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse.
