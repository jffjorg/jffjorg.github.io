[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO SET ASIDE/VACATE DISMISSAL 
 
Dept.

  a.m.

  2024




 


 


 



 
          On October
21, 2022, plaintiff Dimerco Express USA Corporation (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against defendant Concord Displays, LLC (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 20. On
November 29, 2022, the clerk entered default against Defendant. On August 16,
2023, Plaintiff filed a request to dismiss Does 1 to 20 as part of an
application for default judgment against Defendant. The request for dismissal also
requested to dismiss the entire complaint; therefore, the Court dismissed the
case in its entirety. 
          On January 9,
2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to set aside the dismissal. Plaintiff cites
to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 even though no signed settlement
agreement is submitted for the Court’s review. Therefore, to the extent that
Plaintiff relies on section 664.6 for its motion, the motion is denied.
          Nevertheless,
to the extent that Plaintiff seeks to set aside the dismissal due to a clerical
mistake pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473(d), the motion is
GRANTED.  
          The action is
reinstated to the calendar and the Court sets a hearing for a default prove-up
on May 21, 2024. 
Dated
this 12th
day of March, 2024
