And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by Dimerco Express USA Corporation (Plaintiff) to set aside a dismissal of the case against Concord Displays, LLC (Defendant). The Plaintiff had entered default against the Defendant and then filed a request to dismiss Does 1 to 20 and the entire complaint, leading to the case being dismissed in its entirety. The Plaintiff now seeks to set aside the dismissal, citing Code of Civil Procedure sections 664.6 and 473(d). The court finds that the motion is denied to the extent it relies on section 664.6, as no signed settlement agreement is submitted for review. However, the motion is granted to the extent it is based on a clerical mistake, and the action is reinstated to the calendar. A default prove-up hearing is set for May 21, 2024.
