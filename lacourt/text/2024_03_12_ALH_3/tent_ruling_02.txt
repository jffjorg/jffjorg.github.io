I.           
INTRODUCTION
On September 11, 2023, plaintiff Daniel
Ventura (“Plaintiff”) filed this personal injury action against Myron
Longhurst, Clark Longhurst, and Kendra Longhurst. Plaintiff alleges he
sustained injuries arising from a motor vehicle collision that occurred on June
23, 2021. 
On November 9, 2023, Defendants filed a
demurrer to the complaint on the grounds that it was time-barred by the
two-year statute of limitations period applicable to personal injury claims. 
On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed
this motion for an order deeming the complaint filed as of June 19, 2023. 
This order addresses Plaintiff’s motion
as well as Defendants’ demurrer. 
II.         
PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO DEEM COMPLAINT FILED ON JUNE 19, 2023
A.  
Legal
Standard
A court clerk has no discretion to
reject a pleading that substantially conforms to the rules. (Rojas v.
Cutsforth (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 774, 777-78 [the filing functions of a
clerk are merely ministerial].) If the clerk refuses to file the complaint due
to an insignificant defect, it is deemed filed, for statute of limitations
purposes, on the date it was first presented for filing. (Id. at p. 778.)
Where a defect is insubstantial, the clerk should, instead, file the complaint
and notify the attorney or party that the perceived defect should be corrected
at the earliest opportunity. (Id. at p. 777; see also Carlson v.
State of California Department of Fish & Game¿(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1270, 1276
[the grounds for rejecting a filing of a complaint must be based in statute or
the California Rules of Court, and not on local rules].) A paper is deemed
filed when it is deposited with the clerk with directions to file the paper. (Dillon
v. Superior Court of Nevada County¿(1914) 24 Cal.App. 760, 765.) “[T]he
local superior court may not condition the filing of a complaint on local rule
requirements.  Instead, so long as a
complaint complies with state requirements, the clerk has a ministerial duty to
file. In legal effect, a complaint is ‘filed’ when it is presented to the clerk
for filing in the form required by state law.” (Carlson, supra, 68
Cal.App.4th at p. 1270.)  
B.  
Discussion
Plaintiff explains that on June 19,
2023, counsel, Diana L. Paz (“Ms. Paz” prepared a summons, complaint, civil
case cover sheet, and civil case cover sheet addendum for filing. (Paz Decl.,
Exs. A-C.) The documents were uploaded on June 19, 2023, at 10:45 a.m. but
rejected on June 20, 2023, on the grounds that the “[i]nformation does not
match on Complaint and Summons.” (Paz Decl., Ex. D.) Ms. Paz did not become
aware of this rejection until several weeks later. The main issue with the
document submitted was the misspelling of defendants Myron Longhurst and Clark
Longhurst’s names as “Myron Longhurts” and “Clark Longhuyrst” on the caption of
the Complaint, even though their names were correctly spelled in the body of
the complaint. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1)
specifically allows mistakes in the parties' names to be corrected by amending
the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(l).) Furthermore, whether the
names in the Complaint matched the names listed on the summons is not a defect
which should have prevented the complaint from being filed because a complaint
does not need to be filed with a summons. Accordingly, the complaint submitted
by Plaintiff on June 19, 2023, was incorrectly rejected by the clerk because
the misspelled names were an insubstantial defect. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion is GRANTED and the Court issues an order nunc pro tunc deeming the
Complaint filed on June 19, 2023 at 10:45 a.m. when it was presented to the
clerk for electronic filing. 
 
III.       
DEMURRER
Because the Complaint is deemed filed
as of June 19, 2023, Defendants’ demurrer on the grounds that the action is
time-barred is OVERRULED. 
IV.        
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED. 
Defendants’ demurrer is OVERRULED. 
Dated
this 12th
day of March, 2024
