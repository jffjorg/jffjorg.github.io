And here is a brief English summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to file certain documents under seal, a motion for summary judgment, and a motion for summary adjudication in a whistleblower retaliation case. The plaintiff alleges that he was retaliated against for reporting racial discrimination and was not selected for promotion despite being qualified. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims are without merit and that he was not selected for promotion due to legitimate reasons. The court has denied the defendant's motions, finding that there are triable issues of fact regarding the defendant's reasons for not promoting the plaintiff and whether the defendant retaliated against the plaintiff for his complaints. The case will proceed to trial.
