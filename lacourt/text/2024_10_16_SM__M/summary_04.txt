Roles:
	- Plaintiff: Heller
	- Defendant: Bosilic, et al.
	- Judge: N/A
Significant Statements:
	- The court lacks jurisdiction over a party if there has not been proper service of process.
	- Compliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction.
	- The filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper.
	- The court has specific jurisdiction over the defendant because the defendant has direct contacts with California and the action arises out of those contacts.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Andrea Bosilic, moves to quash the service of summons and complaint in this unlawful detainer action. The court has reviewed the proof of service submitted by the plaintiff and the defendant's declaration in opposition to the motion. The court finds that the proof of service shows that the defendant was served via substituted service at the subject property, and the defendant's declaration fails to rebut the presumptively valid substitute service.

The court also finds that the defendant has direct contacts with California, as she is the tenant of the property in question. The exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant is reasonable in this unlawful detainer action. Therefore, the court denies the motion to quash service of summons and orders the defendant to file a responsive pleading within 5 days.
