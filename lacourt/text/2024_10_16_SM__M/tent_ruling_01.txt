Legal
Standard
 
A¿lis¿pendens¿is a¿recorded
instrument¿(“Notice of Pending Action”), recorded in the office of the county recorder
where land is located, that gives¿constructive notice¿of a pending lawsuit
affecting title to described real property. (Gale v. Superior Court¿(2004)
122 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1395.) “A party to an action who asserts a¿real
property claim¿may record a notice of pendency of action in which that real
property claim is alleged.” (CCP § 405.20.) Anyone having an interest in the
property affected by a lis pendens, whether or not a party to the pending
lawsuit, may move to expunge the lis pendens any time after it is recorded.
(CCP § 405.30.) A lis pendens may be expunged on any of the following grounds:
(1) defects in the statutory service and filing requirements; (2) the complaint
does not contain a real property claim; (3) the claimant cannot prove the probable
validity of the real property claim by a preponderance of the evidence; and (4)
“adequate relief” can be “secured to the claimant by the giving of an
undertaking.” (CCP §§ 405.23, 405.31, 405.32, 405.33; McKnight v. Sup.Ct.
(Faber)¿(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 291, 303 [recognizing defective servicing and
filing requirements as grounds for expungement].)
 
The claimant who filed the lis
pendens has the burden of proof where the motion is made on the grounds that
the action does not involve a real property claim or the action lacks probable
validity. (CCP § 405.30.) If the claimant fails to meet his or her burden, the
court must order that the notice be expunged and may not order an undertaking
be given as a condition of expunging the notice. (CCP § 405.32.) 
 
A real property claim is any cause
of action which, if meritorious, would affect title to, or the right of
possession of, specific real property. (CCP § 405.4.) The allegations of the
complaint determines whether a “real property claim” is involved; no evidence
is required. (Urez Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Keefer) (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1141,
1149 [decided under former law].) 
 
A prevailing party on a motion to
expunge a lis pendens is entitled to recover “reasonable attorney’s fees and
costs of making or opposing the motion unless the court finds that the other
party acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of attorney's fees and costs unjust.” (CCP § 405.38.) For purposes
of attorneys’ fees and costs, a court’s ruling on a motion made pursuant to CCP
Sections 405.31 and 405.32 necessarily decides who is the “prevailing party”
since such motions place in issue whether the lis pendens was proper. The award
of attorney’s fees is only against the losing party, not the losing party’s
counsel. (Doyle v. Sup.Ct. (Jacinth Develop., Inc.) (1991) 226
Cal.App.3d 1355, 1359.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendants move for an order
pursuant to expunge the lis pendens recorded against the parcels of real
property commonly referred to as 9920 Valley Blvd., El Monte, CA 92731 (the
“Holiday Inn Hotel”); 16451 Scientific Way, Irvine, CA 92618 (the “Scientific
Way Building”); 2.5 Acres NWC Cabot Rd./Palomar Lane, Desert Hot Springs, CA
92240 (the “Desert Hot Springs Vacant Land”); and 2151 South Haven Ave.,
Ontario, CA 91761-0741 (the “Haven Avenue Office”). Defendants also request an
award of attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of $4,735.00 against
Plaintiffs Jinwan Shen and Da Bai Niu. 
 
Defendant argues that there is “no
real property claim” alleged as to the various properties, including the
Holiday Inn Hotel, the Scientific Way Building, the Hot Springs Vacant Land,
and the Haven Avenue Office. Defendant also asserts that the complaint
primarily seeks monetary damages through a constructive trust on the
properties. Defendant contends that such claims alone would not justify
recording the lis pendens. (Lewis v. Superior Court (1994) 30
Cal.App.4th 1850, 1862.)
 
Holiday Inn Hotel & Scientific Way Building
 
The First Amended Complaint (FAC)
seeks to set aside a pled fraudulent conveyance of the Holiday Inn Hotel. In
late 2020 and early 2021, Defendant Li represented to Plaintiff Shen that a
good investment using Defendant Coastline Holding Group as the umbrella
organization would be the purchase of a Holiday Inn Hotel for approximately
$31M to $32M because it was then a litigation distressed property. (FAC ¶140.) Li
advised Shen to fund the Sunrise Trust with $20M, which would go towards his
70% ownership interest in the Holiday Inn Hotel Property. (¶ 141.) Plaintiffs
wire transferred the funds to Li on March 1, 2021. (Id.) Shen contributed the
$20M via his company Da Bai Niu. (¶142.) Li represented to Shen that Li would
be responsible for the balance of the purchase cost for his 30% ownership
interest in the Holiday Inn Hotel Property, for approximately $9.3M to $9.6M.
(¶ 143.) Defendant 9920 Holding (subsidiary of Defendant Horizon, which is in
turn a subsidiary of Defendant Coastline) purchased the El Monte-based Holiday
Inn Hotel Property in March 2021. (Id., ¶ 144, Ex. 5.) Li omitted that Plaintiff
Shen or Plaintiff Da Bai Niu as a title owner of the Holiday Inn on the grant
deed. (¶ 145.) Immediately following the October 2023 Summary Report and
in-person meeting with Defendant Li in September 2023, Defendant Li executed an
unauthorized Performance Deed of Trust and Security Agreement on November 1,
2023, wherein the Holiday Inn Hotel property was irrevocably granted,
transferred, conveyed and assigned to 9920 Management LLC, with power of sale.
(¶ 154.) Plaintiff Shen was never informed of this Performance Deed of Trust
unilaterally executed by Defendant Li, including the unilateral granting of
power of sale of the Holiday Inn Hotel Property to 9920 Management LLC, an
entity 100% controlled by Defendant Li. (¶155.) The Performance Deed of Trust
encumbered the Holiday Inn Hotel Property with a fraudulent lien that
diminishes the value of the Holiday Inn Hotel Property. (¶ 156.) Setting aside
a conveyance of the Holiday Inn Property would facially affect the title
of the Holiday Inn Property, and therefore constitutes a real property claim. (Kirkeby
v. Sup.Ct. (Fascenelli) (2004) 33 Cal.4th 642, 648-649.) 
 
Plaintiff alleges he was to be the
100% owner of a non-profit foundation Apple Blossom Foundation and the 100%
owner of the Scientific Way Building, funding the entire purchase of the building.
(FAC., ¶¶ 118-121.) Defendants instead took title to the Scientific Way
Building through a “sham” non-profit corporation, intentionally excluding Plaintiffs
from title and corporate ownership or membership, and further encumbered the
building with at $2,160,000 bank loan. (FAC, ¶ 220, 222, 225-229, Ex. 47.) The
September 29, 2021, purchase of the Scientific Way Building by Defendant Li and
Steve in the name of Defendant Apple Blossom Foundation, with no consideration
provided to Plaintiff Shen in exchange, was an attempt by Defendant Li,
Defendant Steve, Defendant Yang, and Defendant Zhai to avoid creditors and to
place such asset/property out of reach of Plaintiffs’ collection efforts. (FAC
¶ 231.) Thus, there is a real property claim stated against the Scientific Way
Building. 
 
Defendant argues in reply that the
FAC still does not present a “real property claim” against the Holiday Inn
Hotel and the Scientific Way Building because the allegations are insufficient
to support the causes of action for fraudulent transfers. Defendant argues that
if Plaintiffs prevail, then title of the properties such as the Holiday Inn
will not change. However, Defendant admits that the title will be affected. If
successful, the Hotel Inn Hotel and Scientific Way Building would no longer be
encumbered by 9920 Management’s deed of trust, which is a matter affecting
title. (FAC ¶ 154.) Therefore, the claims would affect “title to” these specific
real properties.
 
Haven Avenue Office Building & the Desert Hot Springs
Vacant Land
 
Unlike the claims regarding the Hotel
and the Scientific Way Building, Plaintiffs do not allege any fraudulent
transfer claims regarding the Haven Avenue Office Building and the Desert Hot
Springs Vacant Land. Instead, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants purposedly
omitted Plaintiffs from titles to the Haven Avenue Office Building and the
Desert Hot Springs Vacant Land pursuant to the parties’ operative 70-30 agreement.
(FAC ¶¶ 159-165.) However, the FAC does not allege that Plaintiffs were to be
on the titles of the Haven Avenue Office or the Desert Hot Springs Vacant Land.
Quite the opposite, the FAC alleges that Plaintiffs should have an ownership interest
in a holding company, such as Defendant Target Investment or Crosslink
Holding, which would in turn hold title to its respective real property. (¶¶ 135,
159-160, 163-164.) Otherwise, Plaintiff does not cite any allegations in the
FAC or provision in the supporting agreements which would show their right to title
or possession of the Haven Office Building or Desert Hot Springs Vacant Land,
beyond the imposition of a constructive trust as an equitable remedy to recover
against Defendants for breaches of contract and fraud. 
 
Plaintiff argues that the request
for a constructive trust on the Haven Avenue Office Building and the Desert Hot
Springs Vacant Land is a real property claim. (FAC ¶¶ 317, 413-417, 426.)
Constructive trusts do not necessarily support the real property claim
requirement for lis pendens. (Lewis, supra, 30 Cal.App.4th at 1862.)
This is because “equitable remedies, even if colorable, will not support a lis
pendens if, ultimately, those allegations act only as a collateral means to
collect money damages.” (Urez Corp. v. Superior Court (1987) 190
Cal.App.3d 1141, 1149.) “[T]o allow a party to record a lis pendens in a case
in which the party seeks only ‘to freeze the real property as a res from which
to satisfy a money judgment’, is not consistent with the history and purpose of
the lis pendens statutes . . ..” (Campbell v. Superior Court (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 904, 918-919.) 
 
Plaintiff argues that a
constructive trust on real property that was itself wrongfully taken is
a real property claim. (Shoker v. Superior Court (2002) 81 Cal. App. 5th
271, 282.) Shoker does not support the finding of a real property claim
here. Shoker regarded a fraudster who convinced a husband and wife to
sell their rental properties and invest the proceeds in an unidentified technology
company. (Id. at 275.) The couple sold their rental properties and gave
the sale proceeds to the fraudster to invest, based on a representation that
the parties would split profits 50/50. (Id. at 276.) The fraudster never
invested the money, and instead conspired with the buyer of the rental
properties to use the funds to purchase the rental properties for himself. (Id.)
The couple sued the fraudster and the buyer for breach of fiduciary duty,
fraud, and constructive trust among other causes. (Id.) As well as
damages, the Shokers sought an order declaring that the defendants hold the rental
properties, and an order compelling defendants to convey the properties back to
the Shokers. (Id.) In short, the Shokers alleged that the defendants had
swindled them out of their rental properties via fraudulent misrepresentations.

 
The trial court granted a motion to
expunge on the grounds that a constructive trust claim was not a real property
claim, and did not reach the probable validity of the claim. (Id. at
277.) In overruling the trial court and holding that the Shokers’ constructive
trust claim was a real property claim, the Shoker court discussed the
nature of the constructive trust claims. “The case law distinguishes between
two subtypes of constructive trust claims. First, there are constructive trust
claims that are akin to fraudulent conveyance claims because they seek a constructive
trust on real property that was itself wrongfully taken and, if successful on
the merits, plaintiffs would regain title to or possession of the same
property. On the other hand, there are claims seeking a constructive trust or
equitable lien on different property, merely as a means to secure collection of
a debt.” (Id. at 282-283.) There, the plaintiffs claimed “a present
right to title in the same real properties they claim were wrongfully obtained”
by the defendant. (Id. at 283) The Urez line of cases deals with
the latter use of constructive trust—where the plaintiff seeks to impose a
constructive trust or equitable lien on real property only as a means to secure
a debt. (Id.) “Because constructive trusts arise in a wide variety of
factual circumstances, courts should decide these cases on a case-by-case
basis.” (Id.) 
 
There, the Shokers alleged that the
cash buyer “wrongfully acquired their properties via a conspiracy (with [the
fraudster]) involving fraud and breach of fiduciary duties” and were therefore
entitled to “a constructive trust returning those same real properties to them.”
(Id. at 282.) Such a claim fell “squarely within the plain language of
the statute: it “would, if meritorious, affect ... title” to real property.” (Id.)
On the other hand, here, Plaintiffs do not seek to regain the title of
the subject properties. Plaintiffs allegedly never held any interest in the
properties at issue. Plaintiffs do not allege that they were supposed to be on
the titles of the properties, including the Haven Avenue Office or the Desert
Hot Springs Vacant Land. Instead, the FAC alleges that Plaintiffs should have
an ownership interest in a holding company, such as Defendant Target
Investment or Crosslink Holding. (FAC ¶¶ 162-165.) Thus, Plaintiffs’ claim of
title to those properties would stem from the constructive trust remedy itself,
without any pre-existing right to the title or possession of real property. As
such, the instant constructive trust remedy against the Office Building and the
Vacant Land is a collateral means of securing damages for alleged breaches of
contract and fraud concerning the parties’ profit participation, rather than a
direct right to title or possession of real property. 
 
Accordingly, the motion to expunge
lis pendens is GRANTED as to the lis pendens filed against Acres NWC Cabot
Rd./Palomar Lane, Desert Hot Springs, CA 92240 and 2151 South Haven Ave.,
Ontario, CA 91761-0741.
 
In light of the mixed success on
the motion, Defendants’ request for attorneys’ fees is DENIED as imposition
would be unjust.
