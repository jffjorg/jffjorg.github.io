As for the summary of the judge's tentative ruling, here it is:

The judge has granted the motion to expunge the lis pendens filed against the Desert Hot Springs Vacant Land and the Haven Avenue Office Building, as the claims are not real property claims. The judge found that the claims regarding these properties are merely collateral means of securing damages for alleged breaches of contract and fraud, rather than direct claims to title or possession of real property. The judge also denied the request for attorneys' fees, finding that it would be unjust to impose them.
