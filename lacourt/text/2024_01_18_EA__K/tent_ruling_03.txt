 Case Number:  BC592047    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff Kathleen
Coleman’s Motion for New Trial From Granting Motion to Tax Costs is DENIED.
Background   
Plaintiffs Kathleen Coleman (“Coleman”)
and John Hutton (“Hutton”) (together, “Plaintiffs”) sustained injuries in a
March 15, 2015 motor vehicle collision.
On October 2, 2015, Plaintiffs
filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), asserting causes of action against
Aneeta Sagar (“Sagar”), Kinder Clinic, Inc. (“Kinder Clinic”) and Does 1-10
for:
1.                 
Motor Vehicle
2.                 
General Negligence
3.                 
Intentional Tort 
On January 15, 2019, Plaintiffs
dismissed Kinder Clinic, with prejudice.
On June 14, 2019, Sagar filed a First
Amended Cross-Complaint, asserting a cause of action against Coleman and Roes
1-25 for:
1.                 
Damages and Specific Performance
On January 29, 2021, an “Order
Granting Motion for Summary Adjudication of Issues” was filed; that same day,
the court was notified that Sagar had died on January 17, 2021.
On February 24, 2021, Plaintiffs filed an “Amendment to Complaint,”
wherein Sahin Kilci, Trustee of the First Amended and Restated Revocable Living
Trust of Aneeta Sagar, Dated June 29, 2020 (“Kilci”) was named in lieu of Doe
1.
On August 13, 2021, Hutton dismissed his FAC, with prejudice.
On October 24, 2022, a “Trial Transfer Order” was filed, assigning the
matter to Judge Wesley Hsu for trial purposes only.
On April 10, 2023, the Judgment on Special Verdict was filed. On April
17, 2023, Coleman filed (and mail-served) a “Notice of Entry of Judgment.” On
April 28, 2023, Coleman filed a “Memorandum of Costs.”
On July 3, 2023, Coleman filed a “Notice of Appeal.” On September 6,
2023, Kilci filed a “Notice of Cross-Appeal.”
On November 2, 2023, the court heard Kilci’s motion to tax costs,
which it took under submission. On November 21, 2023, the court issued its
ruling granting the motion to tax costs; notice was given to the parties by the
court clerk.
Discussion

Plaintiff moves the
court for a new trial from the granting of Kilci’s motion to tax costs pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 657, subdivisions 1, 5 and 7.[1]
Kilci contends that
the instant motion is actually a deficient motion for reconsideration pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 1008.
The motion is
denied, regardless of whether it is characterized as a motion for new trial or
a motion for reconsideration. A motion for reconsideration must be supported by
an affidavit. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008). The instant motion is not supported by
any affidavit. Further, “[w]hen the application is made for a cause
mentioned in the first, second, third and fourth subdivisions of Section 657,
it must be made upon affidavits; otherwise it must be made on the minutes of
the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 658). “The ‘minutes of the court’ include the records of
the proceedings entered by the judge or courtroom clerk, showing what action
was taken and the date it was taken (Gov. Code, § 69844) and may also include
depositions and exhibits admitted into evidence and the trial transcript. (§
660.).” (Lauren H. v. Kannappan (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 834,
839, fn. 4.) Again, the instant motion is not supported by any affidavits, nor
is it supported by any “minutes of the court.”
