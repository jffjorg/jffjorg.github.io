And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for new trial from the granting of the Defendant's motion to tax costs. The Plaintiff seeks a new trial based on the granting of the motion to tax costs, but the motion is denied because it is not supported by any affidavits. The Judge notes that a motion for reconsideration must be supported by an affidavit, and the instant motion does not meet this requirement. The Judge also references Code of Civil Procedure sections 657, 658, and 1008, as well as Government Code section 69844.
