```

Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendants' Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Answer without prejudice. The Defendants sought to amend their Answer to include res judicata and collateral estoppel, citing an arbitration proceeding between the insurance companies on June 10, 2021, which determined that the Plaintiff was 60% liable and the Defendants were 40% liable for property damage only. However, the Judge found that the Defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence of the arbitration proceeding and its determination, and that the unconfirmed arbitration award is not a final and enforceable judgment. The Judge noted that res judicata is not a proper affirmative defense in this case.
