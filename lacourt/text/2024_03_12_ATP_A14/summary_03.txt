And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal is denied. The Plaintiff, Leilani L. Antoine, alleges that the Defendants, Charles E. Mosman, Sandra Mosman, Mosman's Country Steakhouse & Bar, Zubie Enterprises, Inc., and Mosman's Town & Country Carpet & Construction, are responsible for damages stemming from their time as her tenants. The Plaintiff filed a Motion to Set Aside Dismissal, arguing that the dismissal was the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's arguments are without merit, as the Plaintiff was aware of the need to file an amended pleading and failed to take any action until after the amended pleading was due. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff did not propose a new pleading to accompany the motion, as required by statute. Therefore, the motion is denied.
