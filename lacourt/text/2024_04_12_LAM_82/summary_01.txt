**Case Number:** 23STCP03720
**Hearing Date:** April 12, 2024
**Department:** 82 California School Finance Authority, et al. v. Los Angeles Unified School District, et al.

**Summary of Tentative Ruling:**

This tentative ruling concerns a petition for a writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief filed by the California School Financial Authority (CSFA) and the State Allocation Board (collectively, "Petitioners") against the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and its Board of Education (collectively, "Respondents").

**Facts:**

1. In 2002, the California Legislature established the Charter School Facilities Program (CSFP) to provide funding for charter school facilities.
2. In 2011, the LAUSD and Camino Nuevo High School Charter (Camino Nuevo) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to finance the construction of a school facility.
3. Camino Nuevo vacated the facility in June 2021, triggering the need for a successor charter school.
4. LAUSD issued two Requests for Qualifications (RFQs) to solicit and select a successor charter school.
5. Ednovate, Inc. was selected as the qualified successor charter school, but LAUSD cancelled the second RFQ process in September 2022.

**Disputes:**

1. Petitioners argue that LAUSD failed to comply with the CSFP regulations, including the requirement to solicit and select a successor charter school.
2. Respondents argue that they have complied with the regulations and that the CSFP regulations are invalid.

**Intentions:**

1. Petitioners seek a preliminary injunction to prevent LAUSD from using the facility in a manner inconsistent with the CSFP regulations.
2. Respondents argue that the CSFP regulations are invalid and that they have complied with the regulations.

**Significant Statements:**

1. The CSFP gives priority to a successor charter school to occupy the facility, over a school district, when a previous charter school ceases using it.
2. The CSFP regulations mandate that school districts complete a process to solicit and select a successor charter school before occupying the facility.
3. Section 10157(a) of the California Code of Regulations requires the demonstration of due diligence in the solicitation and selection of a successor charter school.

**Tentative Ruling:**

1. The court grants the motion for a preliminary injunction, prohibiting LAUSD from using the facility in a manner inconsistent with the CSFP regulations until the trial is completed.
2. The court finds that Petitioners have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, and a balance of harms in their favor.

**Next Steps:**

1. The parties will submit briefs and evidence in support of their positions.
2. The court will hold a hearing to consider the parties' arguments and evidence.
3. The court will issue a final ruling on the motion for preliminary injunction.
