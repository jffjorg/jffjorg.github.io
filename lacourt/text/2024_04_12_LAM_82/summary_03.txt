And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the petition with respect to claims for malicious prosecution and wrongful use of legal process because those claims were timely filed. The judge also denies the petition with respect to the remaining claims because petitioners do not demonstrate that they failed to file a timely claim due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The judge finds that petitioners did not seek legal advice until after the criminal case against Davien Long was dismissed, and did not engage in any diligent effort to investigate their legal claims against the County within the six-month limitations period.
