And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to strike the prayers for punitive damages and loss of earnings, employment benefits, and employment opportunities from the complaint. The court finds that the claims for punitive damages are not supported by the allegations in the complaint, as they do not demonstrate conduct constituting malice, fraud, or oppression. Additionally, the court finds that the remedies provided by the Labor Code are exclusive and that the plaintiff has failed to show that the complaint can be successfully amended to include these claims. The court's ruling is based on the Labor Code's wage-and-hour provisions and the court's discretion to strike pleas that are not supported by the allegations in the complaint.
