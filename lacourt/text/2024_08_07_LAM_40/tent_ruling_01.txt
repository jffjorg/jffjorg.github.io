 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Lawrence
  Title’s Motion to Strike
 



Plaintiff Tomika Smalls
(“Plaintiff”) sues Defendant Lawrence Title (“Defendant”), alleging that Defendant failed
to pay Plaintiff all minimum and overtimes wages due and owing, failed to
provide her with duty-free meal and rest breaks at the required intervals,
failed to pay her reimbursable expenses, failed to provide sick pay, and failed
to keep accurate records as to Plaintiff's compensation. 
The operative complaint filed 4/12/24 alleges
causes of action for: (1) failure to pay minimum wages for all hours worked in
violation of Labor Code sections 1194, 1194.2, and 1197.1; (2) failure to pay
overtime wages for all hours worked in violation of Labor Code sections 510 and
1194.2; (3) failure to provide meal and rest breaks in violation of Labor Code
sections 226.7, 512, and IWC Wage Order 5; (4) failure to pay reimbursable
expenses in violation of Labor Code section 2802; (5) failure to provide
accurate wage statements in violation of Labor Code section 226; (6) failure to
pay wages due upon termination; waiting time penalties [Labor Code sections
201, 202, 203]; (7) violation of Labor Code section 233; (8) violation of Labor
Code section 558.1; and (9) Unlawful/Unfair Business Practice.
Defendant now brings an unopposed Motion to Strike the
prayers for (1) punitive damages, and (2) loss of earnings, employment benefits, and
employment opportunities from the complaint.
After review, and for the following
reasons, the Court GRANTS without leave to amend the motion to strike.
 
Motion
to Strike: GRANTED without leave to amend
 
Legal Standard 
 
Any party, within the time allowed
to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part thereof. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any time
in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. §
436, subd. (a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz¿(1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782
[“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)
However, Courts have noted that a motion to strike should be applied cautiously
and sparingly because it is used to strike substantive defects. (PH II, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682-83.) A party cannot use
a motion to strike as a “line-item veto.” (Id. at p. 1683 [“We emphasize
that such use of the motion to strike should be cautious and paring” and “have
no intention of creating a procedure ‘line-item veto’ for the civil
defendant”].)
 
For the purposes of a motion to
strike pursuant to Sections 435 to 437 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the term
“pleading” means a demurrer, answer, complaint, or cross-complaint. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 435, subd. (a).) An immaterial allegation or irrelevant matter in a
pleading entail (1) an allegation that is not essential to the statement of a
claim or defense, (2) an allegation that is neither pertinent to nor supported
by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense, or (3) a demand for judgment
requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint or
cross-complaint. (Code Civ. Proc.,¿§¿431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3).) 
 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the
complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.)

 
Analysis
 
Punitive Damages: GRANTED
without leave to amend
 
To
support a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must allege facts and
circumstances showing conduct constituting malice, fraud or oppression.¿(Grieves
v. Superior Court¿(1984) 157 Cal. App. 3d 159, 166.) The predicate acts to
support a claim for punitive damages must be intended to cause injury or must
constitute “malicious conduct,” defined as “despicable conduct” carried on by
Defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights of others. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 3294(a).) Oppressive conduct is defined as “despicable conduct”
that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of a
person’s rights. (Code Civ. Proc. § 3294(c).)¿¿Plaintiff must allege facts
demonstrating that “the defendant acted in such an outrageous and reprehensible
manner that the jury could infer that he knowingly disregarded the substantial
certainty of injury to others." (Dawes v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal. App. 3d 82, 90.) Moreover, a claim for punitive damages cannot be pleaded
generally and allegations that a defendant acted "with oppression, fraud
and malice" toward plaintiff are insufficient legal conclusions to show
that the plaintiff is entitled to an award of punitive damages. (Brousseau
v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.) Rather, specific factual
allegations are required to support a claim for punitive damages. (Id.)
 
“An employer shall not be liable for damages pursuant to
subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer, unless the
employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed
him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or
authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded
or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect to a
corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard,
authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on
the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.” 
(Civ. Code, § 3294(b).)
 
Here, appellate
authority indicates that in most cases, causes of action based solely on
alleged violations of the Labor Code’s wage-and-hour provisions do not give
rise to the possibility of punitive damages. (Brewer v. Premier Golf
Properties, LP (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1243, 1252 [applying the “new
right-exclusive remedy” doctrine to conclude that punitive damages “are not
recoverable when liability is premised solely on the employer's violation of
the Labor Code statutes that regulate meal and rest breaks, pay stubs, and
minimum wage laws”].)
 
Because
this is an action for violation of the Labor Code that regulates meal and rest
breaks, pay stubs, and minimum wage laws, the motion to strike the prayer for
punitive damages is granted. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to show that
the complaint can be successfully amended. As such, leave to amend will not be
allowed.
Prayer for loss of
earnings, employment benefits, and employment opportunities according to proof: GRANTED without leave
to amend
“When a
statute recognizes a cause of action for violation of a right, all forms of
relief granted to civil litigants generally, including appropriate punitive
damages, are available unless a contrary legislative intent appears.” (Commodore
Home Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court (1982) 32 Cal.3d 211, 215 [authorizing
punitive damages in FEHA action].) “As a general rule, where a statute creates
a right that did not exist at common law and provides a comprehensive and
detailed remedial scheme for its enforcement, the statutory remedy is
exclusive.” (Rojo v. Kliger (1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 79.) 
 
Here, the
statutes under the Labor Code cited in the complaint provide a detailed
remedial scheme, and therefore the remedies provided are exclusive. For
example, Labor Code section 1194.2 states: “In any action under Section 98,
1193.6, 1194, or 1197.1 to recover wages because of the payment of a wage less
than the minimum wage fixed by an order of the commission or by statute, an
employee shall be entitled to recover liquidated damages in an amount equal to
the wages unlawfully unpaid and interest thereon.” (Lab. Code, § 1194.2.)
The statutes do not mention that there are other remedies available. Plaintiff
has failed to file an opposition to contend otherwise. As such, the motion to
strike is granted without leave to amend.
Conclusion 
Defendant’s Motion to Strike is
GRANTED without leave to amend.
