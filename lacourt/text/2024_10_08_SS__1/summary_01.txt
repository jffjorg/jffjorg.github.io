Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a wage-and-hour proposed class action case. The defendant, Fitness International, LLC, moves to compel the plaintiff, Martha Cisneros, to submit her claims to arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement she allegedly signed. The judge denies the motion, finding that the defendant has not met its burden to establish the plaintiff's signature on the agreement. The judge cites various California court cases, including Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc., which holds that a party seeking to enforce an arbitration agreement must show that the electronic signature was "the act of" the person signing. The judge concludes that the defendant's evidence is insufficient to meet this burden and therefore denies the motion to compel arbitration.
