And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's request for default judgment against Truman Hedding without prejudice. The plaintiff, Elm Terrace Holdings, LLC, sought a total of $69,159.47 in damages, including $44,028.16 demanded in the complaint, $9,434.31 in interest, $1,200.00 in costs, and $14,497.00 in attorney fees. However, the judge noted several defects in the submitted default judgment package, including unclear mailing dates, lack of signature, and unclear calculation of interest. Additionally, the judge questioned why the plaintiff is seeking interest on a judgment against another defendant and why the plaintiff is adding $4,497.00 to $10,000.00 in attorney fees without providing evidence. The judge ordered the plaintiff to resubmit the default judgment package.
