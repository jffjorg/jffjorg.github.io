TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
3 Legged Machine, Inc. d/b/a Blackberry Smoke (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of
default judgment against Defendant Thunder on the Iron Range, LLC in the total
amount of $47,265.54, comprising $32,200.00 in damages, $3,184.71 in interest,
$968.33 in costs, and $10,912.50 in attorney’s fees.
The
Court notes a number of defects with the submitted default judgment package. 
First, Plaintiff checked
Item 6(b) of the Request (Form CIV-100), but the date listed is “July XX,
2023.” Thus, it is unclear if and when the request was mailed. 
Second, Plaintiff has not
submitted sufficient evidence to prove up the requested damages. Plaintiff
solely submits the declaration of its counsel in support of the request (the Declaration
of John P. Cogger). Mr. Cogger states, for example, that “attached to the
Complaint and attached here as Exhibit 2 is a copy of the Performance
Contract…which governed Plaintiff’s performance at the music festival and
Defendant’s Guarantee and obligations to pay Plaintiff the full amount of
$60,000.” (Cogger Decl., ¶ 5.) Mr. Cogger also states that “Defendant made the
initial deposit of $30,000 as contractually required. However, Defendant failed
to pay the remaining balance of $30,000, the $1,000 for artist-supplied and
carried production, and…the $1,200 for the catering budget.” (Cogger Decl., ¶
7.) However, the Court does not find that Plaintiff’s counsel
has demonstrated a foundation of personal knowledge to make such statements. 
Third, Item 7(e) of Plaintiff’s Request
(the Memorandum of Costs) states that Plaintiff seeks a total of $968.30
in costs. However, Item 2(d) of the Request states that Plaintiff seeks $968.33
in costs. (Underline added.) 
Fourth, the end of Plaintiff’s name appears
to be cut off in Item 5(a) of the Proposed Judgment (Form JUD-100).
Fifth, it does not
appear that Plaintiff has sought to dismiss the doe defendants. A party seeking
a default judgment must file “[a] dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment…” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(7).)
Based
on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. Plaintiff to arrange schedule for resubmission of the
default judgment package.
