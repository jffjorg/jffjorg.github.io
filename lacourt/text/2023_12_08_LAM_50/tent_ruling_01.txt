TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff Elm Terrace
Holdings, LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment against Defendant
Truman Hedding (“Hedding”). Plaintiff
seeks judgment in the total amount of $69,159.47, comprising $44,028.16 demanded in the Complaint, $9,434.31 in interest, $1,200.00 in costs, and $14,497.00 in attorney fees. 
The Court notes a number of defects with the submitted default
judgment package.
First, it is unclear whether the most recent default
judgment package filed on October 12, 2023 (and October 11, 2023) was mailed to
Hedding. Item 6(b) of the Request (Form CIV-100) filed on October 12, 2023 states
that the request was mailed on “May 2, 2022.” In addition, there is no
signature of the declarant below Item 6 of the Request.  
Second, Item 2(f) of the Request indicates that
Plaintiff seeks a total of $69,179.47. However, Item 6(a)(6) of the proposed judgment (Form JUD-100) indicates
that Plaintiff seeks a total of $69,159.47. (Underline added.)
The Court notes that the amounts requested add up to $69,159.47.
Third, Plaintiff appears to calculate interest in part based on the
amount of the November 9, 2022 Judgment against Defendant Snatch Media, Inc.
dba Dealer Preroll. (See Cadman Decl., ¶ 9, “the additional interest amount
will
be, at 10% interest on the $58,632.91 judgment is the sum of $5,429.56.)
Again, it is unclear why Plaintiff is seeking interest on the total amount of a
judgment against another defendant in this action in the instant request.  
Fourth, Item 7(d)
of the Request (the Memorandum of Costs) lists the amount “$600” but does not
specify what the $600 in requested costs was incurred for. Thus, it is unclear
if such costs are allowable under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5. 
Fifth, there is a signature below Item 8 of the
Request (Declaration of Military Status). However, the date next to the
signature is February 2, 2022, and the instant request was filed on October 12,
2023. 
Sixth, Plaintiff’s counsel’s supporting declaration
filed on October 12, 2023 states that “the amount of fees has increased
$4,497 from what was requested when the judgment against Snatch Media, Inc. was
entered.” (Rothman Decl., ¶ 5.) The Court notes that on November 9, 2022,
Judgment by default was entered against Defendant Snatch Media, Inc. dba Dealer
Preroll, and the judgment included $10,000.00 in attorney’s fees. It thus
appears Plaintiff is adding $4,497.00 to $10,000.00 for a total amount of
$14,497.00 in attorney’s fees requested against Hedding. However, Plaintiff’s
counsel does not appear to provide evidence substantiating any $10,000.00 amount
purportedly requested against Hedding. The $10,000.00 in attorney’s fees
previously awarded was included in a Judgment against Snatch Media, Inc. dba
Dealer Preroll, a different defendant.
Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. Plaintiff
to schedule resubmission of the default judgment package.
