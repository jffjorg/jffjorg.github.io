 Case Number:  21STCV42748    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  57  On January
26, 2024, the Court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of
Cross-Defendant Sonia Gonzalez to the Second Amended Cross-Complaint (“SACC”) of
Helen Kim Law APC and Helen U. Kim (collectively, “Kim”).    Notwithstanding that ruling, and in direct
contravention of it, Kim filed another Cross-Complaint against Gonzalez on
February 1, 2024.  On its own motion, the
Court is striking Kim’s latest Cross-Complaint against Gonzalez.   The Court is taking that action because the
Court’s January 26, 2024 ruling on Gonzalez’s demurrer to the SACC barred Kim
from filing another Cross-Complaint against Gonzalez.   In light
of the striking of the February 1, 2024 Cross-Complaint, the Court is denying
as moot the pending demurrer of Gonzalez to that Cross-Complaint.  Inexplicably, Gonzalez’s pending
demurrer  failed to mention that the
Court’s ruling on Gonzalez’s demurrer to the SACC prohibited Kim from filing the
February 1, 2024 Cross-Complaint.  That
Kim would file the February 1, 2024 Cross-Complaint in the face of the Court’s
ruling of January 26, 2024 sustaining without leave to amend Gonzalez’s demurrer
to the SACC is even more inexplicable.  And it is sanctionable too.
