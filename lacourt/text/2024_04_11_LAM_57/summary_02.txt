  - "That Kim would file the February 1, 2024 Cross-Complaint in the face of the Court's ruling of January 26, 2024 sustaining without leave to amend Gonzalez's demurrer to the SACC is even more inexplicable. And it is sanctionable too."
```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case. The Court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of Cross-Defendant Sonia Gonzalez to the Second Amended Cross-Complaint. However, despite this ruling, Kim filed another Cross-Complaint against Gonzalez, which the Court has now struck. The Court is striking the Cross-Complaint because it was filed in contravention of the Court's previous ruling. The Court is also denying Gonzalez's pending demurrer as moot. The Judge notes that Kim's actions are inexplicable and potentially sanctionable.
