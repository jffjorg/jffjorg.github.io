Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Heriberto Feliciano’s Motion to Set
Aside Dismissal is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is
ordered to file and serve an amended complaint within 5 days.   
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background 
On February 3, 2023, Plaintiff Heriberto Feliciano
(“Plaintiff”), representing himself in propria persona, filed the underlying
lawsuit against Defendant Tina M. Leuth (“Defendant”) for personal injuries
suffered during a crash. Plaintiff later retained the law firm of Benjamin
Charchian and Associates to represent him in the litigation. (Vartanian
Declaration, ¶ 3.) A calendaring error by Plaintiff’s counsel resulted in counsel’s
failure to attend the March 15, 2024 Case Management Conference and OSC Re
Dismissal.  As a result, the Court
dismissed the case without prejudice. (Vartanian Dec. ¶6.)
Plaintiff now moves to vacate the dismissal under CCP §
473(b) due to attorney error.  
No opposition has been filed as of June 7, 2024.
 
Legal Standard 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (CCP § 473,
subd. (b).) 
Discussion 
As a preliminary matter, the instant motion is timely
because it was filed on April 9, 2024, within six months of the dismissal
entered on March 15, 2024. (CCP 473, subd. (b).)  
Under CCP § 473, relief from dismissal is mandatory where
the dismissal is based on the attorney’s conduct and there is an attorney
affidavit of fault. (Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b); see also Leader v. Health
Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal. App. 4th 603, 618 [relief from
dismissal mandatory when the dismissals based on the inadvertence of the
client’s attorneys in meeting filing deadlines].)
Here, a calendaring error by Plaintiff’s counsel resulted in
the dismissal of the action. (Vartanian Dec. ¶6.)  Therefore, the Court is required to grant
relief.   
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to file and serve an
amended complaint within 5 days.
