Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendant Stephanie Alvarez's motion to stay discovery. The court finds that Defendant Alvarez's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is implicated, and that a stay of the civil action will minimize the likelihood of discovery disputes. The court also considers the interests of the parties, including the Plaintiff's interest in proceeding expeditiously with the litigation, and the Defendant's interest in minimizing the burden of simultaneous criminal and civil proceedings. The court concludes that a stay of the civil action pending the outcome of the criminal case is appropriate.
