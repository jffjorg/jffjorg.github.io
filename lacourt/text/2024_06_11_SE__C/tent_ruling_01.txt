Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Mari Alvarez’s Motion to Vacate the
Court’s October 21, 2021 Order regarding Monthly Mortgage Payments is DENIED.
On its own motion, the Court corrects its November
19, 2021 Order nunc pro tunc as set forth below.  
No sanctions are ordered. 
Plaintiff to give notice.
 
Background 
This quiet title action was filed by Plaintiff Mari Alvarez
(“Plaintiff”) against Defendant Christian Erick Alvarez (“Defendant”) on March
4, 2021.  An unlawful detainer action was
filed by Defendant against Plaintiff on March 16, 2021 in Case No.
21NWUD00198.  The parties were previously
married, and a dispute arose between them regarding the ownership of their
residence located at 11604 Leibacher Avenue, Norwalk, CA (“Subject
Property”).  The parties continue to
cohabitate in the subject property. 
On October 21, 2021, a hearing was scheduled on Plaintiff’s
Motion for Leave to File a Second Amendment Complaint, Motion for
Consolidation, and Motion for Stay of the unlawful detainer action.  The Court issued a tentative ruling, heard
argument, and took the matter under submission. 
On November 19, 2021, the Court issued an order granting Plaintiff leave
to file a second amended complaint, denying consolidation, and staying the
unlawful detainer action.  As relevant
here, the Court noted Defendant’s request that Plaintiff be ordered to deposit
at least half of the monthly mortgage [paid by Defendant] into an escrow
account in the event the Court stayed the unlawful detainer action.  Plaintiff did not oppose the request.  The Court made the following order:
“Plaintiff is ORDERED to pay $850.00 into an escrow account on the 1st
of every month until the completion of the UD action.” (Minute Order, November
19, 2021.) 
Plaintiff now moves to vacate the Court’s Order on the
grounds that Defendant misrepresented the actual amount of the mortgage payment.  
Legal Standard 
The
court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct
clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the
judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either party after notice to
the other party, set aside any void judgment or order. (CCP
§ 473 subd. (d.).) 
Discussion
As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff moves the Court to
vacate its October 21, 2021 Order. 
Although Plaintiff’s motions were heard on that date, no ruling was
issued because the Court took the motions under submission.  The Court did not issue a ruling until
November 19, 2021.  
Plaintiff contends she recently discovered that the actual
amount of the mortgage payment is only $411.81 per month, and Defendant falsely
represented that the monthly mortgage payment was $1,700.00 per month. (Alvarez
Decl., ¶ 2.) However, Plaintiff knew, or should have known, that the mortgage
was only $411.81 per month because Defendant stated the correct amount in opposition
to Plaintiff’s original motion to stay the unlawful detainer action. (Silverstein
Decl., ¶ 3, filed on October 18, 2021, in support of Defendant’s Opposition to
Plaintiff’s Motion to Stay.)  The Court
determines that Defendant did not misrepresent the amount of the mortgage
payment.  Rather, it appears the Court
erred by ordering Plaintiff to pay $850.00 per month.  The correct amount is $205.91 per month, or
one-half of $411.81.  Thus, the amount listed
in the Court’s November 19, 2021 Order should be corrected pursuant to CCP §
473 subd. (d.).
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the Court’s
October 21, 2021 Order is DENIED.  On its
own motion, the Court corrects its November 19, 2021 Order nunc pro tunc by amending
the amount Plaintiff is ordered to deposit into an escrow account each
month.  The order shall read: “Plaintiff
is ORDERED to pay $205.91 into an escrow account on the 1st of every
month until the completion of the UD action.” 
Furthermore, Plaintiff is entitled to credit for each overpayment made
to date.  
Because the error is attributed to the Court, no sanctions
are ordered.
