Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background
This action alleges that Defendant Kia Motors America, Inc.
(“Defendant”) violated California’s Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
(“Song-Beverly Act”) by failing to repair Plaintiff’s Edwardo Melgoza’s
(“Plaintiff”) 2015 Kia Sedona vehicle (the “Subject Vehicle”). During the
warranty period, the Subject Vehicle contained or developed defects that
Defendant’s authorized repair facility was unable to conform to warranty. 
On July 10, 2023, Plaintiff propounded his first set of
discovery, including the subject Requests for Production. (Koo Decl., ¶ 3.)
In its April 23, 2024 minute order, the Court determined
that the parties had not sufficiently met and conferred.  The Court ordered the parties to file a joint
statement, and they did so.  In the joint
statement, Defendant agreed to serve further responses to RFP Nos. 28, 29, 91,
and 92.  Defendant stated they may
provide further responses to RFP Nos. 1 and 7 (but defense counsel is still
waiting for confirmation from their client). 
The parties are at an impasse regarding the remainder of the RFPs.   
Meet and Confer Requirement 
A
motion¿to compel further responses to requests for production “shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the
motion.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.)¿  
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and
confer requirement.
Separate Statement 
A motion to compel further
responses requires a separate statement.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a).) Plaintiff properly filed separate statements.
Legal Standard
On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any
of the following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete; (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive; (3) An objection in the response is without merit
or too general. (CCP § 2031.310, subd. (a).) 
Discussion
Request Nos. 28, 29, 91, and 92
These requests are MOOT because Defendant agrees to serve
further responses. 
Request Nos. 1 and 7
These requests seek the following:
·       
No. 1: All DOCUMENTS regarding the SUBJECT
VEHICLE that are maintained in YOUR databases.
·       
No. 7: All DOCUMENTS, including recalls,
technical service bulletins, special service messages, dealer alerts, reports,
Star Reports, campaigns, extended warranties, dealer advisories, summaries,
etc., that were issued for the SUBJECT VEHICLE.
These requests are within the scope of the Case Management
Order, which provides for the production of documents including the following:  
·       
Purchase
or lease contracts concerning the Subject Vehicle, including any associated
documents reflecting original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) or aftermarket
equipment installed at the dealership, extended limited warranties (“ELW”) or
service contracts, and any other writings signed by the Plaintiff at the point
of sale. 
·       
Work
orders, repair orders, and invoices (including accounting and warranty
versions) for any maintenance, service and repair activity concerning the
Subject Vehicle.  
·       
Rental
car or loaner agreements regarding alternate transportation provided during
service or repair visits concerning the Subject Vehicle. 
·

Vehicle. 
·       
Warranty
Claims submitted to and/or approved by Defendant concerning the Subject
Vehicle. 
·       
Warranty
Policy and Procedure Manual or similar policies or claim-handling procedures
published by Defendant from the date the Subject Vehicle was purchased or
leased to the date the lawsuit was filed. 
·

year, make, and model as the Subject Vehicle. 
·       
Defendant’s
written statements of policy and/or procedures used to evaluate customer

including ones brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, from the
date the Subject Vehicle was purchased or leased to the date the lawsuit was
filed. 
·       
Technical
Service Bulletins and Recall Notices for vehicles purchased or leased in
California for the same year, make, and model of the Subject Vehicle. 
·       
Copies
of any repair instruction, bulletin, or other diagnostic/repair procedure

Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further response
to Request Nos. 1 and 7 is GRANTED.  
The Court now turns its attention to the remaining matters
in dispute. 
Request Nos. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 42, 43, 64, and 65 
These requests seek information regarding Defendant’s internal
analysis or investigation, customer complaints, failure rates, and fixes regarding
electrical and transmission defects in Kia Vehicles.  These
requests are overbroad.  The requests will be limited to documents related to the
same electrical and transmission defect in 2015 KIA Sedona vehicles sold in
California.  To the extent a privilege
applies, Defendant may produce a privilege log. (CCP § 2031.240, subd. (c)(1).)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further response to Request Nos. 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 42, 43, 64, and 65 is GRANTED in
part.  

Request Nos. 66, 67, 70 and 71 
These requests seek all executive summaries, summaries,
reports, analyses, evaluations, or memoranda, including documents prepared by
Defendant’s engineers or suppliers, relating to electrical and transmission
defects in KIA vehicles like the Subject Vehicle.  These
requests are overbroad.  The requests will be limited to documents related to the
same electrical and transmission defect in 2015 KIA Sedona vehicles sold in
California.  To the extent a
privilege applies, Defendant may produce a privilege log. (CCP § 2031.240,
subd. (c)(1).)
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further response to Request Nos. 66, 67, 70 and 71 is GRANTED
in part.  

Request Nos. 111,112,
115, 116, 117, and 118
These requests seek documents relating to Communication with
Governmental Agencies and Suppliers regarding the defects in Kia Vehicles. These requests are overbroad. The
requests will be limited to documents related to the same electrical and
transmission defect in 2015 KIA Sedona vehicles sold in California.  
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further response
to Request Nos. 111,112, 115, 116, 117, and 118 is GRANTED in part.  
Requests Nos. 129 and 130 
These requests seek the following: 
·       
No. 129: All DOCUMENTS concerning performance
standards relating to the electrical system in KIA VEHICLES.
·       
No. 130: All DOCUMENTS concerning performance
standards relating to the 6-speed Transmission in KIA VEHICLES.
The Court agrees
with Defendant that these requests are overbroad, vague and ambiguous and not
properly limited in time and scope.  
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further response to Request Nos. 129 and 130 are
DENIED. 
Sanctions
In a motion to compel further discovery responses, the
court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).) 
Given the mixed ruling, the Court declines to impose
sanctions.
