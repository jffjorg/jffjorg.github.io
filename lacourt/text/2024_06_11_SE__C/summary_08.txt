And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Cecilia Vanpatten, has filed a motion to compel the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., to provide compliant responses to her request for admissions. The defendant had provided non-Code compliant responses, which the plaintiff contends are insufficient. The court finds that the parties have not exhausted their meet and confer obligations and orders them to make further efforts to resolve the issues. If the parties are unable to informally resolve their discovery disputes, they must submit a joint statement outlining the remaining disputed issues. The court also advises counsel to review the standing CMC order for guidance on handling disputed items.
