And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

"The court denies Plaintiff's motion to vacate the Court's October 21, 2021 Order regarding monthly mortgage payments. The court corrects its November 19, 2021 Order nunc pro tunc by amending the amount Plaintiff is ordered to deposit into an escrow account each month. The court determines that Defendant did not misrepresent the amount of the mortgage payment, but rather the court erred by ordering Plaintiff to pay $850.00 per month. The correct amount is $205.91 per month, or one-half of $411.81. The court orders Plaintiff to pay $205.91 into an escrow account on the 1st of every month until the completion of the UD action. Furthermore, Plaintiff is entitled to credit for each overpayment made to date. No sanctions are ordered."
