And here is the summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The City of Calabasas is seeking the appointment of a receiver and related injunctive order to abate the hazardous and unsanitary conditions at a property located at 23320 Dale Road in Calabasas, California. The property has been in a dangerous, unsanitary, and unlawful condition for over 14 years, and the City has made extensive efforts to bring the property into compliance with state and local law, to no avail. The property is a public nuisance and poses an extreme and imminent threat to health and safety.

The City argues that good cause exists for the appointment of a receiver and issuance of related injunctive relief because the property poses an extreme and imminent threat to health and safety and a fire hazard to any occupants and neighboring residents. The City has made exhaustive efforts to cause the property to be brought into compliance with state and local law, to no avail. Absent the relief requested, the hazardous and unsanitary conditions at the property will continue to exist, and public health, safety, and welfare will be irreparably harmed.

The Court finds that the City has satisfied the procedural prerequisites for appointing a receiver and granting an injunction. The Court grants the City's motion for appointment of a receiver and related injunctive order and will sign the proposed order.
