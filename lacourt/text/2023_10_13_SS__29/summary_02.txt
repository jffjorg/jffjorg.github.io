And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that defendants Salvador Penatovar and KS Trans Service's motion for relief from waiver of their right to a jury trial is granted. The defendants had failed to timely post the jury fee, but argued that this was due to an inadvertent mistake by their counsel. The judge found that the defendants had always intended to proceed with a jury trial and that their current counsel had acted reasonably in posting the jury fee after substituting in as counsel. The judge also found that Plaintiff Robert Bishop, III had not shown any prejudice that would result from granting the motion. Therefore, the judge granted the motion, allowing the defendants to proceed with a jury trial.
