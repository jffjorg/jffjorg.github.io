And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel a further statement of damages from the plaintiff. The motion is granted in part and denied in part. The plaintiff is ordered to serve a new statement of damages within 30 days of notice of this order, which must set forth the nature and amount of damages being sought. The statement must also specify the nature of any damages claimed on certain lines of the form. The judge notes that the plaintiff's previous statement of damages was deficient in that it did not set forth the nature and amount of damages being sought, and that the updated statement is still deficient in certain respects. The judge also denies the defendant's request for sanctions and notes that the defendant has an adequate remedy available to it if it believes the damages claimed are excessive, namely to pursue the issue through robust discovery.
