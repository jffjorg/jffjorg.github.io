  Case Number:  19STCV23705    Hearing Date:   October 13, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
The three motions to compel are GRANTED. The requests for
sanctions are GRANTED in part. 
 
Background
 
On July 9, 2019, Plaintiffs Jose Cruz,
Reina Andino and Delmis Andino filed a complaint against Defendants Moses
Cardona and Robertson’s Ready Mix alleging that Defendant Cardona was allegedly
negligently operating a vehicle that collided with Plaintiffs’ vehicle on
November 17, 2017.  
 
Legal Standard
 
A
party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.” Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
 
Defendant
Robertson’s served Plaintiffs Jose Cruz, Reina Andino and Delmis Andino each
with Form Interrogatories (Set One). (Kezbar Dec., ¶ 3.) Plaintiffs did not
timely serve, and still have not served, responses, despite multiple extensions
and Plaintiffs’ reassurances that responses would be served. (Kezbar Dec., ¶¶ 3-14.)

 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s three motions to compel are GRANTED.
 
Defendant
Robertson’s requests sanctions in the amount of $1,650 against each Plaintiff
and Plaintiff’s counsel. Given the relatively straightforward nature of a
motion to compel initial responses to discovery requests, and the economies of
scale associated with preparing multiple discovery motions in the same case,
the Court awards sanctions in the amount of $510 per motion, calculated as two hours
of attorney time on each motion, multiplied by counsel’s billing rate of $225
per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS the three motions to compel.

ORDERED to serve code compliant, verified responses to Form Interrogatories
(Set One) within 30 days of notice of this order.
