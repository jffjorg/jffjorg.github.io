And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on three motions to compel and requests for sanctions in a personal injury case. The motions are brought by Robertson's Ready Mix, the defendant, against the plaintiffs, Jose Cruz, Reina Andino, and Delmis Andino. The plaintiffs failed to timely serve responses to interrogatories, despite multiple extensions, and the court has granted the motions to compel. The court has also granted the requests for sanctions and ordered the plaintiffs to pay $510 each for the motion preparation fees. The court found that the plaintiffs' failure to respond to the interrogatories was unjustified and warrants the imposition of sanctions.
