Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Reliant Real Estate Management, Inc. (Defendant) to the second cause of action of the Complaint filed by Ashley Carrell and others (Plaintiffs). Defendant's counsel failed to demonstrate good faith meeting and conferring with Plaintiffs before filing the demurrer, which is a requirement under California law. As a result, the judge has ordered Defendant to meet and confer with Plaintiffs within 10 days and to file a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer if the parties are unable to resolve the issues. The hearing on the demurrer has been continued to a later date.
