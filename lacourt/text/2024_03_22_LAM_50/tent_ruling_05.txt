  ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANT
  RELIANT REAL ESTATE’S DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT
 
 



Background
On December 27, 2023, Plaintiffs
Ashley Carrell, Angelica Herrador, Anthony Estrada, Rachel Bird, Felix Alonzo,
Krista Parry, Anita Thompson, James Egan, Myranda Sanchez, Selina Nunez, and
Hugo Hernandez (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendant
Reliant Real Estate Management, Inc. (“Defendant”). 
The Complaint alleges
causes of action for (1) violations of the Investigative Consumer
Reporting Agencies Act, (2) invasion of privacy, and (3) declaratory relief. 
Defendant now demurs to the second cause of action of the Complaint.
Plaintiffs oppose. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter,
the Court notes that Defendant’s counsel’s declaration filed in support of the
demurrer indicates, inter alia, that “[o]n behalf of Defendant,
on January 10, 2024, I sent a meet and confer correspondence to counsel for Plaintiffs…regarding
the issues raised in this Demurrer and requested that Plaintiffs dismiss the
claim against Defendant with prejudice or otherwise contact me by January 12,
2024 to further meet and confer. Attached hereto as ‘Exhibit A’ is a true and
correct copy of the meet and confer correspondence I sent to counsel for
Plaintiffs.” (Valdivia Decl., ¶ 2.) Defendant’s counsel states that
“Plaintiffs’ counsel failed to respond by January 12, 2024.” (Valdivia Decl., ¶
3.) 
The Court notes that Defendant’s
counsel’s declaration and the Exhibit attached thereto do not demonstrate
that the parties met and conferred in person, by
telephone, or by video conference, or that Defendant’s counsel attempted to do so. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a),
“[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter,
the demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or
by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject
to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis
added.) Such meeting and conferring must be done in good faith with an
effort to try to resolve the issues subject to the demurrer. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on Defendant’s
demurrer is continued to _______________,
2024 at 2 p.m. in Dept. 50. 
Defendant
is¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiffs within 10 days of the date of
this order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the
parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, Defendant is
to¿thereafter¿file and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet
and confer in compliance with¿Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this order.
