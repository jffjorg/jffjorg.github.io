[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
SECOND AMENDED
  APPLICATION FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO CCP §
  584 
 




            
Plaintiff
Boss Hoss of California, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment
against Defendant Angelia Dimattia in the total amount of $30,012.11, comprising $29,422.11
in damages and $590.00 in costs. 
On
March 7, 2024, the Court issued an Order continuing Plaintiff’s Second Amended
Application for Entry of Judgment to March 22, 2024. The Court’s March 7, 2024
minute order provides, inter alia, that “[o]n or before March 15, 2024,
Plaintiff is to file the required form CIV-100 and JUD 100, with courtesy
copies delivered to Department 50.” On March 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Request for Court Judgment (Form CIV-100) and a Proposed Judgment (Form
JUD-100). 
The
Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently supported its request with the
submitted declarations and evidence. However,        the Court notes that Item 5 of the Proposed
Judgment is blank. Plaintiff may file a revised Form JUD-100 prior to the
hearing. If the foregoing defect is corrected before the hearing, the Court
will grant Plaintiff’s request.
