And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Fernando Vazquez's motion to quash the deposition subpoena for production of business records without prejudice. The court found that Fernando Vazquez failed to demonstrate grounds to quash the subpoena. The subpoena was served on September 1, 2022, and required Fernando Vazquez to produce his personal tax returns from 2017 to the present. Fernando Vazquez claimed that the subpoena asked for production of personal tax returns in violation of his taxpayer privilege. The court noted that the subpoena did not provide Attachment 3, which would have provided more information on the records to be produced. The court also found that Fernando Vazquez relied on Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 45, which is applicable to United States district courts, but this action was filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court.
