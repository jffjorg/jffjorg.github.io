And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the City's First Amended Cross-Complaint is partially sustained and partially overruled. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first and second causes of action, which seek equitable indemnification and apportionment of fault, respectively. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, which seeks declaratory relief, because it is uncertain and has not been sufficiently pleaded.

However, the judge has overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which seeks express indemnity, because it has been sufficiently pleaded. The judge has granted leave to amend only to the third cause of action.

The City is ordered to file an amended pleading consistent with this ruling within 20 days of this order.
