And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a default and default judgment. The motion was filed by Mr. Flores, who claims that he was not properly served with the summons and did not receive actual notice of the proceedings. The court finds that the service of summons was ineffective and did not provide Mr. Flores with actual notice of the proceedings against him. As a result, the court grants the motion to set aside the default and default judgment and orders the defendant to file a responsive pleading within 20 days of this order.
