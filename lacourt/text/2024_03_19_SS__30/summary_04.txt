And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Palmdale Regional Medical Center's motion for determination of good faith settlement, finding that the proposed settlement of $740,000 was made in good faith. The judge concludes that the settlement is reasonable based on the evidence presented, including the rough approximation of Plaintiff's total recovery, the settlor's share of liability, and the size of the settlement. The judge also finds that Palmdale Regional Medical Center's nondelegable duty to ensure the safety of its premises was not breached, and that MPM Building Services, Inc. failed to present sufficient evidence to show that Palmdale Regional Medical Center had constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition. As a result, the judge bars MPM Building Services, Inc. from asserting claims for equitable comparative contribution or comparative indemnity against Palmdale Regional Medical Center.
