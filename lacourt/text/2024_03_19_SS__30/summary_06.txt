English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has granted the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment or in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication. The Plaintiff, Sven Klimaschka, filed a complaint alleging three causes of action against Emily Mesta Escalante and Rudy Mesta after an automobile collision. The Defendants argued that they accepted a settlement offer and are seeking to enforce the contract. The Judge found that the settlement offer was properly accepted and that a contract exists. The Court analyzed the terms of the settlement agreement and concluded that the acceptance was absolute and unqualified. The Judge also applied the doctrine of contra proferentem, which construes ambiguity in a contract against the drafter. Therefore, the Motion is granted, and the case will proceed to summary judgment or summary adjudication.
