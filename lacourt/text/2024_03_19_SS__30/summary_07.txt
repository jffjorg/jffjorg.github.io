And here is a summary in English text:

The Honorable Armenak Badoyan has issued a tentative ruling in the case of ARMENAK BADOYAN, et al. vs UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC., et al. (Case Number: 23STCV24268). The Court has denied the Petitioner's motion to compel arbitration. The Petitioner has not provided a written arbitration agreement signed by both parties, and the Court has no opportunity to examine the terms of the agreement. The Court notes that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and California law favor the enforcement of valid arbitration agreements. However, the Court finds that the Petitioner has failed to meet its burden of proving the existence of an enforceable arbitration agreement. The motion is therefore denied.
