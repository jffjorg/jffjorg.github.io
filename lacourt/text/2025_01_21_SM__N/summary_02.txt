And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the motion of the defendants, Yuan Shi, AI List Capital 1, LLP, and AI List Capital GP I, LLC, to quash deposition subpoenas served on various banks and companies, seeking financial records to prove unjust enrichment. The court finds that the subpoenas were properly served, despite the defendants' claims that they were not. The court also finds that the financial information sought is relevant to the plaintiff's claim and is not privileged or sensitive. The court cites GT, Inc. v. Superior Court (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 748, 754, which states that where financial information goes to the heart of the cause of action, a litigant should not be denied access to the information. Therefore, the motion is denied, and the defendants are ordered to comply with the subpoenas.
