And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Aaron Celious to the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Nisha Shah. The Court has overruled Celious's demurrer to the first cause of action for trade libel, finding that Shah has properly stated a claim. The Court has also overruled Celious's demurrer to the second cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations, finding that Shah has alleged valid and enforceable contracts between her and third parties, and that Maroon Society, Inc. (of which Celious is a principal) acted to interfere with those relationships. Finally, the Court has overruled Celious's demurrer to the fourth cause of action for unfair business practices, finding that Shah has alleged a campaign by Maroon Society, Inc. and Celious to make false statements to third parties so they would not do business with Shah. The Court has ordered Celious to file and serve an answer to the Cross-Complaint within 10 days of the entry of this order.
