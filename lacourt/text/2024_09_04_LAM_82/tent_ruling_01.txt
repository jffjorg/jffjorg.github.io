[Tentative] Order Granting Applications
for Writs of Possession
 
INTRODUCTION
 
Plaintiff Primera Financial Corp. (“Plaintiff”)
moves for writs of possession against Defendant Angie A. Garcia and Kailah S.
Jimenez (collectively, “Defendants”) over the following property: 2008 Jeep
Wrangler, motor vehicle, Vehicle Identification Number 1J4GA391X8L519361 (the
“Vehicle”).  No oppositions to the applications have been filed by either Defendant.  Because Plaintiff satisfies all statutory
requirements, the writs of possession are granted.    
             
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
“Upon the filing
of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to
this article for a right to attach order and a writ of attachment by filing an
application for the order and writ with the court in which the action is
brought.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 484.010.)  “The Attachment Law statutes are subject to
strict construction.” (Epstein
v. Abrams (1997) 57
Cal.App.4th 1159, 1168.)  
 
“Except as otherwise
provided by statute, an attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim
or claims for money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or
implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily
ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of
costs, interest, and attorney's fees.” 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 483.010.)  The court shall issue a right to attach order if the court
finds all of the following: 
 
(1)   The claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon
which an attachment may be issued. 
 
(2)   The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
claim upon which the attachment is based. 
 
(3)   The attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the
recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based. 
 
(4)   The amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than
zero.  
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 484.090.)  
 
“A claim has ‘probable
validity’ where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a
judgment against the defendant on that claim.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
481.190.)    “The application
shall be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts
presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.” ¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 484.030.)¿“In contested applications,
the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective
parties and make a determination of¿the probable outcome of the
litigation.”¿  (Hobbs v. Weiss (1999)
73 Cal.App.4th 76, 80.)  
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 482.040 states in pertinent part: “The facts stated in each affidavit
filed pursuant to this title shall be set forth with particularity. Except
where matters are specifically permitted by this title to be shown by
information and belief, each affidavit shall show affirmatively that the affiant,
if sworn as a witness, can testify competently to the facts stated therein. As
to matters shown by information and belief, the affidavit shall state the facts
on which the affiant's belief is based, showing the nature of his information
and the reliability of his informant. The affiant may be any person, whether or
not a party to the action, who has knowledge of the facts.”  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            A.        Notice – Plaintiff has provided proper
notice.  
 
            B.        Probable Validity of Plaintiff’s Claims –
Plaintiff seeks a writ of possession based on its claim for money on a
contract.  On or about March 31, 2021,
Defendants entered into a Retail Installment Sale Contract (the “Contract”)
with Plaintiff’s assignor to purchase the Vehicle.  (Alonso Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, Exh. A-C.)  Plaintiff submits evidence that the Contract
was assigned to Plaintiff.  (Id. ¶ 4 and
Exh. B.)  Defendants defaulted on the
Contract by failing to make payments when due, and there is a balance due of $9,320.03.  (Id. ¶ 5, Exh. C.)  This establishes that Plaintiff likely will
prevail on the claim.
 
C.        Wrongful
Detention – Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
512.010(b)(2), the application must include “a showing that the property is
wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the manner in which the defendant came
into possession of the property, and, according to the best knowledge,
information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the reason for the detention.”  Under the Contract, Plaintiff has the right
to repossess the Vehicle in the event of default.  (Alonso Decl. Exh. A.)  Plaintiff has demanded that Defendants
surrender the Vehicle.  (Id. ¶ 5.)
 Thus, Plaintiff
has made a showing that Defendants have wrongfully detained the Vehicle.
 
D.        Description
and Value of Property – Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
512.010(b)(3), the application must include a particular description of the
property and a statement of its value.  Plaintiff
has satisfied this requirement by providing the make/model and VIN number of
the vehicle, as well as a statement as to its value.  
 
E.         Statutory
Statement
 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b)(5), Plaintiff must provide a statement
that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant
to statute and has not been seized under an execution against the Plaintiff’s
property. Plaintiff has satisfied this requirement.
 
F.         Probable
Location of the Vehicle 
 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b)(4), Plaintiff must identify the probable location of the vehicle and establish “probable cause” to that
effect.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
512.010(b)(4), 512.080.)  Plaintiff seeks
a writ of possession directing the levying officer to take the Vehicle from
real property located at the following two addresses: (1) 324 E 219th Street
Carson, California 90745; and (2) 1503 Locust Avenue #A, Long Beach, California
90813 (Appl. ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff has met
that burden with respect to both addresses. 
(See Alonso Decl. ¶ 10 and Exh. A-C; see also Proofs of Service filed June 24 and August 12, 2024.)
 
G.        Undertaking
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 515.010 requires an undertaking to be
filed before the writ issues in the amount of “not less than twice the value of
the defendant’s interest in the property.” 
Section
515.010(a) states that the value of the defendant’s interest “is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.”
 
Plaintiff submits
evidence that there is a balance due of $9,320.03 on the
Contract, and that the wholesale and retail values of the Vehicle are $10,502
and $12,313, respectively.  (Alonso ¶ 5,
Exh. C.)   Based upon this potential
value, Defendants have an interest in the vehicle between $1,181.97 and
$2,992.97.  Accordingly, the court
estimates that each defendant’s interest in the vehicle is $2,000.  Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
515.010, the court orders Plaintiff to post an undertaking in the total amount
of $4,000 for each writ of possession.  
  
H.        Turnover Order
 
Plaintiff appears to request a turnover order.  (See Memorandum 2:17-22.)  Section 512.070 states: “If a writ of possession
is issued, the court may also issue an order directing the defendant to
transfer possession of the property to the plaintiff. Such order shall contain
a notice to the defendant that failure to turn over possession of such property
to plaintiff may subject the defendant to being held in contempt of
court.”  “Thus a ‘turnover’ order, issued
pursuant to section 512.070, is not a
separate remedy but rather an alternative means of enforcing a writ of possession.”  (Edwards
v. Superior Court (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173, 178.)  Because Plaintiff has satisfied all of the
requirements for writs of possession, the court also issues turnover
orders.  
 
I.          Oral
Evidence 
 
            Plaintiff does not show
good cause for the court to take oral evidence at the hearing.  (See Memorandum 3.)  The request for oral testimony is denied. 
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER  
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The applications
for writs of possession of the Vehicle are granted with respect to the
following addresses:  (1) 324 E 219th
Street Carson, California 90745; and (2) 1503 Locust Avenue #A, Long Beach, California
90813.  
 
            2.         The court issues a turnover order
associated with each writ.
 
            3.         The court orders Plaintiff to post an
undertaking in the amount of $4,000 for each writ.
 
            4.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall prepare and
lodge proposed orders.  
 
            5.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
