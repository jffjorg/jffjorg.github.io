Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike in a personal injury lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed by Luis Arellano against Shane Goodman and Terry Goodman for alleged negligence and punitive damages. The Judge has ruled that the demurrer is overruled, but the motion to strike is granted in its entirety. The Judge has also granted Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint. The Judge's ruling is based on the parties' failure to meet and confer before filing the demurrer and motion to strike, as well as the lack of sufficient factual allegations to support an award of punitive damages.
