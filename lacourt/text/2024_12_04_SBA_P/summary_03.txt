Case Summary:
The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel binding arbitration and stay proceedings. The plaintiffs, Brenden Dunn and Ashlee Dunn, filed a complaint against Tesla Motors, Inc., alleging five causes of action for violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The defendant argues that the plaintiffs consented to the terms of an online Motor Vehicle Order Agreement, which included an arbitration provision. The court finds that the defendant has met its burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties and that the language of the provision is broad enough to cover the dispute at hand. The court also finds that the arbitration agreement is not procedurally or substantively unconscionable. As a result, the court grants the defendant's motion to compel binding arbitration and stays the action pending conclusion of the arbitration proceedings.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has ruled in favor of Tesla Motors, Inc.'s motion to force Brenden Dunn and Ashlee Dunn to arbitrate their disputes instead of going to court. The plaintiffs had filed a lawsuit against Tesla alleging that the company had violated California law by failing to repair defects in their vehicle. Tesla argued that the plaintiffs had agreed to arbitrate their disputes when they signed an online agreement when they purchased the vehicle. The judge found that Tesla had met its burden of proof in showing that the arbitration agreement was valid and that it covered the dispute at hand. The judge also found that the arbitration agreement was not unfair or oppressive, and therefore, the court granted Tesla's motion to compel arbitration and stayed the lawsuit pending the outcome of the arbitration.
