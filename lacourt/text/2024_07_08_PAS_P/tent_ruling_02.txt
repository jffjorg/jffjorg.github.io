INTRODUCTION
            This case
arises from a trip and fall incident on a public sidewalk raised by the growth
of a nearby tree.  On April 22, 2022,
Plaintiff Houry Sevani (“Plaintiff”) sustained a fractured hand and wrist among
other injuries due to this fall. 
            Procedural
Background
On January 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed
suit against Defendant City of Pasadena (“Defendant”) for the following two
causes of action: (1) negligence under Gov. Code §§ 815.2, 820), and (2)
dangerous condition of public property under Gov. Code § 835.
            On February
9, 2023, Plaintiff filed the first amended complaint removing the first cause
of action for negligence.
            On March
27, 2023, Defendant filed a cross-complaint against Street Retail West, 6 L.P.,
a limited partnership (“Cross-Defendant”), and ROES 1 to 20, inclusive for
three causes of action: (1) indemnity, (2) apportionment of fault, and (3)
declaratory relief.
On June 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
four instant motions, moving the Court to compel Cross-Defendant’s discovery
responses. Plaintiff also concurrently filed a Request for Monetary Sanctions,
the Declaration of Ruben Vardanyan, esq. (the “Vardanyan Decl.”), and notice of
the instant motion.
As of July 5, 2024, no opposition
has been filed.
On June 10, 2024, the Court advanced
the July 30, 2024, hearings on the instant motions to July 8, 2024.
Trial is set for January 28, 2025.
Discovery Requests
On November 13, 2023, Plaintiff
served Cross-Defendant by e-Service:
1.     an
initial set of written discovery, which included inter alia Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One, (collectively
the “Interrogatories”); and
2.    
an initial set
of written discovery, which included inter alia Requests for Admission Admitted,
Set One (“RFAs”)
3.    
an initial set
of written discovery, which included inter alia Production Requests of
Documents (Set One) (the “Production Request”) (collectively, the “Discovery
Requests”)
4.    
a request to pay
sanctions of $900.00 in connection with Plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and costs
of filing of this motion.
(Motion to Compel Special Interrogatories, p. 3.)
 
Cross-Defendant’s deadline to respond to all requested discovery was on
or before December 18, 2023. (Vardyan Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff agreed to
Cross-Defendant’s 4-week extension request, setting the new response deadline for
January 16, 2024. (Id. ¶ 3.) By February 1, 2024, upon receiving no
response, Plaintiff inquired about the status of discovery and received no
response. (Id., ¶ 4.) Over the next six months, the parties exchanged
correspondence, finally a compliance date of May 23, 2024. (Id., ¶¶ 5-12.;
Exhs., 2-4.)
To date, the Court is not aware of
any further meet or confer efforts or any further document production on behalf
of Defendant. The Court considers the instant motion on the understanding that
no further efforts have occurred and no further document production, or
responses, have been received.

LEGAL
STANDARD
A.   
Law
Governing Interrogatories
Code Civ. Proc. Section 2030.290 provides
that when a party to whom interrogatories has been propounded fails to serve a
timely response, that party waives any objection to the interrogatories; it
further provides that the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
response to the interrogatory. Subdivision (c) provides for monetary sanctions
in connection with such motion. (CCP § 2030.290.)
“The party to whom interrogatories
have been propounded shall respond in writing under oath separately to each
interrogatory by any of the following: (1) An answer containing the information
sought to be discovered. (2) An exercise of the party's option to produce
writings. (3) An objection to the particular interrogatory.”¿ CCP §
2030.210(a).¿ “If the responding party does not have personal knowledge
sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but
shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by
inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where the information
is equally available to the propounding party.”¿ CCP § 2030.220(c). 
“On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. (2)
An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3)
An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.”¿ CCP §
2030.300(a).  “A motion under subdivision
(a) [of CCP § 2030.300] shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040.”¿ CCP § 2030.300(b).¿ In addition, a separate statement
is required.¿ CRC 3.1345(a)(2). 
“Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories.”¿ CCP § 2030.300(c). 
“[T]he time limitations set forth…[are] mandatory and [when] not met,
the trial court's order is in excess of its jurisdiction.”¿ Vidal Sassoon,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.)
 
B.   
Law
Governing Requests for Production
“Any party may obtain discovery by
inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling documents, tangible things, land or
other property, and electronically stored information in the possession,
custody, or control of any other party to the action.” (CCP § 2031.010.) “If a
deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena,
the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that
answer or production.” (CCP § 2025.480(a).)
 
C.   
Mandatory
Sanctions – Interrogatories & Requests for Production of Documents
Sanctions are mandatory in
connection with motions to compel responses to interrogatories and requests for
production of documents against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c),
2031.300(c).) However, sanctions are not mandatory if the court “finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Id.)
Furthermore, regardless of the
reason for the delay in responding, monetary sanctions are mandatory against a
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response
necessitated the filing of the deemed-admitted motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280(c).)
 
D.   
Law
Governing Requests for Admission
Where there has
been no timely response to a request for admission under CCP § 2033.010, the
propounding party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction.  (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) 
The party who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand,
unless the court grants that party relief from the waiver, upon a showing that
the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and
(2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds.
(a)(1)-(2).)  The court “shall” grant a
motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)

ANALYSIS
A.   
Interrogatories and Production Request 
On November 13,
2023, Cross-Defendant was served with Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set
One, containing 88 specially prepared interrogatories. (Vardanyan Decl. ¶¶ 2-,
5.). Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories (Set One) focused on Cross-Defendant’s
contentions as to issues of liability and causation of the incident, ownership
and maintenance of the premises where Plaintiff was injured, and information at
Cross-Defendant’s disposal at the time of the incident which could have and
would have alerted Cross-Defendant to the defect on its property. (Motion to
Compel Form Interrogatory Responses, p. 5.) The scope of discovery requested
through Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents (Set One) was identical
to that of Form Interrogatories. (Motion to Compel Production of Document
Responses, p. 5.)
Here, Plaintiff
moves the Court to issue orders compelling Cross-Defendant to produce responses
to Plaintiff’s Interrogatories and Production Requests. As discussed above,
Cross-Defendant’s deadline to respond to the Interrogatories and Production
Requests expired on December 18, 2023. The parties attempted to meet and confer
numerous times and extended this deadline until May 23, 2024. At the filing of
the instant motion on June 4, 2024, Cross-Defendant had not yet served any
responses. (Vardanyan Decl. ¶ 13.).
 B.   Requests for Monetary Sanctions are Granted.    Plaintiff moves the Court to impose
monetary sanctions against Cross-Defendant in the total amount of $3,600 ($900 x
4 motions). Plaintiff asks the Court to impose sanctions because Plaintiff has "made every possible effort to allow Cross-Defendant to provide even the most basic discovery responses.  They have not." (Vardanyan Decl. p. 9).  Plaintiff's counsel declares that his hourly rate is $300, which the Court finds reasonable.  Counsel indicates that he expended three hours on each motion, which included meet and confer efforts.  Unless informed otherwise, the Court assumes that each meet and confer effort involved all four discovery motions.  If so, including time for meet and confer on all four motions could constitute overbilling.  Therefore, the Court finds that two hours per motion is sufficient and awards Plaintiff sanctions in the amount of $2,400.         C.   
Requests for Admissions are Deemed Admitted
Plaintiff propounded requests for
admission (“RFAs”), Set One, on Cross-Defendant on November 13, 2023. After
receiving no response, Plaintiff’s counsel commenced lengthy correspondence
with Cross-Defendant, accepting their initial extension request and extending
the deadline of responses due until May 23, 2024. To date, Cross-Defendant has
not filed any responses. Therefore, Defendant seeks an order deeming RFAs
admitted.
Where there has been no timely
response to a request for admission under CCP § 2033.010, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction.  (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who
failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants
that party relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has
subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the
party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect.  (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The
court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless
it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed
has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the
requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
As of July 5, 2024, Cross-Defendant
has not filed any opposition to the motion, nor has Cross-Defendant otherwise
demonstrated that a response to the RFAs were served in substantial compliance
with Section 2033.220 before the hearing. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s RFAs, Set
One, is deemed admitted against Cross-Defendant. (CCP §2033.280(b).)
