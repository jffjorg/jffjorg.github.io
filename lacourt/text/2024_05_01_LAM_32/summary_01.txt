Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, in its motion to exclude the plaintiffs' expert witnesses from testifying at trial or alternatively, to compel them to appear for deposition. The plaintiffs failed to produce their designated experts, Dr. Richard Semelka and Dr. Jenaya Calderilla, for deposition on March 28, 2024, despite serving deposition notices and failing to object to them. The court has ordered the plaintiffs to produce the experts for deposition within 20 days of this order, and has sanctioned the plaintiffs in the amount of $735, plus a $60 filing fee, to be paid within 30 days of this order.
