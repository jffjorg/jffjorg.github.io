     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant children’s hospital of los
  angeles’ motion to exclude witnesses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 27, 2022, Plaintiffs filed
this medical malpractice action on behalf of their deceased son, who died after
several MRI scans. Plaintiffs allege that Decedent was improperly exposed to
the chemical gadolinium throughout the course of the MRIs, resulting in severe
burns, health complications, and eventually death. Plaintiffs allege that
Decedent had a history of hypersensitivity to gadolinium and that Defendants
were put on notice of Decedent’s condition and should have been aware of the
risks of gadolinium exposure in children. The complaint alleges causes of
action for (1) medical malpractice, (2) medical malpractice-lack of informed
consent, (3) medical battery, and (4) a survival action. 
            On April 2, 2024, Defendant
Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles filed the instant motion to exclude
Plaintiffs’ expert witnesses from testifying at trial or alternatively, for an
order compelling the experts to appear for deposition.  Plaintiffs have not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“If, after service of a deposition notice,
a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document … described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document … described in the deposition
notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(a).)
“Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery” constitutes a “misuse[] of the discovery
process.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010(d).) The court is authorized to impose
monetary, issue, or evidence sanctions against a party engaging in misuse of
the discovery process. (Id., § 2023.030.)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiffs’ March 4, 2024 expert
designation identifies Richard Semelka, MD and Jenaya Calderilla, DO. (Kjar
Decl., Ex. A.) Accordingly, on March 5, 2024, Defendant served notices for the
depositions of Drs. Semelka and Calderilla to take place on March 28, 2024. (Id.,
¶ 5, Ex. B.) Plaintiffs did not object to the deposition notices yet failed to
produce the experts for deposition on March 28, 2024. (Id., ¶¶ 6-10.) 
            Plaintiffs are ordered to produce
their experts for deposition within 20 days of this order. If Plaintiffs fail
to abide by this order, the experts will be precluded from testifying at trial.
Sanctions are warranted as Plaintiffs have provided no substantial
justification for the failure to produce their own designated experts for
deposition. Given the simplicity of the motion and lack of opposition, the
Court awards $735, representing 3 hours at $225 per hour (see Kjar Decl. ¶ 11),
plus a $60 filing fee. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Children’s Hospital of Los
Angeles’ motion is GRANTED in part. Evidentiary sanctions are denied at this
stage, however Plaintiffs are ordered to produce Drs. Semelka and Calderilla
for deposition within 20 days of this order. The Court sanctions Plaintiffs in
the total amount of $735, to be paid within 30 days of this order.
