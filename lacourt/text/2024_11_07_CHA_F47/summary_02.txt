And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants. The motion was filed by the defendants, Fortune Energy, Inc., Fortune Energy Distribution, Inc., Fortune Energy Distribution Corp., and F.E. Distribution Inc., seeking an order granting summary judgment in their favor and against the plaintiff, Southwest Marine and General Insurance Company, on the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint.

The judge found that a triable issue of material fact exists regarding the existence of a contract (the Customs Bond) between the parties, which was renewed annually as long as the defendant paid the bond premium. The judge also found that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendants must reimburse the plaintiff for the sums paid by the plaintiff on behalf of the defendants.

The judge further found that the defendants failed to properly support their argument that the plaintiff cannot establish the contract element of their claims, and that the evidence presented by the plaintiff establishes that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendants must reimburse the plaintiff for the sums paid by the plaintiff on behalf of the defendants.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for summary judgment is denied, and that the case will proceed to trial.
