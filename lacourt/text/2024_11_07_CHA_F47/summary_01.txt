And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by attorney Masoud Masjedi on behalf of defendant Yana Mirghaffari. The motion was filed electronically on April 2, 2024, and served on four email addresses, including one email address of record for opposing counsel and another email address for another attorney in opposing counsel's office. However, it is unclear who the other two email addresses belong to, and the proof of service does not show service on the client at the street address listed in the notice of motion. Additionally, no declaration in support of the motion has been filed with the court. Due to these deficiencies, the judge has placed the motion off calendar and denied it.
