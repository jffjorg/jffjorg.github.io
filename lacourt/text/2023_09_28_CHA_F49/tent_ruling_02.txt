SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
April 28, 2021, plaintiff Chad Perrigo was involved in a motorcycle-truck collision
with defendant Jorge Edmondo Castaneda Rodriguez. Plaintiff alleges Rodriguez
was operating his vehicle on behalf of defendants MonteCristo Trucking, LLC,
Fernando Escolero, and Fames Transport, Inc. for the United States Postal
Service.
 
On
May 28, 2021, the Perrigos filed their complaint for motor vehicle, general
negligence, and loss of consortium. On June 21, 2021, the Perrigos filed a
first amended complaint (21STCV20196).
 
On
June 18, 2021, County of Los Angeles filed a complaint against Jorge Edmondo
Castaneda Rodriguez, MonteCristo Trucking, LLC, Fernando Escolero, and Fames
Transport, Inc. dba Nevada Fames Transport, Inc. for motor vehicle
(21STCV22844). 
 
On
September 8, 2021, the court deemed Perrigo, et al. v. Rodriguez, et al.,
21STCV20196 related to 21STCV22844. 
 
On
January 20, 2022, the court granted the Perrigos’ motion for leave to file a
second amended complaint. On February 7, 2022, the Perrigos filed their second
amended complaint for negligence, negligent entrustment, negligent hiring,
supervision and retention, dangerous condition of public property, and loss of
consortium. Plaintiffs also added the State of California and City of Santa
Clarita as defendants.
 
On
March 1, 2022, the court consolidated the actions. On March 10, 2022, the court
granted the motion to transfer the consolidated actions. On March 11, 2022, the
court transferred the action from Department 32 to Department 47. On March 29,
2022, Plaintiff County of Los Angeles filed peremptory challenge to Department
47. The action was assigned to Department 49 on March 30, 2022. 
 
On
April 8, 2022, the City of Santa Clarita filed a cross-complaint against Jorge
Edmondo Castaneda Rodriguez, MonteCristo Trucking, LLC, Fernando Escolero, and
Fames Transport, Inc. for implied equitable indemnity,
contribution/apportionment, and declaratory relief. On May 4, 2022, Plaintiff
dismissed the State of California.
 
On
March 28, 2023, the court granted Plaintiffs unopposed motion for leave to file
a third amended complaint in order to add new defendant Ridge Transport, Inc.,
as well as new allegations against existing defendants Fames Transport, Inc.,
MonteCristo Trucking, LLC, and Castaneda. The third amended complaint was filed
on March 30, 2023 for negligence, negligent entrustment, negligent hiring,
supervision and retention, dangerous condition of public property, and loss of
consortium
 
RULING: Granted
Defendant
City of Santa Clarita moves for summary judgment and alternatively summary
adjudication to the fourth and fifth cause of action for Dangerous Condition of
Public Property and Loss of Consortium on grounds that the location of
collision in no way constitutes a dangerous condition in that the City of Santa
Clarita in no way created any dangerous condition, and lacked notice of any
such alleged condition. City of Santa Clarita also maintains it is immune from
liability. The loss of consortium claim also fails due to the lack of
underlying liability. City of Santa Clarita is only named in the fourth and
fifth causes of action. 
 
Plaintiffs
Chad and Alexa Perrigo submitted a notice of non-opposition to the motion, and
stipulate that the City of Santa Clarita “did not create the alleged dangerous
condition; (2) the City did not have actual or constructive notice of any
alleged dangerous condition; and (3) there is no negligent or wrongful act or
omission of an employee of the City within the scope of employment that created
the alleged dangerous condition.” City of Santa Clarita also filed a notice of
non-opposition with an attached copy of Plaintiffs’ notice of non-opposition.
 
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)  
 
The
court finds City of Santa Clarita shifts the burden regarding the denial of any
creation of a dangerous condition; the City lacked actual or constructive
notice of any alleged dangerous condition; and no negligent or wrongful act or
omission of an employee of the City within the scope of employment created the
alleged dangerous condition. [Declaration of Robert Theiring, Compendium of
Exhibits, Declaration of Andrew Adams.] (Gov. Code, §
830, 830.4, 830.8, 835, 835.2; Rodriguez
v. Bethlehem Steel Corp. (1974) 12 Cal.3d 382, 408.) Plaintiffs submit no
opposition, concede to the merits, and therefore fail to raise any triable
issues of material fact. The motion for summary judgment as to the fourth and
fifth causes of action is therefore granted.
 
Trial
