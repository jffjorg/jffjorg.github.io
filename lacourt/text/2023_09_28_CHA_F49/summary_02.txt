And here is the summary in English text:

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The City of Santa Clarita moves for summary judgment and summary adjudication on the fourth and fifth causes of action (Dangerous Condition of Public Property and Loss of Consortium) against Chad Perrigo and his wife, Alexa. The City argues that it did not create a dangerous condition on public property, had no notice of the alleged condition, and that there was no negligent or wrongful act or omission by an employee within the scope of employment.

The court finds that the City has met its burden of showing that there are no triable issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Plaintiffs have submitted no opposition and concede to the merits, failing to raise any triable issues of material fact.

As a result, the motion for summary judgment is granted, and the trial currently set for June 24, 2024, is no longer necessary. The City is to give notice to all parties.
