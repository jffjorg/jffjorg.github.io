Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The City of Santa Clarita moves for summary judgment and summary adjudication on the fourth and fifth causes of action (Dangerous Condition of Public Property and Loss of Consortium) against Chad Perrigo and his wife, Alexa. The City argues that it did not create a dangerous condition on public property, had no notice of the alleged condition, and that there was no negligent or wrongful act or omission by an employee within the scope of employment.

The court finds that the City has met its burden of showing that there are no triable issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Plaintiffs have submitted no opposition and concede to the merits, failing to raise any triable issues of material fact.

As a result, the motion for summary judgment is granted, and the trial currently set for June 24, 2024, is no longer necessary. The City is to give notice to all parties.

## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the City of Santa Clarita's motion for summary judgment.  This means the judge finds no factual dispute that would require a trial.

The City of Santa Clarita argues it shouldn't be liable because it didn't create the dangerous condition where the motorcycle collision occurred, it didn't know about the condition, and it has legal immunity. The Perrigos, who are suing the City, have agreed with the City's arguments and not disputed them.  

Because of this, the judge finds there is no need for a trial and will dismiss the City of Santa Clarita from the case.

The City of Santa Clarita has moved for summary judgment and summary adjudication on the fourth and fifth causes of action (dangerous condition of public property and loss of consortium) against the Perrigos. The City argues that it did not create any dangerous condition on the road, had no notice of any alleged dangerous condition, and that no employee of the City was negligent or wrongfully acted in a way that created the alleged dangerous condition. The Perrigos have submitted a notice of non-opposition to the motion, conceding to the merits and failing to raise any triable issues of material fact. The court has found that the City has shifted the burden to the Perrigos to show that a triable issue of material fact exists, and the Perrigos have failed to do so. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication is granted.
