And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the City of San Fernando. The City is seeking to dismiss the complaint filed by Maria Villalvazo, who tripped and fell on an uneven portion of sidewalk pavement outside the City of San Fernando's jurisdictional boundary. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the City of San Fernando's argument that the location is outside its jurisdiction is valid, and the court has given the plaintiff 15 days to amend the complaint. The judge has also granted the plaintiff leave to allege a claim seeking to establish jurisdiction within the City of San Fernando based on the claim that the assessor parcel number of the identified property straddles both the City of Los Angeles and the City of San Fernando.
