**English Text Summary:**


The court has issued a tentative ruling in a case where Maria Villalvazo sued the City of San Fernando for negligence after she tripped and fell on a sidewalk.  The City argued that it wasn't liable because the incident happened outside its jurisdictional boundaries. The court agreed and sustained the City's demurrer (a legal objection).

However, the court gave Villalvazo 15 days to amend her complaint.  The court acknowledged that Villalvazo might be able to argue that the "adjacent" property where the incident occurred, though the specific address is outside San Fernando's jurisdiction, straddles the boundary.  The court will only allow Villalvazo to amend her complaint if she can establish jurisdiction based on this "adjacent" property argument and not by simply changing the address.  Any attempt to do so might be considered a "sham pleading" and subject to further legal objection.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the City of San Fernando's demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the trip and fall occurred on or near a sidewalk outside the City of San Fernando's jurisdictional boundary. The plaintiff, Maria Villalvazo, argues that the public record is clear that the property where the trip and fall occurred is within the City of San Fernando's jurisdiction. However, the judge has taken judicial notice that the address of 13811 Del Sur Street, where the trip and fall occurred, is outside the City of San Fernando's jurisdiction. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's allegations do not establish a claim for liability against the City of San Fernando based on a location outside its own jurisdictional boundary. The judge has granted the plaintiff 15 days to amend the complaint to allege a claim seeking to establish jurisdiction within the City of San Fernando based on the assessor parcel number of the identified property.

location: 13811 Del Sur Street
- date: February 7, 2023
event: Plaintiff filed a complaint for Governmental Tort Liability, Negligence, and Premises Liability
- date: March 20, 2023
event: Defendant answered the complaint

- grants plaintiff 15 days leave to amend
- grants request for judicial notice

facts:
- the address of 13811 Del Sur Street falls outside the jurisdictional boundary of the City of San Fernando
- the trip and fall occurred on or near pavement outside the City of San Fernando jurisdictional boundary

disputes:
- plaintiff challenges any finding via demurrer on a "disputed" fact
- plaintiff argues that the property where the trip and fall occurred is within the City of San Fernando

laws:
- Government Code, § 835, subd. (a): Plaintiff cannot state a claim for liability against City of San Fernando based on a location outside its own jurisdictional boundary

summary:
The court sustains defendant's demurrer and grants plaintiff 15 days leave to amend. The court grants plaintiff leave only for purposes of alleging a claim seeking to establish jurisdiction within the City of San Fernando based on the claim that the assessor parcel number of the identified property straddles both the City of Los Angeles and the City of San Fernando. The court makes this conclusion on the basis that it lacks an ability to verify the assessor parcel boundary notwithstanding the acceptance of the map contained in the request for judicial notice establishing the address boundary outside City of San Fernando, and the allegations in the complaint. Any material changes to the operative complaint seeking to alter the address of the location in order to place the location into the City of San Fernando on an otherwise geographically established location outside the City of San Fernando may be subject to a demurrer under the sham pleading standard.
