And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to vacate the order enforcing the settlement agreement. The defendant, Lashon Bundy, had argued that the order was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, but the judge found no basis for this claim. The judge also noted that the defendant was represented by counsel at the time of the hearing and the entry of the order, and that a mere assertion of mistake or disagreement with the order does not render the order subject to a finding of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Additionally, the judge ruled that the defendant's motion was untimely and improper, as any relief sought would be a reconsideration of the order rather than a challenge to the underlying judgment. The judge denied the defendant's request for attorney fees and ordered that the defendant give notice of the ruling.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion filed by Lashon Bundy, the defendant, to vacate the order enforcing the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement required the property at 15156 Kingsbury St., Mission Hills, to be listed for sale, and the appointment of an elisor to facilitate the sale. Lashon Bundy claims that the order was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, but the court finds no basis for this claim. The court notes that Lashon Bundy was represented by counsel at the time of the hearing and entry of the order, and that a mere assertion of a different understanding or disagreement with the order is not sufficient to establish a basis for relief. The court also finds that the motion lacks any new facts or change in law, and that a disagreement with a prior court order does not support relief. The court declines to consider any and all relief sought in the impending hearing and only addresses the item before the court.
