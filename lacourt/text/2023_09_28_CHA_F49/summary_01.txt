And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to vacate the order enforcing the settlement agreement. The defendant, Lashon Bundy, had argued that the order was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, but the judge found no basis for this claim. The judge also noted that the defendant was represented by counsel at the time of the hearing and the entry of the order, and that a mere assertion of mistake or disagreement with the order does not render the order subject to a finding of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Additionally, the judge ruled that the defendant's motion was untimely and improper, as any relief sought would be a reconsideration of the order rather than a challenge to the underlying judgment. The judge denied the defendant's request for attorney fees and ordered that the defendant give notice of the ruling.
