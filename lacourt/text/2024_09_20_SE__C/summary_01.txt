And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, in a tentative ruling, has denied the Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application to advance the hearing date on the Motion to Compel Responses or continue trial. The Judge found that the Declaration attached to the Ex Parte Application does not satisfy the notice requirements set forth by CRC Rule 3.1204(b) and that the Plaintiff's Counsel did not state that any attempt was made to notify the Defendants of the ex parte hearing. Despite this, the Judge has advanced the Motion to Compel Responses from May 15, 2025 to today's date and continued it to December 5, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. The Plaintiff's Counsel is required to give notice to the Defendants and to file and serve opposition and reply papers in accordance with the new hearing date.
