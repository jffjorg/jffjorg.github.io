And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the defendant's ex parte application to advance the hearing on their motion to compel the plaintiff to produce their cellular device for inspection. The defendant argues that they will be irreparably harmed if the hearing is not advanced, as the evidence on the plaintiff's device may be lost or destroyed before they can download and preserve it. As a result, the hearing on the defendant's motion to compel has been advanced from May 13, 2025 to November 12, 2024, and is now set for 9:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. The plaintiff must file and serve opposition and reply papers by the new hearing date.
