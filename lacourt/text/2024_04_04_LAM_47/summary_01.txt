Summary:

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling granting defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissing all defendants with prejudice. The motion was filed by Planet Home Lending, LLC and Wilmington Savings Fund Society FSB, and argued that all of plaintiff Roseanne Smith's claims are barred by the court's prior ruling deeming the truth of matters stated in requests for admissions as admitted. The court found that plaintiff's claims for wrongful foreclosure, unfair competition, and cancellation of written instrument are based on the invalidity of the Notice of Default and Notice of Sale, and that these claims must fail with the underlying Homeowner's Bill of Rights (HBOR) causes of action. The court also denied plaintiff's request for leave to amend the pleadings, finding that the defects in the pleadings cannot be cured by amendment.
