Legal Standard
 
A motion for judgment on the
pleadings is the functional equivalent of a general demurrer.  (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic
Indemnity Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198).  Like demurrers, motions for judgment on the
pleadings challenge the legal sufficiency of the allegations, not their
veracity.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994). Any defects must either appear on the
face of the pleading, or else be taken by judicial notice.  (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th
316, 321-22).  The parties’ ability to
prove their respective claims is of no concern. 
(Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995,
99.)  Though the Court must accept the
allegations of the complaint and answer as true (Gerawan Farming, Inc. v.
Lyons (2000) 24 Cal.4th 468, 515), it will not do so for “conclusions of
law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to law or
[judicially noticed] facts…” (Stevenson Real Estate Servs., Inc. v. CB
Richard Ellis Real Estate Servs., Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1219-20).
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a motion for judgment
on the pleadings, the moving party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who has filed the pleading subject to the motion for
judgment on the pleadings and file a declaration detailing their meet and
confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 439(a).) However, an insufficient
meet and confer process is not grounds to grant or deny a motion for
judgment on the pleadings. (Code Civ. Proc., § 439(a)(4).)
 
The Declaration of Kelsey Luu,
attorney for Defendants, states that Defendants’ counsel attempted to contact
Plaintiff through her counsel via email on October 11, 2023 and October 31,
2023, but received no response. (Declaration of Kelsey Luu ISO Mot. ¶¶ 9-10.)  The Court therefore finds that Defendants have
satisfied their statutory meet and confer obligations. 
 
Timing
 
           A
motion for judgment on the pleadings may be brought by a defendant at any time
after the time to demur has expired and an answer has been filed. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 438(f)). Unless a court orders otherwise, a motion for judgment on the
pleadings may not be made after entry of a pre-trial conference order, (Cal.
Rules of Court 3.720-3.730) or 30 days before the initial trial date, whichever
is later. (Code Civ. Proc. § 438(e). No pre-trial conference order was entered
in this case, and the motion was filed more than 30 days before the initial
trial date.
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
           Defendants
request that the Court take judicial notice of (1) a Deed of Trust recorded in
the Official Records of Los Angeles County on July 25, 2019 as Instrument
Number 20190730107; (2) an Assignment of Deed of Trust recorded in the Official
Records of Los Angeles County on July 25, 2019 as Instrument Number 20190730108;
(3) an Assignment of Deed of Trust recorded in the Official Records of Los
Angeles County on May 6, 2021 as Instrument Number 20210728089; (4) a Substitution
of Trustee recorded in the Official Records of Los Angeles County on May 25,
2021 as Instrument Number 20210834598; (5) a Notice of Default and Election to
Sell under Deed of Trust recorded in the Official Records of Los Angeles County
on May 25, 2021 as Instrument Number 20210834599; (6) a Notice of Trustee’s
Sale recorded in the Official Records of Los Angeles County on September 22,
2021 as Instrument Number 2021443498; (7) Defendants’ Notice of Motion and
Motion for Order Establishing Admissions of Plaintiff, Request for Monetary
Sanctions; Memorandum of Points and Authorities;  and Declaration of Crystal R. Davieau filed in
this case on May 25, 2023; (8) the Bankruptcy Court docket for the Case Name: In
Re Roseanne Smith, Case Number 2:21-bk-18443-NB, filed in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California; (9) a Trustee’s Deed
upon Sale recorded in the Official Records of Los Angeles County on March 3,
2022 as Instrument Number 20220245679; and (10) the Notice of Ruling on
Defendants’ Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Special Interrogatories
and Motion for Order Establishing Admissions of Plaintiff filed in this case on
August 29, 2023.
 
           Defendants’
Requests Nos. 1 through 6 and No. 9 are GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code
section 452(h) as official records of the County Reporter. (Evid. Code §
452(h); see also McElroy v. Chase Manhattan Mortg. Co. (2005) 134
Cal.App.4th 388, 394.) Defendants’ Requests nos. 7, 8, and 10 are GRANTED
pursuant to Evidence Code section 452(d) (court records). 
 
 
Analysis
 
            Defendants
move for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that all of Plaintiff’s claims
are defeated as a consequence of the Court’s August 29, 2023 order deeming the
truth of the matters stated in Defendants’ Requests for Admissions as admitted.

 
            Plaintiff
alleged violations of Civil Code sections 2923.5; 2923.6(c); 2923.7, 2924.9,
and 2924.10, asserting that the Notice of Default recorded on May 25, 2021 and
Notice of Trustee’s Sale recorded on August 22, 2021 against the subject
property violated these provisions of the Homeowner’s Bill of Rights. (See SAC
¶¶ 27-64.) Plaintiff also asserted claims for unfair competition, cancellation
of written instrument, and wrongful foreclosure, all arguing that the Notice of
Default and Notice of Sale were unlawful and void because they violated the
Homeowner’s Bill of Rights. (¶¶ 65-99.) 
 
            Defendants
argue that Plaintiff’s first five causes of action fail because of the Court’s
August 29, 2023 order. The Civil Code states in relevant part that, “[u]nless
otherwise provided . . . sections 2923.5 . . . 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924.9 [and]
2924.10 . . . shall apply only to first lien mortgages or deeds of trust that
are secured by owner-occupied residential real property. . .” (Civ. Code §
2924.15(a).) “Owner occupied” property is property that is the principal
residence of the borrower and is security for a loan made for personal, family,
or household purposes. (Civ. Code § 2924.15.) On May 25, 2023, Defendants moved
for an order deeming the truth of matters stated in their Requests for
Admissions propounded to Plaintiff as admitted, including, inter alia,
Request No. 13, which sought an admission that the subject property was not
Plaintiff’s principal residence during the operative period of 2019 through
2022. (See RJN Exh. 7.) The Court granted the motion on August 29, 2023. (RJN
Exh. 10.) A party’s admissions in requests for admissions are properly subject
to judicial notice. (Arce v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (2010)
181 Cal.App.4th 471, 485.) Thus, through the Court’s August 29, 2023 ruling,
Plaintiff has admitted that the subject property was not her principal
residence, and therefore that her first five causes of action are barred by
Civil Code section 2924.15(a). 
 
            Defendants
next argue that the remainder of Plaintiff’s claims fail because they are
derivative of the first five causes of action. In so arguing, Defendants appear
to conflate the sixth (mislabeled as ninth) cause of action for unfair
competition with the seventh (mislabeled as tenth) cause of action for
cancellation of written instrument in their moving papers. However, as the
Notice of Motion and the body of the moving papers clearly state that the
motion is brought as to the pleadings, this defect is not prejudicial.
Moreover, as all three causes of action on their face state that they are
predicated on the invalidity of the Notice of Default and Notice of Sale, those
claims must fail with the underlying HBOR causes of action.
 
            Thus, because
all of Plaintiff’s claims fail by application of the August 29, 2023 ruling,
Defendants are entitled to judgment on the pleadings. 
 
Leave to Amend
 
            When a
demurrer is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318).  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the
general set of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should
give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff
should not “be deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that
his pleadings were defective for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman
(1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) Accordingly, California law imposes the
burden on the plaintiffs to demonstrate the manner in which they can amend
their pleadings to state their claims against a defendant.  (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) “Denial of leave to amend
constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the complaint shows on its face it is
incapable of amendment.  [Citation.]  Liberality in permitting
amendment is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been
given." (Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217,
1227.)
 
            Plaintiff
has not demonstrated how the pleadings might be amended to cure these defects.
Moreover, as the Court’s ruling here is based on the prior ruling deeming the
truth of matters stated in requests for admissions, it is not possible for the
defects in the pleadings to be cured by amendment. The Court therefore cannot
grant leave to amend on this record. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED.
 
            Dismissal
is entered as to all Defendants with prejudice this date. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
