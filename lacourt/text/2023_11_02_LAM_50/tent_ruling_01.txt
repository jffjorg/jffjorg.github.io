  Case Number:  21STCV03095    Hearing Date:   November 2, 2023    Dept:  50 Superior  Court of California County  of Los Angeles Department 50      CAROL M. SONI (AKA SYLMARAH    BARUTI),                          Plaintiffs, et al.,               vs.   KIM B. PRIESTLEY, et al.,                           Defendants.   Case No.:   21STCV03095     Hearing    Date:   November     2, 2023     Hearing    Time:   10:00 a.m.     TENTATIVE    RULING RE:   DEFENDANTS’    MOTION TO ADVANCE MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT HEARING DATE, OR ALTERNATIVELY,    FOR TRIAL CONTINUANCE       Background Plaintiffs Carol M. Soni (aka Sylmarah Baruti) and The Estate of Obalajii  Khephren Rust filed this action on January 26, 2021 against Defendants Kim B.  Priestley and Darryl H. Priestley (jointly, “Defendants”). The Complaint  alleges causes of action for (1) wrongful eviction, (2) intentional infliction  of emotional distress, (3) conversion, and (4) defamation per se.  The trial date in  this action is currently set for January 24, 2024, and the hearing on  Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary  adjudication is currently set for February 6, 2024.  Defendants now move “for an order continuing the January 24, 2024  trial date and related pre-trial deadlines for a period of not less than thirty  (30) days after February 6, 2024, the hearing date of Defendants’…motion for  summary judgment/adjudication in this matter.” Alternatively, Defendants  “request that the Court advance and specially set the hearing on the  Defendant’s motion for summary judgment/adjudication so that it may be heard  prior to the January 24, 2023 trial date.” No opposition to the motion was  filed.              Discussion “The court may grant a  continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the  continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd.  (c).) “In ruling on a motion or application for continuance, the court must  consider all the facts and circumstances that are relevant to the  determination.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd.  (d).)  As set forth above,  Defendants move “for an  order continuing the January 24, 2024 trial date and related pre-trial deadlines for a  period of not less than thirty (30) days after February 6, 2024, the hearing  date of Defendants’…motion for summary judgment/adjudication in this matter.”  Defendants indicate that on October 6, 2023, they filed a motion for summary  judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication in this matter.  In addition, Defendants’ counsel states in her declaration in support  of the instant motion that “Defendants filed and served by personal service its  motion for summary judgment on October 6, 2023—i.e., 110 days prior to the  January 24, 2024 trial date. However, when Defendants reserved a hearing date  for this motion, the Court’s first available hearing date providing sufficient  notice for a motion for summary judgment was February 6, 2024…Thus, Defendants’  motion for summary judgment is presently set to be heard two weeks after the  January 24, 2024 trial date and well after the December 22, 2023 cut-off for  the hearing on a motion for summary judgment.” (Becker Decl., ¶ 2.)  Defendants cite to Cole v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th  84, 86, where  “Petitioners Geoff Cole and Admiral’s Experience, Inc., [sought] a writ of  mandate to compel the trial court to calendar their timely motion for summary  judgment for a hearing before the start of trial.” The Court of Appeal found that “[t]he  trial court…erred by refusing to set a hearing for the motion for summary  judgment before the start of trial.” (Id. at p. 89.) The Cole Court noted as follows:  “Numerous  Courts of Appeal have held that a trial court cannot refuse to consider a  motion for summary judgment that is timely filed. ‘A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment  motion filed within the time limits of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 437c. [Citation.] Local rules and practices  may not be applied so as to prevent the filing and hearing of such a motion.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529 [255 Cal. Rptr. 13] (Sentry); accord, First State Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330 [94 Cal. Rptr. 2d  104] [invalidating case management  order to the extent it precluded filing motions pursuant to section  437c]; Wells Fargo Bank  v. Superior Court (1988) 206  Cal.App.3d 918, 923 [254 Cal. Rptr. 68] [local court rule that ‘require[s] a party filing a complex  summary judgment motion to file the motion six months before the date set for  trial is void and unenforceable because it is inconsistent with section  437c’].) As the Sentry court explained: ‘We are sympathetic to the  problems the trial courts experience in calendaring and hearing the many  motions for summary judgment…However, the solution to these problems cannot  rest in a refusal to hear timely motions.” (Sentry, supra, at  p. 530.).” (Cole v. Superior  Court, supra, 87  Cal.App.5th at p. 88.)  The Cole Court found that “[b]ecause petitioners’ motion for summary  judgment was filed within the time limits set by section  437c, they have a right to have their motion heard before the start of  trial. Zeiner asserts that petitioners purposefully delayed filing the motion  for summary judgment and then delayed asking for ex parte relief so that they  could avoid going to trial. But the fact remains that the motion was timely  filed, and calendaring issues are not a basis on which the trial court can  refuse to hear a timely filed summary judgment motion, absent an indication  that it was defective under section 437c.” (Cole v. Superior  Court, supra, 87  Cal.App.5th at p. 88.)  Defendants assert that  under Cole, their motion for summary judgment, or in the  alternative, summary adjudication must be heard, and that “[o]ne mechanism for  doing so is to continue the trial date and related pre-trial deadlines to allow  for Defendants’ timely motion to be heard.” (Mot. at p. 4:17-18.)  Defendants also note that “[i]n  ruling on a motion or application for continuance, the court must consider all  the facts and circumstances that are relevant to the determination. These may  include…Whether the interests of  justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by  imposing conditions on the continuance,” and “[a]ny other fact or  circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1332, subds. (d)(10)-(11).) Defendants assert that “it is  in the interests of justice and it is Defendants’ right to have their summary  judgment motion heard.” (Mot. at p. 3:1-2.)                Based  on the foregoing, and in light of the lack of any opposition, the Court finds that Defendants have demonstrated good cause for a trial  continuance. Conclusion Based on the foregoing, Defendants’  motion for an order continuing the January 24, 2024 trial date and  related pre-trial deadlines is granted. The Court continues the  final status conference to 10-11-2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Dept. 50 and trial to 10-30-2024,  at 9:30 a.m., in Dept. 50.              Status Conference set on 5-21-2024 at 10:00 a.m. Non-Appearance Case Review for submittal of trial binders is 10-04-2024, 4:00 p.m. All discovery deadlines  are continued based on the new trial date.  Defendants are ordered  to give notice of this ruling.    DATED:  November 2, 2023                                                   ________________________________ Hon. Rolf M.
