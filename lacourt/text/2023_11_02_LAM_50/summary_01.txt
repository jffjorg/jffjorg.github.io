Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date and related pre-trial deadlines. The trial date was previously set for January 24, 2024, but the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication was filed on October 6, 2023, and is currently set to be heard on February 6, 2024. The judge has determined that the defendants have demonstrated good cause for a continuance, citing the need to consider all facts and circumstances relevant to the determination. The judge has also considered the case law, including Cole v. Superior Court, which holds that a trial court cannot refuse to consider a timely filed motion for summary judgment. The judge has ordered the final status conference to be held on October 11, 2024, and the trial to be held on October 30, 2024.
