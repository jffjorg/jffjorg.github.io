And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Joe Bousleiman v. Youssef Sawaya, et al. Sawaya has demurred to each cause of action in the complaint, but the judge finds that the demurrer is untimely. The judge notes that Sawaya's counsel did not file a reply in support of the demurrer or respond to the plaintiff's objection to the demurrer's timeliness. As a result, the judge overrules Sawaya's demurrer and orders Sawaya to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 10 days.
