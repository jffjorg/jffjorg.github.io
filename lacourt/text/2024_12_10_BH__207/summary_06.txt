And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a response to a demurrer filed by the plaintiff, Stan Lee Universe LLC, to the affirmative defenses raised by the defendant, Pow! Entertainment, LLC. The plaintiff demurs to affirmative defenses 2-7, 9-10, 12-15, and 17-20 of the defendant's answer, alleging that these defenses fail to state a defense and are based on general and conclusory allegations rather than specific facts.

The judge finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer prior to filing the demurrer, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. However, the judge also notes that a determination that the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.

The judge orders the parties to meet and confer again, and continues the hearing on the demurrer to February 5, 2025. The judge also orders the plaintiff to file and serve a supplemental declaration regarding compliance with the meet and confer process by January 29, 2025.
