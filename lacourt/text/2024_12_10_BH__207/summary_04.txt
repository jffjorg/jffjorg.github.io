And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication filed by Dalton Barnes, a cross-complainant in a lawsuit. The motion seeks to adjudicate several causes of action, including breach of contract and express indemnity, against Alpha Real Estate Advisors, LLC and Braden Crocket.

The judge has granted the motion in part, finding that Alpha breached the Operating Agreement by failing to indemnify Barnes. As a result, the judge has granted summary adjudication as to Barnes' first cause of action for breach of contract and fourth cause of action for express indemnity against Alpha.

However, the judge has denied the motion as to Crockett, finding that Barnes has not presented sufficient evidence to show that Crockett committed an act or omission that constituted gross negligence, willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duties, or breach of the Operating Agreement.

The judge has also denied the motion for declaratory relief, finding that the facts presented do not support the requested relief. Specifically, the judge found that Alpha's refusal to indemnify Barnes was not an act or omission that constitutes gross negligence, willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duties, or breach of the Operating Agreement.

The judge has ordered Barnes to file and serve a proposed order in conformance with the ruling on or before December 27, 2024.
