And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant Birgitta Lauren's deposition and production of documents as premature. The plaintiff alleges that Lauren and her counsel failed to appear for the deposition on February 12, 2024, and again on May 15, 2024, despite having agreed to those dates. Lauren's counsel served an objection to the notice of deposition on February 5, 2024, and Lauren herself became ill on May 14, 2024, providing a doctor's note excusing her from work for 90 days. The judge finds that Lauren's counsel did not fail to provide a valid objection to the deposition notice, and that Lauren provided compelling reasons for not attending the deposition. Therefore, the motion to compel is denied as premature, and the request for monetary sanctions is also denied.
