And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to answer filed by the plaintiff, Nadia Heshmati, against defendant Michael Carbajal. The demurrer challenges the defendant's affirmative defenses 1-5, which are: failure to state a cause of action, statute of limitations, unclean hands, failure to mitigate damages, and limitation of liabilities. The judge has overruled the plaintiff's demurrer to the first affirmative defense, which alleges that the plaintiff's claims are barred by laches, an equitable defense. However, the judge has sustained the plaintiff's demurrer to the second through fifth affirmative defenses, finding that they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for leave to amend the answer, as the defendant has not shown how the pleading could be amended to state an affirmative defense. The judge has ordered that the plaintiff shall provide notice of the ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
