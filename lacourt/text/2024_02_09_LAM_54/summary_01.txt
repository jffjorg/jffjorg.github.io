And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Shmuel Erde's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against former Defendant Balboa LLC, Plaintiff Cartwright, and Dolores Golden. The motion is granted because Defendant Erde has acted in good faith and has not received responses to discovery from the cross-defendants. The Court notes that this is in line with the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง 426.50, which allows a party to apply for leave to amend their pleading or file a cross-complaint to assert a cause of action that was not previously pleaded. The hearing is scheduled for February 13, 2024, and if the parties wish to submit on the tentative, they should email the courtroom with notice to opposing counsel before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
