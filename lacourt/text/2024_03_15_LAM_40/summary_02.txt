Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Defendant Non-Stop Enterprise, Inc. to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff NS Executives, Inc. The demurrer argues that the three-day notice to pay rent or quit served on Non-Stop is defective because it does not contain the language "excluding Saturdays and Sundays and other judicial holidays" from Code of Civil Procedure section 1161, subdivision (2). The Court finds in favor of Plaintiff NS Executives, ruling that the demurrer is untimely and that the three-day notice is not defective. The Court also strikes the First Amended Complaint filed by NS Executives on March 8, 2024, and will continue its analysis using the original Complaint. The demurrer is therefore OVERRULED.
