And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The complaint was filed on September 11, 2019, and was dismissed on December 28, 2023, without prejudice. The plaintiff filed the instant motion to set aside the dismissal on March 21, 2024. The court finds that the plaintiff's counsel's calendaring error constitutes excusable neglect, and therefore grants the motion. The matter is set for an Order to Show Cause re Dismissal (Settlement) on May 20, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
