Additionally, Petitioner must provide proof of payments made for medical expenses and clarify the total amount of medical expenses being reimbursed and the method of reimbursement. Petitioner must also provide a revised declaration of attorney fees and complete form MC-355. The Court requires further evidence and clarification on medical expenses and reimbursement methods.
