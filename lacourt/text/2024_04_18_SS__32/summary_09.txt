And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

**Tentative Ruling**

The court has reviewed the parties' briefs and arguments in this case. The defendant, Anderson Moulding, LLC, has moved for summary judgment arguing that there is no triable issue of fact surrounding duty and breach. The plaintiff, Jose Luis Antonio Guerra Guerra, opposes the motion.

After reviewing the evidence, the court finds that the defendant has failed to meet its initial burden in establishing the absence of a triable issue of fact. The court also finds that the plaintiff has presented evidence that the defendant's employee, Codie Baxter, owed a duty of care to the plaintiff and breached that duty.

The court concludes that there is a triable issue of fact as to the defendant's duty of care and breach of duty. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.

**Order**

The court orders that the defendant shall provide notice of the court's ruling and file proof of service of such.
