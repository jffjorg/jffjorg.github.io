And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff's deposition and orders Plaintiff to appear for a deposition within 20 days. The judge also awards Defendant monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,424.45 against Plaintiff and his counsel, jointly and severally. The judge finds that the motion to compel is warranted due to Plaintiff's counsel's failure to appear for the deposition and to reset the deposition date after Defendant's counsel's cancellation. The judge reduces the amount of monetary sanctions awarded due to the excessive nature of the request.
