BACKGROUND
 
On
August 12, 2021, Plaintiffs Henry Leslie and Tamarra Williams filed a complaint
against Gerardo Rendon Venegas, Western Freight Carrier, Inc., and Does 1 to 50
for injuries resulting from a motor vehicle accident. 
 
On September 29, 2023, Defendant Western Freight Carrier, Inc.
(“Defendant”) propounded Request for Production, Set Three on Plaintiff Tamarra
Williams (“Plaintiff”).
(Mathis Decl., ¶ 7, Exh. D.) Defendant granted an extension to respond until
November 14, 2023. (Id. ¶ 8.) On November 15, 2023, Plaintiff served a
response that contained only objections. (Id. ¶ 9, Exh. F.) 
 
The parties
agreed on a motion to compel further deadline of January 19, 2024. (Id.
¶ 12.) 
 
Defendant now moves to compel further responses to Request for
Production, Set Three number 19. Defendant also seeks monetary
sanctions.
 
Plaintiff opposes and Defendant replies.
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
On March 4, 2024, the parties appeared for a scheduled Informal
Discovery Conference (IDC) pursuant to the Court’s Eighth Amended Standing
Order. The issues were not resolved. Therefore, the IDC requirement has been
met. (Min. Order, 3/4/24.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(a) provides that
on receipt of a response to a request for production of documents, the
demanding party may move for an order compelling further responses if:¿ 
¿ 
(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.¿ 
(2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive.¿ 
(3) An objection in the response is without merit or too
general.¿¿ 
 ¿ 
“Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the demand.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(c).)¿¿¿ 
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310 (h).) 
 
Request for Production, Set One, number 19 requests a
recording of Plaintiff’s independent medical examination that took place on
March 2, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff responded as follows: “Plaintiff objects to this
discovery request as it seeks attorney work product in violation of Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2018.020 and 2018.030 Further, the information sought
in this discovery request is equally available to the propounding party from
Dr. Stuart M. Gold who conducted the defense medical exam of Plaintiff on March
2, 2023.”
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff asserts she provided the recording on February 2, 2024.
(Kim Decl. ¶ 4.) Defendant does not dispute this in reply. Therefore, the
motion is denied as moot. However, Defendant still requests monetary sanctions
since Plaintiff did not agree to extend the motion deadline. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant
requests $1,430 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel of
record, representing a $220 hourly rate. (Mathis Decl. ¶ 8.) 
 
Defendant
asserts that on January 5, 2024, it sent Plaintiff a meet and confer letter
requesting availability for an IDC and if the March 4, 2024 date was agreeable.
(Mathis Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. H.) On January 8, 2024, Plaintiff extended the motion
deadline to January 19, 2024. (Id. ¶ 12.) On January 18, 2024, Plaintiff
indicated she would produce the at-issue discovery. (Id.) According to
Defendant, Plaintiff refused to grant another motion extension. Due to this,
Defendant filed this motion on January 19, 2024. 
 
Sanctions
are mandatory against the unsuccessful party in a motion to compel further
discovery. Although the motion is denied as moot, Plaintiff did not timely
produce the discovery,[1]
necessitating this motion. Accordingly, sanctions are warranted. However, the
amount is excessive. The Court awards sanctions in the amount of $440 (2 hours
of attorney time).
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the motion to compel further responses to Requests for
Production No. 19 is denied as moot. 
 
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, shall pay
monetary sanctions in the amount of $440 to counsel for Defendant within 30
days.
 
Defendant
to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
