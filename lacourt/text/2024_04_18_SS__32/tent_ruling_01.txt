TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


April
  18, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


19STCV32362




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Set Aside Dismissal




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Rocio Flores




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
BACKGROUND
 
On September 11, 2019, Plaintiff Rocio Flores filed a complaint
against Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and
Roger Guillen-Ayala. 
 
On December 28, 2023, the case was called for an Order to Show Cause
Re Dismissal (Settlement) and Plaintiff did not appear. The Court then
dismissed the complaint without prejudice. (Min. Order, 12/28/23.) 
 
On March 21, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to set aside
the dismissal. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a
dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  This application must
be filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
A mistake
is a basis for relief under section 473 when by reason of the mistake a party
failed to make a timely response.  Surprise occurs when a party is
unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without any negligence of his
own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the party has shown some
reasonable excuse for the default.  (Credit Managers Association of
California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d
1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 905.)  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the burden of
demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake, justifying a
court’s vacating a judgment.  (Basinger v. Roger & Wells (1990)
220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)   
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) However mandatory relief is only
available when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are
procedurally equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief provision
does not apply to dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals
for failure to serve a complaint within three years [citations omitted],
dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations [citations omitted],
and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement [citations omitted].” (Id.)

 
DISCUSSION

 
            Procedurally,
the present motion is timely because it was filed within six months after the complaint
was dismissed. The Declaration of Gerardo Moreno, Jr., Plaintiffs’ counsel,
(Counsel) states that “it was Plaintiff counsel’s oversight in calendaring the
December 28, 2023 OSC, and in the midst of the holiday season, counsel failed
to appear.” (Moreno Decl. ¶ 2.) A calendaring error constitutes excusable
neglect. (Nilsson v. City of Los Angeles (1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 976,
980.) 
 
            Therefore,
the motion to set aside the dismissal entered on December 28, 2023 is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint.  
 
The matter is set for an Order to Show Cause re Dismissal (Settlement) on
May 20, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Plaintiffs to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
