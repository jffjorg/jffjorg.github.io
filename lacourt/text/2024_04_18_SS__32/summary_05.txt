```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has considered the arguments presented by NAI, despite being untimely, without prejudice to PEI. NAI's arguments rely on the lease agreement, but they do not explain why the lease agreement gives rise to liability by PEI. NAI also fails to explain why PEI would be liable for not reporting issues with the ADA mat. The court overrules NAI's objections of hearsay, expert testimony, and lacking foundation.
