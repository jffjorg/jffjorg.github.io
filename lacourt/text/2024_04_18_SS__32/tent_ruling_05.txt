[1] Though
the opposition was untimely, the Court exercises its discretion to consider
Nai’s arguments absent prejudice to PEI. 


[2] In
opposition, NAI does not dispute that it owned the premises and installed the
mat, or address the PMK’s testimony. (Opp., 5.) NAI’s arguments rely on the
lease agreement. Although NAI argues the lease agreement “places limitations on
liability and responsibility against North Atlantic,” NAI does not explain why
the lease agreement, including the highlighted portions, give rise to liability
by PEI here in light of the definition of premises in the agreement. Moreover,
NAI argues that “[e]ven if it was determined that North Atlantic was
responsible for maintaining the common premises, this would not absolve La
Mexicana of liability because its employees’ testimony establishes that it
never reported any alleged issue with the ADA mat to North Atlantic despite La
Mexicana apparently receiving complaints or concerns about the condition of the
mat.” (Opposition at p. 6.) However, NAI does not explain why PEI would be
liable to Plaintiff for not reporting an issue with an ADA mat to NAI, who was
responsible under the lease agreement for maintaining the mat and the area
where the mat was located. The Court overrules NAI’s generalized objections of
hearsay, expert testimony, and lacking foundation. (Opposition at p. 4.)
