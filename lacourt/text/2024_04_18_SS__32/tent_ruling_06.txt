CASE NUMBER:


21STCV23429




MOTIONS:  


Petition
  for Minors Compromise 




MOVING PARTY:


Petitioner Angelice Levingston




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed
  



 
 
The Court has reviewed the
Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action of a Minor, filed March 26, 2024 by Petitioner Angelice
Levingston (“Petitioner”) on
behalf of Claimant Gianni Brown, age 14. The Court denies the petition without
prejudice for the following reasons. 
 
Petitioner’s attachment 11b(6) still does not set forth
the reasons for the apportionment between Claimant and the other plaintiff. 
 
Petitioner or her attorney did not sign the petition in
item 23. 
 
In item 8a of the proposed order (MC-351), Petitioner
seeks a disbursement of $600, which is part of the $2,037.25 in non-medical
expenses. (See Petition, item 13b.) Therefore, the amount in 8a(2) seeking
$2,037.25 in reimbursements to Petitioner’s attorney, appears duplicative and
must be decreased by $600. 
 
In the proposed order, since Petitioner is seeking
$20,000 of the net settlement to be deposited in a blocked account, item 8b(1)
must instead state $20,000. Item 8b(2) must contain the instructions to deposit
the remaining ($33,002.75) into an annuity, as indicated in attachment 18b(3). 
 
Since Petitioner is seeking $20,000 of the funds to be
placed in a blocked account, she must complete item 9 on MC-351, such as by writing
the branch name and address in 9a and making a selection in item 9c. 
 
Finally, Petitioner reserved a hearing date for a
petition to confirm minor’s compromise with a special needs trust. There is no
indication that the compromise involves a special needs trust. Petitioner is to
correct this defect if another petition is filed.
 
Accordingly, the Court denies the petition without
prejudice.
 
Petitioner shall give notice and file a
proof of service of such.
