And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the demurrer of Home Delivery Link, Inc. (HDL) to the second amended complaint (SAC) of plaintiff Victor Manuel Leon, Jr. The SAC alleges that HDL is liable for the torts of its employees, Scandrick and James, who were making deliveries for La-Z-Boy, Inc. at the time of the alleged battery and assault.

The court held that HDL is not liable for the acts of its employees under the doctrine of respondeat superior because the alleged torts were not committed within the scope of employment. The court also held that the SAC failed to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for negligent hiring, supervision, and retention.

The court granted leave to amend the SAC and instructed HDL to provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service of such. The court's ruling is tentative and is subject to change upon further consideration.
