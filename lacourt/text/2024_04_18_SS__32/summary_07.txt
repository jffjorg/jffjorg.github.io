```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court's tentative ruling is that the motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production No. 19 is denied as moot. The Court finds that Plaintiff Tamarra Williams did provide the requested recording of the independent medical examination, making the motion unnecessary. The Court also awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $440 to Defendant Western Freight Carrier, Inc. for Plaintiff's failure to timely produce the discovery. The Court rejects Defendant's request for $1,430 in monetary sanctions and awards only $440, finding the amount excessive. The Court orders Plaintiff and her counsel to pay the awarded sanctions within 30 days.
