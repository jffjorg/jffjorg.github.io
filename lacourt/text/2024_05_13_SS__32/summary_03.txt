And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a denial of the motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Michael Carson. Counsel, Law Offices of Bob Khakshooy, seeks to withdraw due to lack of cooperation and communication from the client. However, the court finds the efforts to confirm Plaintiff's address and provide notice to be insufficient. The court also finds that Counsel has not included the necessary information regarding future proceedings. As a result, the court denies the motion without prejudice.
