MOTION
 
Plaintiff Esther Mendoza, individually and as successor in interest
for Laura Castaneda, (“Plaintiff”) moves to continue trial and all related deadlines.
No opposition has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
The complaint was filed on July 8, 2020. 
 
Trial was originally set for January 5, 2022. (PI General Order,
7/17/20.) On December 22, 2021, finding that the case had not been served, the
Court advanced and vacated all future dates. (Min. Order, 12/22/21.) 
 
Defendant Aaron’s Towing, Inc. filed an answer on September 1, 2022. 
 
Trial was then set for October 12, 2023. (Min. Order, 9/2/22.) 
 
On September 15, 2023, the Court granted in part Plaintiff’s ex parte
application and continued trial and all related dates to December 5, 2023.
(Min. Order, 9/15/23.) 
 
On November 14, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to continue
trial and all related dates to April 19, 2024, to allow the Court to hear
Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend. 
 
On February 21, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for leave
to amend her complaint by making Esther Mendoza the successor in interest to
Laura Castaneda, and to add defendant A7 Towing, Inc. as the alter ego of Aaron
Towing, Inc. 
 
The first amended complaint (“FAC”) was filed on February 23, 2024. 
 
On March 19, 2024, the Court granted in part, Plaintiff’s ex parte
application continuing trial and all related dates to June 27, 2024. The Court
ordered the parties to meet and confer to schedule and complete all non-expert
discovery and prepare for the completion of expert discovery to obviate the
need for a further continuance. (Min. Order, 3/19/24.) 
 
On April 9, 2024, Aaron’s Towing, Inc. filed an answer. 
 
On April 18, 2024, A7 Towing, Inc. filed a demurrer to the FAC,
scheduled to be heard May 23, 2024. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Legal
Standard
 
 “Continuances are granted only on an affirmative showing of good
cause requiring a continuance.”¿ (In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke
(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 814, 823.)¿ A trial court has broad discretion in
considering a request for a trial continuance.¿ (Pham v. Nguyen (1997)
54 Cal.App.4th 11, 13-18.)¿ California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332 sets forth
factors for the Court to consider in ruling on a motion to continue
trial. 
 
“To ensure the prompt disposition of
civil cases, the dates assigned for a trial are firm. All parties and their
counsel must regard the date set for trial as certain.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332(a).) 
 
“A party seeking a continuance of the
date set for trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by the
parties, must make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an ex
parte application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with
supporting declarations. The party must make the motion or application as soon
as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is discovered.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(b).)
 
“Although continuances of trials are disfavored, each
request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits. The court may
grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance. Circumstances that may indicate good cause include:
 
(1)  
The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;
(2)  
The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;
(3)  
The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances; 
(4)  
The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;
(5)  
The
addition of a new party if:
(A) The new party has not had a
reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or
(B) The other parties have not
had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in
regard to the new party’s involvement in the case;
(6)  
A
party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other
material evidence despite diligent efforts; or
(7)  
A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)
 
“In ruling on a motion or application for continuance, the
court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are relevant to the
determination. These may include:
 
(1)  
The
proximity of the trial date;
(2)  
Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;
(3)  
The
length of the continuance requested;
(4)  
The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance;
(5)  
The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;
(6)  
If
the case is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that
status and whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid
delay;
(7)  
The
court’s calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending
trials;
(8)  
Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial;
(9)  
Whether
all parties have stipulated to a continuance;
(10)  Whether the interests of
justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by
imposing conditions on the continuance; and
(11)  Any other fact or
circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff seeks to continue trial and all related dates because
Defendant A7 Towing, Inc. was served on February 29, 2024 after the first
amended complaint was filed. Plaintiff argues there is insufficient time for A7
Towing, Inc. to complete discovery and file a responsive pleading before trial.
Due to this, Plaintiff requests that trial be continued to a full year on April
19, 2025. However, Plaintiff does not provide facts that show a year of
discovery will be required from the addition of one defendant. Trial is
currently set for June 27, 2024. A7 Towing, Inc.’s demurrer will be heard on
May 23, 2024. Therefore, because Plaintiff does not provide specific facts informing
the amount of discovery needed, the Court does not find good cause at this
moment to continue trial to April 2025. However, given that a new party was
added to this action in February 2024, pursuant to the granting of the motion
for leave to amend, and its responsive pleading is pending, the Court finds
good cause for a shorter continuance.   
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS in part Plaintiff’s motion to continue
trial.  
 
Trial is continued to December 2, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in
Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
 
The Final Status Conference is continued to November 18,
2024 at 10:00 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
 
All discovery and motion deadlines shall be associated with
the new trial date. 
 
 
Plaintiff shall give notice of this order, and file a proof of service
of such.
