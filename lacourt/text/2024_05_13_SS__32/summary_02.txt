And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court grants in part the Plaintiff's motion to continue trial and all related dates. The Plaintiff seeks to continue trial due to the addition of a new defendant, A7 Towing, Inc., which was served on February 29, 2024. The Plaintiff argues that there is insufficient time for A7 Towing, Inc. to complete discovery and file a responsive pleading before trial. The court finds good cause for a shorter continuance given the addition of a new party and the pending responsive pleading. The court continues trial to December 2, 2024, and the Final Status Conference to November 18, 2024.
