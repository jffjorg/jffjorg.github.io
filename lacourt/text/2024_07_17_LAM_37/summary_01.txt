Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The FAC fails to allege facts showing that the defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud in not paying rent. The court finds that the FAC is devoid of facts showing how the defendant acted with malice, fraud, or oppression in not paying rent. The court has given the plaintiff 10 days to amend the FAC and has set a hearing for July 29, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. to consider the amended complaint.
