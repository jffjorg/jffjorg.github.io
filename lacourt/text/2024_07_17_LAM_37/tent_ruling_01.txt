Background
 
On January 9, 2024, Daniel and
Elizabeth Rogosin (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against 9 Sliver LLC; Nathan
Young (collectively “Defendants”); and Does 1 to 100. 
 
The operative First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) alleges five causes of action:
 
1)    
Breach of Contract’
2)    
Account Stated; 
3)    
Open Book Account; 
4)    
Negligence; and 
5)    
Private Nuisance. 
 
Defendants now move to strike
punitive damages from the FAC. Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The matter is now
before the court. 


 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
B.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Motion to Strike[1]
 
A.        Summary of Allegations
 
The FAC alleges that on or
about January 6, 2022, Plaintiffs entered a residential least (the “Lease”)
with Defendants for a premises located in Los Angeles, CA (the “Premises”).
(FAC, ¶ 1, Ex. 1.) Under the Lease, Defendants would rent the Premises until
January 31, 2024, with rent of $18,000 to be paid on the first day of each
month. (FAC, ¶ 2.) Defendant Nathan Young (“Young”) personally guaranteed the
Lease. (SAC, ¶ 3.) “Defendants have breached the term
of the Lease by failing to pay the monthly rent owed for October 2023.” (FAC, ¶
4.)
 
Plaintiffs filed an
unlawful detainer action (the “UD Action”) (LASC Case No. 23STCV26741). FAC, ¶
5.) Defendants vacated the Premises on November 2023 without paying
the rent due for November 2023. (FAC, ¶ 6.) For the months of October and
November 2023, Plaintiffs are owed a total of $36,000 for past rent due. (FAC,
¶ 6.)  Due to the Lease expiring in
January 2024 and costs associated with repairs and legal fees incurred in the
UD Action, the FAC alleges Defendants owe a total of $117,260, including credit
for a $36,000 security deposit paid by Defendant.  (FAC, ¶¶ 7-10, Ex. 2, 3.)  
 
B.        Defendants’ Request to Strike Punitive
Damages
 
Defendants move to strike
Plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages because the FAC fails to allege facts
to show malice, oppression, or fraud. (FAC, ¶¶ 33 at p.8:17-19.) 
 
To
state a claim for punitive damages under Civ. Code § 3294, a plaintiff must
allege specific facts showing that the defendant has been guilty of malice,
oppression or fraud. (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th
1033, 1042.)¿ The basis for punitive damages must be pled with specificity;
conclusory allegations devoid of any factual assertions are insufficient. (Ibid.)¿¿“Malice”
is defined in Civ. Code § 3294 (c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the
defendant to cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the
defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others.” “Oppression” is defined as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”
(Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2).) The term “despicable” has been defined in the case
law as actions that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (Shade Foods,
Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78
Cal.App.4th 847, 891.) Fraud means “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit,
or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on
the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal
rights or otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(3).) 
 
Paragraph
44 states: “As a further direct and legal result of the
wrongful acts and/or omissions of Defendants, Plaintiffs seek the recovery of
punitive and exemplary damages against Defendants as set forth above.” The
court finds that apart from Defendants not paying rent and breaching the lease,
the FAC is devoid of facts showing how Defendants acted with malice, fraud, or
oppression in not paying rent. Moreover, the FAC fails to explain why
Defendants are liable for the repair costs of the Premises and how such conduct
was intentional and done with malice, oppression, or fraud. As to the private
nuisance claim, Plaintiffs fail to explain how Defendants interfered with
Plaintiff’s right to use and enjoy the Premises by not paying rent and how such
conduct was done with malice, oppression, or fraud. “In order to justify an award of punitive damages on this basis,
the plaintiff must establish that the defendant was aware of the probable
dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he wilfully
and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” (Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890,
895–896.) 
 
The motion to strike
is granted with leave to amend.  
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’
motion to strike is granted with leave to amend. Plaintiff has 10 days leave to
amend.  The Court sets an OSC Re: Filing
of Amended Complaint for July 29, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  Defendants to give notice.
