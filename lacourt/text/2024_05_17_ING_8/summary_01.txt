And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to amend the judgment in a personal injury case. The plaintiff is seeking to add $250,000 in non-economic damages to the jury's award of $10,000,000. The court has already reduced the jury's award to $6,800,000, omitting the additional $250,000 in non-economic damages. The plaintiff is also seeking to award pre-judgment interest based on 998 offers made to each defendant. The court is considering these requests and invites the parties to provide additional briefing and argument on several issues, including the calculation of interest, the reasonableness of expert fees, and the handling of MICRA damages.
