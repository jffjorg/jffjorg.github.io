          Plaintiff Linda Lee-Tucker (“Lee-Tucker”)
(“Plaintiff”) moves to compel further responses to her Request for Production
of Documents (Set One) (“RFA”) from Defendant General
Motors, LLC (“GM”) (“Defendant”) to request Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 17, 19, 23, 25, 31, 36, 39,
42, 43, 51, 56, 58, 59, 68, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, and 91 (“Requests”) and
production of all responsive documents corresponding to those requests, and to
strike Defendant’s meritless objections. 
(Notice of Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P. §§2031.310, 128(a)(4), 2023.030(a).)  Plaintiff requests Defendant pay monetary
sanctions of an unspecified amount. 
(Notice of Motion, pg. 1.)
 
Evidentiary Objections
Plaintiff’s 1/23/24 evidentiary objection to the
Declaration of Huizhen Lu (“Lu”) is sustained as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35.
 
Meet and Confer
Defendant fully complied with its meet and confer
obligations under C.C.P. §§2016.040 and 2031.310(b).  Defendant declares parties attempted to
resolve this dispute via an IDC on October 5, 2023, and the discovery dispute
remains unresolved.  (Decl.
of Sanaia ¶33.)  Therefore,
Defendant’s motion is proper.
 
Background
          On May
10, 2023, Defendant electronically served the RFP on Defendant.  (Decl. of Sanaia ¶20, Exh. 8.)  Defendant served unverified responses to
Plaintiff’s RFP on June 8, 2023, and verifications were later served on June
30, 2023.  (Decl. of Sanaia ¶23, Exh.
9.)  Plaintiff declares that as of the
date of the filing and serving of this Motion, Defendant has not provided Code-compliant
responses to Plaintiff’s RFP and has failed to produce all responsive, nonprivileged
documents.  (Decl. of Sanaia ¶26.)
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on October 18, 2023. 
Defendant filed its opposition on January 17, 2024.  Plaintiff filed her reply on January 23, 2024.
 
          Discussion
The Civil Discovery Act provides that a “party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any
motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.”  (C.C.P. §2031.010.)

“[E]vidence is ‘relevant’ if it might reasonably
assist a party in evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a
settlement.”  (Moore v. Mercer (2016)
4 Cal.App.5th 424, 447.)  A party is
entitled to discover “any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action.”  (C.C.P. §2017.010.)  The phrase “subject matter” is broader than
relevancy to the issues (which determines admissibility of evidence at trial).  (Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1392.)  Courts
have uniformly held that, for discovery purposes, information should be
regarded as “relevant” to the subject matter if it might reasonably assist a
party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.  (Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001)
87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1013.)
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses from Defendant
relating to Defendant’s internal investigation and analysis, among other
things, of the engine defects alleged in Plaintiff’s pleading.  Specifically, Plaintiff requested that
Defendant produce documents concerning: (A) the Subject Vehicle (Nos. 1, 2, 3,
7, 8, 9, and 12); (B) internal knowledge and investigation related to the engine
defects in 2018 Buick Encore vehicles (Nos. 17, 19, 23, 25, 31, 36, 39, and
42); (C) summaries, memoranda, Power Points related to the engine defects in
2018 Buick Encore vehicles (Nos. 43 and 51) (D) policies and procedures related
to the Song-Beverly Act (Nos. 56, 58, 59, and 68); (E) communication with governmental
agencies and suppliers related to the engine defects in 2018 Buick Encore
vehicles (Nos. 76, 77, 78, 79, and 80); and (F) other documents related to the
Subject Vehicle’s defect (No. 91).  (Decl. of Sanaia ¶¶20-21, Exh. 8.)
 
A.   Request Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 12
These requests seek production of documents
concerning the Subject Vehicle and are narrowly tailored to a specific issue in
this case.  The requested documents are
relevant to the issues related to Defendant’s good faith compliance with the
Song-Beverly Act, including breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
response provides no explanation as to its search term protocols and provides
no indication that it performed the appropriate searches for relevant ESI or
emails.  Further, Defendant’s boilerplate
objections are not proper.  (See Korea
Data Systems Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1516 [stating
boilerplate objections “[lack] . . . the specificity the statute mandates” and
their use may be sanctionable].)  To the
extent documents are withheld due to an objection, the response must (1)
identify with particularity the document to which the objection is being made;
and (2) set forth the grounds for the objection, including the production of a
privilege log if the objection is based on privilege.  (C.C.P. §2031.240.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 12 and corresponding
documents.  To the extent any responses
are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege log.
 
B.    Request Nos. 17, 19, 23, 25, 31, 36, 39,
and 42
These requests pertain to internal knowledge and investigation
related to the engine defects in 2018 Buick Encore vehicles.  This request is narrowly tailored towards the
applicable policies and procedures related to Plaintiff’s claims.
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
responses indicate it has not performed a search for any emails and ESI.  Further, Defendant’s boilerplate objections
are not proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 17, 19, 23, 25, 31, 36, 39, and 42 and
corresponding documents.  To the extent
any responses are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege
log.
 
C.    Request Nos. 43 and 51
These requests pertain to summaries, memoranda, and
Power Points related to the engine defects in 2018 Buick Encore vehicles that
were prepared by any of Defendant’s engineers concerning the engine defect(s)
in Defendant’s vehicles that are equipped with the same engine as the Subject
Vehicle and is therefore narrowly tailored to the issues in this case. 
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
responses indicate it has not performed a search for any emails and ESI.  Further, Defendant’s boilerplate objections
are not proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 43 and 51 and corresponding
documents.  To the extent any responses
are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege log.
 
D.   Request Nos. 56, 58, 59, and 68
These requests pertain to documents Defendant uses
or have used, since 2020, to evaluate consumer requests for repurchases
pursuant to the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. This request is narrowly
tailored towards the specific issues in the case.
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
responses indicate it has not performed a search for any emails and ESI.  Further, Defendant’s boilerplate objections
are not proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 56, 58, 59, and 68 and corresponding
documents.  To the extent any responses
are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege log.
 
E.    Request Nos. 76, 77, 78, 79, and 80
These requests seek all documents, including ESI,
regarding any communications between Defendant and any government agency or
entity regarding engine defect(s) in Defendant’s vehicles that are equipped
with the same engine as the Subject Vehicle. This request is narrowly tailored
towards the specific issues in the case.
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
responses indicate it has not performed a search for any emails and ESI.  Further, Defendant’s boilerplate objections
are not proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 76, 77, 78, 79, and 80 and corresponding
documents.  To the extent any responses
are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege log.
 
F.     Request No. 91
 This request
seeks all documents reflecting performance standards relating to the engine in Defendant’s
that are equipped with the same engine as the Subject Vehicle. This request is
narrowly tailored towards the specific issues in the case.
Defendant’s response is not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
response indicates it has not performed a search for any emails and ESI.  Further, Defendant’s boilerplate objections
are not proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce
Code-Compliant responses to RFP No. 91 and corresponding documents.  To the extent any response is protected by
privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege log.
 
Sanctions
Under C.C.P. §2023.030(a), “[t]he court may impose a
monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct. The court may also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully
asserting that another has engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or
on any attorney who advised that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction
is authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose that
sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (C.C.P.
§2023.030(a).)
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $3,000.00
against Defendant.  (Decl. of Sanaia
¶45.)  However, Plaintiff’s notice of
motion failed to provide sufficient notice to Defendant of the amount of the
sanction and against whom the sanctions were requested.  (C.C.P. §2023.040.)
 
Conclusion
          Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 17, 19,
23, 25, 31, 36, 39, 42, 43, 51, 56, 58, 59, 68, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, and 91 is
granted.  Defendant is to provide further
Code-Compliant responses within 20 days.
          Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions against Defendant is denied.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
