Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge denies Defendant Inner Power Yoga's Motion for Summary Judgment and Alternative Motion for Summary Adjudication. The Judge finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding Plaintiff's causes of action for negligence and premises liability, and that Defendant has not met its burden of showing that there is no triable issue of fact on the issues of breach of duty and causation. The Judge also finds that the waiver form signed by Plaintiff does not insulate Defendant from liability for injuries that occur when a patron uses its restroom facilities.

Regarding Defendant Sloan Valve Company's Motion for Summary Judgment and Alternative Motion for Summary Adjudication, the Judge finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding Plaintiff's fourth cause of action for negligent product liability and third cause of action for strict product liability. The Judge finds that Plaintiff has presented evidence of a design defect and failure to warn defect, and that there are triable issues of fact regarding whether Defendant was negligent in its design and testing of the toilet and whether Defendant caused Plaintiff's injuries.
