 Case Number:  LC103241    Hearing Date:   July 15, 2024    Dept:  T BAKER  V BAKER CASE NO: LC103241   [TENTATIVE]  ORDER:  Defendant  Clara Veseliza Baker aka Clair Marlo’s Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED.  The case is dismissed without prejudice.   Introduction   Defendant  Clara Veseliza Baker aka Clair Marlo moves to dismiss Plaintiff Alexander  Baker's complaint for failure to bring the case to trial within five years and  six months. Plaintiff opposes. Discussion “An  action shall be dismissed by the court on its own motion or on motion of  the defendant, after notice to the parties, if the action is not brought to  trial within the time prescribed in [Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310 et  seq.].” [Emphasis added.]  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 583.360(a).) Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310 requires that any  civil action be brought to trial within five (5) years of its filing. The  deadline may be extended by tolling or stipulation, but if not, dismissal is mandatory.  (See id., §§ 583.330, 583.340, 583.350.) Plaintiff  filed his initial complaint on August 4, 2015. Absent some exception, the  deadline for trial expired on August 4, 2020.  There  are some exceptions that apply. As  an initial matter, COVID-19 Emergency Rule 10 extended Plaintiff’s deadline for  six months to February 4, 2021.  The  case was also stayed for several periods. “In computing the time within which  an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article, there shall be  excluded the time during which any of the following conditions existed: (a) The  jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended[;] (b) Prosecution or  trial of the action was stayed or enjoined[; or] (c) Bringing the action to  trial, for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 583.340.) The  parties dispute whether the section 583.310 deadline was tolled during each of  the periods when the case was stayed. Defendant argues that only two of these  six tolled the deadline pursuant to section 583.340. Plaintiff argues all six  tolled the deadline. Plaintiff’s  opposition hinges on the interpretation of one stay order, on December 15,  2020, which he claims stayed the case through August 30, 2023. Whether the case  is dismissed depends on whether this stay tolled Plaintiff’s deadline. Even if  the Court assumes that the other five stays tolled Plaintiff’s deadline, those  together are insufficient to save the complaint from being dismissed; Plaintiff  must show this particular order covering December 15, 2020 through August 30,  2023 tolls the 5 year deadline. The  Court finds that the time for Plaintiff to bring his case to trial was not  tolled for purposes of calculating the 5 year time limitation from December 15,  2020 to August 2023.  The  California Supreme Court's decision in Gaines v. Fidelity National Title  Ins. Co. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1081, 1094-1095 is dispositive. “ ‘The term  “prosecution” [in section 583.340] is sufficiently comprehensive to include  every step in an action from its commencement to its final determination.’  [Citation.]” (Id., at p. 1094 [not distinguishing terms “prosecution” and  “trial”]) In Gaines, the Supreme Court found the deadline for trial was  not stayed where the trial court permitted discovery to proceed, because the  order “did not ‘ “stop the prosecution altogether” ’ ” (Ibid., at p.  1094.) Plaintiff  relies on this Court’s December 15, 2020 order to argue the action was stayed,  and the deadline for trial tolled, until August 2023. The Court’s minute order  of that date reads, in pertinent part: “The  trial of this case (not the entire case) is stayed pending determination of  characterization and division of assets/debts trial in related case LD068701,  Baker v. Baker. Discovery remains open.” (12-15-2020  Minute Order.) This  case falls squarely within Gaines. Even if the Court accepts, for the  sake of argument, that the deadline was tolled five times, the total of those  periods would result in a trial deadline of April 27, 2022, well over 2 years ago.  Without the 988 days, the case must be dismissed. The  responsibility to keep track of the 5 year time limitation was on the  plaintiff.  If he had any concern about  bringing the case to trial within the period set forth in Code Civ. Proc., § 583.310,  it was his responsibility to ask the court to advance or special set the trial  date or to stay the entire action or for some other relief.  Plaintiff did not ask the court to advance or  special set the trial date or for any other similar relief.  Plaintiff did not show that it was  "impossible" for the trial to have proceeded during any period of  time except for the brief period when the case was dismissed. Code Civ. Proc.,  § 583.340.  Plaintiff did not seek reconsideration  or appellate review of the order for partial stay.   The  Court has not previously considered this motion.  The court previously only calculated the  dates of the stays and dismissals.  The  court did not, however, consider whether the stays were sufficient to toll the  5 year time limitation under Gaines. Even if was considered a decision  on the merits, the current motion qualifies as a motion for reconsideration and  it is timely.  Finally,  the 5 year time limitation to dismiss is mandatory.  If the evidence establishes that the time has  expired, then the Court does not have the ability to ignore that evidence,  regardless of its prior rulings; it must be dismissed. Defendant’s  motion is granted. The complaint is dismissed without prejudice for failure to  bring the case to trial within the mandatory period prescribed by statute. IT IS SO ORDERED,  CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
