And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, T. Baker, has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to dismiss the case without prejudice. The case was filed by Alexander Baker against Clara Veseliza Baker aka Clair Marlo on August 4, 2015. The deadline for trial was August 4, 2020, but was extended by six months to February 4, 2021 due to the COVID-19 Emergency Rule 10. The case was also stayed multiple times, which may have tolled the deadline for trial. However, the Judge found that the stay order issued on December 15, 2020 did not toll the deadline, and that the plaintiff failed to show that it was impossible for the trial to have proceeded during any period of time. The Judge ruled that the plaintiff was responsible for keeping track of the five-year time limitation and that the case must be dismissed due to the failure to bring the case to trial within the mandatory period prescribed by statute.
