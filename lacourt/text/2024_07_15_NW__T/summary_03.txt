And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and requires the Defendants to pay the outstanding sum of $60,000. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has shown that the Defendants have failed to make any payments towards the settlement sum as required, despite the agreement being executed on December 28, 2023. The Judge also denies the request for prejudgment interest, citing that the settlement agreement does not include an award of prejudgment interest and that the Court's authority is limited to enforcing the terms of the agreement as agreed upon by the parties.
