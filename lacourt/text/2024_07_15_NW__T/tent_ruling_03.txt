 Case Number:  23VECV00412    Hearing Date:   July 15, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV00412 REGENCY  CENTERS, L.P. vs WCFS BOWL 3 LLC, et al. [TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Plaintiff Regency Centers, L.P.’s Motion to  Enforce Settlement and fees is GRANTED. The request for prejudgment interest is  DENIED. Introduction  Plaintiff moves to enforce a  settlement agreement made on December 28, 2023, with Defendants WCFS BOWL 3 LLC  (formerly WCFS BOWL 3 LIMITED COMPANY) doing business as EVERBOWL and WAGSCAP  FOOD SERVICES, LLC. Plaintiff requests that he Court to enforce the settlement  and require Defendants to pay the total outstanding sum of $60,000 under Code  of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  Plaintiff and Defendant WCFS Bowl  3, LLC entered into a commercial lease for a property at 23369 Mulholland  Drive, Woodland Hills, California, on November 5, 2020 (“Lease”). (Kim Decl. ¶  2, Ex. 1.) Concurrently, Defendant WagScap Food Services, LLC (“Guarantor” or  “WagsCap,”) executed an Absolute Unconditional Guaranty of the Lease  (“Guaranty”). (Kim Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 1, Ex. D.) The Lease was to terminate on  February 28, 2026. (Kim Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. 1.) Starting December 1, 2021,  Defendants began failing to pay rent and other charges under the Lease. On  November 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint for Unlawful Detainer against  Tenant (Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 22VECV02039). (Kim Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.)  On January 2, 2023, Tenant vacated the premises, rendering the possession  action moot. (Kim Decl. ¶ 6.) Despite vacating, Defendants continued to fail in  performing under the Lease, including the obligation to pay monthly rent and  other charges. (Kim Decl. ¶ 6.) On January 30, 2023, Plaintiff  filed a Complaint for rent pursuant to Civil Code section 1951.2 and breach of  guaranty against Defendants (Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23VECV00412)  to recover unpaid rent and other charges. (Kim Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. 2.) Defendants  were personally served on February 2, 2023 (Everbowl) and February 23, 2023  (WagsCap). (Kim Decl. ¶ 8.) Defendants did not file a responsive pleading,  leading to defaults being entered against each Defendant on April 3, 2023. (Kim  Decl. ¶ 9.) Default judgment was entered against Defendants. Discussion  In April 2023, Defendants reached  out for settlement through their counsel. (Kim Decl. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff  participated in good faith settlement negotiations since then. (Kim Decl. ¶  10.) Despite good faith negotiations, no immediate agreement was reached. (Kim  Decl. ¶ 11.) On August 16, 2023, the Court issued an Order to Show Cause (OSC)  for why sanctions should not be assessed against Plaintiff's counsel for  failure to enter default judgment. (Kim Decl. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff’s counsel  informed Defendants’ counsel of the OSC to expedite settlement, but no  agreement was reached by the OSC hearing date on September 20, 2023. (Kim Decl.  ¶ 13.) Plaintiff then filed for entry of default judgment in response to the  OSC. (Kim Decl. ¶ 14.) Default judgment for $90,861.16 (principal $87,226.63  and attorneys’ fees $3,634.53) was entered against Defendants. (Kim Decl. ¶ 15,  Ex. 3.) On October 4, 2023, Plaintiff and  Defendants agreed to settle, with Defendants paying $60,000 over 24 months to  resolve Plaintiff's claims. (Kim Decl. ¶ 16.) Payments were due on the first of  each month, starting January 1, 2024. (Kim Decl. ¶ 16.) The settlement included  the Court retaining jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. (Kim Decl. ¶ 16.) A  Settlement Agreement was executed on December 28, 2023. (Kim Decl. ¶ 16, Ex.  4.) Along with the Settlement Agreement, a Joint Stipulation to vacate default  judgment and dismiss the action was filed on January 2, 2024. (Kim Decl. ¶ 17,  Ex. 5). Plaintiff brings this motion on  the grounds that Defendants have not made any payments towards the Settlement  Sum. (Kim Decl. ¶ 18.) No payments were made on January 1, February 1, March 1,  2024, or thereafter. (Kim Decl. ¶ 18.) Defendants provide no arguments  in opposition. The Court finds that it has  authority to grant Plaintiff’s motion and enter judgment pursuant to the terms  of the settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. Here, the  settlement agreement allows the Court to retain jurisdiction over the parties  to enforce the agreement. (Kim Decl. ¶ 14, Ex. 4.) Both parties agreed to this  provision, and section 6 of the Settlement Agreement explicitly states that the  Court may retain jurisdiction to enforce the agreement and its terms until full  performance is achieved, including the entry and enforcement of judgment.  Plaintiff shows that Defendants have violated the terms of the settlement  agreement by failing to make any payments towards the Settlement Sum of $60,000  as required, with payments that were supposed to commence on January 1, 2024,  not being made to date. (Kim Decl. ¶ 16.)  The request for  prejudgment interest under Civil Code section 3298 is denied. Section 664.6  authorizes the trial court to enter a judgment reflecting the terms of the  parties’ settlement agreement.” (BTHHM Berkeley, LLC v. Johnston (2024) 100 Cal.App.5th 1220, 1225.)  “Although a judge hearing a section 664.6 motion may receive evidence,  determine disputed facts and enter the terms of a settlement agreement as a  judgment [citations], nothing in section 664.6  authorizes a judge to create the material terms of a settlement, as  opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have previously  agreed upon.” (Id. [internation quotations removed].)  In BTHHM,  the Court of Appeal found that the trial court’s  award of prejudgment interest altered the terms of the parties’ settlement  agreement, which was limited to “what amount of money would adequately  compensate BTHHM for the harm it suffered to  warrant BTHHM's release of claims. That agreement included a liquidated damages provision that would  become operative if Johnston failed to make timely payment.” (BTHHM, supra,  100 Cal.App.5th at 1225.)  Similarly, here, Plaintiff  fails to show that the settlement agreement included an award of prejudgment  interest. The Court neither finds sufficient support in the attached agreement  itself. Thus, the Court declines to award prejudgment interest as it would  essentially amount to an unauthorized alteration of the terms of the agreement  and beyond the scope of Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  Plaintiff Regency Centers, L.P.’s  Motion to Enforce Settlement is GRANTED. The court will sign the proposed  judgment, eliminating prejudgment interest.    IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO ENTER  JUDGMENT AND GIVE NOTICE OF ENTRY.
