§§ 473(b), 16 473(d), 473.5, and 128(a)(8)] is DENIED.
 
Background
 
This is an
unlawful detainer (UD) action. 
 
On May 8,
2023, a Notice to Pay Rent or Quit was served via “Posting and Mailing”. [1]
 
On May 22,
2023, Plaintiff Lyfestyle Properties, LLC filed the instant UD action against
Defendants Maria and Ana Pompa (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging a total
delinquent rent of $36,000.[2]

 
On May 24,
2023, a Notice of Unlawful Detainer (Eviction) form was filed as to all
Defendants (Maria Pompa, Ana Pompa, and All Occupants).[3]

 
On June 8,
2023, the court granted Plaintiff’s Application and Order to Serve Summons by
Posting. According to the Declaration of Diligence attached thereto (See pp.
3-4 of 4 of PDF), service was attempted by a California registered process
server, at the following times and dates upon Defendants:[4]
 
1) Attempt: May 31, 2023, 7:37 am PDT at HOME: 24 Spyglass Avenue,
Pomona, CA 91766 No answer. Quiet. 
 
2) Attempt: Jun 1, 2023, 4:47 pm PDT at HOME: 24 Spyglass Avenue,

5) Attempt: Jun 4, 2023, 6:59 am PDT at HOME: 24 Spyglass Avenue,
Pomona, CA 91766 No answer. Quiet.
 
On June 14,
2023 at 6:19 PM, Defendants, via a registered process server, were served with
the Summons-Eviction; Complaint - Unlawful Detainer; Civil Case Cover Sheet;
Plaintiff's Mandatory Cover Sheet And Supplemental Allegations-Unlawful
Detainer via posting and certified mail.[5]

 
On July 10,
2023, default and default judgment were entered against Defendants (for
possession only). 
 
On August 18,
2023, Defendants filed a Notice of Limited Scope Representation (Counsel Brian
McCoy stating he would investigate the facts and evaluate further
representation). 
 
On August 25,
2023, Defendant(s) filed a Request for Copies (of the entire case file).
 
On September
1, 2023, Defendants filed an ‘Ex-Parte Application for Stay of Execution of
Default Judgment and Order Shortening Time for Service of a Motion to Set Aside
Default Judgment,’ which the court denied on 9/08/23. That same day, Defendants
filed a Notice of Limited Scope Representation wherein Daniel Choi indicated he
would represent Defendant (Maria Pompa) at the ex parte application hearing on
9/1/23 and at the hearing on Defendants’ motion to set aside default judgment. That
same, Defendants filed the instant motion. 
 
On September
7, 2023, Plaintiff filed its opposition to both the ex-parte application and
the motion to set aside the default judgment. 
 
To date,
as of 9/27/2023 at 9 AM, no Reply has been received (due 5 court days before
hearing). 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Defendants
bring forth the motion pursuant to CCP sections 473(b) (mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect), 473(d) (improper service), 473.5 (standard for
motions to set aside default judgment), and 128(a)(8) (court’s powers in
conducting proceedings).[6]
 
CCP section 473 subdivision (b) allows a court to vacate
a prior order upon a showing that the order was entered due to a party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Additionally, the motion
“shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after
the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ. Proc.,¿§
473, subd. (b).)
 
Section 473(d) provides that “[t]he court may . . . on
motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void
judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(d).) A default judgment is void
against a defendant who was not served with a summons in the manner prescribed
by statute. (See Sakaguchi v. Sakaguchi (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 852,
858). Relief pursuant to section 473(d) may be made at any time. (See Manson,
Iver & York v. Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42).
 
Section 473.5 provides the procedure when a defendant claims she has not
received actual notice of the summons, resulting in a default and/or default
judgment. The motion “shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under oath
that the party’s lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not
caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect.” (Civ. Proc.,
section 473.5(b).) Pursuant to section (c) of the statute, when a court
determines that a defendant “lack of actual notice in time to defend the action
was not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect, it
may set aside the default or default judgment on whatever terms as may be just
and allow the party to defend the action.” 
Lastly, CCP section 128, provides that a court shall have the power “[t]o amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice.” 
 
Discussion
 
The crux of
Defendants’ motion is that they did not receive actual notice of the summons
and complaint. Defendants learned of the action on August 11, 2023 after the
property manager was “unresponsive” so one of the household members went to the
courthouse to check to see if a UD action was filed against them. (Motion p.
13:18-24; see also Maria Decl., ¶5.)
 
In
Opposition, Plaintiff advances the following rebuttals: (i) Plaintiff is
entitled to a presumption of proper service, and it is Defendants’ burden to
overcome the presumption with specific facts and credible evidence; (ii) not
all Defendants have filed declarations (Ana Pompa has not filed a declaration);
(iii) the declarations are vague; and (iv) Defendants should have known about
this case because they have not paid rent. In sum, the crux of Plaintiff’s
argument is that the fact that one of the Defendants concludes that she was not
served, without more evidence supporting the claim, is insufficient. (Opp. p.
5.)
 
Here, the court finds that Defendants have not
offered sufficient explanations and evidence to overcome the rebuttable
presumption for a few reasons.[7]  
 
First, as to Defendants’ explanation of how they learned of the lawsuit,
it is questionable. The motion only states that Maria “had a nervous feeling
because [the property manager] was being unresponsive.” (Motion p. 13:18-19.) But
that statement tacitly suggests that Defendants knew something about this case
before going to court and asking for the files. In fact, Defendants would have
received other notifications about the pendency of this action (e.g., notice of
unlawful detainer case filing, and the request for default and default
judgment), but the motion nor declarations do not speak to those other filings,
suggesting those documents were perhaps received. Thus, as the motion and
declarations appear to undermine that the basis for the motion—that they only
learned of the action based on a hunch—that argument is insufficient to
overcome Defendants’ evidentiary burden. 
 
Second, despite Defendants’ contention that they were not evading
service, the POS suggests otherwise. There were five attempts at personal
service, attempted at various hours in the day (morning and evening), but that
there was no answer/the home was quiet. Defendants have not explained (i) where
they were (home or not) or (ii) if they work and what times and where which
would be evidence to support Defendants’ contention that they were truly
ignorant of the action, which is the very basis of the motion. 
 
Third, to the extent that Defendants explain that the household has
experienced recurring instances of opened mail and missing delivered packages
suggesting that the complaint and summons could have been stolen, that is
unpersuasive for a few reasons. First, the declarations only speak to stolen packages
not stolen mail (or stolen posting(s) on the door). Second, on this
note, the declaration states that mail is opened, not that mail is stolen.
Third, the declaration states that the issue of certain opened mail has been a
problem in “the past” and specifically within the past “two months.” (Motion p.
32 of 35 of PDF.) But the summons and complaint were mailed on June 14, 2023,
which is more than two months from the filing of the declaration (8/31/2023).
Thus, as the declarations are unclear as whether mail is indeed stolen and when
this issue began/is reoccurring, this evidence is also insufficient to overcome
Defendants’ burden.   
 
All
in all, though mindful of the public policy strongly favors granting relief, the evidence, and arguments, when read in their
totality, draw into question the credibility and veracity of Defendants,
indicating that Defendants knew of the lawsuit but turned a blind eye to the
case. (See Hodge Sheet Metal Products v. Palm Springs Riviera Hotel (1961)
189 Cal.App.2d 653, 658 [“The weighing of the veracity of the affidavit
was in the province of the trial court.”].)
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion is DENIED.
