And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to set aside the default judgment and quash the writ of possession/execution. The motion was filed by the defendants, Maria and Ana Pompa, who claim they did not receive actual notice of the summons and complaint. The judge found that the defendants' explanations and evidence were insufficient to overcome the rebuttable presumption that proper service was made. The judge also found that the defendants' claims of not receiving actual notice were undermined by the fact that they had received other notifications about the pendency of the action, and that they had not provided clear evidence of how they learned of the lawsuit. The judge concluded that the defendants' arguments and evidence, when considered together, raised doubts about their credibility and veracity, indicating that they may have known about the lawsuit but chose to ignore it.
