The judge has denied the motion to set aside the default judgment and quash the writ of possession/execution. The motion was filed by the defendants, Maria and Ana Pompa, who claim they did not receive actual notice of the summons and complaint. The judge found that the defendants' explanations and evidence were insufficient to overcome the rebuttable presumption that proper service was made. The judge also found that the defendants' claims of not receiving actual notice were undermined by the fact that they had received other notifications about the pendency of the action, and that they had not provided clear evidence of how they learned of the lawsuit. The judge concluded that the defendants' arguments and evidence, when considered together, raised doubts about their credibility and veracity, indicating that they may have known about the lawsuit but chose to ignore it.

In this tentative ruling, the Judge denies the Defendants' motion to set aside the default judgment and quash any writ of possession/execution. The case is an unlawful detainer action, and the Plaintiff, Lyfestyle Properties, LLC, served a Notice to Pay Rent or Quit on May 8, 2023. On May 22, 2023, the Plaintiff filed an UD action against the Defendants, Maria and Ana Pompa, for a total delinquent rent of $36,000. On June 14, 2023, the Defendants were served with the Summons-Eviction; Complaint - Unlawful Detainer; Civil Case Cover Sheet; Plaintiff's Mandatory Cover Sheet And Supplemental Allegations-Unlawful Detainer via posting and certified mail. On July 10, 2023, default and default judgment were entered against the Defendants for possession only.

The Defendants brought forth the motion pursuant to CCP sections 473(b), 473(d), 473.5, and 128(a)(8), arguing that they did not receive actual notice of the summons and complaint. However, the Judge found that the Defendants have not offered sufficient explanations and evidence to overcome the rebuttable presumption. The crux of the Defendants' motion is that they did not receive actual notice of the summons and complaint, but the Judge found that their explanation of how they learned of the lawsuit is questionable, and despite their contention that they were not evading service, the proof suggests otherwise. Additionally, the Defendants' explanation of opened mail and missing delivered packages is unpersuasive.

Overall, when reading the evidence and arguments in totality, the Judge found that they draw into question the credibility and veracity of the Defendants, indicating that the Defendants knew of the lawsuit but turned a blind eye to the case. Therefore, the motion is denied.
