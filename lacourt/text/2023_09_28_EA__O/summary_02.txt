And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's petition for a writ of possession against Yurong Lin, but has deemed the petition moot as to ZYG World Inc. The case involves a dispute over possession of certain equipment, which the plaintiff claims is entitled to possess due to the defendants' default on a loan and security agreement. The plaintiff filed a suit against the defendants and an application for a writ of possession, which was supported by declarations and a verified complaint. The court has determined that the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and has complied with the procedural requirements for a writ of possession. The writ of possession is granted/moot, allowing the plaintiff to take possession of the equipment.
