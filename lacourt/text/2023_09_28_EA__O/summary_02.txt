And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession as to YURONG LIN, the guarantor, but not as to ZYG WORLD INC. The plaintiff, BMO HARRIS BANK N.A, alleges that it entered into two Loan and Security Agreements with the defendants, ZYG WORLD INC and YURONG LIN, and that the defendants defaulted on the loan. The plaintiff filed a complaint and two applications for writ of possession, which were denied in part. The court found that the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and that the undertaking requirements of Section 515.010 have been satisfied. The judge grants the petition for writ of possession, directing YURONG LIN to transfer possession of certain equipment to the plaintiff.

facts:
  - Plaintiff and Defendants entered into a Loan and Security Agreement and Continuing Guaranty
  - Defendants defaulted in the payment terms of the Loan and Security Agreement

  - Code Civ. Proc., § 511.090
role:
  - Plaintiff: the party seeking an order for possession
  - Defendants: the parties being sued for breach of contract and wrongful detention of property
significant\_statements:
  - "Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply for an order for a writ of possession."
  - "A plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession. The application may be supported by declarations and/or a verified complaint."
  - "The declaration supporting a writ possession application must set forth facts with particularity. A recitation of conclusions without a foundation of evidentiary facts is insufficient."
  - "The court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the plaintiff's claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking requirements of Section 515.010 are satisfied."
  - "A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.”

The Judge's tentative ruling grants BMO HARRIS BANK N.A's Writ of Possession regarding YURONG LIN, but states it is moot if the plaintiff seeks to continue with a default judgment as to both defendants. This decision is based on the fact that the plaintiff and defendants had a Loan and Security Agreement and Continuing Guaranty, and the defendants defaulted on the payment terms. The plaintiff has complied with the procedural requirements for a writ of possession, and it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on this claim. However, the ruling does not apply to ZYG World, Inc.
