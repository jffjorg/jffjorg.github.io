And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling notes that the agreements (#0001 and #7001) were entered on different dates. The contract is attached to the complaint and declaration in support of the application for a writ of possession. The current estimated wholesale value of the vehicle is $46,501.00 and the current estimated retail value of the vehicle is $51,365.00, based on present market values and authority from J.D. Power. The court also notes that the address provided for the defendants (11100 Valley Blvd., Suite 103, El Monte, CA 91731) is different from the address listed in the contract and where service of the summons and complaint was effectuated (88 S Garfield Ave Unit 264 Alhambra, CA 91801-6872).
