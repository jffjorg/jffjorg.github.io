The demurrer was filed on August 25, 2023, and the parties have failed to meet and confer in good faith, which is grounds to continue the hearing. The plaintiff's counsel failed to adequately respond to the defendant's meet and confer letter, and the court has requested that the defense counsel file a meet and confer declaration or submit the email exchange between the attorneys. The court's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง 430.41, which requires the parties to meet and confer in good faith.
