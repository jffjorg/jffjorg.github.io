[2] Defendants contend
the allegations are factually inaccurate as they paid rent for April 2022 and
June 2022 and that Plaintiff has received all the remainder rent through COVID
rent relief. (Motion p. 13:10-14.) 
 


[3] According to the
motion, Maria and her children (Ana, Abraham, and Karen) live on the property.
The court presumes all the children are over 18 years old as Ana filed an
answer in the 2021 action and Abraham’s and Karen’s declarations indicate they
are over 18 years of age. 
 


[4] In UD actions,
posting can only be used as a last resort for service of process. (CCP section
415.45(a).) The court can order service by posting only when the defendant
cannot be served personally, by mail, or by substitute service through the
exercise of reasonable diligence. (Ibid.) The plaintiff must prove by
affidavit the requirements for service by posting. (Ibid.) To determine
if the plaintiff has exercised reasonable diligence under CCP section 414.45,
the court must evaluate each case on its own facts. (Board of Trs. v. Ham (2013)
216 Cal.App.4th 330, 339.) Here, the declaration of due diligence—wherein the
registered process server attempted personal service multiple times—illustrates
that neither personal service nor substituted service were viable alternatives
as there is no indication that an adult may be found on the premises (home was
quiet or dark inside).

filed on 7/10/23. 
 


[6] The court’s analysis
will focus on the lack of actual notice of the summons and complaint. 
 


[7] As the proof of
service (POS) was proper, and Defendants do not contend otherwise, there is
rebuttable presumption that the service was proper. (Dill v. Berquist
Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1442.)
