And here is an English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a dispute over whether the defendant was properly served with a summons and complaint. The defendant claims that the allegations in the complaint are factually inaccurate, as they did pay rent for April 2022 and June 2022 and that the plaintiff has received all the remainder rent through COVID rent relief. The judge notes that the plaintiff's declaration of due diligence shows that they attempted personal service multiple times, but there is no indication that an adult was found on the premises. The judge will focus on the lack of actual notice of the summons and complaint, and will evaluate whether the plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence in serving the defendant.

## English Summary

The Judge is considering a motion by Defendants challenging the way they were served with an eviction notice.  

The Judge acknowledges that Defendants claim they paid rent and received COVID relief funds, mitigating the Plaintiff's claims. The Judge also notes that service by posting is generally a last resort and requires proof of reasonable diligence.  The Plaintiff's process server attempted multiple personal service attempts and found no one at the property, suggesting reasonable efforts.

The Judge states they will focus on whether Defendants actually received notice of the eviction proceedings, as the Proof of Service appears to be valid.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a court hearing. The case involves a dispute over unpaid rent and service of process. The defendants claim that the allegations in the complaint are factually inaccurate, as they paid rent for April and June 2022, and the plaintiff has received the remainder of the rent through COVID rent relief. The judge notes that the defendants, including Maria and her adult children (Ana, Abraham, and Karen), live on the property. The judge also discusses the requirements for service of process by posting, citing relevant laws and case citations. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to serve the defendants personally, and that the service by posting was proper. The judge's analysis focuses on the lack of actual notice of the summons and complaint, but notes that there is a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper. Overall, the judge's tentative ruling suggests that the court will focus on the technical aspects of service of process and the defendants' contentions regarding the allegations in the complaint.
