And here is an English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a dispute over whether the defendant was properly served with a summons and complaint. The defendant claims that the allegations in the complaint are factually inaccurate, as they did pay rent for April 2022 and June 2022 and that the plaintiff has received all the remainder rent through COVID rent relief. The judge notes that the plaintiff's declaration of due diligence shows that they attempted personal service multiple times, but there is no indication that an adult was found on the premises. The judge will focus on the lack of actual notice of the summons and complaint, and will evaluate whether the plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence in serving the defendant.
