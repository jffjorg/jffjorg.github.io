And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains in part the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) by Kidder Matthews, Inc. (Kidder Matthews) against Gage Developments I LLC, Gage Developments II LLC, and Gage Developments III LLC (Plaintiffs). The ruling finds that the FAC fails to allege sufficient facts to support the fourth cause of action (negligent misrepresentation) and sustains the demurrer to that cause of action. However, the ruling overrules the demurrer to the third cause of action (fraud and deceit) and the fifth cause of action (unfair business practices).

The ruling finds that Kidder Matthews has not fulfilled the requirement to meet and confer with the Plaintiffs before filing the demurrer. The ruling also finds that the FAC has sufficiently alleged facts to support the third cause of action, including the concealment of material facts, breach of written contract, and fraudulent concealment.

The ruling refers to the case of Easton v. Strassburger, which established the duty of a real estate broker to inspect and disclose defects, and finds that Kidder Matthews' argument that it had no duty to disclose is not well-taken. The ruling also finds that Kidder Matthews' concealment of material facts, including the presence of hazardous substances, constitutes fraud and deceit.

The ruling grants the Plaintiffs leave to amend the FAC to cure the defects identified in the demurrer. The ruling also orders the parties to meet and confer before the hearing to see if they can reach an agreement.
