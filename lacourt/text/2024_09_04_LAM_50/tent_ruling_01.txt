[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
MOTION BY
  DEFENDANT HALEH ALLAHVERDI FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS BY STRIKING PLAINTIFF
  SOLOMON GOLTCHE’S VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT AND AN ORDER IMPOSING
  MONETARY SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF $4,461.65 AGAINST PLAINTIFF SOLOMON
  GOLTCHE
 



            
Background
Plaintiff Solomon Goltche (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on
February 28, 2020. On May 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Verified
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against defendants Jamsheed Goltche, Hedayat
Golcheh, Haleh Allahverdi (“Allahverdi”), and “All Persons Claiming Any Legal
or Equitable Right, Title, Estate, Lien, or Interest in the Property Described
in the Complaint Adverse to Plaintiff’s Title, or Any Cloud on Plaintiff’s
Title Thereto.” The FAC alleges eleven causes of action.  
Allahverdi now moves “for Terminating Sanctions by an Order
Striking [Plaintiff’s] Verified First Amended Complaint and for an Order
Imposing Monetary Sanctions in the amount of $4,461.65 against Plaintiff.” The
motion is unopposed. 
Discussion
Misuses of the discovery
process include “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery” and “[d]isobeying a court order to provide
discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) There
are a broad range of sanctions available against anyone engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process, including the issuance of monetary,
evidentiary, issue, and terminating sanctions. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “The court may
impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: (1) An order
striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in
the misuse of the discovery process. (2) An order staying further proceedings by
that party until an order for discovery is obeyed. (3) An order
dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party. (4) An order
rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d).) 
Allahverdi notes that she previously moved for “orders (1)
compelling Plaintiff to provide responses to Allahverdi’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One, without objections; (2) ‘deeming admissions and
genuineness of documents admitted’; and (3) compelling Plaintiff to provide responses
to Allahverdi’s Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, without objections
and produce documents.” (See May 28, 2024 Order, p. 2:12-16.) On May 28,
2024, the Court issued an order granting the motions.
The Court’s May 28, 2024 Order provides, inter alia, that
“[t]he Court orders that the matters in Allahverdi’s Requests for Admission,
Set No. One to Plaintiff are deemed admitted. The Court orders Plaintiff
to serve complete verified responses, without objections, to Allahverdi’s
Special Interrogatories, Set No. One. The Court orders Plaintiff to serve
complete verified responses, without objections, and to produce responsive
documents to Allahverdi’s Demand for Production and Inspection of Documents and
Other Tangible Things, Set Number One, within 30 days of notice of this Order.”
(May 28, 2024 Order at p. 7:1-7.) In addition, the May 28, 2024 Order provides
that “[t]he Court further orders Plaintiff to pay $1,161.65 to Allahverdi
within 30 days of notice of this Order.” (Id. at
p. 7:8-9.) 
In addition, Allahverdi moved for an order compelling Plaintiff to
provide responses to Allahverdi’s Form Interrogatories – General, Sets One and
Two. On May 29, 2024, the Court issued an Order granting the motion. The
Court’s May 29, 2024 Order provides, inter alia, that “[t]he Court
orders Plaintiff to serve complete verified responses, without objections,
to Allahverdi’s s Form Interrogatories - General, Set No. One and Form
Interrogatories – General, Set No. Two, within 30 days of the date of this
Order.” (May 29, 2024 Order at p. 4:9-11.)
Allahverdi’s counsel states that “Plaintiff did not comply with
the Court’s orders to provide responses, without objections, produce documents
and pay the monetary sanctions.”  (Pugh
Decl., ¶ 19.) Allahverdi’s counsel indicates that “[o]n July 1, 2024, I wrote
to Plaintiff via e-mail ‘The court ordered you to provide responses, produce
documents and pay sanctions within 30 days. As of today, you have failed to do
so. Please provide the same by no later than Friday, July 5, 2024.’” (Pugh
Decl., ¶ 20.) Allahverdi’s counsel also indicates that “[o]n July 1, 2024, I sent
a letter by United States Mail to Plaintiff stating ‘[a]s reflected in the
attached Notices of Ruling, the Court ordered you to provide responses, produce
documents and pay sanctions within 30 days. As of today, nothing has been
received. Please provide your responses, produce documents and pay the
sanctions by July 5, 2024.’” (Pugh Decl., ¶ 21.) Allahverdi’s counsel states
that “Plaintiff did not respond.” (Pugh Decl., ¶ 22.) 
Allahverdi’s counsel further states that “[o]n July 8, 2024, Defendant’s
counsel called Plaintiff. Having reached a voicemail, Defendant’s counsel left
a message for Plaintiff to return her call…The call was followed up with email
as follows: ‘I just called to meet and confer with you, however, you were not
available. I left you a message asking that you return my call. Please kindly
either respond in writing regarding your responses to discovery or call me…Plaintiff
did not respond.” (Pugh Decl., ¶¶ 23-25.) 
Allahverdi also notes that on May 17, 2024, the Court issued a
minute order providing, inter alia, that “Plaintiff failed to appear at
the Informal Discovery Conference for a second time. Defendant Allahverdi may
proceed with the discovery motions currently set on May 28, 2024 and May 29,
2024…On the Court’s own motion, the Order to Show Cause Re: Why the Court
should not impose $250.00 in sanctions for the failure of Plaintiff Solomon
Goltche [sic] at the meet and confer IDC scheduled for 05/17/2024 is continued
to 05/20/24…” The Court’s May 20, 2024 minute order provides, inter alia,
that “[o]rder to Show Cause Re: Sanctions, in an amount up to $250.00, against
Plaintiff for Plaintiff’s Failure to Appear at the May 20, 2024 Status
Conference is scheduled for 07/12/2024…” The Court’s July 12, 2024 minute order
provides, inter alia, that “Solomon Goltche…is ordered to pay sanctions
in the amount of $250.00 to the Superior Court of California, County of Los
Angeles by 08/12/24 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 177.5 for Failure to appear on 5/20/24 and 7/12/24 and failure to
obey Court orders.”
In the motion, Allahverdi states that “[t]his Motion is made on
the ground that Plaintiff’s [sic] disobeyed orders of this Court to provide
responses, produce documents and pay monetary sanctions…” (Mot. at p. 2:8-9.) Allahverdi
asserts that “Plaintiff has disobeyed the Court order [sic] by failing to
produce documents, provide responses and pay monetary sanctions, leaving
Defendant with no choice but to seek terminating sanctions.” (Mot. at p.
9:23-25.) The Court notes that “¿the sanctioned party’s history as a repeat
offender is not only relevant, but also significant, in deciding whether to
impose terminating sanctions.¿” (¿Liberty Mutual Fire
Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrators, Inc.
(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1106¿.) “¿A decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.”¿ (¿Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280¿.) 
As discussed, on May 28, 2024 and May 29, 2024, the Court issued orders
granting Allahverdi’s subject discovery motions. Allahverdi provides evidence
that Plaintiff did not comply with the Court’s orders. (Pugh Decl., ¶ 19.) Plaintiff
does not oppose the instant motion and thus does not provide any evidence that
Plaintiff complied with the May 28, 2024 and May 29, 2024 Orders. Further, as
set forth above, the Court’s July 12, 2024 minute order in this action provides,
inter alia, that “Solomon Goltche…is ordered to pay sanctions in the
amount of $250.00 to the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles by
08/12/24 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
177.5 for Failure to appear on 5/20/24 and 7/12/24 and failure to obey
Court orders.” In instances where “¿the record is replete with instances of
delay and failure to comply with a court order, dismissal may be proper.¿” (¿Laguna
Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 489 [disapproved
on other grounds]¿.) This is particularly true where, as here, Plaintiff did not
file an opposition to the instant motion for terminating sanctions. (See Ibid. [“¿[A]ppellants
had ample opportunity to present their arguments and excuses to the trial
court. Instead, they failed to file opposition to the motion to compel or the
dismissal motion, leading the trial court and us to presume they had no
meritorious arguments.”].) The Court finds that Plaintiff’s discovery
abuse demonstrates that less severe sanctions will not produce compliance with
the discovery rules. Accordingly, terminating sanctions are appropriate. 
Allahverdi also seeks monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a), “[t]he court
may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct…If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this
title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
As discussed, the Court’s May 28, 2024 Order provides, inter
alia, that “[t]he Court orders that the matters in Allahverdi’s Requests
for Admission, Set No. One to Plaintiff are deemed admitted. The Court
orders Plaintiff to serve complete verified responses, without objections,
to Allahverdi’s Special Interrogatories, Set No. One. The Court orders
Plaintiff to serve complete verified responses, without objections, and to
produce responsive documents to Allahverdi’s Demand for Production and
Inspection of Documents and Other Tangible Things, Set Number One, within 30
days of notice of this Order.” (May 28, 2024 Order at p. 7:1-7.) As further
discussed, the Court’s May 29, 2024 Order provides, inter alia, that
“[t]he Court orders Plaintiff to serve complete verified responses, without
objections, to Allahverdi’s s Form Interrogatories - General, Set No. One
and Form Interrogatories – General, Set No. Two, within 30 days of the date of
this Order.” (May 29, 2024 Order at p. 4:9-11.) Allahverdi’s counsel states that
“Plaintiff did not comply with the Court’s orders to provide responses, without
objections, produce documents and pay the monetary sanctions.”  (Pugh Decl., ¶ 19.)
As discussed, Plaintiff does not oppose the instant motion. Thus,
the Court does not find that Plaintiff has shown that he acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of monetary sanctions unjust. 
Allahverdi seeks monetary sanctions in the total amount of $4,461.65.
Allahverdi’s counsel’s supporting declaration states that “I have spent at
least 4 hours in the review of the records and pleadings and preparing the
instant motion. I anticipate at least 3 hours reviewing the opposition and
preparing the reply and 1 hour for attending the hearing. This totals 8 hours.”
(Pugh Decl., ¶ 28.) As discussed, Plaintiff does not oppose the instant motion,
and Allahverdi did not file any reply. Thus, the Court finds that it is
reasonable to award a total of $2,811.60 in sanctions (5 hours x $550/hr. +
$61.60 in costs.) (Pugh Decl., ¶¶ 28-30.) 
Conclusion
Based
on the foregoing, Allahverdi’s motion for terminating
sanctions is granted. Plaintiff’s FAC is stricken as to Allahverdi. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,811.60
to Allahverdi within 30 days of the
date of this Order.  
Allahverdi is
ordered to provide notice of this Order.
