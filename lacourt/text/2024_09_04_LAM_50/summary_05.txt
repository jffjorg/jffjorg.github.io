And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Beaudet discloses that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck 24 years ago that developed electrical problems. After multiple attempts to repair the truck, the manufacturer and dealer agreed to take it back and refund the purchase price. The judge does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased in the case, but gives opposing parties the opportunity to file a verified statement of disqualification if they disagree. The case management conference is continued to November 7, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file a statement. The plaintiff is ordered to notify new parties who are added to the case of the disclosure and to file proof of service with the court.
