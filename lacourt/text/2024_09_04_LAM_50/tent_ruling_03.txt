  AMENDED COMPLAINT



 
Background
Plaintiff Denise Wheeler (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on September
21, 2023 against Defendant Center Street Lending Corporation. 
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on January 8, 2024
against Defendants Center Street Lending Corporation and Center Street Lending
Fund IV SPE, LLC. The FAC alleged causes of action for (1) violation of Civil Code section 2923.55 and 
(2)
violation of Business and Professions Code section
17200, et seq. 
Center Street Lending Corporation and Center Street Lending Fund IV
SPE, LLC demurred to both causes of action of the FAC and moved to strike
portions of the FAC. On May 23, 2024, the Court issued an Order sustaining the demurrer to the
first and second causes of action of the FAC, with leave to amend. The Court
also granted the motion to strike, without leave to amend. 
On June 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended
Complaint (“SAC”)
against
Defendants Center Street Lending Corporation and Center Street Lending VIII
SPE, LLC. The SAC alleges causes of action for (1) violation of Civil Code section 2923.55 and 
(2)
violation of Business and Professions Code section
17200, et seq. 
Center Street Lending Corporation, Center Street Lending Fund IV SPE,
LLC, and Center Street Lending VIII SPE, LLC (collectively, “the Center Street
Parties”) now demur to both of the causes of action of the SAC. The Center
Street Parties also move to strike portions of the SAC. Plaintiff opposes
both.  
Requests for Judicial Notice 
The Court grants the Center Street Parties’ request for judicial
notice. The Court also grants Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice. 
Demurrer 
A.    Legal Standard  
A demurrer can be used
only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack
or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) “To survive a demurrer, the
complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need
not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart
Union High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the
sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) 
B.     Allegations of the
SAC  
In the SAC, Plaintiff alleges that at all relevant times, she owned
the property located at 637 E 29th Street, Los Angeles California 90011 (the
“Property”). (SAC, ¶ 8.) Plaintiff alleges that “[t]he Property has been in
Plaintiff’s family since 1993, but she was not on title until August 2015. The
property has served as her personal and principal residence for all times
referenced herein.”  (SAC, ¶ 9.) “In
mid-2015, a fire virtually destroyed most of the Property and left it in severe
disrepair. As a result, Plaintiff received insurance proceeds to fix the
Property so that she and her family could continue residing therein. Thus,
Plaintiff alleges that the Property is Security for a loan made for purposes of
personal, family, or household purposes. This is also when Plaintiff was put on
title to the Property.” (SAC, ¶ 10.) 
            “On
August 20, 2015, Plaintiff received a refinance from Defendant CENTER STREET in
the amount of $350,000.00.” (SAC, ¶ 12.) “In the loan origination process and
knowing Plaintiff lived in the Property, Plaintiff was told to use a different
address for her personal residence.” (SAC, ¶ 13, emphasis omitted.) Plaintiff
alleges that “CENTER STREET knew Plaintiff’s only residence was the property
but was told to use a different address to fund the loan.” (SAC, ¶ 13.) “Plaintiff,
as an ordinary consumer, did not know the implications of doing so and executed
the documents with a different address.” (SAC, ¶ 14.) “In February 2016, the
loan came due, and Plaintiff was unable to pay the balloon amount.” (SAC, ¶ 15.)
            “In September 2017, CENTER STREET
filed a Notice of Default. On December 26, 2017, CENTER STREET filed a Notice
of Trustee’s Sale…” (SAC, ¶ 16.) “On January 18, 2018, Plaintiff filed for
Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. Plaintiff made payments throughout the bankruptcy until
early 2023 when CENTER STREET filed a Motion for Relief from stay.” (SAC, ¶ 17.)
“The Bankruptcy court granted the Motion for Relief from stay and CENTER STREET
recorded a new Notice of Default on May 31, 2023.” (SAC, ¶ 18.) Plaintiff
alleges that she “lived in the Property as her principal residence when the
Notice of Default was recoded [sic] on May 31, 2023.” (SAC, ¶ 19.) Plaintiff
alleges that “[o]n September 5, 2023, Defendant recorded a Notice of Trustee’s
Sale and set the property for auction on October 3, 2023. Despite the fact that
Defendant failed to contact Plaintiff to “assess her financial situation and
explore options to avoid foreclosure” as required by Civil
Code 2923.55, Defendant intends to proceed the sale [sic]…” (SAC, ¶ 21.) 
C.     First and Second Causes of Action 
Pursuant to Civil Code section 2923.55, subdivision (a), “[a] mortgage servicer,
mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or authorized agent shall not record a notice
of default pursuant to Section 2924 until all of
the following: (1) The mortgage servicer has satisfied the requirements of paragraph
(1) of subdivision (b).
(2) Either 30 days after initial contact is made as required by
paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) or 30 days after satisfying the due diligence
requirements as described in subdivision (f). (3) The mortgage servicer complies with
subdivision (c) of Section 2923.6, if the borrower
has provided a complete application as defined in subdivision (h) of Section 2923.6.” 
The Center Street Parties argue
that, “at the time the NOD was recorded, neither of
the Defendants were the current ‘mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee,
beneficiary, or authorized agent.’ Rather, Center Street VIII was the
beneficiary at the time…As a result, Defendants are no longer the beneficiary
of record and Plaintiff cannot pursue any claims against them based on an
alleged violation of Section 2923.55.” (Demurrer
at p. 5:17-22, emphasis omitted.) 
The Center Street Parties cite to Exhibit “G” to their request for
judicial notice, which is an “Assignment of Beneficial Interest Under Deed of
Trust” recorded on recorded on September 4, 2019. (Center Street Parties’ RJN,
¶ 7, Ex. G.) This Assignment provides, inter alia, that “BY THIS
ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST UNDER DEED OF TRUST…dated to be effective as
of August 1, Center Street Lending Fund IV SPE, LLC, a Delaware Limited
Liability Company (‘Assignor’)…does by these presents grant, bargain, sell,
assign, transfer and set over unto Center Street Lending VIII SPE, LLC…all of
Assignor’s right, title and interest as Beneficiary under that certain Deed of
Trust dated August 10, 2015 executed by Denise L. Wheeler…” (Ibid.) As an initial matter, Center
Street Lending VIII SPE, LLC is a defendant named in the SAC. Thus, it is
unclear why the Center Street Parties contend that that “neither of the
Defendants were the current ‘mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee,
beneficiary, or authorized agent.’” (Demurrer at p. 5:18-19.) The Center Street
Parties acknowledge that “Center Street VIII[1]
was the beneficiary at the time.” (Demurrer at p. 5:19, emphasis omitted.) However,
as discussed below, the Court grants the Center Street Parties’ motion to
strike Center Street Lending VIII SPE, LLC as a defendant from the SAC.  
In any event, the SAC further alleges that “CENTER STREET LENDING
CORPORATION…is a California stock corporation engaged primarily in residential
mortgage banking and/or related business and was the beneficiary or servicer of
Plaintiff’s loan during the operative time period herein.” (SAC, ¶ 6.) The
Center Street Parties do not appear to make any argument that Center Street
Lending Corporation was not the servicer of the loan.  
The Center Street Parties also assert that “[b]ecause no facts are
alleged against Center Street IV, the Demurrer should be sustained without
leave to amend as to Center Street IV.” (Demurrer at p. 5:27-28.) But as noted
by Plaintiff, Center Street Lending Fund IV SPE, LLC is not a defendant
named in the SAC. In addition, on August 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request
for dismissal as to Center Street Lending Fund IV SPE, LLC, and dismissal was
entered as requested on August 26, 2024. 

D.    First Cause of Action for Violation of Civil
Code Section 2923.55
In the first cause of
action, Plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that “Defendant recorded the NOD
without sending the NOD to Plaintiff or contacting Plaintiff ‘in person or by
telephone’ to assess her financial situations and explore options to avoid
foreclosure. Additionally, the Notice of Trustee’s Sale (‘NOTS’) also fails to
include the above required declaration and is not appropriately executed, thus
Defendants violated Cal. Civ. Code§ 2923.55.”
(SAC, ¶ 26.) Plaintiff alleges that “[s]ince Defendant also failed to notify or correspond with Plaintiff
in writing concerning her options regarding the NOD and alleged default,
Defendants recorded the NOD in violation of Cal. Civ.
Code § 2923.55.” (SAC, ¶ 27.) 
The Center Street Parties argue that “HBOR does not apply
to Plaintiff’s business loan.” (Demurrer at p. 6:5.) The Center Street Parties cite
to Civil Code section 2923.55, subdivision (h), which provides that “[t]his section shall apply only to
mortgages or deeds of trust described in Section
2924.15.” Pursuant to Civil Code section 2924.15,
subdivision (a)(1), “[u]nless
otherwise provided, paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of Section
2924 and Sections 2923.5, 2923.55, 2923.6, 2923.7,
2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11, and 2924.18 shall apply only to a first lien
mortgage or deed of trust that meets either of the following conditions: (1) (A) The first lien mortgage or deed of trust is
secured by owner-occupied residential real property containing no more than
four dwelling units. (B) For purposes of this paragraph, ‘owner-occupied’
means that the property is the principal residence of the borrower and is
security for a loan made for personal, family, or household purposes.” (Emphasis
added.) 
The Center Street Parties assert that “[i]n the Bankruptcy, filed in
2018, Plaintiff certified under penalty of perjury that she rented out the
Subject Property for profit.” (Demurrer at p. 6:22-23.) The Center Street
Parties cite to, inter alia, Exhibit I to their request for judicial notice,
which is a “Debtor’s Post Confirmation Status Conference Report No. 1;
Declaration of Denise Wheeler in Support Thereof” filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the Central District of California in the matter In re: Denise
Wheeler, Case No. 2:18-bk-10597 (the “Bankruptcy Matter”), on April 30,
2020. (Center Street Parties’ RJN, ¶ 9, Ex. I.) Exhibit I provides, inter
alia, that “Debtor also generates rental income from rental property in the
amount of $4,500 per month. The major assets of the estate are: Debtor’s rental
property located at 637 E. 29th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90011 (the ‘Rental
Property/Real Property’), two vehicles and other personal assets.” (Center
Street Parties’ RJN, ¶ 9, Ex. I, p. 2.) The Center Street Parties also cite to
Exhibit F to their request for judicial notice, which is a “Stipulation for
Chapter 11 Plan Treatment and Order Dismissing Objection to Proof of Claim with
Prejudice” filed in Bankruptcy Matter on August 27, 2019. (Center Street
Parties’ RJN, ¶ 6, Ex F.) Exhibit F provides, inter alia, that “[o]n
August 10, 2015, Debtor executed a Note secured by real property commonly known
as 637 East 29th Street Los Angeles, CA 90011 (‘Property’) pursuant
to a Deed of Trust…On January 18, 2018, Debtor filed the current Chapter 11
bankruptcy case and alleging the value of the Property to be $500,000.00. The
Debtor is continuing in possession of the Property, and operating and managing
the Property as a rental income property, as debtor-in-possession pursuant to
Bankruptcy Code Sections 1107 and 1108.” (Center
Street Parties’ RJN, ¶ 6, Ex F, pp. 1-2.) 
The Center Street Parties assert that “[d]espite the opportunity to
amend her allegations, Plaintiff fails to address her prior pleadings from the
Bankruptcy wherein she repeatedly stated and represented in pleadings that the
Subject Property was a rental property from which she earned rental income.
Nothing in the SAC reconciles how these representations are consistent with her
new position that the Loan, which she obtained to refinance the purchase of the
Subject Property, was for personal, family, or household purposes. As such, the
Court should disregard Plaintiff’s inconsistent allegations in the SAC that
inaccurately attempt to characterize the Loan as one that was used for
personal, family, or household purposes.” (Demurrer at p. 7:8-14, emphasis
omitted.)[2] 
As an initial matter, as discussed above, the Center Street Parties
cite to certain filings in the Bankruptcy Matter which reference the property
at 637 East 29th Street Los Angeles, California 90011 as a “rental”
property. However, this argument appears to concern whether the subject property
is “the principal residence of the borrower,” not whether the property is “security
for a loan made for personal, family, or household purposes.” (Civ. Code, § 2924.15, subd. (a)(1)(B).) The Center
Street Parties do not appear to point to any filings in the Bankruptcy Matter
stating that the subject loan was not made for “personal, family, or household
purposes.” (Ibid.)
Plaintiff notes that the SAC alleges that “[t]he property has served
as her personal and principal residence for all times referenced herein.
Plaintiff lived in one unit, while her family members resided in the other unit,”
and that “the Property is Security for a loan made for purposes of personal,
family, or household purposes.” (SAC, ¶¶ 9, 10.) Plaintiff alleges that “[i]n
mid-2015, a fire virtually destroyed most of the Property and left it in severe
disrepair,” and that “Plaintiff received the loan as a refinance of her
existing mortgage and after her insurance company paid out repairs to the
fire-damaged property.” (SAC, ¶¶ 10, 23.) 
The Center Street Parties also assert that “the subject property was
not owner-occupied.” (Demurrer at p. 7:16.) As set forth above, Civil Code section 2924.15, subdivision (a)(1) provides that
“[u]nless otherwise provided, paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of
Section 2924 and Sections
2923.5, 2923.55, 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11, and 2924.18
shall apply only to a first lien mortgage or deed of trust that meets either of
the following conditions: (1)(A) The first lien mortgage or deed of trust is secured by owner-occupied
residential real property containing no more than four dwelling units. (B) For purposes
of this paragraph, ‘owner-occupied’ means that the property is the
principal residence of the borrower and is security for a loan made for
personal, family, or household purposes.” (Emphasis added.) 
The Center Street Parties cite
to, inter alia, Exhibit E to their request for judicial notice, which is
a “Voluntary Petition for Individuals Filing for Bankruptcy”
filed in the Bankruptcy Matter on January 18, 2018. (Center Street Parties’ RJN,
¶ 5, Ex. E.) The Center Street Parties note that page 2 of the Petition
states, inter alia, “1191 1/2 West 38th Street Los Angeles, CA 90037”
after “Where you live.” (Center Street Parties’ RJN, ¶ 5, Ex. E, p. 2.) The Center Street Parties also cite to Exhibit U to their
request for judicial notice, which is a “Declaration of Lionel E. Giron in
Support of Application for Compensation for Law Offices of Lionel E. Giron
Period January 2, 2019 through April 18, 2023” filed in the Bankruptcy Matter
on May 23, 2023. (Center Street Parties’ RJN, ¶ 21, Ex. U.) The Center Street Parties note that Exhibit U states, inter
alia, “[o]n April 19, 2023 my office served a copy of the Application for
Compensation to Mrs. Wheeler at 1191 ½ West 38th Street, Los Angeles, CA
90037.” (Center Street Parties’ RJN, ¶ 21, Ex. U, ¶ 5.) 
In the opposition to the demurrer, Plaintiff asserts that “the
property was owner occupied when the notice of default was recorded.” (Opp’n at
p. 6:26-27.) As discussed, the SAC alleges “[t]he Bankruptcy court granted the
Motion for Relief from stay and CENTER STREET recorded a new Notice of Default
on May 31, 2023.” (SAC, ¶ 18.) Plaintiff now alleges that “Plaintiff lived in
the Property as her principal residence when the Notice of Default was recoded
on May 31, 2023.” (SAC, ¶ 19.) 
Next, the Center Street Parties
assert that “Plaintiff is unable to plead a material violation.” (Demurrer at
p. 8:19.) They cite to Civil Code section 2924.12, subdivision (b), which provides in pertinent part that “[a]fter a trustee’s deed
upon sale has been recorded, a mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee,
beneficiary, or authorized agent shall be liable to a borrower for actual
economic damages pursuant to Section 3281,
resulting from a material violation of Section
2923.55, 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11, or 2924.17 by that
mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or authorized agent where
the violation was not corrected and remedied prior to the recordation of the
trustee’s deed upon sale...” The Center Street Parties cite to Billesbach v. Specialized Loan Servicing LLC (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 830, 837,
where the Court of Appeal noted that “[f]irst, by its terms, the HBOR
creates liability only for material violations that have not been remedied
before the foreclosure sale is recorded.” 
The Center Street Parties argue that here, “the fact that
Plaintiff and Center Street IV agreed to modify the terms of the Loan prior to
the recording of the pending NOD satisfies the requirements under section 2923.55.” (Demurrer at p. 9:16-17.) The
Center Street Parties cite to Exhibit F to their request for judicial notice,
which, as discussed, is a “Stipulation for Chapter 11 Plan Treatment and Order
Dismissing Objection to Proof of Claim with Prejudice” filed in Bankruptcy
Matter on August 27, 2019. (Center Street Parties’ RJN, ¶ 6, Ex. F.) The Center
Street Parties appear to note that the Stipulation provides, inter alia,
“New Loan Terms. Monthly payments on the new secured loan of $500,000.00
shall be payable monthly, at the interest rate of 8.0% fixed, all due and
payable 24 months after the date the first payment is due, with payments to
commence November 1, 2019.” (Center Street Parties’ RJN, ¶ 6, Ex F, p. 4.) The Stipulation
provides that “[t]he original loan amount was $350,000.00, and the Note
provided for a non-default interest rate of 11% and a default interest rate of
30%. The original maturity date on the Note was February 8, 2016, which was
later extended by mutual agreement to August 8, 2016.” (Id.
at p. 2.) 
The Center Street Parties cite to Schmidt
v. Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28
Cal.App.5th 1109, 1121, where the Court of Appeal noted as follows: 
 
“We further conclude that SPS complied with the requirements of
former section 2923.55, subdivision (b)(2) by
fully reviewing and processing the Schmidts’ loan modification application
before recording the notice of default. (See, e.g., Hutchful v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (9th
Cir. 2012) 471 Fed. Appx. 693, 694 [trial court had “properly construed the
notice requirement of California Civil Code § 2923.5 as having been met by [the
borrower’s] extensive discussions with [the lender] regarding loan modification”]; Bell v.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (C.D.Cal., Oct.
28, 2014, No. CV 14-4316-JFW(MRWx)) 2014 WL
12611283, p. *3 [loan modification review satisfies the requirement that
the lender assess the borrower’s financial situation and explore
alternatives to foreclosure]; Keng Hee Paik v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. (N.D.Cal., Aug. 3, 2011,
No. C 10-04016 WHA) 2011 WL 3359697, p. *3 [lender’s
review of two loan modification applications demonstrated “conclusive[]
compli[ance]” with former § 2923.5, predecessor
statute to former § 2923.55].).” 
In the opposition, Plaintiff asserts that “the undisputed
evidence shows that Plaintiff was never considered for a loan workout option
prior to Defendant recording the Notice of Default at issue, as the Notice of
Default makes clear that Defendant believed it had no obligation to do so.”
(Opp’n at p. 10:1-4, emphasis omitted.) But Plaintiff does not identify what
“undisputed evidence” she is referring to. As discussed, the SAC alleges that
“[t]he Bankruptcy court granted the Motion for Relief from stay and CENTER
STREET recorded a new Notice of Default on May 31, 2023,” and that “[o]n
September 5, 2023, Defendant recorded a Notice of Trustee’s Sale and set the
property for auction on October 3, 2023.” (SAC, ¶¶ 18, 21, emphasis added.) The
subject “Stipulation for Chapter 11 Plan Treatment and Order Dismissing
Objection to Proof of Claim with Prejudice” was filed on August 27, 2019,
before the alleged May 31, 2023 notice of default and September 5, 2023 notice
of trustee’s sale. (Center Street Parties’ RJN, ¶ 6, Ex F.) In Billesbach v. Specialized Loan Servicing LLC, supra, 63 Cal.App.5th at pages
837-838, cited by Plaintiff, the Court of Appeal noted that as
follows: 
 
“First, by
its terms, the HBOR creates liability only for material violations that have
not been remedied before the foreclosure sale is recorded. A material
violation is one that affected the borrower’s loan obligations, disrupted the
borrower’s loan-modification process, or otherwise harmed the borrower. Based
on these principles, we hold that where a mortgage servicer[’]s violations stem
from its failure to communicate with the borrower before recording a notice of
default, the servicer may cure these violations by doing what respondent did
here: postponing the foreclosure sale, communicating with the borrower about
potential foreclosure alternatives, and fully considering any application by
the borrower for a loan modification. Following these corrective measures,
any remaining violation relating to the recording of the notice of default is
immaterial, and a new notice of default is therefore not required to avoid
liability. We do not endorse respondent’s conduct in failing to communicate
with appellant before initiating foreclosure 
proceedings and
failing to comply with other statutory requirements. Mortgage servicers should
take care to comply with their statutory obligations in the first
instance, rather than seek to cure violations after a borrower has sued them.
We conclude only that appellant has provided no basis for liability under the
HBOR.” (Emphasis added.) 
Plaintiff also argues in the opposition that “the Stipulation for
Chapter 11 Plan Treatment and Order Dismissing Objection To Proof of Claim was
not a formal foreclosure workout option. It was an agreement in bankruptcy
governing how Defendant’s claim would be paid through Plaintiff’s Chapter 11
Plan.” (Opp’n at p. 9:18-21.) But Plaintiff does not appear to cite any legal
authority to support the proposition that the subject Stipulation was “not a
formal foreclosure workout option.” (Opp’n at p. 9:19.) Plaintiff does not
appear to dispute that the terms of the subject loan were modified before the May
21, 2023 notice of default was recorded. (SAC, ¶ 18.)
Based on the foregoing, the Court sustains the Center Street Parties’
demurrer to the first cause of action of the SAC. 
 
E.    
Second Cause of Action for Violation of Business and Professions Code Section 17200 et seq.
 
“The
UCL does not proscribe specific activities, but broadly prohibits any unlawful,
unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising. The UCL governs anti-competitive business practices as
well as injuries to consumers, and has as a major purpose the preservation of
fair business competition. By proscribing any unlawful business practice, section 17200 borrows violations of other laws and
treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes
independently actionable. Because…section 17200 is written in the disjunctive, it
establishes three varieties of unfair competition—acts or practices which are
unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent.” (Puentes v. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 638, 643-644 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)

The Center Street Parties assert that “[h]ere, Plaintiff’s second
cause of action is derivative of her first cause of action…For the reasons
discussed above, the first cause of action fails and it follows that
Plaintiff’s derivative second cause of action also fails.” (Demurrer at p.
10:7-9.) The Center Street Parties cite to paragraph 34 of the SAC, which
alleges that “Defendant’s violation of California
Civil Code § 2923.55 constitute [sic] unfair business practices in
violation of California Business and Professions Code
§ 17200 et seq.” (SAC, ¶ 34.)
In the opposition, Plaintiff asserts that “[s]ince Plaintiff has
sufficiently alleged their [sic] underlying claims, his [sic] claim for
violation of Civil Code § 17200 is also
sufficiently alleged.” (Opp’n at p. 11:15-16.) As set forth above, the Court
sustains the Center Street Parties’ demurrer to the first cause of action of
the SAC.
The Center Street Parties also argue that “Plaintiff must show that
the allegedly wrongful conduct caused economic injury. While she provides a
generic list of alleged injuries, she fails to allege facts showing how the
alleged misconduct caused these purported injuries.” (Demurrer at p. 10:24-26.)
Plaintiff does not appear to respond to or dispute this argument in the
opposition. The Center Street Parties cite to Business
and Professions Code section 17204, which provides in pertinent part that
“[a]ctions for relief pursuant to this chapter shall be prosecuted exclusively
in a court of competent jurisdiction…by a person who has suffered injury in
fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.” The
second cause of action alleges that “Plaintiff was injured and suffered actual
damages including but not limited to, loss of money and property, loss of
reputation and goodwill, and severe emotional distress, according to proof at
trial but within the jurisdiction of this Court[.]” (SAC, ¶ 39.) However, as
noted by the Center Street Parties, Plaintiff does not appear to allege facts
showing how the alleged misconduct caused these purported injuries.[3]
Based on the foregoing, the Court sustains the Center Street Parties’ demurrer
to the second cause of action of the SAC.[4] 
Motion to Strike 
A court may strike any “irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading” or any part of
a pleading “not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule, or an order of the court.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 436.) “The grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on the face
of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to
take judicial notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)

The Center Street Parties move to strike Center Street Lending VIII
SPE, LLC as a defendant from the SAC. 
The Center Street Parties note that the FAC named defendants Center
Street Lending Corporation and Center Street Lending Fund IV SPE, LLC. As
discussed, on May 23, 2024, the Court issued an Order sustaining Center Street
Lending Corporation and Center Street Lending Fund IV SPC, LLC’s demurrer to
the first and second causes of action of the FAC, with leave to amend. As noted
by the Center Street Parties, in the May 23, 2024 Order, “[t]he Court did not
order or otherwise authorize Plaintiff to add a new party, such as Center
Street VIII.” (Mot. at p. 1:28.) 
The Center Street Parties cite to Taliaferro
v. Davis (1963) 220 Cal.App.2d
793, 795, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[l]eave of court is
required under section 473 of the Code of Civil
Procedure to add new parties defendant.” (Internal quotations omitted.) The
Taliaferro Court found that “the trial court was correct in striking the
amended complaint because of plaintiff’s attempt, without permission of court,
to add Dorothy Davis as a party defendant…” (Ibid.)

In the opposition, Plaintiff contends that “in opposing the Demurrer
to First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff plainly asked for leave to amend to add
the current beneficiary into the loan…Therefore, Defendant’s motion to strike
fails and should be overruled.” (Opp’n at p. 2:18-21.) But Plaintiff does not
appear to dispute that the Court did not grant her leave to amend the FAC to
add Center Street Lending VIII SPE, LLC as a defendant. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court grants the Center Street Parties’ motion
to strike Center Street Lending VIII SPE, LLC as a defendant from the SAC,
without leave to amend. 
Conclusion 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court sustains the Center Street Parties’ demurrer to the first
and second causes of action of the SAC. The Court is inclined to sustain the
demurrer with leave to amend, because the Center Street Parties’ argument that
“Plaintiff is unable to plead a material violation” (Demurrer at p. 8:19) was
not addressed in the Court’s May 23, 2024 Order on the previous demurrer to the
FAC. The May 23, 2024 Order also did not address the Center Street Parties’
argument concerning economic injury as to the second cause of
action. 
The Court grants
the Center Street Parties’ motion to strike, without leave to amend. 
The Court orders
Plaintiff to file and serve an amended complaint, if any, within 20 days of the
date of this order. If no amended complaint is filed within 20 days, the Court
orders the Center Street Parties to file and serve a proposed judgment of
dismissal within 30 days of the date of this Order.¿¿¿
