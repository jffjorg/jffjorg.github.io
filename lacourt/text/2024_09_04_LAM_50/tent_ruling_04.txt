[1]The Center Street
Parties do not appear to include the full name of this entity, or argue that it
is distinct from Center Street Lending VIII SPE, LLC. 
 


[2]The Center Street Parties cite to State of California ex rel. Metz v. CCC
Information Services, Inc. (2007)
149 Cal.App.4th 402, 412, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[t]he
complaint should be read as containing the judicially noticeable facts, even
when the pleading contains an express allegation to the contrary…A plaintiff
may not avoid a demurrer by pleading facts or positions in an amended complaint
that contradict the facts pleaded in the original complaint or by suppressing
facts which prove the pleaded facts false.” (Internal quotations omitted.)
 


[3]As to the second
cause of action, the Center Street Parties also argue that “Plaintiff must show
that there is ongoing conduct in order to succeed…A violation under the UCL
cannot remedy past conduct that is not ongoing.” (Demurrer at p. 10:19-23.)
However, the Center Street Parties do not appear to cite any legal authority to
support this argument. 
 


[4]Plaintiff also
asserts in the opposition that “Defendants completely fail to demur to
Plaintiff’s claim for violation of Business and
Professions Code § 17200.” (Opp’n at p. 11:17-18.) It is unclear why
Plaintiff makes this argument. The Center Street Parties’ demurrer concerns
both the first and second causes of action of the SAC. (See Demurrer at
p. 3.) In addition, as discussed above, the memorandum of points and
authorities in support of the demurrer discusses the second cause of action.
