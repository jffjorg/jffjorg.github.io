And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Teresa A. Beaudet, has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for approval of the settlement of Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) claims without prejudice. The motion was filed by Plaintiffs Noel Van Wagner and Veronica Andrade against Defendant Westlake Properties, Inc. The settlement agreement has several defects, including a definition of "Covered Period" that exceeds the one-year statute of limitations, failure to define "Covered Employees" in accordance with Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (c)(1), and lack of provision for submitting the order to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA). The Court also notes that the settlement agreement does not contain any provision specifying when the release will be effective. The Court will require Plaintiffs to provide notice of this ruling.
