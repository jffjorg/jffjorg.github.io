Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is based on the information presented before the hearing. The case is about a loan dispute between Plaintiff Stephanie Gauss and Defendants David De Wispelaere, Annie Maes, and Maes Capital. The Plaintiff alleges that the loan is in violation of federal lending laws and that the Defendants did not provide adequate disclosures.

The Judge's ruling sustains the demurrer to the second, third, sixth, and eighth causes of action with 20 days leave to amend, except for the seventh, ninth, and tenth causes of action which are sustained without leave to amend. The Judge also grants the motion to strike the seventh, ninth, and tenth causes of action.

The Judge continues the motion to augment bond to August 26, 2024, and orders the Defendants to give notice of this ruling. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff may not add new causes of action that were not previously raised in the amended pleading.
