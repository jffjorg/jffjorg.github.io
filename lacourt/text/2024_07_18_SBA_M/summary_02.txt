And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Timmons of Long Beach to the Complaint of Sergio Miloban Suarez. The Court has sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. The Complaint alleges that the Plaintiff's 2021 Volkswagen Atlas suffers from electrical, engine, steering, and suspension system defects and that the Defendant, Timmons of Long Beach, is liable for negligent repair. The Court has determined that the Complaint fails to state a cause of action for Negligent Repair because it does not allege facts sufficient to demonstrate a duty of care that was owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff. The Court has also determined that the Complaint does not allege facts sufficient to demonstrate economic damages. The Plaintiff has been given 20 days to amend the Complaint to address these issues.
