And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Ronald Williams' motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, set six, and has also granted his request for sanctions. The motion was filed in a wrongful death lawsuit against Torrance Memorial Medical Center, where Williams' wife, Chionese Agee, died after surgery. The judge found that the defendant's responses to the interrogatories were incomplete, evasive, and non-responsive, and therefore ordered the defendant to serve further responses without objections within 10 days. The judge also granted sanctions in the amount of $1,862.25, which was calculated based on the time and effort required to prepare and appear at the hearing.
