TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Ronald Williams’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special

            Background
 
            Plaintiff
filed the Complaint on January 6, 2023. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff’s
wife, Chionese Agee, died on November 9, 2022, after surgery at defendant’s
hospital. Plaintiff alleges the following cause of action: 1. Wrongful Death.
 
            Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories 
 
Where
responses to interrogatories have been served but the requesting party believes
that they are deficient because the answers are evasive or incomplete, or,
because an objection is without merit, that party may move for an order
compelling a further response.  CCP §
2030.300(a).  Notice of the motion must
be given within 45 days after service of verified responses in question, or any
verified supplemental responses.  CCP §
2030.300(c).  The motion must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration in compliance with CCP §
2016.040.  CCP § 2030.300(b).
 
Meet and Confer
 
Plaintiff
set forth a meet and confer declaration in substantial compliance with CCP §§
2031.310(b)(2) and 2016.040.  (Declaration, Neil Howard ¶¶
11-15.)
 
Motion
 
Plaintiff moves for an order for further responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set Six, Numbers 161 to 186 from Defendant Torrance
Memorial Medical Center.  Defendant failed
to file a timely written opposition to the motion. 
 
The special interrogatories at issue simply seek facts
that may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in this action.
Defendant’s responses are incomplete, evasive, non-responsive, and Defendant
has failed to justify its objections.  
 
Defendant is ordered to serve further responses,
without objections, within 10 days of this date. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions is granted.
Defendant is sanctioned the total amount of $1,862.25 which was calculated at 4
hours to prepare and appear at $450/hour, plus $62.25 filing fee. Sanctions are
payable within 30 days of this date.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
