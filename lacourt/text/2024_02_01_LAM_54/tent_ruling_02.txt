Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
Moving Party: David R. Shoop and Thomas S. Alch,
Counsel of Record for Defendant Security Systems, Inc.
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:   THE MOTION IS
GRANTED. COUNSEL TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF ORDER ON DEFENDANT WITHIN 5 DAYS
OF NOTICE OF RULING. COUNSEL WILL BE RELIEVED UPON FILING OF PROOF OF SERVICE
OF ORDER.
 
COUNSEL TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the
tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing counsel
(or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
The Court may issue an order allowing
an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (CCP § 284.) 
The attorney may withdraw from representation where the withdrawal would
not result in undue prejudice to the client’s interest—that is, counsel cannot
withdraw at a critical point in the litigation. 
(Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see
California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
David R. Shoop and Thomas S. Alch seek
to withdraw from representation of Defendant SSI. Counsel state that the
attorney-client relationship has broken down due to nonpayment of fees. Trial
has been completed; no prejudice will result from counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel
has complied with CRC 3.1362. 
 
There is good cause for counsel’s
withdrawal. The motion is GRANTED.

(4) Motions to Compel Responses to
Discovery[1]
Moving Party: Plaintiff Vanowen Real Estate
Partners
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:   PLAINTIFF’S
MOTIONS ARE GRANTED.
 
DEFENDANTS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES
TO THE SUBJECT DISCOVERY, WITHOUT OBJECTION, WITHIN 15 DAYS OF NOTICE OF
RULING.
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS ARE GRANTED
IN THE REDUCED AMOUNT OF $820.32 AGAINST EACH DEFENDANT.
 
PLAINTIFFS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the
tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing counsel
(or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
“If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it. . .  [t]he party to whom
the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product. . . .  The party making
the demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.”  (CCP § 2031.300(a)–(b).) When timely
responses to interrogatories are not received, “[t]he party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.”  (CCP § 2030.290(b).) 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel responses to
post-judgment SIs and RPDs from Defendants Lali Fizli and Maritza Aguilar. Plaintiff
served the discovery on February 24, 2023. Responses were due on March 29,
2023. As of the date of these motions, Plaintiff has not received responses.
Defendants have not opposed this motion to show that responses have been
served. The motions are GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff requests $820.32 in sanctions
for each of the four motions. As the motions are largely duplicative, the Court
will allow $820.32 in total sanctions against each Defendant.
