And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendant, Advanced Systems Technology Spray Depot, LLC, to the plaintiff's complaint alleging a violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). The plaintiff, Miguel Esparaza, alleges that the defendant's website chat feature recorded his conversation without his knowledge or consent. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claim does not state a valid claim under CIPA because it does not apply to website chats. However, the judge declines to determine at the pleading stage that there can be no violation of CIPA here, citing case law that has interpreted the alleged conduct to fall within the scope of CIPA. Therefore, the judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer.
