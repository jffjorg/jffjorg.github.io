And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to continue the trial, which was made to allow the court to hear a second motion for summary judgment. The defendants had not provided sufficient evidence to show good cause for the continuance, and the court is not obligated to continue the trial to accommodate a motion for summary judgment that has not been filed in a timely manner. The judge has previously denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication, and the defendants have not established any new facts or circumstances that would warrant a second motion for summary judgment.
