  Case Number:  20STCV19549    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2024    Dept:  74 Joanne Capriotto, et al. v. Robinson
Helicopter Company, Incorporated, et al.
 
Specially Appearing Defendant Moog,
Inc.’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint.
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from a helicopter
accident.
            On
May 20, 2020, Plaintiffs Joanne Capriotto, Jenny Aidala, John Capriotto, and
Catherine Capriotto (Capriotto Plaintiffs) filed a complaint against Robinson
Helicopter Company, Incorporated.
            On
May 21, 2020, Jessica R. Croce, Dominic Louis Croce, and Dante Gregory Croce
(Croce Plaintiffs) filed a complaint against Robinson Helicopter Company,
Incorporated.
            On
July 28, 2022, the Capriotto Plaintiffs amended their complaint to include
Moog, Inc. (Specially Appearing Defendant) as a defendant. So, too, did the
Croce Plaintiffs.
            On
February 6, 2023, Specially Appearing Defendant filed this motion to quash service
of the summons and complaints based on lack of personal jurisdiction.
LEGAL STANDARD
            “A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a
notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him
or her.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, sudd. (a).)
DISCUSSION
            The court finds this motion moot because
on January 18, 2024, the Capriotto Plaintiffs and the Croce Plaintiffs requested
dismissal of their complaints against Specially Appearing Defendant.
CONCLUSION
                The court finds this motion moot.
            Specially
Appearing Defendant shall give notice.
