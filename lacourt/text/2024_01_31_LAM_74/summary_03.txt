The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration and stay the action filed by CRMLS Compliance against Peter Machin. The dispute revolves around a database that facilitates real estate sales. CRMLS Compliance has met its burden of producing evidence of a written agreement that covers the claims in Machin's complaint. Since Machin did not file an opposition to the motion, the Judge has granted CRMLS Compliance's motion to compel arbitration and stayed the action pending the completion of the arbitration. The Judge has ordered all of Machin's causes of action to be arbitrated, and CRMLS Compliance is required to give notice.
