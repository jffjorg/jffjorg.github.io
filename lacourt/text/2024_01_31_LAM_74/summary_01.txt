And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Specially Appearing Defendant Moog, Inc.'s motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The motion is based on a lack of personal jurisdiction, but the judge finds the motion moot because the Capriotto Plaintiffs and the Croce Plaintiffs have requested dismissal of their complaints against Moog, Inc. on January 18, 2024. As a result, the judge grants the motion, and Moog, Inc. shall be notified of the dismissal.
