Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions. The first motion is from defendant David Lee Scott, who seeks a protective order to prevent the public disclosure of his personnel records from his former employers, Los Angeles Unified School District and CATCH Prep High School, Inc. The judge grants this motion, finding that Scott establishes a legally protected privacy interest in his records and that the limited relief of prohibiting public disclosure rather than prohibiting discovery is a reasonable and moderate step to mitigate the intrusion into his privacy.

The second motion is from plaintiff Jane C.R. Doe, who seeks to compel defendant CATCH Prep Charter High School, Inc. to serve further responses to requests for production of documents. The judge grants this motion in part, ordering CATCH to serve further verified responses to the requests and to produce any responsive documents concurrently with its further written responses. The judge also orders that the parties execute a stipulated protective order to maintain the confidentiality of the records CATCH produces.

The judge also issues a ruling on a notice of related case filed by plaintiff Jane C.R. Doe, seeking to relate this action to Jane M.R. Doe v. CATCH Prep Charter High School, Inc., et al. The judge finds that the cases are related and reassigns the latter case to Judge Armen Tamzarian in Department 52 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.

## English Summary:

The tentative ruling addresses two motions related to a case alleging sexual assault by David Lee Scott, a former employee of CATCH Prep Charter High School, Inc. 

First, Scott's motion for a protective order to prevent public disclosure of his personnel records was granted. The court recognized his right to privacy and found that limiting disclosure to the parties involved is a reasonable alternative that protects both his privacy and the plaintiff's ability to pursue her claims.

Second, the court granted in part the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from CATCH Prep regarding requests for production of documents. While CATCH initially objected based on Scott's privacy concerns, the court ruled that CATCH must provide the requested documents subject to the protective order granted to Scott.


The ruling also related two separate cases involving allegations against Scott and CATCH Prep, recognizing their shared factual basis and assigning them to the same judge for efficient case management.
