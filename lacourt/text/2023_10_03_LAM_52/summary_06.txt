And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, National Commercial Recovery, Inc. d/b/a Blair Smith and Associates, seeks to amend the judgment to add Armando Martinez Mota as Trustee of the 2021 Armando Martinez Mota Separate Property Family Trust as a judgment debtor. The court finds that the equities overwhelmingly favor the amendment and it is necessary to prevent an injustice. The plaintiff has submitted evidence that the judgment debtor transferred real property to a trust he created in 2021, and the court will not permit the judgment debtor to avoid enforcement of the judgment by creating a revocable trust and transferring real property to it. Therefore, the court will amend the judgment to add Martinez as a judgment debtor. The motion is granted, and the court will sign the plaintiff's proposed order to amend the judgment.
