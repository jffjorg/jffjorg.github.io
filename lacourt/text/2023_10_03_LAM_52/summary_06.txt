## English Summary

The judge is tentatively ruling to grant National Commercial Recovery, Inc.'s (Plaintiff) motion to amend the judgment.  

The Plaintiff won a judgment against Armando Martinez (Defendant) in 2013. In 2022, the Defendant transferred real property to himself as trustee of a trust he created in 2021. The Plaintiff argues this was done to avoid paying the judgment. The judge agrees, stating it would be unjust to allow the Defendant to escape the judgment by transferring assets to a trust. 

Therefore, the judge will amend the judgment to include Armando Martinez as trustee of the trust as an additional judgment debtor.
