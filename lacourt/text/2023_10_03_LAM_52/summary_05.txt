And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the request for default judgment in this case. The plaintiff, Salvador Lopez Jr., has requested the defaults of defendants Advance Pipe Bending and Mitchell McCray, but the complaint has two significant problems that prevent the court from granting a default judgment. First, the complaint does not demand a specific amount of damages, which is required by law. Second, the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action against Mitchell McCray.

The court will grant the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to cure these problems. The amended complaint must be served on the defendants in the same manner as a summons, and the defendants will be entitled to file a new answer. The court will set an order to show cause regarding the entry of default for January 26, 2024.
