## English Summary

The judge has written a tentative ruling regarding a case where the plaintiff, Salvador Lopez Jr., requested a default judgment against the defendants, Advance Pipe Bending and Mitchell McCray. The judge found two problems with the plaintiff's complaint:

1. **Unspecified Damages:** The complaint doesn't state a specific amount of damages sought. This is a problem because a default judgment cannot exceed the amount specified in the complaint.
2. **Insufficient Facts Against McCray:** The complaint lacks sufficient facts to support a claim against individual defendant Mitchell McCray. 

To address these issues, the judge will grant the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint. The amended complaint must specify the amount of damages sought and include sufficient facts to state a cause of action against Mitchell McCray. 

The court will then hold a new hearing to review the amended complaint.
