 Case Number:  23STCV00076    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default Judgment 
            Plaintiff
Salvador Lopez Jr. successfully requested the defaults of defendants Advance
Pipe Bending, a business entity form unknown, and Mitchell McCray.  Plaintiff’s complaint, however, has two
problems that interfere with obtaining a default judgment.
Prayer for Damages
The complaint does not demand
a specific amount of damages.  “A default
judgment greater than the amount specifically demanded in the complaint is void
as beyond the court’s jurisdiction.”  (Airs
Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23
Cal.App.5th 1013, 1018 (Airs
Aromatics).) 
“Where no amount of damages is demanded any amount awarded is by
definition greater than the amount demanded.” 
(Falahati v. Kondo (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 823, 830–831.)
Plaintiff’s complaint
prays for various forms of damages “according to proof.”  (Comp., prayer, p. 26.)  It does not give defendants adequate notice
of the amount of damages they face by not responding to the complaint.  A default judgment awarding monetary damages
would exceed the amount specifically demanded and therefore by void as beyond
the court’s jurisdiction.  To recover damages,
plaintiff must amend the complaint.  
Individual Defendant Mitchell McCray
Plaintiff’s
complaint does not allege sufficient facts for any cause of action against
defendant Mitchell McCray.  “Under the
‘well pleaded’ complaint rule, it is error to enter a default judgment on a
complaint that fails to state a cause of action against the defaulting
defendant.”  (Ferraro v. Camarlinghi
(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 509, 539.)
The
complaint alleges seven causes of action: (1-5) violations of the Fair
Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), (6) wrongful termination in violation of
public policy, and (7) violation of Labor Code section 1102.5.  Each cause of action only applies to
employers—not to individuals acting on behalf of an employer.  (Jones
v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1160
[FEHA claims other than harassment]; Miklosy v. Regents of University of
California (2008) 44 Cal.4th 876, 901 [wrongful termination in violation of
public policy]; Mewawalla v. Middleman (N.D. Cal. 2022) 601 F.Supp.3d
574, 608 [Labor Code § 1102.5].) 
The complaint’s
first six causes of action are alleged against “all non-individual defendants
and Does 1 to 25.”  Only the seventh
cause of action for violation of Labor Code section 1102.5 is alleged against “all
defendants” and thereby includes individual defendant Mitchell McCray.  But that cause of action only lies against an
employer.  
The
complaint does not allege McCray was plaintiff’s employer and does not allege
facts showing McCray otherwise stands in the employer’s shoes as required to be
liable.  The complaint alleges, “[t]he
non-individual Defendants, and each of them, are ‘employers’ as defined by” FEHA
“and that the non-individual Defendants and Does 1 through 25 are single
‘employers.’ ”  (¶ 15.)  It further alleges, “Defendant Mitchell
McCray, is a managing agent of one or all of the corporate Defendants, as
defined in White v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563.”  (¶ 17.) 
This allegation concerns the entities’ liability for punitive damages
under Civil Code section 3294(b), not whether the individual managing agent is
liable for any cause of action.  (White
v. Ultramar (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 566.)  The complaint’s only other allegation about
Mitchell McCray is that “[p]laintiff reported to his supervisor Leo and/or
Defendant Mitchell McCray and requested an accommodation in the form of medical
leave.”  (¶ 21.)  The complaint alleges insufficient facts for
its sole cause of action against defendant Mitchell McCray.
Leave to
Amend
The
court will grant plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to cure the problems
discussed above.  Materially amending the
complaint vacates defendants’ defaults.  After a plaintiff “file[s] an amended
complaint praying for a different amount of damages and/or other appropriate
relief… she must serve her amended complaint on defendants, who will be
entitled to file a new answer; all issues will then be at large, including liability.”  (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42
Cal.3d 822, 830; accord Airs Aromatics, supra, 23 Cal.App.5th at p.
1025.)  The amended complaint must be
served in the manner of a summons.  (Engebretson
& Co. v. Harrison (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 436, 444.) 
Disposition
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1), the
court hereby grants plaintiff leave to file a first amended complaint to demand
a specific amount of damages and to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of
action against defendant Mitchell McCray.
The court hereby sets an order to show cause re:
entry of default for January 26, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
