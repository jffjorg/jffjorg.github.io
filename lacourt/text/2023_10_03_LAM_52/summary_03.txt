And here is the English-language summary:

The tentative ruling grants defendant S. Keven Steinberg dba Steinberg Law's motion to have requests for admissions, set two deemed admitted. The defendant served the requests on May 26, 2023, and the plaintiff failed to timely respond, despite being required to do so by June 30, 2023. As a result, the court deems the truth of the matters specified in the requests admitted. The court also awards the defendant $1,185 in sanctions against the plaintiff, which is half of the claimed expenses of $1,310. The defendant is entitled to these sanctions because the plaintiff's failure to timely respond necessitated the defendant's motion.
