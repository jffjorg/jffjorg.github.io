 Case Number:  BC483753    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  52 Plaintiff National
Commercial Recovery, Inc. d/b/a Blair Smith and Associates’ Motion to Amend
Judgment 
Plaintiff/judgment
creditor National Commercial Recovery,
Inc. d/b/a Blair Smith and Associates moves to amend the judgment to add “Armando
Martinez Mota as Trustee of the 2021 Armando Martinez Mota Separate Property
Family Trust dated February 16, 2021” as a judgment debtor.  
Courts
may amend judgments to add judgment debtors. 
(Curci Investments, LLC v. Baldwin (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 214, 220; CCP § 187.)  “
‘[A]n unnamed party may be included as a judgment debtor if the equities
overwhelmingly favor the amendment and it is necessary to prevent an injustice.’
”  (Favila v. Pasquarella (2021)
65 Cal.App.5th 934, 942.)
Plaintiff
shows that equity overwhelmingly favors amending the judgment.  On November 20, 2013, the court entered a
stipulated judgment for plaintiff against defendants C
M Products, LLC and Armando Martinez a/k/a Armando Mota Martinez a/k/a Armando
Mota a/k/a Armando M. Cuevas.  Plaintiff
successfully applied to renew the judgment on July 26, 2023.
Plaintiff
submits evidence that in 2022, judgment debtor Armando Martinez transferred
real property to himself as trustee of a trust he created in 2021.  (Besnyl Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. B.)  On October 5, 2022, the Los Angeles County
Recorder’s Office recorded a quitclaim deed from grantor “Armando Martinez Mota
(AKA Armando Martinez), a married man as his sole and separate property” to
grantee “Armando Martinez Mota as Trustee of 2021 Armando Martinez Mota
Separate Property Family Trust dated February 16, 2021.”  (Ibid.)  The deed states, “This conveyance transfers an
interest into the grantor’s Living Trust.” 
(Ibid.)  
It
would not be just to permit judgment debtor to avoid enforcement of the judgment
against him by creating a revocable trust and transferring real property to it.
 The court therefore will amend the
judgment to add Martinez, as trustee of the trust, as an additional judgment
debtor.
The
motion is granted.  The court will
sign plaintiff’s proposed order to amend the judgment to add “Armando Martinez
Mota as Trustee of the 2021 Armando Martinez Mota Separate Property Family
Trust dated February 16, 2021” as a judgment debtor.
